			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar hit by restructuring costs LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, yesterday announced a sharp fall in profits mainly because of Pounds 14.1m of exceptional restructuring costs. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 8.1m in the year to November 30. The prior year figure was adjusted down from Pounds 24.3m to comply with FRS 3. At the interim stage, profits rose 4.9 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. Mr Jim Leng, who became chief executive last year, said European profits improved, especially in the UK. Restructuring costs, which covered the closure of its UK non-wovens business and the reorganisation of North American operations, would lead to further margin improvements this year, he said. Turnover was almost unchanged at Pounds 307.4m (Pounds 307.7m), helped by Pounds 10.1m of sales from acquisitions. Operating profits increased 0.4 per cent to Pounds 25.3m, but profits on continuing operations fell slightly, mainly due to falling profits in Canada and heavier losses in the US. The Pounds 11.1m acquisition of Royal Tufton, the floor coverings company, and other purchases increased net borrowings to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 13.2m). Interest costs increased more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.46m. Higher borrowings, and a slight fall in shareholders' funds, lifted gearing from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. Earnings fell to 3.35p (17.04p) per share. The company said that earnings before exceptional items would have totalled 17.4p. A proposed final dividend of 6.4p makes an unchanged total of 9.1p. COMMENT These results - and the exceptional charges - were well flagged and the shares gained 5p to 303p yesterday, mainly on optimism about the UK and US. After attacking the US losses and replacing management, the division should finally recover this year, while Canada is already benefiting from a stronger US dollar exchange rate. And, after weathering recession, UK packaging and specialist materials should do well with recovery. The worry is the Continent, which provided 36 per cent of operating profits, and where only Germany has so far shown signs of downturn. If the rest of the Continent follows, Low &amp; Bonar's long awaited 'annus mirabilis' - when nothing goes wrong - may take 12 months longer. Profit forecasts are for Pounds 26m, putting the shares on 15 times. After outperforming their sector in the first six months of last year, the shares have now come back in line. Without further news on Europe, they are likely to stay there.</p>

Following the talks, Boross told journalists that Hungary  counts on France understanding its security policy anxieties.  He said both countries are interested in furthering economic  integration, and there have been countless signs of political  rapprochement between the two countries over the past three  years.    Juppe told journalists he considers Hungarian-French  relations to be excellent, and added that France wishes to  assist Hungary's efforts to become part of "the European  family," where he believes Hungary has a place.    He said bilateral cooperation is also going well, though  there is still room for development.    Juppe also said that the Bosnian situation was among the  topics discussed, and that France fully understands the  difficulties caused for Hungary by the un embargo. "This is one  more reason for us to find a solution as soon as possible," he  said.    The Hungarian prime minister next held talks with French  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in the Matignon Palace. The  topics discussed were the Bosnian situation and what is commonly  called "the Balladur plan."    In a brief statement to the press about his East-Central  European stability program, the French prime minister said  France will do everything possible to ensure East-Central  European stability.</p>

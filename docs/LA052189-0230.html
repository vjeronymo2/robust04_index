			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STOCK WATCH: BECKMAN SPINOFF, NEW PRODUCT GET A HO-HUM  </P> <P> Beckman Instruments in Fullerton has spent $50 million in research over the  past 3 years for a single new product line called a clinical chemistry  analyzer, President Louis Rosso said last week.  </P> <P> For that kind of money, some investors may be expecting a breakthrough that  will shake the clinical laboratory industry.  </P> <P> But even though analysts expect the new product line to be successful, they  said it is unlikely to have more than a moderate impact on future business of  the Orange County maker of diagnostics equipment and analytical instruments.  </P> <P> And that attitude also typifies the reaction on Wall Street to the pending  spinoff of Beckman Instruments this summer by parent company SmithKline Beckman  Corp., a Philadelphia pharmaceutical giant.  </P> <P> Beckman, analysts note, tends to be a steady but unspectacular performer. In  1988, for example, its earnings grew a respectable 9.3% to $42.5 million, while  revenue increased 11.4% to $770.3 million.  </P> <P> This year, analysts expect revenue to grow about 10%, with earnings growth a  little higher.  </P> <P> That kind of predictable growth will make Beckman a stable but not dynamic  investment after the total spinoff by SmithKline, which is merging with a  British drug company, analysts said.  </P> <P> SmithKline spun off about 15% of Beckman's shares to outside investors last  November. But the company is not yet considered by analysts as a "true  investment play" because SmithKline still owns the lion's share of its stock.  </P> <P> Beckman stock closed Friday at $19.625 per share, down 25 cents for the week on  the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> "To me, it's an interesting company. But to most people, it won't impress them  as exciting," said Linda Miller, an analyst with the New York brokerage firm of  PaineWebber.  </P> <P> One reason Beckman won't grow at a torrid pace is that it already has a large  and established position in markets in the United States and dozens of foreign  countries.  </P> <P> Also, thousands of different products are used by medical instruments buyers,  which means that a new product might be highly advanced, but its sales won't  necessarily shoot through the roof.  </P> <P> Analysts said they consider a new biological research instrument developed by  Beckman to be superior to other products on the market, but it will account for  only about $15 million, or 2%, of Beckman's sales for next year.  </P></p>

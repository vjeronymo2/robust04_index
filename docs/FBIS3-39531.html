			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou before the </F> Government Committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies  building--live]    [Text] From the beginning, with its policy statement and  later with the foreign minister's letter to the UN secretary  general and UN Security Council permanent members, our  government made its position on Skopje clear. Greece remains  ready to develop good neighborly relations and close cooperation  with Skopje, thus contributing substantially to its development  and prosperity. Greece remains a country that is really well  disposed toward Skopje. Greece remains ready to participate in a  dialogue with Skopje under the UN auspices. From the time Skopje  was accepted in the United Nations, through the formation of the  current government -- and despite the previous Greek Government,  according to its policy, participating in a dialogue with Skopje  -- we have noted the continuous aggravation of Skopje's  provocation, its intransigence, and its deceitful offensive  propaganda.    Since the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia and the  creation of the issue of Skopje, Skopje has taken no  conciliatory or prudent step. Indeed, since that time, Skopje  has set in motion a constitutional document in a strongly  offensive context and very provocatively adopted historic Greek  symbols, including the Star of Veryina, which was hitherto  unknown, foreign, and uninteresting for them.    Greece's firm and principle goal is peace, stability, and  security in the greater region. To serve this goal and to make  the relevant UN decisions credible and real, Greece asked for  something that should have been self-explanatory. Greece asked  Skopje for specific and practical steps to indicate its  willingness to abandon the increasingly offensive propaganda  against Greece through points in its constitution and its  symbolism.    These specific signs are not Greek conditions but, in the  final analysis, are Skopje's commitments born out of  international law. Greece has stated that if Skopje had taken  these necessary, practical steps, it could have examined the  possibility of lifting its objections to Skopje's accession to  the CSCE.    As Skopje's intransigence continued, even intensified, many  members of the international community, including member  countries of the European Union and recently the United States,  established diplomatic relations or recognized Skopje, most of  course with the name FYROM [the Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia]. Greece does not want to comment on the evaluations  and motives behind these moves. The result, though, was that  Skopje misinterpreted all these moves, which gave the illusion  that it can be indifferent to the Greek positions and the  problems it causes for the stability of the greater area.    [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's recent impudent  letter  to U.S. President Bill Clinton proves to Greece that Skopje does  not appear to realize the special or unique importance of  normalizing its relations with Greece or the problems it causes  with its behavior in a particularly sensitive area.    Greece, a member of the European Union and presiding over  the  Union during this half of the year, a member of NATO and the  CSCE, and a country with an institutional, social, and economic  structure that places it firmly in Western civilization, is  obliged to act as the primary guarantor of peace, stability, and  security in the region. Greece is obliged to undertake -- it  does -- and assume initiatives in this direction, centering on  the Yugoslav crisis and the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Greece is obliged to foster respect for international law and  play a major role in implementing UN decisions. Consequently,  Greece is obliged, especially in the current international  arena, to restate with absolute clarity the framework of its own  positions and actions. Unfortunately, because the reasons, no  matter how hard and firm they are, are undermined or  misinterpreted, Greece is obliged to state its position with  specific actions.    The Greek Government has decided: 1. To suspend operations  at  its general consulate in Skopje, and 2. To suspend the movement  of goods to and from Skopje through the port of Thessaloniki.  The exception is that which is absolutely necessary for  humanitarian purposes, such as food and medicine.    The Greek Government's decision today constitutes a message  to Skopje and to others, including all those who participate in  formulating the positions of the international community.  Greece is always ready to participate in a dialogue with Skopje  under UN auspices, as long as this dialogue is honest and  substantive and always given our country's position regarding  the name of Skopje. Something like this, though, is subject to  -- and everyone had better understand this -- the specific and  practical signs that Skopje must show. Unfortunately, there has  been no sign that it understands the reality and the prospects.  Thank you. [applause]</p>

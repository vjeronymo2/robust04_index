[Pokrovskiy] We have a system of mass compulsory  testing. Zealous medical personnel send to the laboratories  everyone who does and does not need it, with no account taken of  human rights or of the material cost. There should be a  different approach to this problem.  [Dianova] How many people are infected with the HIV  virus in Russia at the moment?  [Pokrovskiy] Six hundred and ninety-two. As a  comparison, there were 652 recorded in May. Some people (not  least some journalists) are unimpressed by this figure. And  there are voices claiming that the AIDS problem in our country  is imaginary or exaggerated. But the situation in the United  States 20 years ago was exactly the same! If we do not want to  catch up with America in terms of these sad statistics we need  to raise the AIDS issue to the level of state policy. And this  presupposes the creation of a national AIDS committee, the  adoption of a Russian law on AIDS, and the instilling of order  in the structure of organizations called upon to combat the HIV  infection.</p>

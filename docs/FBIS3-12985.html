The participants also expressed support for the  initiative to co-opt into the coalition any Knesset faction that  accepts the government's basic guidelines and the agreement with  the PLO. The prime minister told the meeting that in the wake  of the Hebron massacre there is an atmosphere of pre-retaliation  in the Arab world. The government must be prepared, and expand  the coalition.    Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin attacked the prime minister  saying that he does not call a spade a spade, and plays a game  of saying yes and no at the same time. Beilin quoted from the  Kahn Commission on the Sabra and Shatila massacre on what it had  to say about Refa'el Eytan and asked how international public  opinion and the Arabs could accept Eytan joining the government.  Beilin was constantly interrupted by catcalls.    The Meretz Knesset faction unilaterally reaffirmed its  opposition to Tzomet joining the government. The faction said  that Meretz cannot be a member of a government in which Tzomet  is a member under the present circumstances, and its ministers  will resign the moment negotiations are opened between Labor and  Tzomet. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir notes that during the  meeting, Minister Shulamit Aloni apologized for her reported  remarks in YEDI'OT AHARONOT that Sarid "is a spokesman and a  public relations man" and said she had no intention of  criticizing Yosi Sarid. She also made it clear that there is no  basis for the reports that she opposes the faction's stand on  Tzomet. Meretz decided to express full confidence in Minister  Yosi Sarid and his contribution to the movement's position on  Tzomet.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 7 March adds:  "Tzomet sources told our correspondent that senior party members  who spoke to Prime Minister Rabin over the phone during the past  few hours understood that the Tzomet story is over, and that the  main thing now is bringing SHAS (Torah Observing Sephardim) back  into the government while reaching a compromise with Meretz.  Tripartite Meretz-SHAS-Labor negotiations are currently under  way." ]    Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan informed his Knesset faction  that he is waiting to hear from the prime minister, if he  intends to invite Tzomet to negotiations on joining the  coalition. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports Eytan as  saying that if he is invited, he will go to the meeting. Nobody  in the faction had reservations about that position. Eytan said  he would present the prime minister with positions he has  coordinated with Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party  chairman.</p>

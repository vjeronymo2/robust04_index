Snelling, MN 55111&hyph;9650 (``Authorized Agent''). The Authorized Agent shall have sole authority to receive service of legal process in the nature of garnishment (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``process'') arising under the law of any state, territory, or possession, or the order of a court of competent jurisdiction of any state, territory, or possession (including any order for child support and alimony). No process shall be effectively served until it is received by the office of the Authorized Agent. No other employee shall have the authority to accept service of such process. Service of process in conformity with Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not waived for any suit or action wherein the Postal Service, its officers, or employees are parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;491.2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Manner of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Service of process on the Authorized Agent may be made in person or by certified or registered mail, with return receipt requested, at the address of the Authorized Agent.

No garnishment is effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent regardless of the chosen mode of delivery. Process addressed to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the Authorized Agent, may, at the sole discretion of the employee, be returned to the issuing court marked ``Not Effectively Served.'' A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included. Employees are not authorized to redirect or forward garnishment process to the Authorized Agent. In the event that the address of the Authorized Agent is changed, mail may be forwarded from his or her last published address to the new official address until such time as these regulations are amended to reflect the new address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;491.3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Sufficient legal form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document purporting to garnish employee wages shall be deemed sufficient unless it can be determined from the face of the document that it is legal process in the nature of garnishment; that it is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized official pursuant to an order of such a court or pursuant to state or local law, evidenced by a signature of the issuing person; and that it contains the name of the garnished party, with his or her social security number, orders the employing agency to withhold from pay a specific amount of money, specifically describes the judgment of debt or administrative action complete with statutory citation and contains specific advice as to where to send the funds withheld including the complete ZIP Code (ZIP+4).

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (2): Changing economic tune - A more dynamic strategy is needed to set the country on its feet again WHEN Edouard Balladur this spring moved into his opulent new offices at the Hotel de Matignon, the French prime minister's residence, one word cropped up again and again in his speeches - austerity. Austerity, said Mr Balladur, was the only way that the government could regain control of the French economy and haul it out of recession. He has since changed his tune. Mr Balladur now accepts that he has to adopt a more dynamic strategy if he is to succeed in revitalising the economy - and stemming the rising tide of unemployment - before his centre-right coalition comes up for re-election in spring 1995. The Balladur government has since unveiled a series of reflationary measures  -a public works programme, income tax cuts and employment reform - in a desperate attempt to end the recession. The critical question, with little more than a year to go before the 1995 elections, is whether his efforts will be enough. Mr Balladur has a tough task on his hands. France took far longer to slip into recession than most of its competitors. The economy continued to grow, albeit at a slackening pace, until the final quarter of last year. It has since stayed stubbornly in recession - squeezed by high real interest rates and a strong currency - with a hefty budget deficit and escalating unemployment. Interest rates have fallen steadily since the centre-right took power in late March. The franc has also weakened after the ERM crisis in early August when France, like its fellow European Community member states, was forced to widen its ERM trading bands from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. Yet so far there has been little improvement in France's economic performance. The problems of its trading partners, notably Germany, have undermined corporate confidence. The industrial output index stabilised over the summer, having fallen by an average of 1.9 per cent in the first quarter and 0.3 per cent in the second. But a recent report by Societe Generale described the 'apparent stability' as 'very fragile'. Unemployment levelled this summer with the number of people out of work rising in August by just 4,000 to 3.22m, or 11.7 per cent of the workforce, compared with average monthly job losses of 30,000 during the spring. But the rate of job losses is expected to accelerate in the autumn. OFCE, the economic institute, expects the unemployment total to reach 3.4m, or 12.4 per cent of the workforce, by the end of the year. As a result consumer confidence has remained weak with an inevitable effect on expenditure. Consumer spending has also been depressed by the high rate of real interest rates, whereby inflation is significantly lower than base rates, in spite of the recent round of rate reductions, making it more attractive for the French to save, rather than spend their money. The personal savings ratio, which fell to an average of 10.9 per cent in the boom year of 1987, rose to 12.8 per cent last year and now hovers well above 13 per cent, according to Societe Generale. The Balladur government is trying to reverse the trend. Michel Giraud, employment minister, this summer launched a series of reforms intended to relax France's notoriously strict employment laws. These included making the 39-hour working week more flexible and waiving employers' social security contributions for the first three new workers they hire. Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister, this autumn joined the fray by including in his 1994 budget plan FFr19bn of tax cuts, directed principally at the middle classes, and fiscal reforms aimed at shifting French savings towards housing and consumption. Most economists, and even Mr Balladur's own back benchers, doubt that these will be adequate. But the French government has little room for manoeuvre. One important constraint is the budget deficit, which limits the scope for public sector spending. Mr Sarkozy's official estimates suggest that the deficit will reach FFr317bn this year. Private sector economists expect the final tally to be higher. Meanwhile the government's ability to reduce interest rates is inhibited by the need to protect the franc. The French currency has remained relatively robust since the ERM crisis, buoyed by the Bank of France's cautious rate reductions. This policy seems set to continue given that the French authorities are not only anxious about the risk of endangering the franc, but are also keen for the central bank to rebuild its reserves after the ERM crisis and to repay its debts to Germany's Bundesbank. It will be able to accomplish both tasks more easily if the franc stays strong against the D-Mark. As a result France's economic prospects are pedestrian, at best. Mr Sarkozy hopes to reduce the budget deficit to FFr300bn next year, thanks to FFr55bn of privatisation proceeds and an anticipated increase in French exports which, he expects, to fuel real growth in gross domestic product of 1.4 per cent. Other observers are less optimistic. Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers, suspects that the economic difficulties elsewhere in Europe, notably in Germany, will impede France's export growth and that domestic demand will remain depressed. He predicts significantly slower growth in GDP of 0.5 percentage points for France in 1994 with a deficit of FFr350bn to FFr360bn. The OFCE agrees. It is braced for even lower GDP growth of 0.3 percentage points next year with unemployment rising to 3.7m, or 13.6 per cent of the workforce by the end of 1994. Jean-Paul Fitoussi, head of the OFCE, described Mr Balladur's reflationary measures as steps in the right direction. But he holds out little hope of seeing the French dole queues shortening before the next elections.</p>

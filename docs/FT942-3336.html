			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Observer: Marathon hurdle Winning the right to host the 2000 Olympics Games was obviously the easy bit for Sydney - getting someone to run the damn thing is the tricky part. The Sydney Olympics Games Committee brought in two firms of headhunters to help choose the games' chief executive. But SOGOC is covered in embarrassment. Its (un-named) second-choice candidate has pulled out, just hours before the appointment was due to be announced. The first choice also withdrew, some time ago. The sticking-point is - wouldn't you believe it? - money. This time round, the ADollars 400,000-a-year salary was quickly topped by the candidate's existing employer. Gary Pemberton, the Qantas boss who heads SOGOC, says everything now goes back to square one - meaning, in all likelihood, another eight-month delay. Should be a close finish.</p>

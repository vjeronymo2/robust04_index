			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Electricity advances to Pounds 42m - Pounds 13m customer rebate and largest dividend rise of regional companies announced YORKSHIRE Electricity is to rebate each of its tariff customers Pounds 5 after announcing sharply higher profits and dividends for the six months to September 30. Mr John Tysoe, chairman, said yesterday that the refund would cost the company Pounds 13m. 'But we want to share the results of our good performance between our shareholders and our customers.' Yorkshire closed the electricity season with a 28 per cent increase in profits before tax to Pounds 42.5m (Pounds 33.1m). Earnings jumped 29 per cent to 14.8p. The interim dividend is increased by 15 per cent to 6p, the largest increase announced by a regional company. Mr Tysoe said: 'Viewed against a background of the continuing deep recession throughout the country, this is an excellent result.' Although turnover and units sold fell in the period, there was an improvement both in cost control and in the number of bad debtors. Operating costs fell 7 per cent and staff numbers were reduced by 150. There was a deterioration in both main activities. Operating profit from distribution fell to Pounds 57.4m (Pounds 59.6m), and the supply business loss rose to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 17.9m). Offsetting this was a sharp improvement in non-core businesses such as retailing and contracting, where operating profits amounted to Pounds 1.7m compared to losses of Pounds 7.4m. Provisions in both years distorted these figures. Yorkshire expects the recession to continue to affect its results for the remainder of the financial year, though further cost reductions should contribute to a growth in profitability. Mr Tysoe said that Yorkshire was unlikely to sign any long-term electricity deals with the power generators until the uncertainty created by the coal review was removed. If anything, he would prefer an interim arrangement that would tide the industry over to 1994 when a fresh review of pricing arrangements is due. COMMENT The numbers were not quite as rosy as they looked. The deterioration in both the supply and distribution businesses - though not indicative for seasonal reasons of the full-year outturn - showed how hard the recession is impacting, and the management's assessment of the outlook was not madly encouraging. Some analysts also thought that Yorkshire was not driving down on costs as hard as it had promised. The refund was a bit of a red herring because the regulator would have obliged Yorkshire to return the money anyway next year. But the result was good enough to preserve Yorkshire's reputation as the investor's most favoured rec. The estimated prospective yield of 5.6 per cent is the lowest in the sector, despite the thumping dividend increase.</p>

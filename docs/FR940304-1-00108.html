			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department also notes that standards resulting in price increases on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas water heaters would cause switching to electric water heaters only if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar or greater price increases did not occur for efficiency improvements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to electric water heaters, which is certainly not the case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Supplying Electricity to Gas-Fired Storage Water Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments addressed inclusion of installation and maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses in the engineering analyses. The Southern Gas Association, American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Association, and Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, among others,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that installation (electric supply and venting alterations) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance for gas water heater designs that would require electricity, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as intermittent ignition device, induced draft combustion, power venting, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensing, must be included in the analyses. (Southern Gas Association, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 at 10; American Gas Association, No. 23 at 3; and Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Gas Association, Southern Gas Association, and several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other gas utilities gave estimates of costs for providing electric service to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a water heater. For an existing appliance location, costs ranged from $75 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $200 and for new construction from $15 to $50. (American Gas Association, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23 at 5; Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 3; Lone Star, No. 39 at 6;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energen, No. 12 at 5; Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 2; South Carolina Gas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric Company, No. 34 at 2, 3; Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 5;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ENTEX, No. 58 at 5; Public Service Company of North Carolina, No. 74 at 4;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses for electric service could double the installed price of the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 3). On the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, Flair said that in northern climates, the water heater most likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stands next to the furnace, which has an electrical supply readily and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheaply available to the water heater. Flair estimated that the average price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adding electricity is much less than the cost of the water heater. (Flair,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 85 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department used a cost of $11.20 for the installer to add a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plug-in transformer and install low-voltage wiring to the water heater. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Department assumed this would not require an electrician, and would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water heater to be installed a large distance from an existing outlet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would provide sufficient power to run safety controls, spark ignition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flue damper, and a small venting fan. For design options, such as condensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flue gases, submerged combustion, and direct firing, which would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher voltage, a charge of $100 was used as the installation price of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing electricity. This figure was presented to the Department by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Gas Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paul, D.D., Stickford, G.H., &amp; Locklin, D.W.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Assessment of Technology for Improving the Efficiency of Residential Gas Water Heaters, Second Interim Report, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  June 3, 1991, Battelle, Columbus OH, prepared for Gas Research Institute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The effective date of the final nutrition labeling regulations published on January 6, 1993, will remain July 6, 1994. However, FSIS will not take enforcement action on such meat and poultry product labeling until August 8, 1994. In addition, FSIS is providing notice that temporary label approvals, granted by the Food Labeling Division in conjunction with the July 6, 1994, rule, will now expire on August 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the effective date of the final nutrition labeling regulations remain July 6, 1994, FSIS will not take enforcement action on such meat and poultry product labeling until August 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Charles Edwards, Director, Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 254&hyph;2565. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On January 6, 1993, FSIS published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  a final rule titled ``Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products'' (58 FR 638). Corrections and technical amendments to this final rule were published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43787), and on September 10, 1993 (59 FR 47624), respectively. The technical amendments, which were issued as an interim final rule, were confirmed as final on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12157). The effective date of the final rule is July 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to permit voluntary nutrition labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products, and establishes a mandatory nutrition labeling program for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations are designed to parallel, to the extent possible, the nutrition labeling regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all other foods. Both agencies cooperated closely in the development and timeframe for implementation of their respective rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's final nutrition labeling regulations became effective on May 8, 1994. However, Congress recently amended the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) to extend the compliance date for certain FDA-regulated food products packaged prior to August 8, 1994, to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements. The legislation (S. 2087) was passed by both houses of Congress, and signed into law by the President on May 27, 1994. Although it is not subject to the NLEA, FSIS has decided not to take any enforcement action on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products until August 8, 1994. FSIS believes that this date is reasonable and practical, and reflects its continued cooperation with FDA on nutrition labeling issues. FSIS also believes that the extended timeframe further minimizes the cost of complying with the regulations and allows for a more orderly and uniform compliance implementation for nutrition labeling of all foods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In anticipation of the July 6, 1994, effective date, the Food Labeling Division has granted temporary label approvals under 9 CFR 317.4(d) and 381.132(b) of the regulations. These temporary approvals were granted for labels which comply with current regulations, but which would not comply with the regulations when the final rule issued on January 6, 1993, is effective. These temporary approvals are automatically extended until August 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS encourages manufacturers to revise their labels as soon as possible. On and after August 8, 1994, products with labeling that does not comply with the nutrition labeling regulations will be misbranded and subject to enforcement action by FSIS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William J.

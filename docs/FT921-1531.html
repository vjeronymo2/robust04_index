			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Citicorp writes off Dollars 120m on Randsworth CITICORP, the leading US bank, has written off Dollars 120m (Pounds 69m), nearly one third of its loan exposure, to Randsworth Trust, the UK property company placed in administrative receivership last week. The decision to opt for receivership came after Citicorp failed to agree on a financial reorganisation with JMB Realty, the Chicago property investment firm that acquired Randsworth in 1989 on behalf of its pension fund clients. Citicorp's exposure to Randsworth stems from a 1989 loan of Pounds 197m. But investors holding a separate Dollars 229m of debentures have a more senior claim as Randsworth creditors than Citicorp. Following its write-off, Citicorp has about Dollars 215m of loan exposure to Randsworth. The bank said yesterday it had 'recognised the erosion of value' but stressed it remained sanguine about eventually recovering the outstanding principal. The Citicorp loan write-off represents a little more than 10 per cent of its Dollars 1bn loan exposure in the London property market. Citicorp also has about Dollars 300m of depressed property obtained after foreclosing on London-booked loans in the UK and Australia. Last year Citicorp wrote off a total of Dollars 304m of property loans in the UK and Australia. Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, last year took personal charge of the bank's troubled worldwide property loan portfolio and moved to reclassify loans in the US, UK and Australia. Most of Citicorp's problem property loans are in the crippled US market, where about 41 per cent of the bank's Dollars 12bn commercial property portfolio is classified as non-performing. It remains unclear whether Citicorp will need to write off more of its outstanding Dollars 215m of Randsworth loans. The bank is understood to be discussing recovery prospects with KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants who were last week named as court-appointed receivers of Randsworth.

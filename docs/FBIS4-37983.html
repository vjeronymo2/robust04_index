			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj, foreign  affairs minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, said  recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen has become a matter  of time, and was neither a difficult, nor an impossible matter.    In an interview with the Lebanese AL-ANWAR, Brother  'Abdallah  al-Asnaj expected that recognizing the Democratic Republic of  Yemen could take place in a few days, not weeks.    Brother al-Asnaj accused the rulers of Sanaa of waging a  barbaric war against the southerners with the aim of occupying  the south.</p>

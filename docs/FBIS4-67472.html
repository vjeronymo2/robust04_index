			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 16 (XINHUA) -- An initial survey of a  large-scale Sino-U.S. joint investigation of the impact of  environment and occupations on people's health was recently  concluded in East China's Anhui Province.    It has produced a large body of data for experts to process  and analyze.    The survey was sponsored by the International Research  Center  of Environmental Epidemiology, an institution jointly founded by  Anhui Medical Sciences University and the U.S. Harvard  University.    The four-month initial survey began last August 1 among  almost 60,000 residents near Anqing City.    Each survey form contained more than 2,300 items of  information. It focused on two subjects: natural history of  respiratory system diseases and the relations between pesticide  pollution and disease.    Regular follow-up surveys will be carried out among the same  group of people in the next 15 years and will occupy generations  of experts to research and find solutions to problems.</p>

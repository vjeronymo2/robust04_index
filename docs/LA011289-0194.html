			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MICRO D DROPPED BY COMPETITOR  </P> <P> Micro D's largest competitor, Massachusetts-based Microamerica, said Wednesday  that it is no longer pursuing a possible acquisition of the Santa Ana personal  computer products distributor.  </P> <P> "There are no ongoing discussions," Microamerica spokeswoman Ann Mauriello  said. "We kind of tested the waters, and there was not much interest."  </P> <P> As previously reported, Microamerica approached Micro D in late December about  the possibility of acquiring all the Santa Ana firm's stock for $15 per share.  </P> <P> Micro D's controlling shareholder, Nashville-based Ingram Industries, has  offered to acquire the 41% of the firm that it does not already own for $12.50  per share, or about $37 million. A special committee of Micro D directors has  rejected the Ingram offer as inadequate.  </P> <P> Microamerica's overture to Micro D was disclosed last week in a Securities and  Exchange Commission filing by Ingram. Microamerica, based in Marlborough,  Mass., also had told Ingram that, alternatively, it might be interested in  acquiring the Nashville firm, according to the filing.  </P> <P> Ingram, a privately held company, said it wasn't interested in selling its  interest in Micro D or being acquired by Microamerica.  </P> <P> Microamerica and Micro D are the nation's two largest distributors of personal  computers and related equipment. Ingram is a large conglomerate with interests  in computer products distribution, marine transportation, oil and gas  exploration, and insurance.  </P></p>

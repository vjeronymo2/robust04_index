			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW: A KOOSH PUSH  </P> <P> You can squish it, you can throw it, you can take out your aggressions on it.  What is it? It's a Koosh Ball, and it's not really a ball. It's a soft,  porcupine-ish toy made up of thousands of rubber filaments radiating from a  central core. "We can't keep them in stock," says Hilda Tellez, manager of the  Power of Play in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> The Koosh Ball, which sells for between $5 and $12, depending on size, appeals  to adults and children. "People like its texture," Tellez says. "It's almost  like a sea urchin. It feels prickly on your hand. It's a nice feeling."  </P> <P> Kids have seized upon the collectibility of the toy. "Kids love them," she  says. "Kids collect them because they come in two different sizes and all  different colors, ranging from pastels to primaries."  </P> <P> At Victor's Toys in Reseda, manager Ann Kim agrees. "Children really think that  it's special," she says. "They usually always buy three or four at a time."  </P> <P> But adults like to "koosh" for a very adult reason: Stress relief. "A lot of  adults like to throw Koosh Balls at each other in the office," Tellez says.  "It's fun for them, and they know it's safe -- since it's not a real ball, they  know it's not going to break anything."  </P> <P> Maddening rush-hour traffic gets "kooshed" away, too. "I had one person come in  and say, 'Oh, this will be great when I'm sitting on the freeway. I can  concentrate on this ball rather than the traffic,' " Tellez adds.  </P> <P> The ball has other practical uses, as Kim has found. "It's great for holding up  a book when you read," she says.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by chief editor Mahfuz al-Ansari: "Al-Turabi's </F> Infernal Scheme: Water and the Approach to the Forbidden  Target"]    [Text] It is clear that a secret, central, and binding  decision to "poison" relations with Egypt and block all attempts  to mend them is guiding Sudan's policy.    It is also clear that the decision came out of "the  government's dark room" chaired and administered by "Imam  Ayatollah Ruhollah [name as published] Hasan al-Turabi...!", the  regime's spiritual leader, leader of the National Islamic Front  [NIF], and member of the international organization of the  "political Islam" movement.    The decision made by the "dark room" is binding on the  Government, whose executive seat is filled by Lieutenant General  'Umar al-Bashir and his comrades, officers of the National  Salvation Movement that toppled al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's regime.    A clever cunning characterizes the way the objectives are  chosen and the way in which the decisions are made and  implemented. The "Imam Shaykh Hasan" possesses cleverness and  cunning in ample measure. His tactics depend on choosing the  right moment to focus on certain objectives that are  increasingly vital.    The tactics are also marked by targeting acknowledged  sanctities and the rules and principles that have historically  safeguarded Egyptian-Sudanese ties.    These tacticians do not take into account--nor do they even  care at all--whether these decisions harm the interests of the  Sudanese people themselves.    Al-Turabi is pressing ahead toward "forbidden" goals, always  challenging the "taboo."    The latest decision made inside the "shaykh's dark room,"  with which Lt. Gen. al-Bashir's "administration" complied, was  to seize 30 posts owned by the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry in  Khartoum, in the al-Shajarah area south of Omdurman, and other  installations. This was a first step toward a greater and more  important goal, namely the Nile observation posts on the Blue  Nile, White Nile, Subat, 'Atbarah, al-Rusayris Dam, and Malakal  areas. These Egyptian outposts are in Sudan on the strength of  treaties, agreements, and international laws regulating the use  of jointly owned rivers, observing their progress, securing the  water resources, and distributing the water.    This tactical progress toward the "forbidden" goal, carried  out step by step by the "Imam" and his dark room is a blatant  encroachment on the Nile water and Egypt's share of it. This  objective cannot be concealed by the Sudanese Government's  disingenuous media explanations made after the seizure of the  Egyptian irrigation posts.    While the Sudanese media tried to cover up the recent  seizure  of Egyptian posts with feeble pretexts, Sudanese Irrigation  Minister Ya'qub Abu-Shura announced that "Sudan's share of the  [High Aswan] Dam water according to the 1959 agreement between  Egypt and Lt. Gen. 'Abbud [Sudanese leader 1958-1964] does not  satisfy Sudan's needs and therefore the agreement must be  revised."    The facts contradict these statements, which remain a mere  excuse for disputes and confrontations. The facts, which  neither the Sudanese irrigation minister nor Lt. Gen. al-Bashir,  nor for that matter the spiritual leader "Ayatollah al-Turabi,"  can deny are the following:    --Since 1992, Sudan has refused to hold a meeting of the  Higher Joint Technical Nile Water Committee. According to  existing agreements, this committee must meet every six months,  in Sudan and Egypt alternately. This intentional suspension of  the committee's functions has brought consultation, discussion,  and cooperation to a halt.    --Sudan uses only 4 billion cubic meters of its annual 18-  billion-meter share of the Nile River water. Although no one is  preventing it from doing so, it is not equipped to use the rest  of its share. It simply cannot use it all.    --Sudan informed Egypt some time ago that it planned to  raise  the height of the al-Rusayris Dam and increase its holding  capacity by an additional 4 billion cubic meters. Egypt did not  object, but said "Go ahead with God's blessing."    Sudan came back and said it needed more electric power and  planned to build a reservoir called al-Hamdab Reservoir in the  town of Murrah north of Khartoum. Egypt again did not object  and Sudan hired a Russian company to carry out feasibility  studies at a cost of $30 million.    Returning to the facts, we refer to the "High Dam"  agreement with Sudan of 1959. Before the dam was built, Egypt's  water quota, as agreed upon with the Nile basin states, was 48  billion cubic meters. Sudan's quota was 4 billion cubic meters.    The High Dam studies, before and after the project was  carried out, proved that the amount of water added by the dam is  31 billion cubic meters, of which 10 cubic meters evaporates per  year, between one flood and the next. The remaining added  amount is thus 21 billion cubic meters, which Egypt requested be  shared equally between itself and Sudan. But Sudan objected,  requesting that it get two-thirds to Egypt's one-third--that is,  14 billion cubic meters for Sudan and 7 billion for Egypt.  Egypt's annual share of the Nile waters would thus become 55  billion cubic meters.    The same facts show that Egypt undertook full responsibility  for building the dam. It even compensated Sudan for the lands  that were submerged by the waters of Lake Nasir. This means  that Egypt undertook full financial responsibility for the dam  and compensated Sudan in order to obtain 7 billion cubic meters  of the Nile waters. Sudan, which paid none of the dam's cost,  gets 14 cubic meters.    Egypt was not naive or helpless in doing that. Rather, it  was responding to the eternal fact in which it believes and on  which it acts--that there is no difference between the northern  and southern parts of the valley and that the sons of the north  are brothers of those of the south.    These are some, but not all, of the facts that depict the  relationship and its nature in one of its numerous aspects--that  pertaining to the Nile and water.    What does "Imam Shaykh" Dr. Hasan al-Turabi want, he and the  "executive authority" which puts the decisions he makes in his  "dark room" into effect, without pausing to consider the risks  they involve or their different, fabricated, and even "suspect"  nature?    It seems that "Shaykh Dr. Imam Hasan" is spoiling for a  fight; he is seeking a "fight" with Egypt.    The man leaves no "well" without poisoning its water, even  if  the only one drinking from that well are the Sudanese people  themselves. He did it with the Egyptian schools in Sudan, in  which brother Sudanese were getting their educations. He did it  in the name of Sudanization, as though this Sudanization is a  creed, a religion, or a language.    He did it the day he decided to seize the branch of Cairo  University in Khartoum and sequestered its buildings and all its  contents. That university was originally established to serve  the brothers there. He did it when he turned to the diplomatic  representation and decided to close the Egyptian consulates in  al- Ubayyid and Port Sudan.    Before that, he tried to change the international borders  unilaterally the day he acted in Hala'ib as though it was purely  Sudanese territory. He invited Canadian and Japanese companies  to go there and prospect for oil. He did it the day he expelled  the workers of the Egyptian Manganese Company and closed the  company's doors.    This line of conduct, these incidents, and the approach  al-Turabi and his executive apparatus, as represented by the  lieutenant general's government, appear frivolous. But a second  look reveals bigger and more serious dimensions. The closure of  schools, universities, the Nile observatory stations, the  Egyptian Irrigation Ministry's rest houses, and the consulates,  plus the earlier attempt to create a border dispute that would  develop into a military or semimilitary confrontation, all fall  under the same category and have one goal: To sever all  Egyptian-Sudanese links, provoke hatred and malice in the hearts  of the people in the northern and southern parts of the valley  instead of love, amity, and understanding, and to arouse  Sudanese public opinion and steer it toward a big external  target involving dignity and identity in schools and  universities; the national soil of the homeland in Hala'ib and  Shalatayn; and life and livelihood, as represented in the Nile  waters.    Al-Turabi's mobilization is done in a tactical and  escalatory manner. He chooses one specific target after the  other and picks the time he deems fit to carry out his internal,  regional, and external schemes. After that, the stage will be  set for his grand scheme, which will come through a major and  more serious adventure. He tried to start this adventure the  day Khartoum attempted to act unilaterally in Hala'ib,  concluding an exploration contract and expelling Egyptian  personnel there. My guess is that in his calculations and  estimates, al-Turabi thought then that Egypt would get mad and  declare an all-out war, but he was disappointed. As a result, he  resorted to "tactical measures" with the apparent view of  "provoking" Egypt to act irrationally, such as Sudanizing  schools, terminating the presence of Egyptian universities,  closing down consulates, and seizing the headquarters and houses  of the Irrigation Ministry. Such "tactical measures" are, I  believe, outdated. Today, he is heading for his major  adventure. As is known, playing with fire is a dangerous thing.  Playing with fire approaches the "taboos" that concern the  lives of others. In our context, it means the Nile and its  water. Al-Turabi knows very well that such an "adventurous" and  dangerous approach would be just a game that would lead him  nowhere, for thousands of reasons. Some are legal and  international and others relate to matters of capability,  control and work tools [adawat tahakkum wa 'amal], finance, and  the last one concerns the "defense of life and homeland." I do  not want to talk about the last one, because I believe it is  far-fetched.    Probably "al-Turabi's major game" is to get rid of south  Sudan and leave it to become independent and join the black  African and Christian club south of the Sahara, while keeping  northern Sudan "ethnically and religiously cleansed." It is the  same as the Zionist-Jewish theory and the Serbian theory of a  state racially and religiously purified in full. But there are  tens of thousands of soldiers from the valiant Sudanese Army who  fought for many years in defense of a unified Sudan. There are  also Army officers, his own partners, who waged the "salvation  revolution" and made him the "spiritual leader" with absolute  power and authority. These officers, led by Lieutenant General  al-Bashir, have taken part in the unification war to stop the  secession and its conspiracies. People who have sacrificed their  sons to defend the unity and integrity of the soil cannot go  along with such "racist" notions as those pursued by al-Turabi  in the name of "Islamic Internationalism," nor with ethnic and  religious purity. Nobody can betray the blood of martyrs or  deny the noblest sacrifices. Without that, there is nothing  left for the shaykh but to provoke Egypt and approach the water  taboo; and perhaps Egypt will react to his provocation, fall  into his trap, and decide to put an end to these absurd,  childish, and suspicious acts. Then mobilization at the border  would start, Sudan's troops in the south could be pulled back to  confront "Egypt the aggressor" threatening the Sudanese  homeland! Then, he could hold Egypt responsible. He could  distract Egypt and draw its attention away from its major  development efforts for progress and welfare at home. This  would hinder Egypt's role in the region and the continent in  making peace and building bridges of cooperation and growth, and  would disrupt its international role as a partner in drafting a  new world order based on democracy, equal rights, and equal  cooperation. For, chaos is the only atmosphere in which  al-Turabi and his "groups" could live and expand, even if this  expansion costs the bodies of people and the debris of destroyed  and ruined cities.    The question is: If these are the intentions and schemes of  the spiritual leader, what about the views of the lieutenant  general [al-Bashir] and his team, if they still have any say or  any decisions to make? But that is another story.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says that neither force nor the threat of a funding  cut will make him accept the constitution that denies the Zulu  nation its right to self-determination. Speaking in Ulundi  ahead of his summit meeting today with State President F.W. de  Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, and Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini, Dr. Buthelezi said he's always rejected violence,  but warned of more bloodshed if the election proceeded as  scheduled.    Our political staff reports that the summit meeting is seen  as a final attempt to avert a war between the IFP and the ANC in  kwaZulu- Natal. Dr. Buthelezi said that advocates of a federal  system in South Africa have been elbowed out of negotiations by  the government and the ANC.    The government and the ANC have both indicated that they  intend to be accommodating of the Zulu king's position. Before  the summit meeting begins, Mr. Mandela will hold separate talks  with King Goodwill on the kwaZulu issue. Yesterday Mr. Mandela  and President de Klerk held preparatory discussions. Various  international leaders have expressed the hope that the talks  will produce a settlement. It is not yet known where the summit  meeting will take place.</p>

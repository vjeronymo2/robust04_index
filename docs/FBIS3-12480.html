			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the </F> Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, by Ra'id Salihah in Amman;  date not given]    [Excerpts] [Salihah] How will Hamas react to the brutal  massacre perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque?    [Ghawshah] I would like to say that the massacre was  directed  against the city of Hebron, which is known for its conservatism  and Islamic character. [passage omitted]    This strike is going to further Hamas' determination, will,  and strength. Everyone knows that Hamas' fighters, 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam groups, are well educated in the Islamic doctrine,  which excels the Torah's doctrine. Therefore, the battle is now  between the followers of the Torah and the followers of the  Koran. We believe that victory will be for the followers of the  Koran. [passage omitted]    [Salihah] Is there any specific plan to carry out operations  in the near future?    [Ghawshah] The way Hamas acts is a difficult one, and it is  also difficult to understand its organization. However, there  is room for movement. Hamas will certainly deal blows to the  Zionist enemy, including the settlers. [passage omitted]    [Salihah] Do you plan to assassinate those responsible for  the massacre?    [Ghawshah] You know that the killing of individuals does not  lead to the required results. We want to strike at and damage a  major center of the Zionist enemy. The mujahidin will choose  proper targets, God willing.    [Salihah] Do you not believe that it is time for all  factions  to launch an armed struggle?    [Ghawshah] The blessed march, which was staged in Amman and  in which we took part, proposed that and also called for a final  withdrawal, rather than a halt or a suspension of the  negotiations, and for the resumption of armed struggle. This is  a hard road, but it is the only way to preserve the whole  nation's dignity.    [Salihah] How do you view President 'Arafat's decision to  continue negotiations despite all that has happened?    [Ghawshah] We urged him through the media and stressed that  this is his last chance and that this was our last call. If he  does not return to his people and resume armed struggle, he will  be viewed by his people as part of the Zionists, and he will pay  the price. We also said that if he and his clique continued to  pursue their current path, the curses of God, the people, and  history will befall him.    He accepted Clinton's invitation before the martyrs' blood  was even dry. No nationalist would ever do that. However, it  seems that due to a widespread popular protest, he began to  retreat bit by bit and to set some conditions.    [Salihah] You said this was your last warning to 'Arafat.  Does this mean that you will liquidate him if he does not  respond?    [Ghawshah] No. Hamas does not believe in political  assassination. The last warning comes from the Palestinian  people themselves. The people will distinguish between what is  legitimate and what is illegitimate and between what is wrong  and what is right.

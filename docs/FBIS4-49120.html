			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- A high-ranking agriculture  official on Monday [2 May] denied rumors that the government has  indicated during negotiations with GATT members over Taiwan's  entry into the world trade body that it will back away from rice  farmers in exchange for continued protection of the local car  industry.    Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said  during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that  the report that prompted the rumor was "groundless."    A newspaper reported last week that GATT contracting parties  are permitted to protect a single industry in line with GATT  provisions, and that the government had decided to favor the car  industry at the expense of the rice industry because it employs  600,000 more people than the rice industry.    In fact, GATT rules allow countries to protect their  agricultural markets more than their industrial markets. To  that end, Sun said, the government would continue in GATT  negotiations to push for limited access to Taiwan's agricultural  market.    Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang also refuted the  rumors, saying the government will do everything it can to win  extra adjustment time for the agricultural sector while pushing  for entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.    Taiwan applied for GATT membership in 1990 under the name of  "the customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," and  has been involved in four GATT working-party meetings since  then. The fifth is scheduled for May 16-19 in Geneva.    Taiwan held talks with the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand  and Japan last week on tariff reductions, and will meet with the  United States next week.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Europe debate 'soon' say Tories THE DEBATE paving the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill to the Commons will be 'very soon', ministers indicated yesterday, Alison Smith writes. It will therefore be possible to bring the bill back before MPs in the middle of next month. Discussion of the Maastricht treaty at last week's cabinet meeting came down on balance in favour of pressing ahead with the legislation. The Foreign Office is keen to proceed on the basis that continued delay is debilitating and encourages the Tory rebels. In his statement to the Commons today on the Birmingham European Community summit, Mr John Major, the prime minister, will re-state his determination to take the legislation through parliament. Government business managers will not commit themselves firmly to any particular timetable until they see how the paving debate goes.</p>

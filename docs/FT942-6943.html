			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse tops Pounds 62m and plans to expand Storehouse, the fast-recovering owner of the BHS and Mothercare retail chains, said yesterday it was increasing its spending to expand selling space, as it reported a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 62.4m. The figures for the 53 weeks to April 2 compared with Pounds 15.2m last year, although that was after exceptional losses on disposals of Pounds 31.4m. This year's figure was depressed by an exceptional provision of Pounds 6.4m against non-repayment of loan notes in connection with the sale of a US business. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits increased 48 per cent from Pounds 46.6m to Pounds 68.8m. However, the shares slipped 3p to 212p. Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said the economy was 'steadily improving' and current sales were broadly in line with the trend of the past six months. He added that priorities now were to increase trading space at both BHS and Mothercare. The group had identified 60 target locations for BHS on top of its current 123 stores, and planned three openings this year in Telford, Rochdale and Cambridge. The group was also converting 'fallow' space in existing stores into extra selling space. At Mothercare, the new format designed to appeal to young children would be extended from 20 stores to 75 by the year-end. Capital spending would rise from Pounds 46m to about Pounds 60m. Another task was to improve supply chain management, and reduce surplus stock and costs. The group was looking at integrating more closely distribution at Mothercare and BHS. Mr Edelman said other priorities were to improve brand awareness and loyalty, and to restore stability after the reshaping of the group in recent years. Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds 1.05bn, although the figure for 1993 included Pounds 172m from discontinued businesses. The group operating margin rose from 5 to 6.4 per cent, in spite of a 1 per cent fall in gross margins reflecting increased markdowns and discounts at BHS, and price repositioning at Mothercare. Sales at BHS increased from Pounds 696m to Pounds 749m, and operating profits from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 56.2m. At Mothercare, sales grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 282m, and operating profit doubled from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.2m. Earnings per share increased from 0.1p to 9.7p and a proposed final dividend of 3p gives a total of 5.5p (5p). See Lex</p>

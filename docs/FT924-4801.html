			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Irish policy on punt criticised IRISH farm and industry leaders yesterday criticised the government's policy of defending the punt against devaluation, as wholesale interest rates took a sharp upward turn, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The two leading clearing banks both increased their prime overdraft rates yesterday after the central bank increased overnight rates to 100 per cent in its efforts to deter speculators from attacking the Irish currency. Bank of Ireland, one of the four main clearing banks, doubled overdraft rates for corporate borrowers to 35 per cent. Allied Irish Bank kept its increase to only 6 per cent, but said that any new overdrafts would attract a rate of 60 per cent for corporate borrowers. The Dibor (Dublin interbank offered rate) for one-month funds rose to between 38 and 45 per cent, while one-week funds were being quoted at rates of up to 80 per cent. Mr Alan Gillis, the president of the influential Irish Farmers' Association, said that the government had 'lost control of the economy'. Intense negotiations are under way between the main political parties over the formation of a new coalition after last week's election which left Labour holding the balance of power.</p>

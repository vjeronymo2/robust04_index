			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] In a special session, the general council of the  Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] was installed with its new  membership, as established by recent political and electoral  reforms. The six citizen advisers, who were proposed and  approved by the political parties in Congress, were sworn in and  will be able to vote from now on. In an initial speech,  Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, president of the IFE general  council, analyzed the legal reforms and the agreements that have  been reached. He listed 36 agreements reached since January so  the elections will be honest. He said that in accordance with  the law, the elections will be held on 21 August.    [Begin Carpizo recording] On behalf of the federal  executive,  I want to reiterate that the government's commitment to act  impartially and legally is unalterable. It has not and will not  be subject to anything other than the law. [end recording]    After a recess and in a special session, Samuel del Villar,  representative of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution],  reported that members of his party found electoral material in a  trash heap in Mexico City. He said they will file a report on  this once the Electoral Prosecutor's Office is established.    [Begin del Villar recording] We will provide documents  related to this to the Attorney General's Office. [end recording]    The IFE council approved that a commission formed by three  of  the six citizen advisers will investigate this issue.</p>

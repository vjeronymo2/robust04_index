			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television It looks like an excellent evening for going over your catalogue of modern first editions (have you seen what they're offering for 'Lucky Jim' with a dust cover?) or cleaning the tops of the architraves. While doing that you could listen to Analysis on Radio 4 (8.00) which tonight tries to establish whether the condition of the South American poor will improve now that the continent begins to be more prosperous. If you feel a compulsion to watch television there is Floyd On Oz (8.00 BBC2) in which the intrepid gastronaut takes a train to the Australian interior and on the way feeds four fashion models, a young camel named Camilla, and the train driver. This Week (8.30 ITV) shows how arms manufacturers are endeavouring to cash in on the 'smart' weapons which supposedly won the Gulf War. The programme tells how the Patriot missile system failed to intercept the last Scud fired in the war because one unit was undergoing maintenance and another failed to register a threat, so that 28 Americans were killed.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Mrs Gracey's battle to spike terrorist guns: A campaign to expose intimidation in Ulster It was Patrick Gracey's lucky day when he was shot in the leg by IRA gunmen on wasteland behind a West Belfast bar. The gun jammed, preventing a second shot aimed at the base of his spine. His abductors call the intended punishment a '50-50' - reflecting the target's chances of ever walking again. As they left, they threw him 10 pence to make a telephone call for help. Mr Gracey's crime was to pick a fight on a minibus with the wrong person. The result was a six-month campaign of intimidation against him, his wife and their young child, culminating in his lunchtime punishment shooting off the Falls Road. But, in shooting Mr Gracey on July 13 1990, the IRA unwittingly picked a fight with his mother. On news of her son's shooting, Mrs Nancy Gracey drove through red traffic lights in a blind fury to the house of a man she regarded as a local IRA 'godfather'. Confronting him in his living room, she was angered by his indifference. He offered her a cup of tea. The Roman Catholic mother of nine vowed to fight him and everything he stood for. Mrs Gracey went on to the hospital to see her son, where she met another mother at the bedside of her own boy, a Protestant victim of loyalist extremists. 'We were both crying for our sons. It made no sense.' Overnight, she decided to employ the most powerful weapon at her disposal to launch a personal campaign against intimidation. Enlisting the help of newspapers and broadcasters, she set about highlighting what she saw as the hypocrisy and lies employed by all paramilitaries in trying to impose their perverted code of justice on local communities. Her family, frightened for her life, pleaded with her not to do it. 'I told them the only way to stop me was to put a bullet through my head. My life has not been easy but I was damned if I was going to let scum take and hurt my son and get away with it.' The reaction was rapid and overwhelming. 'The stories of beatings, shootings, protection payments and banishments poured in. There is so much fear, so many people desperately wanting help,' Mrs Gracey says. In August 1990 she formed Families Against Intimidation and Terror (Fait) to help fight cases in which individuals or entire families find themselves under threat. The organisation, which now has a core of 15 volunteers and gets a Pounds 37,000 annual grant from the government, has achieved some important successes on behalf of victims. The case of Mr Micky William is typical. A Londonderry father of 12, he was branded an IRA informer and forced to leave the country because he alerted the police to an incident in a neighbouring house. 'We publicised the truth and the IRA had to back down. The local communities just won't stand for it.' In another incident an IRA list circulated with the names of 200 Roman Catholics ordered to leave their areas was publicised, and subsequently withdrawn. Recently, however, loyalist extremists have been responsible for the majority of reported cases of intimidation. 'Many of the accusations from both sides are total fabrications. They will pin anything on someone singled out for treatment,' Mrs Gracey stresses. Her group believes at least 200 people a year are having to leave Northern Ireland under threat of mutilation or death, with many more expelled from their home towns. Last week in Belfast two men were found with gun wounds after incidents bearing the hallmarks of punishment shootings, while an Armagh mother publicly appealed to the IRA to lift a two-year banishment order on her son following allegations against him of 'anti-social behaviour'. Mrs Gracey says that, for the paramilitaries, 'anti-social' activity usually means criminal behaviour which they have not sanctioned. 'We are talking about a Mafia which is not prepared to give up its wealth and go back on the dole. Visions of 'Mother Ireland' don't come into it.' She is convinced that by publicising paramilitary terror tactics the organisation has, in particular, helped stem overseas support for the IRA. The stubborn, angry founder of Fait, who has herself been on the receiving end of threats ever since the campaign began, says people in Ulster have had enough: 'It's the ordinary people who hold the key. They have the power to get rid of these people if they make clear they will not tolerate them. 'We were told we wouldn't last six months but we are still here and intend to go on showing up these people for the lying, murdering hypocrites that they are.' No-one who knows Mrs Gracey doubts her determination.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TREASURE OF INDIAN ARTIFACTS TRIGGERS OWNERSHIP BATTLE;  </P> <P> ARCHEOLOGY: PALOMAR COLLEGE FILES SUIT SEEKING RETURN OF THE ARTIFACTS FROM  TEACHER WHO SAYS THEY BELONG TO LANDOWNER.  </P> <P> An argument over broken bits of bone, shell, pottery and stone has escalated  into accusations of grand theft and a civil lawsuit between an archeologist and  one of the colleges where she teaches.  </P> <P> The debris, left behind by ancestors of the Luiseno Indians, is priceless to  Leslie Quintero, an archeologist and instructor at Palomar Community College  and San Diego State University. From the debris, she is reconstructing the life  style of an Indian culture that lived in the area at least 600 years ago.  </P> <P> To Palomar College, these thousands of pieces of ancient leftovers are worth  $100,000. That's the price the college put on the material when college  officials filed a complaint with the county Sheriff's Department earlier this  month alleging Quintero took the artifacts from college property and refused to  return them. In legal language, that adds up to a felony: grand theft.  </P> <P> Quintero readily admits that she removed the artifacts from a Palomar College  lab during the Thanksgiving holidays and concedes that the artifacts do not  belong to her. But, she adds, neither do they belong to Palomar College.  </P> <P> The midden -- or refuse heap -- into which Quintero has been probing since 1981  is on land owned by Donald Sullins of Vista, she explained. Sullins owns what  was found on his property, Quintero claims, and Sullins gave her permission to  remove the Indian artifacts and to use them in her research.  </P> <P> "I was very surprised when Dr. (George) Boggs called me and demanded that I  return the artifacts to the college," Quintero said. "I have never heard of any  case in which an educational institution has acted in this way."  </P> <P> Boggs, president of Palomar, said that he, too, was surprised. He said that he  could not understand why Quintero, a teacher at the San Marcos junior college  since 1981, would remove college property. He said that the instructor had been  given permission to use the materials from the dig in her research but had not  been told she could remove them from the campus.  </P> <P> "I have tried to talk to her in recent days and have been unable to," Boggs  said. "We feel that we must protect the public funds used on the dig and must  recover the artifacts. Their value to us is in the teaching field and for  research. We can't place a value on that."  </P> <P> Boggs said that the $100,000 value placed on the collection included about  $56,000 in salary paid to Quintero as a part-time instructor, the cost of  cleaning, marking and cataloguing the artifacts, and the expense of determining  the age of the materials.  </P> <P> After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a court order forcing Quintero to  return the collection, Palomar College attorneys filed a civil suit against the  archeologist and landowner Sullins to recover the materials.  </P> <P> Quintero shakes her head at the legal maneuvering.  </P> <P> "It's a very curious situation," she said. California has very specific  regulations on personal property rights, she said, all placing ownership of  artifacts with the landowner.  </P> <P> Sullins could not be reached for comment but his wife confirmed that he had  given Quintero permission to conduct the dig on his property. Sullins hopes to  build a museum for the artifacts on his property after Quintero finishes her  research, his wife said. As for the archeologist, she is far from finished with  her work at the site.  </P> <P> The painstaking collection of bits and pieces has so far shown her that the  tribe led a well-ordered life, using the dig site as their winter quarters,  making autumn forays to Palomar Mountain to harvest acorns -- a staple food in  their diet -- and spending the summers at the beach.  </P> <P> Their seafood diet included not only mollusks, probably gathered at Carlsbad's  Agua Hedionda Lagoon, but also deep-sea fish like skipjack and tuna, Quintero  said.  </P> <P> Chips of obsidian found in the midden indicate that the early-day Indians also  engaged in trading. She has traced the chips to sources near the Salton Sea and  to the Coso Mountains near the Owens Valley.  </P> <P> Quintero said she never signed agreements with the college concerning the  artifacts because they are not hers to give. She said she had planned to take  the collection to San Diego State, where more sophisticated equipment is  available to continue her research. But, she said, Palomar officials blocked  that move by speaking to SDSU officials.  </P> <P> The dig has gone slowly, she said, because the midden does not yield its clues  in neat layers. Ground squirrels, burrowing into the ancient trash heap, have  scrambled the artifacts, making it more difficult to unravel clues about this  early San Luis Rey-area tribe.  </P> <P> With time-dating, which Quintero says was paid for by funds she solicited, and  with a special technique she has developed to determine the season the animals  were killed from rings in their teeth, she is piecing together the lives of  these early ancestors of the Luiseno Indians.  </P> <P> Quintero said she is determined to finish her research, despite the college's  decision not to renew her teaching contract for the coming semester. She said  she will miss the Palomar students who aided her at the dig while she taught  them fine points of archeological sleuthing.  </P> <P> "At first I arranged meetings with school officials" over the artifacts,  Quintero said, "but the school agreed to meet only if I brought the artifacts  back. I suggested that we meet in a neutral place but they gave me an  ultimatum," to return the Indian materials or face the consequences, she said.  </P> <P> Gene Jackson, dean of Palomar's humanities division, said that the hostilities  that have escalated between the college and Quintero "is a sad thing." He said  that the school has had plans for a museum to house such artifacts on the  drawing board for years.  </P> <P> "There should be a common ground here," Jackson said, "and this should be  worked out somehow. The artifacts belong here, near where they were found."  </P></p>

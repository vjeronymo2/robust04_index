			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Imagine this - an organised manager / Management IMAGINIZATION: THE ART OF CREATIVE MANAGEMENT by Gareth Morgan Saga Pounds 19.95 347 pages THE HALLMARKS FOR SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS by David Rail Mercury Books Pounds 14.95 279 pages EVERY management which has experienced the traumas of rationalisation and ferocious competition has to be interested in new forms of organisation. Gareth Morgan's Imaginization argues that we are leaving the age of 'organised' organisations and moving into an era where the ability to understand, facilitate and encourage processes of self-organisation will become a key competence. But how do you avoid ending up with bureaucratic management in another form, rather than creating an organisation with a strong degree of self-organising while still developing a corporate culture and necessary systems? Morgan quotes the example of an Pounds 8bn company in the natural resources industry renowned for a hard-nosed bottom line approach and cyclical nature. Training and development are handled through a network of consultants hired on a task-by-task basis to keep overheads to a minimum. Costs are charged directly to line managers using their services. For general strategy, there is also a small group of consultants. Successful organisations grow, but ultimately size becomes a barrier to flexibility. Can you grow while staying small? Yes, says Morgan, by replicating yourself in a decentralised fashion, in the style of franchising and other retailing systems. In the fashion industry, building an organisation to exploit a market niche is simpler because almost everything can be sub-contracted. What happens in a mass production unit dependent on expensive machines and equipment? The problems of remodelling organisations remains as intractable as ever. The author admits there is no simplistic 'cure all' technique. His contribution is to show how new ways of organising and dealing with change can be developed, including teamwork. 'Imaginization', he argues 'offers a means whereby people in everyday situations can explore and challenge their taken-for-granted assumptions while opening new ventures for understanding and action.' Decentralisation, franchising, sub-contracting, networking, flexitime - all these clearly work, but the reader still remains in some doubt how many types of bureaucratic organisation allow scope for self-organisatlon systems. Unless you are in the middle of strategic changes, complex operations will still need to be carefully planned and well-organised. The Hallmarks for Successful Business is a resourceful but partly flawed confection. As a guide for smaller and medium-sized companies, based on research and case material, it is unlikely to leave either struggling or fast-growing firms satisfied as an approach. Based on six so-called hallmarks - Focus/Direction, Customising, Partnering, Personality, Quality and Systems - the key message is that finding and keeping customers and building relationships for repeat business is the first and most important step. The advice that it is better to skip less important internal matters and visit key customers should be learned, digested and repeated aloud daily by every executive employed even by large companies. Smaller and medium-sized businesses are unlikely to have much time for internal meetings; satisfying their customers must be top priority, but continually delighting them, as the author suggests, is perhaps asking the impossible. The author's approach is to define his hallmarks as a model for managers planning and implementing change which he believes, probably correctly, is missing from many businesses. Thus personality - the character of the businesses - calls for exceptional vitality, vision and values to be developed and communicated to all target audiences. A learning model based on questionnaires aims to establish awareness, assessment and action in respect of all six hallmarks in order to develop the business. This could have been a powerful work given a more rigorous analysis of the determinants of success of some of Britain's best run companies, as well as lessons from some of the failues, and applying both more challengingly as insights to development and growth.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL AGENT MADE FALSE CLAIMS, PANEL TOLD  </P> <P> A former federal prosecutor and private investigator whose agency was retained  by investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. misrepresented himself  as working for a House subcommittee looking into corporate takeovers, the  subcommittee was told Monday.  </P> <P> The allegation before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and  investigations subcommittee was made by William G. Bertain, a Eureka, Calif.,  lawyer involved in a pending suit over the 1985 Drexel-assisted takeover of  Pacific Lumber Co. by Maxxam Corp. of Houston.  </P> <P> Bertain told the subcommittee that John Gibbons, a former assistant U.S.  attorney in California and now a private investigator for Kroll Associates, had  told him on five occasions last year that he was seeking information about  Maxxam's chairman, Charles Hurwitz, on behalf of a congressional subcommittee.  </P> <P> In one of the conversations, taped by Bertain at the request of the  subcommittee's staff, Gibbons said he was working for the oversight and  investigations panel, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, (D-Mich.), Bertain  testified.  </P> <P> Part of the tape of that conversation in Bertain's office was played at  Monday's hearing, the latest in a series Dingell has held concerning Drexel's  assistance in corporate takeovers by underwriting high-yield "junk bonds."  </P> <P> Drexel agreed in principle in December to plead guilty to six charges of  securities law violations and pay a record $650-million fine, largely in  connection with its relationship to now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission also has alleged that Drexel violated  securities laws in Maxxam's takeover of Pacific Lumber, the largest private  holder of redwood timberland in California.  </P> <P> The Pacific Lumber takeover was structured by Drexel through a $300-million  bank loan arranged by Irving Trust Co. of New York and a $450-million junk bond  offering sold by Drexel.  </P> <P> Gibbons declined Monday to answer specific questions from subcommittee members,  saying he had received the panel's subpoena only a week ago and had not had  adequate time to prepare.  </P> <P> He said he was not aware that his conversation with Bertain in Bertain's office  last Dec. 19 had been taped until this past weekend.  </P> <P> But Gibbons' boss, Jules Kroll, principal owner of the detective agency, told  reporters after the hearing it is "totally inconceivable" that Gibbons had  misrepresented himself and predicted that he would be vindicated at a  continuation of the hearing next week.  </P> <P> "My man was set up by Bertain and others to get our files," said Kroll, whose  agency specializes in corporate takeover investigations and includes among its  clients several major investment banking firms in addition to Drexel.  </P> <P> Included in the subcommittee's subpoena to Gibbons were demands for copies of  any documents regarding Drexel, Boesky, Maxxam, Hurwitz, five other companies  and "matters involving" securities and takeover laws in the Pacific Lumber  takeover. Last October, Bertain filed a $2.25-billion lawsuit against Maxxam  and Drexel on behalf of former stockholders in Pacific Lumber.  </P> <P> The subcommittee did not establish Monday that Gibbons was working for Drexel  when he sought Bertain's assistance. Steven Anreder, a spokesman at Drexel's  headquarters in New York, said he could not establish immediatedly if Gibbons  was working on behalf of his company at the time. But Dingell said he would  refer to the Justice Department evidence of anyone representing themselves as  working on behalf of the subcommittee when they were not.  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / How we elect the king: Tony Benn explains how the constitution should be used to give Britons the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head of state The British constitution, contrary to what is widely believed, is not an unwritten one but is written down in detail in a network of personal oaths of allegiance which are imposed on everyone who exercises any responsibility in the state and binds them, individually, to the crown. All MPs, peers, mayors, judges, officers, police officers and many others are required to take such an oath. Privy councillors, who include all cabinet ministers, have a special and secret oath administered binding them even more tightly to the crown. Bishops are required to pay homage to the crown and accept that the monarch is the only source of 'ecclesiastical, spiritual and temporal power', while at the coronation the only oath that the Queen gives is to defend the protestant religion and uphold the rights of the bishops. The monarchy actually consists of three separate and interlocking parts. The first, and most public, is to be found in the person of the king or queen. The Queen has a high profile and symbolises the nation in the minds of the people, ever present and presiding over parliament and government but nowadays possessing very few personal powers. The real powers of the crown are exercised by the prime minister using the royal prerogatives. These confer an immense amount of patronage, including the power to make and unmake ministers, appoint peers and thousands of public officials. They also include the power to go to war and sign treaties, without the consent of parliament, and it is under the prerogative power of treaty-making that all the laws assented to by British ministers in Brussels gain their legitimacy and override any domestic legislation that might conflict with them. The third and most mysterious aspect of the monarchy lies in the existence of the crown as a legal fiction, for example, when members of the security services are placed under a lifetime obligation of confidentiality to the crown, which is a licence for them to do what they like without regard to the law and then to keep quiet about it, making them a state within a state. This structure dates back hundreds of years and the only real change came recently - and from an unexpected source - British entry into the European Union. Under the Maastricht Treaty provisions, the Queen and Prince Charles have become citizens of this union, reducing them to the same level as the rest of us. Within the European Union, as it moves towards federalism, it is obvious that many more public officials will be required to transfer their personal allegiance to the union, as British commissioners have already had to do. All these aspects of a monarchical system of government are carefully concealed beneath the public face of the king or queen of the day. Any criticism of the system has been fended off by presenting it as an unfair attack upon the person of the monarch. So successful has this technique been that it is almost impossible for any serious discussion to take place on how we might wish to be governed Some time ago I introduced a Commonwealth of Britain bill which would give the country a new and democratic constitution providing, among other things, for the election of a president and disestablishment of the Church of England. This bill received a great deal of attention and is on the reading list for some universities, but the problem has always been the method by which the process of reform could be started. For many years I have been working on a method that would make this possible, intending to disclose it when the throne became vacant, and this is how I realised that it could be done. When a sovereign dies or abdicates the successor has to be proclaimed king or queen and that proclamation, which is then read out in public in various parts of the country, is the legal basis upon which the new monarch rests for his or her authority. This proclamation is agreed at a meeting of the Privy Council, held at St James's Palace, and the key words in it are as follows: 'We, therefore . . . do now, hereby, with one voice and consent of tongue and heart publish and proclaim . . .' This proclamation is then signed by all those present. There could hardly be a clearer or more precise legal statement of the requirement of unanimity - and it is virtually identical with the same principle which applies in the Council of Ministers of the European Union when the president of the commission has to be appointed. A few days ago, the prime minister was vigorously defending his use of that unanimity rule to block the appointment of the Belgian prime minister and this was one of the reasons why I decided to make my proposal public, by writing to the Lord President of the Council. The other reason for doing so was the decision of the Prince of Wales to recommend the disestablishment of the Church of England, which I have long advocated, and which would have the most profound constitutional implications. If the proclamation of the Prince of Wales as king can be delayed by one privy councillor registering an objection, then the matter would have to be referred back to parliament, as it was in 1688 when parliament offered the throne to William III. My purpose in all this is very simple and straightforward and involves no personal criticism of the Prince of Wales. It is to offer this country a chance to adopt a democratic constitution that would give everyone the right to choose, through the ballot box, their head of state and both houses of parliament, as happens in every modern democracy. It is my conviction that the problems that face Britain can only be tackled if we throw off the shackles of feudalism and start to have confidence in ourselves.</p>

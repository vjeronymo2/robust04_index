			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Competitive language Sir, I was delighted to read Mr Tomlinson's letter ('Wasting time on languages', January 27). I have long been concerned at the growth in the supply of non-native Japanese speakers, which tends to depress the market value of people like myself who are rather well paid for our ability to communicate in Japanese. I am sure that the letter will help to deter would-be British students of Japanese. It would be gratifying if you could now spread the word - American undergraduates, in particular, have a distressing tendency to persist in their efforts to learn Japanese.

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Observer: Discounted directors It is hard to remember in these days of enlightened corporate governance that some City firms used to pack their boards with non-executive directors who were also customers. For clearing banks in particular it was a good way of making sure that the competition did not poach a customer's business. But the custom was never more prevalent than among the City's discount houses. Unlike the old accepting houses, the discount houses were never great powers in the land so they relied on friends in high places to funnel business in their direction. It is no longer enough; Union Discount, once the sector leader, passed its dividend yesterday after another horrendous loss and is now worth a mere Pounds 12 1/2 m or so in the stock market. Its board of non-executive directors used to read like a who's who in the City. Could this perhaps be part of the reason for this famous firm's sad decline? Certainly, its dismal record can't be blamed on a shortage of well qualified non-executive directors. It has always had lots of them. John Sclater, the new chairman of Hill Samuel and chairman of Foreign and Colonial, has been on the board since 1981 and Lord Remnant, chairman of National Provident Institution, has been a director since 1968. Less than a decade ago, the chairmen of Barclays Bank and Morgan Grenfell were also on the Union board. Given that The Union's problems stem largely from its shift from core business to ill-advised diversification, on which sage part-time directors with wide experience ought to have been able to advise, the corporate governance experts may have cause to ponder the lessons of Union's unhappy experience.</p>

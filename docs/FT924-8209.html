			<p>921112 FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Review Panel clears Oceana Oceana, the South African-controlled investment company, has been cleared by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, over the way it shows profits from Etam in its annual accounts. But the action did nothing to reduce the feud between Oceana and Etam, the fashion retailer for which it made an unsuccessful hostile bid last year. Oceana was left with a 34.4 per cent stake in Etam, and has used equity accounting in its accounts, which allowed it to show 34.4 per cent of the company's profits as its own. Equity accounting requires a shareholder to have 'significant influence' over the company in which it has a holding. Etam says Oceana has no such power, and complained to the Review Panel. Oceana has no board members or co-operation agreements with Etam, and can only block special resolutions at an annual meeting.</p>

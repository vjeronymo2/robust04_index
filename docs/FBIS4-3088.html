			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 16 (CNS) -- A trial practice with  public bidding for the allocation of quotas for certain export  products will be included in some relevant regulations soon to  be promulgated, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation.    Import and export companies having rights to foreign trade  with the approval of the ministry and which are also members of  commercial associations for import and export, production  oriented enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises will be  allowed to enter the bidding.    Enterprises making successful bids cannot make use of the  quota to transfer the quota with payment to other enterprises  within a stated period of time without prior consent from the  authorities. A particular enterprise which makes such a  transfer has to pay the charges for the transfer which must be  carried out in a specific place designated by the authorities.  Overcounter [as received] transfers will be strictly prohibited  and the transferee enterprise has to meet the conditions  required for the bidding of a particular commodity. No further  transfer of the quota will be allowed.    Enterprises which find it difficult to meet the obligations  required in foreign trade nor able to transfer the quota they  won, have to submit the quota to the bidding office within a  stated period of time. [sentence as received] The quota  received will be included in the next bidding. Part of the  expense of the bidding will be refunded to the enterprise  returning the quota.    Enterprises will not be qualified for the next bidding if  they fail to make use of the quota they won, did not make a  proper transfer or submitted the unused quota to the bidding  office within a specific period of time. They will also lose  their qualification for bidding in the following two years if  they make a transfer of quota which they won by bidding without  prior consent from the bidding office.</p>

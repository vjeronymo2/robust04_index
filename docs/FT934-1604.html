			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Australian shipping line still in red Australia's national shipping line, ANL, has recorded its second consecutive net loss due to sluggish world trading conditions, Reuter reports from Canberra. However, the soon-to-be privatised line said it expected to break even in the year to June 1994. ANL reported a net loss of ADollars 8.3m (USDollars 5.4m) against a loss of ADollars 8.9m the previous year although it posted a pre-tax profit of ADollars 8.7m compared with a loss of ADollars 19m a year earlier. The group's finance manager, Mr Daryl Corney, said a number of strategic postions taken by ANL in earlier years, particularly in the coastal business, began to pay dividends in the latest year. He said the group hoped to at least break even in 1993-94 even though international trading conditions were not expected to pick up until 1995-96 according to World Bank forecasts. The government said in August it would seek to privatise the company this financial year, although little progress on a sale has been made. Analysts expect the company to fetch up to ADollars 150m.</p>

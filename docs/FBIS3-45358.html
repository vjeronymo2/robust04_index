			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Manila, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China today urged  Asia- Pacific countries to exert concerted efforts to ensure a  sustained and steady economic growth in each country and the  region as a whole.    Tong Zhiguang, member of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress of China, said Asia-Pacific countries  should have a long-term strategic perspective and look ahead in  the 21st century.    Tong is here to attend the second general meeting of the  Asia- Pacific parliamentary forum, which opened this morning.    There are tremendous potentials in economic cooperation  among  countries in the Asia-Pacific region as their economies are  highly compatible and complementary with each other, Tong said.    While stressing the importance of regional cooperation, Tong  said that only with a development strategy compatible with its  own conditions, can a country attain economic prosperity.    "After all, there can be no regional prosperity without the  development of the component countries," Tong said.    He also told more than the 100 delegates from 18 countries  that China has achieved phenomenal accomplishments in economic  development during the past 15 years thanks mainly to the  economic reform and opening-up policies.    One of the China's basic policies, Tong said, is open to the  entire world, primarily to the Asia-Pacific region.    "It is our firm policy to expand economic cooperation and  trade with other Asia-Pacific countries," he added.    Tong also appreciated the result of Seattle meeting of Asia-  Pacific Economic Cooperation in last November, saying it would  have a positive bearing on facilitating the regional economic  cooperation.</p>

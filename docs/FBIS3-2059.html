From his deeds, people may feel the soaring  aspiration of a son of the Chinese people who is determined to  serve his nation and the brilliant dedicated spirit of a  Communist Party member.    At the ordinary work post of loading and unloading ships,  Bao  Qifan loved his job and became an expert in this trade. He  successfully added modern additions to this time-honored trade.  While making contributions to the development of modern science  and technology, he also successfully developed himself and  realized the sublimation of his life value. The practice of  making painstaking efforts in difficult conditions to do a  pioneering job fostered his profound love toward his great  motherland and his fellow workers, aroused his soaring  aspirations for reinvigorating China, and strengthened his  consciousness of giving play to the vanguard exemplary role of a  Communist Party member. He not only faithfully performed his  duties at his work post but also strove to make selfless  contributions. He maintained and carried forward Lei Feng's  spirit.    The great era of reform and opening creates an extremely  good  opportunity for the regeneration and reinvigoration of their  nation, and also for Chinese people to display their talent and  ability in serving their motherland. The times call for the  appearance of a new generation of people with a lofty ideal,  moral integrity, good education, and a sense of discipline, who  will cherish, grasp, and properly use this opportunity, who will  master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and who will make new achievements in  conscientiously practicing the party's basic line and building  material and spiritual civilization. Bao Qifan is precisely an  outstanding representative of such a new generation of people.  He represents the spirit of patriotism, collectivism, and  socialism, and he conscientiously resists money fetishism,  hedonism, and extreme egoism. His noble character should be  introduced to and emulated by the whole nation.    To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his lofty ideal  and firm belief in communism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "In  the past, we continued to work and struggle in extremely  difficult conditions a number of decades, and we relied on the  firm belief of uniting the people and encouraging them to fight  for their own interests. Without such belief, we shall have no  rallying force and shall have nothing." Making the people  better off and the country strong and realizing communism is the  objective and historical mission of the CPC, and is also the  mental pillar for the Chinese people to exert themselves to  overcome difficulties and strive for a better live. Bao Qifan  could stand the test of the difficulties in acquiring knowledge  and could resist the enticement of material lust. He firmly  adhered to a correct course in his life, because he never gave  up the lofty ideal and belief, and gained mental strength from  such ideals and beliefs, thus advancing in the forefront of the  reform tide and marching into the palace of modern science and  technology step by step and making great contributions to the  nation and the people.    To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his master spirit  of setting great score by the state and collective interests.  Bao Qifan could make unusual contributions at his work post,  maintain a worker's determination when facing good offers, and  use the grab buckets he invented to recover wealth of several  million yuan for the Shanghai Harbor but not to reap even one  cent for himself, precisely because he has the strong sense of  responsibility. This is a powerful counter to the behavior of  seeking private gain at the expense of public and state  interests appearing in society.    To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his pioneering  spirit of making progress, seeking knowledge, and participating  in reform. To realize socialist modernization in our country, we  must not let the extremely good opportunity slip, and should  study hard and work in a down-to-earth manner. We should make  unceasing efforts to make progress. Young people and  intellectuals with lofty aspirations should model thenmselves on  Bao Qifan, and strive to acquire real knowledge and abilities  and to render meritorious service. They should take this as a  mission given by the times.    To emulate Bao Qifan, we should learn from his selfless  spirit. Making selfless contribution is the character of  Communist Party members, and is also an admirable value in any  society. Advocating and carrying forward such a dedicated  spirit is our party's responsibility and also its advantage.  Bao Qifan faithfully honored the pledge he made when joining  the party and cherished the morality of a party member. He did  not claim credit for himself, always cared about the masses, and  safeguarded the image of a Communist Party member. All  Communist Party members should behave like him and  conscientiously take the dedicated spirit as the orientation of  social values. Thus, in the conditions of a market economy,  there will not only be attractive competition but also the  warmth of making selfless contributions in our society; the  economy will become vigorous and interpersonal relations will  become warm.    Bao Qifan is a model appearing in the period of reform and  opening. We should emulate and give publicity to his deeds and  spirit, and should, like him, make our youth relish the course  of creation and make our lives sublime in the course of  dedication!</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia signals further cut in oil production A FORECAST of Russian oil production with grim implications for both Russia and the former Soviet states was presented to the energy ministers of the states in Moscow yesterday. The oil industry forecasting group, Asotek, told them it expected crude oil production in Russia in 1994 to be 327m tonnes - sharply down on this year's forecast figure of 340-350m tonnes. Refined products should reach 225m tonnes in 1994 compared with 254.6m tonnes in 1992, it said. Asotek said it would not be possible to stop the decline in oil production, which has been falling steadily for five years. However, it could be 'significantly slowed' through the programme of co-operation and investment agreed between nearly all the former Soviet states. According to Tass, the official news agency, Mr Nikolai Pravednikov, head of Asotek, told the gathering that the expected level of production next year would cover Russia's consumption but would not be sufficient to supply other former Soviet states. Russia has cut back on cheap oil supplies to its neighbours but has not moved to full world pricing of oil exports to its closest partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The ray of light was that gas production was forecast to rise by 10bn to 12bn cubic metres, to 650bn-660bn cu m in 1994. The co-operating states - Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan - have agreed to pool investment in energy resources and to create joint ventures for the proving and developing of oil supplies. However, the poverty of most of them has so far limited the co-operation - while the Russian oil managers continue to throw cold water on most projects that would bring in foreign oil companies.</p>

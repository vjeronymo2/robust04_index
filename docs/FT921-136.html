			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bond Corp in ADollars 310m deficit BOND Corporation, the Australian investment group and former flagship of entrepreneur Mr Alan Bond, yesterday unveiled net losses of ADollars 310m (USDollars 238m) for the six months to December 31, saying the result would not hit its debt swap programme aimed at avoiding liquidation, Reuter reports from Perth. The company, operating under a scheme of arrangement with its lenders, said the loss was mainly due to interest expense accruals of ADollars 105.64m, unrealised net foreign exchange losses of ADollars 162.6m - relating to Eurodebt and convertible bonds - and provisions of ADollars 46.09m on investments and receivables.</p>

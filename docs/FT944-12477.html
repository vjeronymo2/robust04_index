			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Electricity offer in Thailand oversubscribed The first flotation of part of Thailand's electricity industry has attracted funds worth nearly Dollars 8bn - driving the offer price of the Electricity Generation Co (Egco) to Bt22 a share. 'It's getting to be quite unbelievable - we knew the share would be popular but this has surprised us,' said a member of the Jardine Fleming team co-managing the offer. The indicated price range had been Bt17 - Bt20 but this was lifted because the local portion of the offer - a total of 147m shares - was oversubscribed at least 50 times and the international tranche of the remaining 57m shares oversubscribed more than 20 times. At Bt22 a share Egco's market capitalisation is nearly Bt9bn.</p>

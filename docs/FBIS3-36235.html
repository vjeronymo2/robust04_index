The many-days-long efforts of politicians and diplomats  from the two countries were rounded off by the signing of the  Russo-Georgian Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations  and Cooperation. They had to display much persistence in their  effort to restore the traditional ties of friendship between the  two countries in spite of the destructive upheavals of past  years and contrary to the speculations of enemies of the treaty.    The leaders and foreign ministries of the two countries have  exerted titanic efforts in this direction over the past few  weeks. Assessing the results of their work, Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev stressed during a recent meeting with leaders of  the North Caucasian republics that it was neither in the  interests of Russia, nor of each nation of the North Caucasian  region to have next to them a state torn asunder by internal  strife, plunged into an economic chaos and crime. In his  opinion, the treaty is a key to stability in the entire southern  region of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This is  perhaps the briefest answer to the question: What will the  treaty give Russia and the Caucasian peoples?    "The treaty is primarily important politically for Russia,"  ITAR-TASS was told by member of the Russian Presidential Council  Emil Pain, "because it is wrong to adhere to two criteria at a  time in politics: If you are an advocate of Russia's integrity,  you must be also an advocate of the integrity of neighbouring  states". Moreover, the current summit talks have shown that the  treaty gives Russia several purely pragmatic advantages: Access  to ports, establishment of military bases, maintenance of a  military-strategic status quo, which is of common importance for  all the CIS nations.    Along with the treaty, which lays a solid legal foundation  for the entire complex of relations between the two states,  Russia and Georgia have also signed more than twenty other  documents. They have also exchanged views on problems linked  with bilateral cooperation, settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia  and South Ossetia, on key international problems and on the  situation in the transcaucasian region as a whole.    "The Russian side," President Yeltsin stressed, "stands for  a  cardinal improvement of relations with Georgia in all spheres,  for the quickest possible restoration of ruptured economic,  cultural, and spiritual contacts, for rapprochement and  integration. Russia proceeds from the need to honour Georgia's  territorial integrity and to guarantee fully the interests of  Abkhazia and South Ossetia."    "The documents signed in Tbilisi and the results of the  summit talks will contribute to the strengthening of cooperation  not only between our two countries, but among all the nations of  the Commonwealth of Independent States, too," Eduard  Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, told a press  conference in Tbilisi. "The importance of President Yeltsin's  visit transcends the limits of Georgian-Russian relations.  Their normalisation is closely linked with the settlement of  all the outstanding problems in the Caucasian and Black Sea  region, with the achievement of peace and stability there."    Asked whether the negotiations touched on Georgia's  inclusion  in the rouble zone, President Yeltsin told the press conference  that it was decided to set up working teams to examine all the  "pros" and "cons" concerning both Georgia and Russia.  Journalists put another "difficult question" to Yeltsin: What  do you think about the State Duma's attitude to the signed  treaty? The president did not rule out discussions, because  "any international treaty is subject to debate". "Nevertheless,"  he said, "I am sure that members of the State Duma will  positively approach this full-scale treaty with the independent  Republic of Georgia".</p>

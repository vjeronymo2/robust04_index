			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Hong (6378 4767) and correspondents Zhang </F> Jianxin (1728 1696 2450) and Cen Daokun (1478 6670 0981)]    [Text] On the afternoon of 27 April, the Lanzhou Military  Region ceremoniously held a meeting at the 1 August Club to  confer the honorable title of "Model Company in Grass-Roots  Construction" on the Fourth Company of a certain regiment.    Zhou Yongshun, deputy political commissar of the Xinjiang  Military District, chaired the meeting.    Fu Bingyue, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region  and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, read the  Lanzhou Military Region's order that conferred the title of  "Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction" on the Fourth  Company of the certain regiment.    The Fourth Company of the certain regiment, established  during the war of resistance against Japan, is a military unit  with a glorious history and fine traditions. During the  competition of military techniques held by the Xinjiang Military  District in 1964, it won gold medals in contests of all the five  major military techniques at evening training sessions,  including a 100-percent mark for outstanding shooting  performance at night. It was known as the "Nocturnal Tiger  Company." Under a new historic period, it has carried forward  our army's glorious traditions; has earnestly implemented  President Jiang Zemin's general requirements that "all army  units must be qualified politically and competent militarily.  They must have a fine style of work, maintain strict discipline  and be assured of adequate logistical support"; has  conscientiously pursued the "Program on Developing Military  Grass-Roots Units"; and has accomplished remarkable results in  building the company in an all-around manner. In the past six  consecutive years since 1988, the company has been commended as  an advanced unit and advanced company that fulfilled its  requirements; and has won a collective's third-class meritorious  award in the past consecutive six years and a collective's  second-class meritorious award in one year. In 1992, the  Xinjiang Military District named the company as a "Pacesetting  Company in Grass-Roots Construction."    Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of the Lanzhou  Military Region and political commissar of the Xinjiang Military  District, attended and spoke at the meeting. He urged all  Xinjiang military units to launch extensive campaigns to  comprehensively learn from the Fourth Company so that more  heroic collectives similar to the Fourth Company will appear in  Xinjiang's military units.    At the meeting, Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the  Xinjiang Military District, read the Xinjiang Military District  party committee's "decision on launching campaigns to learn from  the `Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction'."</p>

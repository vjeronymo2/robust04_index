"The just-formulated measures are intended for a sweeping  change of our public works bidding system and are historic in  light of their effect on our social and economic structures,"  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quoted the premier as  telling a cabinet meeting.    Hosokawa also sought further cooperation of cabinet  ministers  in smoothly implementing the action program to open Japan's  large-scale public works projects to foreign bidders, the top  government spokesman told a news conference.    Takemura said he believes the scheme marks a major shift in  the collusive nature of some practices in Japan, such as illegal  prearranged bidding for public works projects.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGUITO HIRES FOOTBALL COACH  </P> <P> San Dieguito High named Marty Albert its second head football coach in less  than a month Wednesday. He replaced Dave Rudolph, who resigned on Monday.  </P> <P> Albert compiled a 120-95-4 record in a 17-year career that included 10 years at  Strongsville, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and Los Alamos, New Mexico.  </P> <P> Rudolph, an assistant at Carlsbad, said his decision to leave was a financial  one based on the decreased benefits package offered by the San Dieguito School  District on top of a $10,000 cutback in pay.  </P> <P> "You don't coach high school football because you can make a lot of money at  it, you do it because you see some value in it," said Albert, 46. "I like the  opportunity of being in school, taking people and being competitive. It's a  challenge, but it's something I now have an opportunity to do."  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State took advantage of 12 walks to score an 11-1 nonconference  victory over Cal State Los Angeles. SDSU (24-12) was led by Scott Dennison, who  had a home run and four RBIs.  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> University of San Diego defeated Chapman College, 8-0, in a nonconference  match. USD (19-4) is ranked 19th, while Chapman (8-6) is third in Div. II. The  Toreros lost only two sets, and Thomas Simonson lost only one game. Dan  Mattera, now ranked 47th, and J.R. Edwards, ranked 74th, also won.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> U.S. International added former SDSU player Andrew Aguilar, 28, as an assistant  coach. He has assisted at Santa Barbara City College. USIU also announced  Aurora Van Sickle of Rancho Buena Vista High and Monica Green of Gering, Neb.,  as two new recruits.  </P></p>

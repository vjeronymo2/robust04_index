			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NON-TRADITIONAL JOB?  </P> <P> Do you or someone you know make all or part of your living through a  non-traditional job or occupation (maybe it's even a bit shady)? I'd like to  hear from you.  </P> <P> I'm studying how Americans make a living and I'll treat your reply with total  confidentiality. Just send an address to "Jobs," P.O. Box 171, Eureka, CA  95502. I'll send you a short questionnaire so that you can become a part of a  national study of the American entrepreneurial spirit.  </P> <P> PETE PETERSON  </P> <P> EUREKA  </P></p>

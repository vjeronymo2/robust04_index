			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WORD PLAY  </P> <P> "Safe Is Never Sex. It's Dangerous."  </P> <P> That's the come-on line for promotional and ad materials hyping Orion Pictures'  just-out "Hot Spot," starring Don Johnson as a stranger who drifts into a small  town -- and into a steamy love triangle with sultry Virginia Madsen.  </P> <P> Besides being grammatically odd, we wondered: what does it mean?  </P> <P> "The line is a kind of a twist," says Christine La Monte, Orion's senior vice  president of publicity and promotion. "It says that everything is dangerous in  this film. That nothing is safe.  </P> <P> "(Director) Dennis Hopper has a reputation for being on the edge of being  dangerous. So it fits the filmmaker as well as the film, which is hot and  dangerous."  </P> <P>  Hmmmmm.  </P> <P> La Monte added that the film's campaign -- which also features the tag line,  "Film Noir Like You've Never Seen," and three provocative photos -- has stirred  up lots of talk and phone calls.  </P> <P> "It's an attention-getter."

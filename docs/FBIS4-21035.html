			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kiskinskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- The number of detectives  dealing with drug-related crimes has been recently dwindling in  the process of reorganisation of district interior departments,  while the rate of these crimes is rapidly increasing, according  to Vladimir Khayretdinov, head of department for fighting  illegal drug-trafficking.    Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, he reported that  a  total of 141 drug cases were being investigated at the moment,  as compared with 993 drug-related crimes registered in 1992 and  2,183 crimes registered last year.    The interior officer listed Ukraine and Asian regions as the  main transshipment points on the way of drugs to Moscow.  Non-traditional types of narcotics are smuggled from Latin  America, while Germany supplies crack and heroin. One gram of  quality hashish trades for 100,000 roubles on the black market,  the same as one glass of dried poppy, one gram of heroin costs  150 U.S. dollars. High prices force drug-addicts to commit  grave crimes in order to pay for dope.    Khayretdinov stressed the need for setting up a centre to  fight drug-trafficking, with the participation of experts in  different fields. The first step in this direction has already  been taken: an orphanage for children addicted to drugs is now  functioning in Moscow's Cheremushki district. Another orphanage  is to be opened in the south-eastern municipal district.</p>

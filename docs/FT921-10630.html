			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range with dealers reporting a dull session enlivened by a squeeze towards the close, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract started reasonably with a premium of 26 reached soon after the opening. With little in the way of features, the market ran out of steam mid-morning and began to drift. Then, a rally was seen with the firm opening on Wall Street and the contract advanced steadily, leaving the underlying cash market behind. An attempt by locals to close short positions in the last half hour of trading generated a squeeze in March but the retreat on Wall Street as London closed led to selling of the contract at the finish. March closed at 2,583, down 6 on the previous day, and some 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume, at 4,382, was poor. Options traders reported a dull session on LTOM, where turnover reached 23,864 contracts. The FTSE-100 index option was busy, trading 5,830 lots. BP was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,339 contracts with the July 280 puts the busiest series. This was followed by BT with a day's total of 1,842 lots.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Navy said it hoped to find and correct the cause of a Trident 2 missile  explosion in time to fire the next missile in April and complete a series of  submarine tests by year's end. The Navy's goal is to have the long-range  missile operational by December. That goal could be jeopardized if the problem  is not found quickly, but a Navy statement said it would be premature to  suggest the missile would not be ready for deployment then. The first submarine  launch of the Navy's newest and most powerful weapon ended in fiery failure  shortly after one of the 44-foot missiles vaulted out of a tube in the deck of  the submerged Tennessee and shot to the surface. The first stage ignited and  the projectile immediately spun like a burning pinwheel and exploded four  seconds after launch about 100 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.  </P></p>

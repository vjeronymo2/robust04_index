For this  reason, these competing groups have entered into the most  violent battles the country has known in the 20-month-old civil  war.    Each group describes itself as "Islamic," and this is a  characteristic which they adopted in the 1980's to distinguish  the mojahedin from the Communist regime in Kabul supported by  the Soviets. This characteristic had an impact which enabled the  mojahedin groups to make religion an opposition ideology in its  struggle with the Communist regime of Kabul. It also helped them  achieve great support from various Islamic states. In April  1992, after losing Soviet support, the Communist regime fell.  The mojahedin groups retained their "Islamic" symbols, but it  was quickly evident that the groups were not set up or acting on  a religious basis but according to their ethnic backgrounds.    The group led by Borhanoddin Rabbani, the president ad-hoc  of  the country, calls itself Jam'iat-e Eslami [The Islamic  Society], but this group has principly become a political tool  to impose Tajik hegemony over Afghanistan. There are, of course,  people from other ethnic groups who belong to Rabbani's  organization, but the core of the organization remains a group  of Tajik Sunni Muslims who speak Persian.    The strong man in this group is Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, the  talented military commander who played the decisive role in the  fall of the Communist regime headed by Mohammad Najibollah. At  that time, hope spread that Mas'ud would use his irrefutable  organizational talents and leadership abilities to form a new  national alliance and coalition going beyond the ethnic  limitations, but nothing of that sort happened.    Rabbani also enjoys the support of Esma'il Khan, the  governor  of Herat and a former army officer under the Communist regime.  Here also, ethnic loyalty, not religious feeling, played the  greatest role in determining Esma'il Khan's loyalty to Rabbani  and Mas'ud, the two senior Tajik leaders.    It is worth noting that the Tajiks form 30 percent of the  population and that they have not been afforded the chance to  govern Afghanistan with the exception of six months during which  the revolutionary Habibollah Khan, known as "Bacheh-ye Saqa"  [son of Saqa], reigned in 1921.    It appears that the Tajiks are now planning to lose no  opportunity--as they have vowed historically--afforded them to  gain control in the Afghan Government.    The group commanded by "General" 'Abdol Rashid Dos Tam,  bears  the exalted name of "The Islamic National Party," but it is  "Islamic" in name only, because most of its leadership is made  up of former Communists who compete in boasting of, spreading,  and advertising their heresies. The internal regime and goals of  this party are a clear copy of the Communist Party's regime and  programs without mentioning the term "Communist."    In the past year, the city of Mazar-i Sharif, the northern  city that Dostam has taken for his headquarters, has been an  assembly point for former officials, Army officers and cadres of  the Communist Party and its regime. However, Dostam's party is  also not "national." It is the political organization for those  of Uzbek descent, who form 10 percent of Afghanistan's  population.    Proof is mounting of the ethnic nature of Dostam's party  with  the support that has been afforded it by neighboring Uzbekistan.  So the party is more an Uzbek organization than it is an  organization of Islamic convictions and feelings.    The third group in the current conflict is the "Hezb-e  Afghanistan-e Eslami," [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] led by  Golboddin Hekmatyar, who officially presumes to be the prime  minister, but who has not taken on this role and has no right to  do so. However, Hekmatyar's party is increasingly pressing to be  the representative of Pashtun political aspirations. In other  words, this party is also no more than an organization  established on ethnic grounds.    Like Rabbani's party, Hekmatyar's organization includes  elements from other ethnic groups, but the sensitive leadership  positions are vested in Pashtuns, who form 90 percent of the  members of the party. Hekmatyar's party enjoyed the support of  both the United States and Pakistan during the war against  Soviet hegemony. The major motive for the Pakistani support is  that Pakistan itself includes 15 million Pashtuns.    The fourth group in the conflict is an organization that  calls itself by the name "Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami" [the Islamic  Unity Party], but it also uses the term "Islamic" as no more  than an emblem or slogan. The truth is that this party is an  organization for Afghan Shi'ism supported by Iran. [Shi'ites]  form about 18 percent of the Sunni-majority population. It is  not a matter of religious doctrine, since the Shi'ites belong to  the Hezarah people, an ethnic group of Mongol origin.    Shi'ites in Afghanistan receive support from Iran not only  because they are Twelvers, but also because they speak Persian.  There are six other parties which, without exception, use the  term "Islamic," but all of them are formed on the basis of the  ethnic rivalries and use religion as a mere external cover. The  Turkomans, Nuristanis, Isma'ilis, and lesser Pashtun tribes have  their political parties and organizations, but a penetrating  glance at each of them discloses that they are clan  organizations, not political parties, and that they have always  existed in Afghanistan.    Has Afghanistan become another Somalia then? This question  cannot be ignored. The truth is that the religious, ethnic, and  tribal divisions in Afghanistan are deeper than they are in  Somalia.    Some commentators and analysts are amazed that Hekmatyar's  party, which claims to be "Islamic" and is viewed as  "fundamentalist," has allied itself now with the former  Communists against Rabbani. This is merely a small sample of the  Afghan festival. Rabbani allies himself at times also with the  Communists to prevent Hekmatyar from imposing his hegemony over  Kabul.    The Afghan conflict is rapidly deteriorating into a clan war  of the type the country suffered in the 19th Century. Today,  Pakistan, Iran, and Uzbekistan have all deeply intervened in the  Afghan conflict, and each of them support this or that group.  Russia is not far from this stage of conflict. It is known that  Russian forces are deployed primarily along the Tajik-Afghan and  Turkoman-Afghan borders. Moscow has disclosed in no uncertain  form that it will not accept the idea of the existence of a  regime that is hostile to it in Kabul. In spite of the fact that  Yeltsin's government pretends that it is anti-Communist, it is  working with the new Communist regime in Tashkent and the other  in Dushanbe. The main joint goal is the existence of a federal  body in Afghanistan enabling all of the ethnic groups to obtain  a large measure of independence.    Dostam is promoting the federal formula and is actually  practicing it in Mazar-i Sharif, where he is behaving as if his  city were an independent statelet. He is hoping that Hekmatyar  and Rabbani will destroy each other, thus leaving the field open  for the appearance of an Uzbek-Communist-Isma'ili alliance which  would become capable of molding the future of Afghanistan. His  calculations, however, met a setback when Rabbani decided to  launch attacks on Dostam in his stronghold. Dostam's response  was to attack Rabbani's positions in Kabul. The following step,  logically, was to make an alliance with Hekmatyar.    Perhaps one of the historical divisions which caused the  first battle between Rabbani and Hekmatyar to break out is the  fact that the latter wanted to arrest Dostam and put him on  trial for treason. Hekmatyar had boycotted the government of  Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and then that of 'Abdol Sabur Farid  because they refused to issue orders to arrest Dostam.    Hekmatyar and Dostam--who has been characterized as "a  Communist mercenary and leader of a gang of thieves"--are now  two allies pretending to fight for the exaltation of the cause  of Islam.    This alliance will not be the last marvel in Afghanistan.  This sad country will witness more wonders and restiveness.</p>

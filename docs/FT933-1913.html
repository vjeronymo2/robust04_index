			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Russia in Crisis: Yelstin defends action to 'break this disastrous, vicious circle' The following are excerpts from Mr Boris Yeltsin's live television address to the Russian people last night: 'Parliament has been seized by a group of persons who have turned it into the staff of the irreconcilable opposition. Hiding behind deputies, this group is pushing Russia towards the abyss 'My duty as president is to state that the current corps of deputies has lost its right to be in control of crucial levers of state power. The security of Russia and its peoples is more precious than a formal obedience to contradictory norms created by the legislature. 'These will not be fresh elections to the Congress or Supreme Soviet (parliament). 'According to a presidential decree which has already been signed today, Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet cease to perform their. . . legislative functions. There will be no more Congress sessions. Deputies' credentials are invalid. 'I appeal to the leaders and peoples of foreign states, to our friends abroad - there are lots of them around the world. Your support is important for Russia. The measures to which I had to resort were the only way to defend democracy and freedom in Russia. 'Any actions aimed at preventing elections will be considered illegal and persons involved in these actions will be brought to account under criminal law. 'The already weak legal foundation of the already weak Russian state is being deliberately eroded. Laws are being approved for the sake of momentary political goals. Most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet have been going on with violations of the established procedures. That discredits the very foundation of parliamentarianism. 'The only way to overcome the paralysis of state power is to fundamentally renovate it on the basis of the rule of the people and constitutionality. 'The current constitution doesn't allow that - neither does it allow for the passage of a new constitution. Being the guarantor of security of the state, I must offer a way out of the stalemate, and to break this disastrous, vicious circle.'</p>

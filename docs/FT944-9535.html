			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bebear keeps Axa on the global track - The French insurer's chief is sticking to his international vision If there is one thing that is guaranteed to provoke Mr Claude Bebear, head of Axa, the insurance group, it is to suggest his company is essentially French. His focus for many years has been firmly international. Mr Bebear was born in the Dordogne and began his career at Ancienne Mutuelle, a small mutual insurance company in Rouen (it became Axa after a series of mergers in the 1980s). He has since built it into one of the largest groups in the world, with more than Dollars 230bn in assets under management. Fresh from the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in 1958, he was selected as 'dauphin' to succeed the father of a classmate as head of Ancienne Mutuelle. He qualified as an actuary and worked throughout the company. Before he was 30, he moved to Canada for two years to work for his company's affiliate. 'I got to know North America and I understood that France is something small in the world,' he says. 'I saw that there is another way to think than the French way. You realise that the way to do business is completely different elsewhere. I had to adapt to different ways of thinking.' It is a philosophy he has been committed to as he expanded the group overseas. At the top are locally recruited management. 'They know the market and are known in the market.' Below them are international teams who can bring in new ideas and prove more innovative than the local staff working alone. Axa wasted no time expanding internationally. Once in charge, Mr Bebear quickly began a merger and acquisition programme, first domestically and then abroad. 'I was convinced that one day the market would change and become global.' 'You could survive then with a small business. That is less and less true. Companies are becoming bigger, and laws and liabilities more complex. Even small businesses are selling products outside France. The market is becoming more concentrated. You have to be able to follow your customer.' While arguing for diversification to reduce dependency on a single economy, he stresses it is important for Axa to remain strong in France. 'We need to be among the leaders in a market. It is better not to be in too many markets but strong in a few,' he says. That said, Mr Bebear is sure the future for his business lies in Asia. This summer he began operations in Japan and Axa also has a representative office in Beijing. 'I'm convinced that in 20 or 30 years from now the Asian market will be the biggest in the world,' he says. 'The time to go is when the market is starting, so you can grow with the market.' The global vision makes it all the more painful for him to recall a recent visit by a US credit rating agency which raised concerns about Axa's French casualty business when it represents just 18 per cent of the group's business. 'We are seen as a French company,' he says. 'We want to show that we are becoming more and more global.' This helps explain why he is keen to have stock market listings for Axa: first in New York next year, and then probably in London and Tokyo by 1997 at the latest. 'It is important to raise money elsewhere,' he says. 'The French market is too small, and US pension funds prefer to invest in a company quoted there.' His sensitivity to being perceived as running an essentially French company is also reflected in a Dollars 9m-a-year advertising campaign launched last month and aimed at international decision-makers. He acknowledges, however, that some foreign investors are suspicious of the fact that Axa is controlled through a complex structure. Only 49 per cent is publicly held and the remainder is with seven insurance mutuals and several cross-shareholdings, which prevents any risk of takeover. 'I am very happy with the arrangement,' he says. 'We are not in danger, no one can buy us. It means we can invest even if we know the market is against us or unable to understand us. It keeps us out of the reach of raiders.' He does not rule out the possibility of relinquishing the controlling shareholding of the mutuals, but is concerned that this could lead to a takeover. 'I see Mr (Michael) Milken is back in business in the US.' As for Axa's future, there is a paradox. Mr Bebear has become known for developing a group stripped of hierarchy, with authority delegated and formality removed. 'We have to tell managers they are not there to give orders to other people but to help them grow.' On the other hand, the company is clearly dominated by him. In the early 1980s, just before it became Axa, it was in danger of becoming known as 'Groupe Bebear', as one insider puts it. 'His company is not very hierarchical,' says the director of a rival insurer. 'But nothing gets done without Bebear's knowledge or specific approval.' That prompts the question of what happens when he leaves. Now aged 59, he says he plans to start 'reducing his involvement' from next year. He says no decision has finally been taken on his successor but he has written a letter of recommendation in case anything happens to him unexpectedly. The choice could prove just as important as any of Axa's international plans.</p>

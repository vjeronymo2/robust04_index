			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack Brussels on 'ageism' THE EUROPEAN Commission was branded 'ageist' in the Commons yesterday as Conservative MPs renewed their attacks on Brussels' employment-related policy initiatives, David Owen writes. Sir Michael Neubert, the Conservative MP for Romford, enlivened a subdued session of employment questions by urging the government to 'root out' the 'blatant' example of ageism provided by the Commission's conditions for job applicants. Was it not against the spirit of the times for the Commission to limit applicants for its own posts to people of 35 or less, he asked. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said ageism was 'not only an undesirable policy, it is a stupid policy'. The government announced measures to cut waiting time for employment appeal tribunals hearings. It promised proposals allowing the tribunal president to sit alone in certain cases.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: The '82 first-growth clarets / Assessing the vintage ten years on THE 1982 clarets were widely acclaimed even before the grapes reached the fermenting vats. Emile Peynaud, the eminent Bordeaux University professor, said there is more sugar in the grapes than in any year since 1947, and comparisons were readily made with that year and the celebrated 1961. The alcoholic strength was high, the colour exceptionally deep, and the acidity low. Definitely a Merlot year, with a record crop of 3.5m hl of red wine: nearly 1m more than in 1981. Initially, the Bordeaux trade said there was no reason for increased en primeur prices but they were increased sharply. First-growths opened at FFr170 (Pounds 18.88) a bottle, ex-cellars, compared with FFr100 the year before. Merchants capitalised on the prevailing buying euphoria and resold immediately at up to FFr225. This did not restrict demand, and speculation ran wild in the US. Typical British opening prices in bond ran from about Pounds 290 a case for Haut-Brion to Pounds 325 for Lafite, and the others fell between. This led to a duty-paid, delivered cost to the consumer of between Pounds 340 and Pounds 385 a dozen. This was the only fairly recent vintage to date in which buying futures yielded a real profit, provided the wines were not held for long. Accordingly, this was a special occasion for a group of six, including two Masters of Wine, which meets each year to dine and drink (not just taste) the eight first-growth clarets when ten years old. They set a standard for each vintage. Decanted at least an hour in advance, the 1982s were served in the customary order: Haut-Brion, Margaux, Lafite, Mouton-Rothschild, Latour, Ausone, Cheval-Blanc and Petrus. Here, then, are my notes made at the table, followed by representative comments noted at the same time by the other five diners. As all viewed the colours as deep, with Haut-Brion and Ausone a little less full than the others, the notes on this have been omitted. My notes are in italics. Haut-Brion: Austere nose that opened up beautifully in the glass. Strong, fruity, medium length in the mouth. Distinguished wine. Nose developed meaty in the glass, very distinguished, brick, earthy taste, rather high acidity; savoury, lively nose, classic Haut-Brion taste impact, dry finish, slightly bricky, dusty nose, with good length, dry finish; blackcurranty, a bit lightweight; sweet initially, some sourness later, not much body. Margaux: Very closed nose initially, but much better later, edgy, peppery, seems to lack fruit and extract, needs more time. Nose muffled at first, but soon evolved in glass, high marks, lovely crisp berry-like fruit; fleshy, opulent nose, well-mannered taste, unformed but impressive, has a long way to go, easy to under-estimate; deliciously sweet first on palate, beautifully balanced; lovely rich middle taste, good length, too young; aromatic nose, rather thin initially but richer later. Lafite: Fine nose, elegant, distinguished flavour, good balance but when refreshed later had lost some body. Nose low-key at first, but developed creamy, spicy, vanilla, quite powerful, considerable extra tannin, acidity; rather dry, stalky finish, savoury nose, but can't see it developing dramatically; wonderful nose, meaty, substantial flavour, but dry in the mouth; delicious nose, candlewick, but gone down when refreshed; raffine, thin at end. Mouton-Rothschild: Very closed nose, quite strong, aggressive at first, but better later. Flavour a bit dull. Youthful for an '82, thick, biscuity nose. Massive wine, dry, full-bodied, tannic yet soft; exotic nose, very sweet palate impact, delicious tonight, but definitely leaner than Latour; still very young, dense, concentrated; huge almost Petrus-like, sweet, Californian; lacks elegance, rich, full sweet. Latour: Full Pauillac nose, rich fruity wine, with a good deal behind it, but not ready, yet less backward than usual. Touch of banana and vanilla on nose, fragrant after one hour, loads of tannin, great future; not much nose, very sweet palate entry, almost porty, first wine with perceptible tannin, backward; nose you could cut with a knife and fork, dumb, backward; unready, strong banana smell, not very enjoyable now, intense, sweet with sharpness afterwards. Ausone: Chocolate nose, big, round, well-balanced wine, needs time as much behind it. Pleasant, mature nose, very sweet, medium body for an '82, dryish finish, a point; fruitcake nose, lovely tonight but I'd back Cheval-Blanc for the long term; sweet and succulent in mouth, the first wine really ready; cabbagy, herbal nose, more Italian than Bordeaux; slight sharpness on nose and a little neutral on taste. Cheval-Blanc: Fairly fruity on nose, but flavour richer than expected; nose came out of glass when refreshed, a very enjoyable wine. Gentle, sweet, harmonious bouquet, very sweet, lovely flavour and balance, nice now; unformed nose, hint of tea, lovely sweetness at first taste, currants macerated in alcohol, very long; very rich, concentration on nose and palate, if anything slightly too ripe; very approachable wine not near its peak; strong, sweet, beguiling. Petrus: Near-burgundian, rich nose, sweet taste but not a lot behind it. Is there enough acidity to keep it? Rich, meaty, slightly malty nose, packed with fruit, virtually faultless, yet not exciting; hint of rusty nails on nose, treacle on taste, not appetising, a bit flabby; very rich and lovely length, is it too big as always?; rich, ripe and Californian; smooth, sweet, rich, lovely. After all glasses were refreshed, the order of preference was taken: from one to eight, with the lowest total first. 1 Cheval-Blanc (11); 2 Mouton-Rothschild (18); 3 Petrus (22); 4 Ausone (23); 5 Latour and Margaux equal (25); 7 Lafite (43); 8 Haut-Brion (48). The wines were judged on the night and, as can be seen, the first six were close together. All agreed there was not a bad bottle among the eight. As always, it must be emphasised that bottle variation may occur at this age, and only one bottle of each wine was opened.</p>

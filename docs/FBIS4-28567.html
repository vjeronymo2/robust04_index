			<p>BFN     [Text] Former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun urged leaders  in the Asia Pacific region to accelerate the process of regional  economic integration under the framework of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum to achieve broader regionwide  liberalization and to provide political leadership towards free  trade at the global level.    Speaking at a conference on "Pacific Trade and Investment:  Options for the 90's," Anan, who initiated the Asean Free Trade  Area (Afta), said he inclined to disagree with more cautious  views of the future role of Apec. "I would urge our leaders to  be bolder in hastening the process of regional economic  integration," he said.    Anan, the Afta architect, spoke from Canada where he was  receiving the honourary degree from Queen's University. He  said, "Vision is not really the issue here anymore, since market  forces and past successes have already shown the way."    Thailand and Canada are both members of Apec, the grouping  of  17 Asia Pacific nations whose leaders are scheduled to have the  second meeting in Indonesia later this year to determine the  future course of the group.    Anan viewed that the past patterns of vertically-integrated  production relations seem now to be giving way to more equal  business partnerships, characterized by horizontal  interdependence. In other words, economic convergence between  developed countries and the NIEs [newly industrializing  economies] and emerging NIEs will mean that the latter two  groups represent distinct sets of investment and market  opportunities fed by the economies of China and Indochina.    Anan also predicted that while the world's economies will  become more integrated, the financial services sector will  continue to be an area of expanding opportunities in the Apec  region. He said, "I also observe that the rapidly expanding  investment needs, in both the private and public sectors of  developing Apec economies, will generate enormous opportunities  for trade and technology transfer in financing services. By  their nature, financial services will be those that are most  characteristically global."    "I foresee that the financial services sector, which has  already grown significantly in recent years, will continue to be  an area of expanding opportunity in the Apec region. Capital  mobility, especially in the Asia Pacific, is linking regional  financial markets in an unprecedented manner," he said.</p>

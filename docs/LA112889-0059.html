			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLE FOUND IN BASE OF GARVEY RESERVOIR  </P> <P> Divers have discovered a hole one foot in diameter that extends at least six  feet into the 10-foot-thick clay liner at the base of the Garvey Reservoir in  Monterey Park.  </P> <P> For more than two weeks residents near the 41-acre reservoir have complained of  flooding in their yards and basements. As a result of Monday's discovery, the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California announced it will drain the  reservoir by today and begin repairing the crack and any other damage that is  uncovered.  </P> <P> So far, city officials said, at least 13 houses have been damaged by water. The  city has installed water pumps at six houses, but no one has had to leave home  because of the flooding, said City Manager Mark Lewis. Monterey Park officials  said they are still pressing the water district on the issue of liability.  </P></p>

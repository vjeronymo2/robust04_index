			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Virgin claims BA incentives unfair MR RICHARD Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, yesterday accused British Airways of more dirty tricks, including offering unfair incentives to travel agents to push BA at the expense of other carriers, writes Daniel Green. Mr Branson has complained to the European Commission, alleging that BA offers large corporations and travel agents financial incentives which contravene EC competition laws. 'Some travel agency staff are sometimes encouraged to offer products which are neither the best quality nor value for their customer . . . to reach (a) target,' Mr Branson said. Upon achieving that target the agent would be paid a 'kick back'. BA said it would not be appropriate to comment. It was 'not aware of the details of the allegations, nor have we been contacted by the EC'. The complaint to the EC follows a series of actions by Virgin.</p>

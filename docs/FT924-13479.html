			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Big line of Glaxo placed THE PERFORMANCE of pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was held back by a large placing of shares at a hefty discount to the market price. Securities house County NatWest, which carried out the deal, was believed to have taken on 3.7m shares at 758 1/2 p and sold 2.7m of them at 765p, thus taking a turn of 6 1/2 p a share. The stake represented employee share options - the right but not the obligation to buy shares at a pre-set price, that were exercised. Glaxo shares had opened at 790p but tumbled 20p following the placing. There was also talk that news on an Aids drug being developed for Glaxo was not quite as positive as hoped. A conference in California has been discussing the merits of 3TC. It appeared that County might still have had 1m shares on its book following the placing. However, the Glaxo share price recovered with the market to close 9 lower at 782p on final turnover of 10m shares. Arjo downgrade Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell a net 7 to 151p as one of the company's brokers cut its profit forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, joint broker with Cazenove, argues that the company is well run but external economic pressures are taking their toll. UBS has sliced around Pounds 30m from its 1993 estimate, which is now between Pounds 190m and Pounds 200m. The broker feels that the economic situation in Europe shows no signs of improvement and is especially worried about the position of carbonless paper. Carbonless prices have fallen by 30 per cent recently and Arjo controls a third of the European market. The cut follows a reduction in 1992 estimates by County NatWest last week. Ladbroke sold A punchy, no-holds barred sell recommendation from Kleinwort Benson did the day's main damage in Ladbroke. The shares reacted to the note by retreating 6 to 149p, making it one of the day's biggest declines in percentage terms among FT-SE 100 stocks. In a hard hitting salvo, Kleinwort said of the stock that there was too much recovery expected by the market, too many uncertainties, too many adjustments which can be made to the accounts, too little disclosure and, 'too much blind faith required by investors for the shares to justify their current rating'. Some 4.7m shares were traded by the close. Hotels group Forte closed 3 lighter at 150p. There were whispers in the market that the new changes to the board announced yesterday could lead to a cut in the dividend. Shares in brewing group Grand Metropolitan bucked the market trend, closing a penny firmer at 377p, having touched 379p, earlier in the session. County NatWest were reported to be behind the revived fortunes of the stock. Mr Graeme Eadie at the broker believes the shares are a good buy for long term funds, suggesting the recent falls have been overdone. A hefty 6m shares had changed hands by the close of business. Investors took the view that the recently announced coal pit closures particularly in the Midlands were likely to hurt Scottish &amp; Newcastle, a large supplier to the area. The shares fell 18 to 399p, on volume of 3.6m. Abbey National dropped 6 to 309p on criticism that instigation of its mortgage rate cut, announced on Tuesday, was being needlessly delayed. A strong performance in the Hong Kong stock market on Tuesday drew attention to Hongkong Shanghai Bank, which lifted 13 to 437p. Shares in BT held recent strong gains despite general weakness and fears that it could lose business to rival companies offering cheaper telephone services. The shares have risen almost 30 points since a couple of big sellers left the market 10 days ago. They closed only a halfpenny easier at 369 1/2 p. ICI lost 10 to 1053p with Credit Suisse First Boston reiterating a low 1993 forecast of Pounds 680m. However, Nikko Securities argues that the soon to be split chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant will fare better. It sees the company benefiting from sterling weakness a pick-up in new drugs and the latent value to be released by the forthcoming demerger. Generators PowerGen and National Power fell sharply as investors considered the possibility of a regulatory investigation into pricing and scheduling. PowerGen also suffered after County NatWest put the company on its influential '30' list of underperforming stocks. It replaced property group MEPC, which eased 3 to 274p. PowerGen and National Power were the worst performers in the FT-SE 100 Index in percentage terms. They fell 13 apiece to 267p and 256p respectively. Furniture group MFI suffered another clutch of profits downgradings, this time from SG Warburg and Smith New Court. Smith reduced its current-year estimate by Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 65m, saying that in common with other retailers the company had suffered from sales losses over the last three to four weeks. The shares eased 3 to 110p. Turnover in Sears hit 10m with the shares steady at 86p. A positive statement that accompanied better than feared results at greeting card retailer Clinton Cards caused the shares to jump 10 to 71p. The market was also cheered by the held dividend. Insurer Legal &amp; General fell 12 to 352p after announcing that new business from life and and pensions annual premiums fell to Pounds 144m in the first nine months of 1992 from Pounds 175.2m last year. Insurance broker Sedgwick fell sharply in early trade on speculation that it might be the subject of a DTI inquiry. The shares were down 14 at one stage and the slide prompted the firm to issue a statement saying it had heard these rumours but they were untrue. After the statement the shares rallied slightly to close 7 off at 134p. Conglomerate Williams Holdings gave up 9 to 267p after broker Hoare Govett trimmed its current year profits forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 157m citing continued weakness in UK construction. Thames Television jumped 18 to 168p. The company is believed to have been seeing its big shareholders over the past two days and it has a significant stake in ITN, which has received a Pounds 30m commitment from a consortium of four media companies. SG Warburg highlighted the the potential of the new Channel Five and argued a Thames asset value of up to 210p a share. Engineer Siebe was down 17 at the day's worst on fears that a profits decline in a division of a US competitor may indicate a similar picture emerging at Siebe, speculation that was soon discounted by analysts. A line of stock was also said to be on offer. The shares later regained some of the lost ground to close 10 lower at 331p. Glynwed International ran back 12 to 214p, after agency broker Carr Kitcat joined other houses which have reduced profit expectations. Carr shaved its current year figure by Pounds 3m to Pounds 34m, to take account of the poor second-half trading particularly in the copper tubes division. News of the cutbacks in the coal industry led to a fall in several equipment suppliers to the industry. These included Dobson Park, where the shares gave up 9 to 47p, and Charter Consolidated, 8 lighter at 515p.

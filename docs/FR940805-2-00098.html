			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> V. Mutual Program Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC will provide training and other assistance to States, such as assistance in developing regulations and program descriptions to help individual States prepare for entrance into Agreements and to help them during transition periods of assumption of regulatory authority. Following assumption of regulatory authority, NRC will continue to provide training and other assistance such as review of proposed regulatory changes to help States administer their regulatory responsibilities. NRC would also use its best efforts to provide specialized technical assistance to Agreement States to address unique or complex licensing, inspection, and enforcement issues. Similarly, Agreement States will assist the NRC and other Agreement States in addressing areas where Agreement States have particular expertise or are in the best position to provide immediate assistance. In addition, NRC and Agreement States shall use their best efforts to keep each other informed about relevant aspects of their programs. NRC will provide an opportunity for Agreement States to have early and substantive involvement in rulemaking, policy, and guidance development activities. Agreement States will provide a similar opportunity to the NRC to make it aware of, and to provide the opportunity to review and comment on, proposed changes in Agreement State programs, regulations, policies, and regulatory guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following assumption of regulatory authority by an Agreement State, if it experiences difficulty in program administration, NRC would use its best efforts to assist the State in maintaining the effectiveness of its radiation control program. Such assistance could address an immediate difficulty or a chronic difficulty affecting the State's ability to discharge its responsibility to continue to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Performance Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, NRC retains authority for ensuring that Agreement State programs continue to provide adequate protection of the public health and safety. In fulfilling this statutory responsibility, NRC will provide oversight of Agreement State radiation control programs to ensure that they are adequate and compatible prior to entrance into a Section 274(b) agreement and that they continue to be adequate and compatible after an Agreement is effective. NRC, in cooperation with the Agreement States, will establish and implement a performance evaluation program to provide NRC and Agreement State management with systematic, integrated, and reliable evaluations of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective radiation safety control programs and identification of areas needing improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a part of this performance evaluation process, NRC will take any necessary actions to ensure that Agreement State radiation control programs remain adequate and compatible. These actions include: (1) biennial assessments of Agreement State radiation control programs against established review criteria; (2) provision of assistance to help address weaknesses or areas within an Agreement State radiation control program requiring improvement; (3) placing a State on a probationary status for serious program deficiencies that require heightened oversight; (4) temporary suspension of an agreement and reassertion of regulatory authority in an emergency if an Agreement State program experiences any immediate program difficulties preventing the State from continuing to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety; and (5) suspension or termination of an agreement and reassertion of NRC regulatory authority if the Agreement State program experiences difficulties which jeopardize the State's ability to continue to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. The basis for NRC's actions will be based on a well defined and predictable process and a performance evaluation program which will be consistently and fairly applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Levels of Agreement State Program Review Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion outlines the nature of NRC findings regarding the NRC's Agreement State review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding 1_Adequate to Protect Public Health and Safety and Compatible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the NRC finds that a State program has met all of the Agreement State program review criteria or that only minor deficiencies exist, the Commission would find that the State's program is adequate to protect the public health and safety. If the NRC determines that a State program contains all required NRC program elements for compatibility, or only minor discrepancies exist, the program would be found compatible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding 2_Marginally Adequate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the NRC finds that a State program protects public health and safety, but is deficient in meeting some of the review criteria, the NRC may find that the State's program is marginally adequate. The NRC would consider in its determination plans that the State has to address any of the deficiencies noted during the review. In cases where less significant Agreement State deficiencies previously identified have been uncorrected for a significant period of time, NRC may also find that the program is marginally adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Since the compatibility finding is made on the basis of a State having program elements which are ``identical'', ``essentially identical'', or ``essentially verbatim'', there can be no intermediate finding between compatible and not compatible. In terms of the compatibility evaluation, and the need for possible NRC action, the significance of an individual element in a State program will be judged on the basis of its impact on the national radiation protection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding 3_Inadequate to Protect Public Health and Safety and/or not Compatible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the NRC finds that a State program is significantly deficient in some or all of the review criteria, the NRC would find that the State's program is not adequate to protect the public health and safety. If the NRC determines that a State, after a substantial period of time, has either failed to adopt a significant item(s) of compatibility or has failed to adopt several of the required compatibility items, or has refused to revise state regulations which are inconsistent with the required NRC compatibility elements, the program would be found not compatible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. NRC Actions as a Result of These Findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion outlines the options available to the NRC as a result of making any of the above findings. None of these actions are automatic. The appropriate action will be determined on a case-by-case basis by NRC management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

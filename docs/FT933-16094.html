			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agreement on EC aid welcomed DOWNING Street yesterday welcomed an outline European Community agreement on aid worth Pounds 2.3bn for depressed UK areas - but refused to say how Britain would interpret the rules on matching EC funds with aid from local or national government. Past Treasury attempts to curb its spending on regions benefiting from EC assistance have resulted in clashes with Brussels and rows between Whitehall departments and in Westminster. Downing Street said details of the agreement on 'structural funds' reached by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, at a long meeting over the weekend had still to be worked out - not least because of a dispute on the separate issue of 'cohesion' funds for the Irish Republic. Officials said it would be 'extremely cynical' to assume that much of the extra money would be clawed back by the Treasury.</p>

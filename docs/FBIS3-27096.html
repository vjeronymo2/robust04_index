			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Lawrence Chung] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb 18 (AFP)--Armed with a fruit knife and  a fake bomb and accompanied by his foster mother, wife and two  children, a Chinese man hijacked a mainland airliner to Taiwan  Friday -- the 11th such incident in 10 months.    Taiwan authorities sent Lin Wenqiang's family of four back  to  China aboard aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 later  Friday.    The hijacking, the first this year, is expected to prompt  China and Taiwan to reopen talks on the repatriation of  hijackers, which collapsed over sovereignty and jurisdiction  issues, officials here said.    Lin, 26 [age as received], a businessman from the southern  Chinese province of Fujian, told Taiwan police he was persecuted  by the communists in China and thus sought political asylum in  Taiwan.    Dressed as a Chinese police officer, Lin surrendered to  police immediately after the airplane touched down at Taiwan's  international airport, police said.    The plane had been scheduled to fly from Chengdu in Sichuan  province to the southern coastal city of Fuzhou.    The plane carrying 130 people, including the hijacker, his  family and eight crew, began the journey from Changsha, Hunan  province.    "They (the communists) persecuted me ... and repeatedly  turned down my application to open a business," police quoted  Lin as saying in the initial investigation.    Lin and his family -- his foster mother Li Yuying, 68, his  wife Wang Chunlian, 23, his two sons Li Zhanghao, 9, and Li  Zhangyao, 11,-- were taken to the airport police department for  questioning, police said.    "Investigation showed that the family were previously not  aware of what the suspect would do, and so they were sent back  along with other passengers," Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung  told reporters here.    But the wife resisted being put back on the plane and had to  be forced, police said.    The jetliner and the 129 people, including family members  and  crew, returned to China four hours after the plane landed here  at 10:43 a.m. (0243 GMT).    Lin was taken to the prosecutor's office for further  questioning, police said.    "As the hijacking took place in Taiwan, we have the absolute  right to handle the case here and try the suspect before  deciding whether to send him back," Wu said.    Hijacking suspects' trials have been the major source of  disagreement in the repatriation talks by the two sides of the  Taiwan Strait.    The spate of hijackings, involving 15 mainlanders, including  Lin, has become a new source of frictions between Taiwan and  China.    The two have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese civil  war  after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Both  governments claim sovereignty over all of China.    China and Taiwan, represented by their semi-official  agencies, began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993.    The second round of talks was held in China's coastal city  of  Xiamen last November, and the third round was in Taipei in  December.    "They are reluctant to recognize our legal jurisdiction over  the handling of the hijackers here, including trying them in  Taiwan," Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman of the semi-official  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), charged.    SEF handles the negotiations on Taiwan's behalf.    "I believe the latest incident would prompt the mainland to  realize the importance of the issue and to hold further talks  with us," Chiao said.    Taiwan's cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday  expressed regret over the incident and called on China to  quickly reopen talks with Taipei to resolve the issue.    Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail  terms ranging from six years to ten years.</p>

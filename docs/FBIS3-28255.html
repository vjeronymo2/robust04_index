After one pass around the earth at an approximate altitude  of  450 kilometers, the experimental space shuttle code-named Orex  splashed down as planned, 2 hours and 10 minutes after liftoff,  about 460 kilometers south of Christmas Island in the  mid-Pacific.    The successful conclusion of the first H-2 series rocket  mission catapults Japan among the forerunning nations in rocket  technology, opening broad prospects for the launching of  commercial satellites, NASDA officials said.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACKING POLAR BEARS IN MANITOBA CAN GIVE ANYONE CASE OF COLD FEET  </P> <P> It was dawn in the frozen north. Sometime during the night, our train had edged  out of Manitoba's prairie and into the first fringes of birch forest. Our guide  was pointing out the twiggy mounds that are beaver lodges when we saw the old  man.  </P> <P> He was dressed in white long johns and leaning out the open window of a low,  split-log cabin that sat in the middle of nowhere, in the woods. The scene was  unreal, almost like a museum exhibit.  </P> <P> But then, this whole trip didn't seem quite real. We were on Via Rail's "Hudson  Bay," a train that was taking us first into the past, then to the edges of  North America's last true frontier.  </P> <P> We were on our way to the town of Churchill, Manitoba, 500 miles south of the  Arctic Circle, to see polar bears. It was fall and it was cold. But first,  there was the train.  </P> <P> For 1,000 miles -- two nights and a day -- we traveled through an increasingly  harsh landscape, past towns with names like Flin Flon Junction and Moose Nose  Lake and Pukatawagan, finally getting to an area where there are no roads,  where the rail line is the only highway in and out.  </P> <P> Past Thompson and the last set of gravel ruts, we started picking up fur  trappers. Alex Brightnose, 64, was a stocky, weathered Cree Indian with a wide,  flat face and cauliflower ears. He looked the part and, indeed, has been  trapping for 37 years . . . full-time since the Thompson nickel mines said he  was too old for mining.  </P> <P> Alex has 30 miles of trap lines and, in a good year, earns maybe $4,000. He  gets beaver and mink mostly. They fetch $100 apiece. If he's really lucky, Alex  gets a lynx, good for $700 if it's in top-notch shape. All this he does in a  land where mid-winter temperatures can easily drop to 50 below zero.  </P> <P> The train is a link to a past when railroads were vitally important  transportation. Trappers such as Alex use it as we would use a car, hitching  rides for groceries or to visit friends down the line.  </P> <P> As for us, we rumbled on through the night. Right on time the next morning, we  pulled into Churchill, a two-square-mile collection of plain stucco buildings.  </P> <P> Churchill would be one more forgettable Manitoba town except for a couple of  things. First, sitting on the mouth of the Churchill River at the edge of  Hudson Bay, it's a major shipping port.  </P> <P> Hard as it may be to picture looking at a map, Churchill is 1,000 miles closer  to Europe than Montreal and 1,200 miles closer than Halifax. Thus, grain grown  in the middle of Canada is shipped to Europe through here.  </P> <P> But most important from the tourists' standpoint, Churchill is where you come  to see polar bears.  </P> <P> The bears are here because they've always been here. Each winter, they roam the  ice on Hudson Bay in search of seals. Then as the ice melts, they're forced  ashore and spend the summer lazing around. Come fall, they're restless and  hungry. They head for the bay's coastline, anxiously prowling around and  waiting for the bay to freeze up. Once that happens, they're gone.  </P> <P> The tiny town of Churchill, population 800 in winter, just happens to be in the  way of all this. As far back as the first European settlements in the 17th  Century, people were writing home about the bears.  </P> <P> And with good reason: A full-grown male bear, after a winter's gorging, can  easily weigh 1,200 pounds. One huge beast was measured at nearly 1,800 pounds.  </P> <P> Yet, even with all that weight, the average bear can run 35 m.p.h., and drag a  200-pound seal from the water and kill it in seconds. He is also the perfect  cold-weather machine. The hairs of his cream coat are actually hollow to better  trap and transmit warmth to his black skin. He's well-padded with fat, and his  foot-wide feet are carpeted with rough skin for traction on ice and with fur  for walking in snow.  </P> <P> So besides a ring of traps and warning signs throughout the town, there are  other accommodations made for bears in Churchill. On Halloween, for instance,  local firemen and Mounties patrol the streets to keep trick-or-treaters safe.  </P> <P> What with this kind of care, it's been years since anyone was injured by a  bear. The last was a local man who had been rummaging through a burned building  at midnight and stuffed hamburger meat in his pockets.  </P> <P> Most bear sightings, especially those by tourists, are made from the safety of  a special tundra bus. And that's exactly what we were scheduled to do.  </P> <P> We headed out in one of the original Tundra Buggies . . . a tall, boxy  contraption on huge tires that looks like a bus on fat stilts. Each buggy holds  28 people and has a toilet and a viewing platform.  </P> <P> For half an hour, we bounced across the tundra. The land is absolutely flat,  unrelieved except for pebbles and an occasional boulder. It looks, in fact,  like an endless beach, though in this case it's an incredibly fragile one.  </P> <P> Out here, where the wind-chill factor in winter can cause temperatures to reach  the equivalent of 100 below, everything moves and grows slowly. Tiny  evergreens, hardly four feet tall, are 500 years old. Willows stand barely two  feet high. Berry bushes (with full-size berries) reach maybe six inches.  </P> <P> This is why the buggies sit on such fat tires. The six-foot-high,  four-foot-wide tractor tires have only five pounds of pressure per square inch,  meaning they can roll over the tundra with less force than a person walking.  </P> <P> For an hour or so, we saw bears in the distance -- bears playing on the  horizon, bears by other buggies, but nothing near enough for us to take  pictures. Then someone shouted, "Bear ahead!"  </P> <P> The closer we got, the rangier he looked. We could see the skin hanging from  his body. He plodded up to our companion buggy and sniffed the side, burying  his head in a wheel well.  </P> <P> Then the bear turned and came our way, shaking his head back and forth as if  trying to figure us out. Finally he walked off, the sunlight still playing off  his sides and the shadows accentuating the folds of his skin. We, too, went on  heading farther east.  </P> <P> Our goal that day was a 70-foot-high mound called Knight's Hill, really a  drumlin, a pile of rock and sediment thrust up by glaciers as they ground their  way through this area eons ago.  </P> <P> Our brief stop at Knight's Hill was magnificent. We stood among the sprigs of  willow and heather while the low northern sun made the rust-colored lichen  glow. This was our only chance to actually get on the ground because from high  on the hill, it was easy to see anything coming. Even so, the buggy drivers and  guides walked the perimeter with rifles.  </P> <P> On our way back, we briefly visited the tundra camp. From a distance, it looked  like a Rube Goldberg affair -- a generator wagon in back, a boxy dormitory and  viewing platform in the middle, a school bus made into a diner in front. The  camp sleeps 16 and has become a gathering spot of sorts for bears.  </P> <P> Sure enough, we were not disappointed that afternoon. Six bears lounged on the  ground, some with heads resting on paws, two nuzzling each other and a couple  more just sitting there. As we pulled up, one of the bears stood on his hind  legs and stared while a half-dozen photographers on the viewing platform  jostled for position.  </P> <P> Then our own buggy exploded into action as windows popped open and 15 cameras  clicked away. We had been hoping for one, maybe two bears this day. Our hopes  were far exceeded.  </P></p>

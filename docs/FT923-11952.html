			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kalon reports heavy interest in Mander Centre Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director of Kalon, yesterday said that he had been 'inundated with inquiries' from companies interested in acquiring the Mander Centre. This is the office and retail development in Wolverhampton Kalon would own if it was to win its hostile Pounds 91.5m battle for rival paint maker Manders (Holdings). Kalon has frequently said it would not keep the Mander Centre, though it has consistently stressed it would be under no pressure to sell it. 'The gearing of the deal means that it's not essential for us to sell it quickly, or even at all, if conditions don't permit,' Mr Hennessy said.</p>

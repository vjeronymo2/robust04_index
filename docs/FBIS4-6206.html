			<p>BFN     [Text] In his capacity as chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement and president of the Republic of Indonesia, President  Suharto has promised to work for the lifting of UN economic  sanctions against Iraq. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this  to reporters after he accompanied his Iraqi counterpart Sa'id  al-Sahhaf who paid a courtesy call on the president at Jakarta's  Bina Graha presidential office this morning.    The Iraqi minister, who held hour-long talks with the  president, conveyed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's oral message  on efforts to lift economic sanctions as stipulated in Clause C  of the UN Resolution No. 687, which Iraq believes it has fully  conformed to. Iraq hopes the four-year-old sanctions will be  lifted soon because it has caused severe hardship to its people.  The Iraqi minister said his country's infant mortality rate has  increased (?sevenfold) against that before the war, while the  mortality rate for children over five years old is four times  higher. As a result of severe economic sanctions, about 150,000  children have died due to malnutrition and even hunger.    During talks between President Suharto and the Iraqi foreign  minister, various steps have been agreed on in approaching the  United Nations through the Nonaligned Movement's Coordinating  Bureau at the UN headquarters and urging the UN Security Council  to review the sanctions and conduct an objective study aimed at  lifting the four-year-old sanctions. In this connection, Iraq  also called for solidarity and support of all Nonaligned  Movement members.</p>

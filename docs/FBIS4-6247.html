			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting  chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society,  in a letter sent today to Kang Yong-hun, president of the South  Korean Red Cross, urged the South side once again to show a  positive response at an early date to the reasonable demand of  the North for an immediate repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan, prisoners of war.    The letter says:    The South side in a telephone message December 3 last year  turned down the reasonable demand of the North for the  repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, contending that they  did not belong to the category of prisoners of war because of  their guerrilla activities and acceptance of nationality. Its  wrong attitude and assertion are quite contrary to the  humanitarianism of Red Cross.    According to international law, those who are arrested by  the  warring party while in action are to be considered prisoners of  war, be they soldiers or guerrillas. Therefore, Kim In-so and  Ham Se-hwan must be treated as prisoners of war and should have  been repatriated under the Korean Armistice Agreement.    The South side's refusal of their repatriation on the ground  of their nationality acceptance shows that it acts contrary to  the humanitarianism of Red Cross, manipulated by some seditious  forces that dislike national reconciliation and unity.    As you know, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not want to live  in  South Korea and have already asked the International Committee  of the Red Cross to help them in their repatriation to the North.    The two daughters of Kim In-so, the sister of Ham Se-hwan in  her eighties and other family members and relatives in the  northern half of the country are earnestly wishing their  repatriation to the North.    We hold that the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  who are undeniably prisoners of war, must be realised at an  early date as required by the Korean Armistice Agreement and the  international law on prisoners of war, unhindered by any pretext  or condition.</p>

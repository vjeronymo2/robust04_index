			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Observer: Border patrol The recent Gatt symposium in Geneva on conflicts between free trade and environmental protection was purring along peacefully until Philippe Sands, a young shirt-sleeved legal type, mischievously provoked Richard Eglin, director of Gatt's Trade and Environment division. Sands, founder of London University's Foundation for International Law and Development, started annoying Eglin by quoting ebulliently from a much-leaked Gatt panel ruling on a dispute between US and Mexico over the harm that tuna fishing can cause to dolphins. Eglin, normally a suave, unflappable sort, responded that he 'can't see why people accuse us of lack of transparency - this hall leaks like a sieve'. However, rather than quit while he was ahead, Sands kept on prodding Eglin and the 300-odd delegates to think of an exception to his strongly held belief that most pollution crossed national borders. Eglin offered 'noise pollution' as an example. Sands nodded at the truth of this; but it gradually began to dawn on him - along with everyone else - that the remark might have been directed at him.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Wine and Food: Crumbs of discomfort - Nicholas Lander finds that life can be tough in a French bakery AT 7 am, the village baker's daughter opened the doors to me, her first customer. On my way out I bumped into the mayor, who pumped my hand like a good politician and bemoaned the fact that the bar owner had overslept and he would have to wait for that day's Midi Libre. Along the main road came the baker's apprentice, on his shoulder a large, brown plastic container with 80 assorted baguettes, ficelles and pains de campagne fresh from the oven. While I strolled back, he ran, so that five minutes' later, as I walked past the baker's laboratoire (all French artisans, even butchers, give their units of production this name), he was busy loading the oven again. The following Tuesday at 12.30 am, the 19-year-old apprentice, now known to me as Yannek, opened the laboratoire door to me, his assistant for the night. His boss had not yet arrived. And so began an Englishman's involvement in supplying a French village with its staple food. The first task was to calculate the quantities. In a small village of 600, consumption is constant, and a look at the previous Tuesday's sales gave the totals for tonight's production: 70 long and 48 short loaves; 130 baguettes; six pains de campagne; four other different types of loaf, including one without salt and one wholemeal (French bakers are finally adding various types of brown bread to their range); plus 3.5 kg of croissants, pains au chocolat and pains aux raisins. Just after 1 am the baker arrived, complaining of the heat. Stripped to the waist, he and Yannek took yeast from yesterday's production  - the crucial element, according to the baker  - plus salt, water and flour and, with the aid of an enormous 40-year-old mixing bowl, made the dough. The flour, which came from a nearby mill in 50 kg sacks, contained 1 per cent farine de feves: broad bean flour which ensures that the dough (and, therefore, the bread) emerged white rather than grey. The mass of dough was dug out into 11 kilo balls which would each make 20 loaves. Then, to the shout of 'On attague,' the dough was cut mechanically and thrown into what looked like an old-fashioned mangle. It emerged in the shape of embryonic baguettes, which were laid on trays to wait for the fermentation to bring them up to their proper size. The activity brought a healthy glow to the baker and his assistant. In the baker's case, it was enhanced by numerous cups of chicory-flavoured coffee laced with rum and a packet of Gitaines Mais. His immediate complaint was the lack of a family holiday this summer because of the recession, although he and his wife were concerned for their only son, enlisted recently in the army and possibly en route to Yugoslavia. Professionally, he complained that the French were buying less and less bread. He predicted that supermarkets would soon ring the death knell for most village bakers. When I asked him if he made a living, he shrugged his shoulders. The shop provided a flat and income for the family; but when the annual increase in the price of bread was passed by the French government, it was greeted by his customers with howls of protest. The only time his eyes lit up was at the mention of the Spanish and Portuguese grape-pickers, who would soon invade the area during the September harvest. They, at least, are still great bread-eaters. At 3 am, the oil-fired oven was lit and the peace of the night shattered; it would reach its optimum temperature at 4.30. Until then, the baker retreated into a small kitchen and made his patisserie  - apple, peach or plum tarts, Paris-Brest or the local speciality, fougasse  - which, he assured me, was a more remunerative occupation than baking bread. This finished at 4.30 and, with the oven at its correct temperature, the baker and his assistant went upstairs to sleep. Just before 6, the vital incisions were made in the tops of the baguettes and the oven loaded with the first 120 loaves. The trays of croissants were given a final brush of butter and slid into a convection oven. By 6.25, as the dawn broke, the air was filled with aromas of baking bread. The baker slid the first lot from the oven at 6.40 but he was not too happy. He complained that the cold northerly wind had slowed the fermentation and that Yannek had allowed the oven to get too hot. He threw me the first loaf, which I very nearly dropped. I have worked in commercial kitchens, but this was the hottest thing I had ever held. As Yannek carried the first container up to the shop, two workmen called in for their pains au chocolat. Then the baker turned his attention back to the oven and, pleased to have an audience for once, shouted: 'Now, watch an expert' as he began to load his oven with more loaves.</p>

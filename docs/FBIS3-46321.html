A Chinese  source in Hong Kong revealed this.    During the meeting, the CMC also revised the "Military  Guideline," the rules setting forth the role of the military in  pursuing reform and open-door policy. This is the first time in  five years that the guideline has been revised. It may be said  that all this shows that Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and  concurrent CMC chairman, is trying to solidify his position  within the military.    According to reports by China's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, the  Chinese Air Force's eighth meeting of party delegates was held  in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 24 December. That  meeting was attended by Jiang Zemin; Liu Huaqing, CMC vice  chairman and member of the party Political Bureau Standing  Committee; Zhang Zhen, CMC vice chairman; Defense Minister Chi  Haotian; Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the  People's Liberation Army [PLA]; Yu Yongbo, PLA General Political  Department director; Fu Quanyou, Political Department director  of the PLA General Logistic Department; and many other top  military officials. It appears that the CMC meeting was held  around that time.    According to the Chinese source, the man removed during the  CMC meeting was Zhang Gong, a political commissar in the Chengdu  Military Region, who had served as the spokesman for the martial  law force at the time of the Tiananmen incident.    In May of 1990, following the Tiananmen incident, Zhang's  contribution was recognized and he was promoted, in one big  sweep, from the position of director of the Beijing Military  Region's Political Department to the political commissar of the  Beijing Military Region. But in December 1992, he was  transferred, in a de- facto demotion, to the position of  political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region, and as a  result of the recent CMC action, he was even removed from that  position. The Chinese source insisted: "The personnel action  strongly smacks of purging targeted at Zhang who, as the  spokesman of the martial law troops, was a symbolic figure at  the time of the Tiananmen incident."    The source said that the latest CMC meeting also demoted or  removed the people belonging to the group linked to party  Political Bureau member Yang Baibing who was dismissed as  chairman of the CMC following the CPC 14th Congress in the fall  of 1992. The source did not give details on it, however.    During the meeting, the CMC also approved the "Guideline for  Building Army Grassroots Units" presented by General Secretary  Jiang. Its purpose is to make the roles of the military forces  comform to the government's position of pursuing the policy of  reform and opening up. A draft for it was first presented to  the commission five years ago. The passing of it by the CMC  means that five years have been given to the work of  transforming it into a formal "guideline."    The "guideline" can be said to be the basic action guideline  for the military forces in the future, and asks the military to  be "politically qualified, militarily strong, exemplary in  attitude, strict in discipline, and logistically well prepared."  The reason General Secretary Jiang wanted this completed is  thought to lie in his desire to solidify his base within the  military.    Meanwhile, in a ceremony in Beijing on 23 December, 12  senior  officials from the Chinese People's Armed Police Force  Headquarters were promoted to the rank of major general.  Concerning this, a Western diplomatic source in Hong Kong said:  "The Armed Police Force is the organization in which Jiang is  trying to gain influence over. There is no doubt that Jiang's  political intention regarding the military forces was evident at  that promotion ceremony."</p>

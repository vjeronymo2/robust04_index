			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>   [Text] The American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the  information carried by REUTER about President Glavkos Kliridhis'  threat to resign if the Security Council proceeds with a  decision to reinforce the confidence-building measures [CBM's]  process. According to REUTER the threat is contained in the  letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime  Minister John Major.    This is according to I MAKHI exclusive information which  also  reveals the negative role of former U.S. coordinator Robert  Lamb. The same information notes that the American Embassy's  action tried--initially--to have people think the leak emanated  from the Cyprus Government in order to:    FIRST: Be seen as a "bluff" by President Kliridhis with the  same contents as the intentions and warning he conveyed to U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher during their recent  telephone conversation. (The National Council was briefed at  its meeting last Wednesday on the telephone call which was made  at Mr. Chrisopher's initiative.)    SECOND: To weaken, through the publicity and dimensions that  the issue would acquire, the dramatic tone, seriousness,  developments, and President Kliridhis' categorical refusal to  accept the continuation of talks on the CBM's. The same sources  revealed to I MAKHI that the ultimate goal of this action was  for the U.S. Government not to pay proper attention to the  Kliridhis letter and to conceal the actions and recent handling  by Robert Lamb and American Ambassador in Nicosia Richard  Boucher.    According to reliable information I MAKHI has, which leaves  no room for doubt, the U.S. Government and the State Department  are COMPLETELY UNAWARE [uppercase as published] of the ways Lamb  and Boucher handled the issue and particularly of Lamb's  proposals made in Vienna and the promises (which are outside the  21 March document) he gave "behind the backs" of the Greek  Cypriot side and which Rauf Denktas now invokes and uses as a  basis for the strengthening of the CBM's talks.    Moreover, it is worth stressing that the UN secretary  general's representatives also disagree strongly with Lamb's  promises and they have expressed their strong displeasure at the  way that Lamb handled the issue in Vienna and the current  approach for the future course of the Cyprus issue.    Meanwhile, there has not been any official reaction by the  Cyprus Government to Kliridhis' threat to resign and call  elections, as REUTER reported. Government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis, despite repeated questions from journalists,  neither denied nor confirmed the REUTER report. He confined  himself to saying only that the contents of President Kliridhis'  letters to the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister are  confidential.    Commenting on the insistence by the Americans and the  British  and their efforts to continue the CBM talks, a diplomatic source  in Nicosia told I MAKHI that they are heading in this direction  because it suits them since it gets them out of the difficult  position they would be in if they followed the Butrus-Ghali  options, by which they would be compelled to condemn Denktas and  adopt measures against him.    According to New York reports, during a press briefing, the  UN secretary general's spokesmen Joe Sills and Fred Eckhard  expressed the view that there are some hopeful signs, but they  avoided specifying them, adding only that Mr. Gustave Feissel is  continuing his consultations. Asked when the secretary  general's new supplementary report will be issued, Mr. Eckhard  said that he does not know what form the report will finally  take (whether it will be a letter or some sort of report) but he  revealed that another UN official Mr. Karekan [name as  transliterated] told members of the Security Council that the  secretary general will add to the 31 March report information  concerning the most recent position of the Turkish Cypriot side.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Program Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consultation with the participating USIS posts in the development of the project proposal is encouraged. Letters of commitment from participating U.S. institutions would enhance a proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USIA also encourages the development of specialized written materials to enhance this professional development program. In developing written materials, consideration should be given to their wider use in Africa, beyond the immediate training at hand. USIA is interested in organizations' ideas on how to ``reuse'' specialized materials by providing them to universities and libraries or other institutions for use by a larger audience. If not already available, glossaries of specialized terms should be developed. However, please note that, according to current USIA regulations, materials developed with USIA funds may not be distributed in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Selection of a grantee institution is based on the substantive nature of the program proposal; the applicant's professional capability to carry the program through to a successful conclusion; and cost effectiveness, including in-kind contributions and the ability to keep overhead costs at a minimum. USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $160,000, but organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000, and their budget submissions should correspond to this limitation. USIA will consider funding the following costs: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport fees); ground transportation costs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Per diem:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For foreign participants during activities in the United States, organizations have the option of using a flat rate of $140/day or the published Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) per diem rates of individual American cities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. institutional staff must use the published FTR per diem rates, not the flat rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For activities overseas, standard Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Escort-interpreters:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interpretation for U.S.-based programs is provided by the State Department's Language Services Division. Typically, delegations ranging from 8&hyph;12 participants require two simultaneous interpreters and one escort officer. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem rate for each State Department escort/interpreter, as well as home-program-home air fare of $400 per interpreter and any U.S. travel expenses during the program itself. Salary expenses are covered centrally and are not part of the applicant's budget proposal. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations during travel to or from their home country. Interpreters are not available for U.S.-based internship activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Book and cultural allowances:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants are entitled to a one-time book allowance of $50 plus a cultural allowance of $150 per person during programs taking place in the United States. U.S. staff do not receive these benefits. Escort interpreters are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150.00. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consultants:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consultants may be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria generally should not exceed $250/day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) should be included in the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

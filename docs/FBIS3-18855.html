The committee's work will conclude with a report also  containing a thorough examination of the administrative  decisions made by the Faeroese banks in the 1980's that  contributed to the bankruptcy of the two largest Faeroese banks.    The provincial government wants the committee to be  appointed  by 1 February so that the report can be finished by 1 July.  According to a statement from the Faeroese Representative  Council, the committee's members must all be independent from,  among other things, the Faeroese banks, the National Bank, the  Danish Bank, and the Financial Inspectorate.</p>

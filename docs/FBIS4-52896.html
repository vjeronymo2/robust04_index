			<p>BFN     [Text] The mainstream Communist Party of the Philippines  [CPP] identified with Jose Ma. Sison has meted death sentence to  four breakaway rebel leaders, according to Carlos Forte, head of  the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, one of the breakaway  groups of the CPP.    This, however, could not be verified from the Sison-led CPP  itself. One of its allied organizations, the Revolutionary  Council of Trade Unions, had earlier denied there was such a  "hit list" of former comrades to be liquidated but "only charges  that has to be duly processed in the revolutionary court."    In a statement faxed to the CHRONICLE, Forte said Sison's  politburo has convened itself as a "People's Court" and voted  5-4 to liquidate Filemon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar,  and Ricardo Reyes. Forte is reportedly the nom de guerre of  Lagman.    "We have identified three of the comrades assigned to carry  out this order, one of whom is a long-time operative of the  defunct Armed City Partisan (ACP) in Metro Manila of the early  1970s," Forte said. "They are now in Metro Manila but are being  monitored by ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] units."</p>

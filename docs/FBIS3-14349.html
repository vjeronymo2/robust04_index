The first mention, which went against the grain of the ordinary  U.S. policy, was uttered weeks ago when the al-Ibrahim mosque  massacre occurred, in which Israeli occupiers and settlers  killed 53 Palestinians and wounded more than 180 others. This  U.S. statement was made before the UN Security Council. At the  time it was very clear that nobody could condone the massacre or  even oppose its condemnation; this is because the ugliness and  magnitude of the massacre and its racial motivations exposed the  Israeli hypocrisy, which has been killing Palestinians for years  and decades in a terrorist, racist, merciless, and harsh manner  in the occupied land and world capitals; yet the Israelis  continued to avoid world condemnation. What is more, the  Israeli hypocrisy used to accuse the Palestinians of terrorism.    In the midst of the Israeli official, terrorist, and  occupationist killing, the United States opposed UN Security  Council Resolution 904 for three weeks, thus defying the  international community. It insisted on voting on each separate  paragraph of the resolution in order that it could abstain from  voting on an issue that is the most clear-cut of issues -- it is  the issue of east Jerusalem, which the resolution stipulates  must be included in the list of occupied territories. This  stipulation is harmonious with reality and with all past UN  resolutions. It is also compatible with the measures that the  superpowers and other countries, including the United States,  have respected to the letter; they have all refrained from  opening an embassy in Jerusalem. This was done to avoid giving  the Israelis the interpretation they have been working for since  their occupation of the Palestinian land -- to give Jerusalem  the status of the united and permanent capital of Israel.    The issue could have passed if the matter had stopped at the  U.S. abstention, and after the clarification issued by the White  House, stressing no change in U.S. policy toward Jerusalem.    But what happened the day before yesterday -- after the U.S.  President met the Jewish communities and after Jewish leaders  stated that Clinton had pointed out that Jerusalem is an  undivided city and Israel's eternal capital -- sets off the  problem from anew.    It is true that U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry  yesterday stressed that there are no changes in the U.S.  position on Jerusalem, but that statement was general,  open-ended, and insufficient. It does not resolve the situation  on a fundamental issue for our Palestinian people, the Arab,  Islamic, and Christian nations.    When we put two and two together, we realize what is behind  these statements, and this raises our anxiety on such U.S.  discrepancies and ambiguities over Jerusalem. On the one hand,  the Administration does not agree on a paragraph which does not  state Jerusalem's occupation, and on the other they leave the  U.S. President's office to announce what he had told them was  his position -- on Jerusalem being Israel's unified capital. On  another occasion, the official spokesman for the State  Department, and not for the White House, speaks ambiguously and  in general terms that there is no change in the American  position on the issue of Jerusalem, without specifying the  position and without redefining that position.    Some have criticized the PLO because it forced the city of  Jerusalem into the UN resolution. This led to the U.S.  abstaining from the vote.    Notwithstanding our willingness to accept all critics, we  still think that blind persistence and/or hiding one's head in  the sand will not help anyone. On the contrary, it will make  things worse.    The American stance and policies are not merely reaction. On  the contrary, there are acts and policies which are well planned  in advance, as well as tactical pledges. It is therefore  necessary to raise them in order find out exactly what they are  leading to, to know how to deal with them, and which weapons one  should use.    We believe that the current American Administration is under  greater pressures from the Jewish lobby in the United States --  which might be behind the Whitewater issue which has become a  powder keg that might destroy this Administration -- when  dealing with the Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli  conflict. It is therefore a problem which has made matters more  difficult and more complicated, and has made it necessary to  face up to the problems, however complicated they might be,  foremost of which is Jerusalem. Jerusalem should be viewed as an  occupied city and a holy city, not only to Muslims but also to  Christians, whose right to their holy city has been questioned  by President Clinton, who has chosen ambiguity as a means for  fulfilling the Jewish illegitimate aims.    It is true that Jerusalem is on the table of negotiations  within the agreed timetable of the negotiations. However, such  an admission should not change the fact that it is an occupied  city, and that negotiations will not be about whether it is an  occupied city or not but on its future, in a such a way that  would bring about balance and fairness, and meet the rights of  all parties concerned.    Jerusalem cannot be eternally united as the Israelis have  been asserting, because the word eternal is a gratuitous one.  Nothing is eternal as far as history is concerned.</p>

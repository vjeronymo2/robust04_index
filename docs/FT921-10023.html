			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Appointments: Bunker's Dowty move Christopher Bunker, finance director at Westland, is leaving the Yeovil-based helicopter manufacturer after a 21-year stint for a potentially much bumpier ride at Dowty, the aerospace components manufacturer in Cheltenham. While three times the size of Westland in market capitalisation terms, Dowty has also suffered severely from the recession. Its flamboyant chief executive Tony Thatcher quit for greener pastures last year and there have been persistent rumours that TI or Smith Industries might launch a bid. 'I hope he's got a cast-iron contract,' quipped one City observer, pointing out that a lot could have changed by the time Bunker, 45, arrives as group financial director at the beginning of August. Westland, in turn, was evidently reluctant to let him go - his predecessor at Dowty, Reg Moore, who was due to retire in March, had hoped shortly to be on the ski slopes. 'Bunker is still quite a young man with tremendous energy,' says Dowty. 'We might be in a bad patch now. But that may be a good time to join. This is a very exciting company.' Westland, while relatively secure in the longer term, is in danger of treading water in the next two years with a very thin helicopter order book. At Dowty, meanwhile, the excitement for Bunker - a geography graduate with subsequent accountancy qualifications - is to try to pull the company out of its current hole.</p>

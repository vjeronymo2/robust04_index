			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Japan's LDP tries to halt defections to new parties JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party was fighting yesterday to keep its parliamentary members from defecting, as two centrist groups planned new parties for the July 18 election, which may end four decades of LDP government. Senior LDP officials conceded that the party might be defeated at the election, called after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, lost a no-confidence motion on Friday when a rebel faction voted against the party. The political upheaval is expected to dominate Japanese financial markets this week after Friday's 2 1/2 per cent drop in the value of the yen against the dollar. The stock market opened weaker this morning, with the Nikkei average down about 300 points in initial trading. The yen opened at Y109.33 against the dollar, after closing in New York on Friday at Y109.75. Analysts are uncertain whether the possibility of the LDP losing its 38-year-old hold on power means the end of the yen's bull run, which has seen a 16 per cent rise in the Japanese currency against the dollar this year. While braced for short-term weakness ahead of the election, they point out that Japan's huge trade surplus is deep-rooted and still favours the yen. Sensing that the LDP is more vulnerable than at any time since 1955, the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition group, said a coalition government could be formed with LDP defectors if they succeed in attracting voter support. The LDP decided to hold the election as soon as possible, believing that the new groups will find it difficult in the time allotted to choose candidates and raise funds for an effective campaign. Party officials were also conscious that the trial for tax evasion of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former LDP godfather, begins on July 22. Mr Tsutomu Hata, whose LDP faction brought down the government, is expected to announce his resignation from the party tomorrow and the formation of a new party a day later. He hopes to put forward at least 170 candidates for the 512 seats to be contested in the election. 'It's important to put an end to one-party rule  - that's one part of political reform which could create dynamism,' Mr Hata said, referring to the LDP's possible defeat. He also defended himself against criticism that he had tarnished the country's reputation by triggering an election at a time when Japan is preparing to host a Group of Seven summit, due to begin on July 7. Mr Hata said the LDP chose to provoke the upheaval by failing to address political reform, especially the redrawing of electoral boundaries and tougher controls on donations intended to clean up Japanese politics. The scent of a share in government has encouraged the SDP, which has languished in opposition without any real chance of leading the country. Mr Sadao Yamahana, the SDP's chairman, said his party is willing to share power with a new Hata-led party. LDP members fear they will be punished by voters next month, a fear also reflected among candidates for Tokyo city council elections to be held on Sunday. Apart from Mr Hata, a second group of 10 LDP members belonging to the Mitsuzuka faction is planning to form a new party.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Gloomy forecast on EC economies THE European Community will have to wait until 1995 for a real economic recovery, Mr Henning Christopherson, EC economic commissioner, said yesterday, Lionel Barber reports from Rome. In one of his gloomiest forecasts to date, Mr Christopherson said unemployment could reach 12 per cent in 1993-94, higher than the peak jobless rate in 1985. Addressing the Association for the Monetary Commission of Europe, the Danish commissioner ruled out re-opening the Maastricht treaty's criteria for European monetary union to take account of rising unemployment. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, president of Fiat, accused the EC of a 'gutless lack of ideals' and called for an inner group of core currencies to move to monetary union. This would create a vital benchmark and would make a 'significant contribution to a further drop in European interest rates,' he said.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Prague exchange to open today with unlisted market THE PRAGUE stock exchange (PSE) will join the group of emerging eastern European markets when it begins trading today with a small number of unlisted securities. Initial plans to open with a listed market have been abandoned because of technical difficulties, but work on listing arrangements continues. Mr Jiri Franc, PSE general secretary, said: 'The listing process is under way, but it is very hard to choose companies suitable for listing. The whole economy is being restructured and some companies, which six months ago showed good results, may have big problems in the future. We want to offer quality.' By starting with an unlisted market the PSE hopes to establish itself before the opening of a rival, known as the RM system. Run by Mr Dusan Triska, one of architects of mass privatisation while at the finance ministry, it is designed to operate as a nationwide, cheap electronic over-the-counter market. The backers of the RM system hoped to establish it by trading in shares from last year's mass voucher privatisation, which involved about 1,500 companies and in which 8.5m Czech and Slovak investors participated. The distribution of these shares was due to start on March 29, but it has been postponed indefinitely after a row between the Czech Republic and Slovakia over the division of assets from former Czechoslovakia. The Czech government said it would not transfer shares in Czech companies to Slovak investors unless Slovakia agreed to settle. Mr Franc, of the PSE, is cautiously optimistic on prospects. 'It will take time for a market environment to develop,' he said. Trading will begin with eight securities, including government bonds, and he hopes that, by the end of the year, there will be about 15 fully-listed securities. The exchange has 30 staff, small dealing desks for 32 dealers divided between two floors, and 53 registered brokers. Initially, there will be a single daily price fixing.</p>

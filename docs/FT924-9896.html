			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: US buying helps lift London equities BETTER economic news from across the Atlantic and interest rate cuts in France helped the UK stock market resist political uncertainties yesterday and turn higher towards the close of the trading session. US buyers appeared in London for the blue chip internationals, while the broad range of domestic stocks responded to hopes that interest rate cuts and moves to stimulate the domestic economy will survive tomorrow night's Maastricht debate in parliament. Trading volume was light for much of the day, with investors clearly cautious at the beginning of a week which will be featured by the presidential election in the US and the challenge to Mr John Major's government in the paving debate over the Maastricht treaty. In early trading, equities were sluggish, barely succeeding in recovering an early fall of 9.2 on the FT-SE Index by midsession. Renewed weakness in sterling cast a cloud over interest rate hopes, and equities were restrained by falls in government bond prices. The second half of the session saw share prices climbing slowly until mid-afternoon when the pace speeded up, reportedly when a leading UK securities house stepped in to the London market with a Pounds 150m buy order from a US investment fund. Also helping equities was a modest rally in sterling after the reduction of some French base rates appeared to improve the chances for similar moves in the UK. The FT-SE Index closed at the day's best of 2,687.8 for a gain on the day of 29.5 points. Traders suggested that the US fund buyer of London stocks might simply be hedging positions while awaiting the outcome of the presidential vote. But sentiment towards the US economy benefited from news late yesterday that the US National Purchasing Managers Index had risen to 50.6 per cent and that construction orders had increased by 1.3 per cent in September, the largest monthly rise since April. The rise in the equity market spread from the blue chip international sectors to take in the wider range of stocks reflected in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. The increased focus on stocks outside the FT-SE 100-share Index over the past fortnight has indicated the search by institutions for stocks likely to benefit from moves to stimulate the UK economy. Retail and consumer shares edged forward after a dull start and building and construction issues, also immediate beneficiaries of lower base rates, found buyers. But gains were generally modest. as were trading volumes. A handful of bid situations also re-emerged, partly in view of perceptions that the Hanson camp, challenged in its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, may turn to other targets, some of them identified in previous tussles. Takeover speculators were active on the insurance pitch, where a French bid was suggested, and also among the construction stocks. However, strategists warned that the market might have over-reacted yesterday to modest buying interest. On the domestic front, hopes for economic stumulus must take account of the government's struggle to achieve acceptance tomorrow for the Maastricht proposals, and may then have to wait until the official autumn economic statement, due at the end of next week.</p>

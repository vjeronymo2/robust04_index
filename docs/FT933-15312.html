			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (5): I hope I can make a difference - Interview / Prime minister Rafik al-Hariri shares his ambitions with Roger Matthews THE LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER discussed his programme of national reconstruction with the FT. Excerpts follow: The search for foreign funding: I am not at all disappointed by the response. We have over Dollars 1bn committed. Part of it from the Italian government, from the World Bank, the Kuwaiti Fund, the Arab Fund and the EC. We are also discussing bilateral protocols with several countries. Things are going well. Exchange rate policy: The most important thing is stability. I am not trying to fix the rate. We are trying to stabilise it, and that is what I have been doing since I took over. We are not now using our foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. Earlier this year some people did try to play with the exchange rate. They have paid the price. They lost money. There is no law to stop people speculating. It is a free market. The Christians and the government: Maybe some Christian leaders do not feel comfortable with the present situation. But I am as committed to the Christians as I am to all the Lebanese. We have Christian ministers in the Cabinet and they are representative. The whole Lebanese political situation is in a transition period. The war is finished. During the war not all the normal Lebanese leaders, the conservatives who led the country during the first 40-50 years, played an important role. During the war period a new leadership emerged some of which became popular, others failed. In a few years we will see a new leadership emerging from the post-war era. The next elections in just under three and a half years will give a new leadership to the country. I believe that Lebanon cannot be governed by a person, by a sect, by a religion or by a party. Lebanon was, and always will be, ruled by the agreement of most of the Lebanese leadership. Why Hizbollah is still armed: It is a militia only in the south. It relates to the occupied territory. It is like any other Lebanese resistance force, but perhaps has more publicity. You will not find Hizbollah acting as a militia in Beirut or anywhere else, except in the south. Every country has its own political situation. You cannot now disarm the Lebanese who are fighting the occupation (by Israel). The Israelis say they are not occupiers. This is not true. Once we reach an agreement with Israel to withdraw and we have our land back, Hizbollah and any other resistance forces will have no need to keep fighting. And because they are not fighting, they will not need their arms. The Middle East peace process: Our position is very clear. We entered the negotiations on the basis of UN resolution 425 which includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Lebanon. We are following the negotiations with the other Arab countries very closely. You will not see us or any country sign a separate agreement with Israel. The Syrian and Israeli presence: You cannot call the Israeli occupation a 'presence'. It is an occupation. Syria is playing a completely different role. The Syrians have been trying, since I came to office, to give all the help they can to the Lebanese government. They are not interfering in our internal development as a country - not with me anyway. The Israeli occupation is not linked to the Syrian presence. The country is now peaceful and the Syrians are playing a very important role in keeping it peaceful. The Lebanese army and security forces are improving every day. The more we strengthen them, the less we will need Syria. Lebanon and Syria are looking forward to the day when we are satisfied with the security situation and they will not want to stay any more. The 1991 treaty with Syria: The relationship between the two countries is improving, on the basis of the independence and sovereignty of both nations. There is a lot of contact between ministers on both sides to seek the basis of common interest. In Lebanon we have a tremendous interest in Syria from an economic point of view. It is a large market for our products. The private sector is also very strong in Lebanon, much stronger than in any other part of the region. On the reconstruction of Beirut: I am the man behind the idea to rebuild central Beirut. In 1975 I was just a small, poor guy, working in Saudi Arabia, so I did not really know how Beirut was then. We do not want to rebuild Beirut as it was. We are not satisfied with it as it was. It lacked a lot of things in 1975. Communications, roads, electricity and other things were not that good. Instead we want Beirut to be a city of the 21st century. We might see an agreement with Israel coming out of the negotiations. We should be prepared for it. But we cannot be prepared with the capital as it is now. Why he became prime minister: Even my wife does not understand that. But I felt that I could make a change, and that for the country I must take the job. I had been trying to help from behind the scenes for a long time before I became prime minister, in a humanitarian and philanthropic way, and politically through ceasefires and the Taif Agreement. So far I do not think my decision was wrong. But there is a big difference with what I did before. In business you control your work and your decisions. In politics you must work harder and consider a lot of other elements. You can never say you have succeeded. I have made a difference: that is the best I can say.</p>

The International Competition  for Changing the 'Cover' Installation Is Over. But What Is  Next?"]    [Text] Just as the nuclear electric power station on  the banks of the Pripyat River is firmly associated in our  country with danger, misfortune, and grief, the word "Chernobyl"  itself brings to mind the fourth unit of the AES [nuclear  electric power station] that was demolished by a terrible  explosion and the sarcophagus that was erected on its ruins,  under whose arches there is now a simply fantastic amount of  radioactive material--20 million curies.    Many think that the "Cover" installation is airtight.  Unfortunately, this is not so. During its construction, due to  high radiation it was necessary to use remote methods, as a  result of which the overall area of cracks in the sarcophagus  totals about 1,000 square meters. Naturally, radioactive dust  can easily penetrate through these to the outside. Given a  failure in the internal structures, there is a serious danger  for people working in the industrial area of the AES.    Prominent specialists from many countries of the world  who took part in the international competition, whose results  were summarized in Kiev almost a half year ago, attempted to  answer the question: "What should the new 'Cover' be like?" They  had to take the most diverse circumstances into account. For  example, to ensure against natural and other calamities, the new  "Cover" should be calculated for an earthquake magnitude of  seven (one higher than probable) and for a powerful hurricane,  and even for the fact that an aircraft could fall on it. It is  not without reason that it is said that the rarest event that  occurs once in a thousand years could also occur tomorrow.    It is written in the conditions of the competition that  a contract is signed with its winner (or winners) for the  implementation of their ideas. But nothing is being heard about  the start of design work, not to speak of construction work. HAS  THE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION TURNED INTO A KIND OF POLITICAL  GAME ORGANIZED AROUND CHERNOBYL? A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent  put this question to Professor Vladimir Tokarevskiy, doctor of  physico-mathematical sciences and general director of the  "Cover" interbranch scientific-technical center of the Academy  of Sciences of Ukraine.    [Tokarevskiy] Such a point really was stated in the  conditions, but it was changed in March of this year: The winner  received an opportunity to reach the final stage of the  so-called tender--the competition for the right to acquire a  contract. In this case, this was the conduct of a feasibility  study for the design work. In essence, this decision of the  organizational committee was like extending the competition for  an unlimited period.    [Kiyanskiy] What, for example, would soccer fans say if the  rules of the game were changed in the course of a match?! In my  opinion, behavior like this is not permitted in civilized  countries...    [Tokarevskiy] An exceptional circumstance compelled us to do  this. It remained absolutely unclear as to who would pay for the  TEO [feasibility study] and the design work, and what is most  important, who would be able to finance the construction. If the  conditions remained as before, the Ukrainian Government would  simply prove to be unable to fulfill them and to sign a contract  with the winner. And this, you will agree, is far worse than  making corrections.    [Kiyanskiy] Perhaps it is appropriate here to mention an old  anecdote from the "vintage" series. At the beginning of the  1930's, Rothschild was approached by representatives of the  Soviet Ministry of Finance with a request to borrow a very large  sum. Why do you need so much money? asked the famous banker.  They explained to him politely: for the construction of  socialism. "In my opinion, when there is no money, it is not  necessary to build," Rothschild replied.    [Tokarevskiy] The story is amusing, but I do not see the  analogy here. The sarcophagus cannot wait. Every lost month is  fraught with problems.    [Kiyanskiy] As I understand it, the French offered the  means...    [Tokarevskiy] Only for the feasibility study and (to a  lesser  degree) for the project. If we had agreed to their conditions,  we would have impeccably formulated documents, beautifully  executed sketches, and they possibly would even be able to lay  down a certain "zero" cycle. And they would have received the  usual long-range construction project, for there was no money  for the completion of construction. To finance all the work the  Ukrainian Government would need, according to various estimates,  from $500 million to $2.5 billion, and the French were giving  $10-15 million. As you see, the sums are not compatible...    Before starting any kind of a job, it should be known  exactly  how to complete it. The World Bank or the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development are able to guaranteeing real  financing for the grandiose project. It would be possible to  resolve the problem successfully if we were actively assisted by  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  Commission of the European Community, and an international fund  established specially to finance the Chernobyl project, say, at  the request of the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.  The sum of $500 million is really not such a large amount for  the entire world community.    [Kiyanskiy] The authors of one of the drafts that was  submitted for the competition proposed pouring concrete into the  destroyed unit and transforming it into a monolith. Why was  their idea rejected; after all, the resources needed for its  implementation would be much less than other projects?    [Tokarevskiy] By transforming the unit into a monolith we  would increase the volume of radioactive waste, and would  thereby be behaving like the poor housekeeper who scoops all the  rubbish into one corner in the hope that someone will take it  away later. As the result of such an operation, instead of  hundreds of cubic meters of radioactive waste, we would get  millions of cubes of "contamination." But this, you will agree,  is unethical with respect to our progeny, on whose shoulders we  would place such a heavy burden.    If a catastrophe that is unprecedented in human history  occurred because of our tragic mistakes, then the efforts that  are applied to the elimination of its consequences must be just  as great. The present generation is obliged to cope with the  accident of the century.    Unfortunately the international competition jury, about  which  we have already spoken with you, was compelled to state that not  one of the submitted works makes it possible to resolve the  problem comprehensively: It is impossible, for example, to take  the French draft, considered to be the best, and start  construction on its basis. The jury decided not to award the  first prize. It thereby declared to the whole world that,  unfortunately, a ready solution does not exist today. The  problem proved to be far more complicated than we thought just  several years ago.    [Kiyanskiy] But sooner or later the construction will  nonetheless begin. Hundreds of trucks will begin to move up to  the unit, and various mechanisms will start to work in the  industrial area. Many will speak up about the danger that dust  will be raised, and that the wind will carry the nuclides to  nearby villages and cities. Radioactive particles will fall into  the soil and water...    [Tokarevskiy] Well, you know, fear makes mountains out of  molehills. If such fears are expressed by the broad public, then  specialists have already thought about this first and foremost.  We consider dust suppression to be one of the most important  problems. In the course of a day approximately 22,000 liters of  air pass through a person's lungs, and you and I consume about  two kilograms of food on average. This means that incomparably  more nuclides can get into the human body through breathing than  through eating. It is for this reason that the requirements for  clean air are much stricter.    Dust suppression systems will begin to function as soon as  construction work around the sarcophagus is started. The  contaminated soil of 1986 by the walls of the sarcophagus is now  at a depth of three to nine meters: It was covered with clean  earth at one time for the purpose of decontaminating it. But, of  course, we will have to remove the "cultured layer," which is  contaminated with radiation. As for removing blockages and  dismantling damaged structures inside the sarcophagus, this will  begin to be done only after the erection of the airtight shell  of "Cover-2."    [Kiyanskiy] But after all, nuclides can get into not only  the  air and ground, but also into subsoil water...    [Tokarevskiy] Indeed, this is one of the most complicated  and, alas, still unresolved problems today. As recent  measurements indicate, there has been no record, fortunately, of  migration through any kind of loose joints or cracks in the  foundation of the sarcophagus. However, we will not forget about  the enormous amount of radioactive materials located here.    I repeat, there is no migration at this time. But if we  become convinced that it has appeared, it will obviously not  become easier for anyone. Therefore, any delays in the  construction of "Cover-2" are fraught with the most serious  consequences. We have been allotted only five years for  everything--and not a month longer.</p>

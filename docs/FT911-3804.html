			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / FT Conference (European Securities Markets in the 1990s): Securities chiefs split as deadline looms - Ahead of next month's Athens meeting which aims to approve a pan-European stock market trading system, the views of industry leaders are polarised, reports Richard Waters. SENIOR officials of the largest stock markets in the European Community still have markedly different ambitions for a proposed system to support cross-border share trading, just one month before they are due to reach agreement on the system's final form. Speaking in London yesterday at a conference on the development of the European securities industries, officials from Germany, France and the UK seemed as far apart as ever on the future for securities trading in Europe. Yet at a meeting in Athens in a month's time, they and other EC exchanges hope to agree the development of Euroquote, a network which could form the basis for cross-border share trading. Mr Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice-chairman of the Federation of German Stock Exchanges, said that there is no demand in Germany for Euroquote to act as a pure information system - the planned first phase of the development. Instead, he said, 'the obvious need remains for a European settlement system'. Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, chairman and chief executive of the Paris Bourse, did not specifically address the question of Euroquote in his speech, but later said that the system was not a necessary part of cross-border share trading. Commercial information suppliers could disseminate information just as effectively, he said. Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of London's International Stock Exchange, said that to be useful, Euroquote should carry regulated company news - something that only two of the 12 EC exchanges could currently provide about companies they listed. He added: 'We are sceptical about the development of Euroquote into any (as yet wholly undefined) kind of trading or settlement system . . . We must first decide what it is that Europe's markets need.' Mr Patrick Gifford, a director of Fleming Investment Management, challenged many of the assumptions made by the exchanges when he said that, for an investor, the current fragmented European markets offered greater opportunities than would exist in a single, efficient, transparent market. Instead, he called for cheaper settlement costs and changes that would make the job of fund managers easier. These include a common settlement period in all markets, to make international switching easier, and more information from exchanges about corporate actions like the timing of dividend payments. Differences also arose over the regulation of cross-border share trading. The EC hopes by June to agree an Investment Services Directive to regulate securities business, but this has so far foundered on strong differences of principle. Mr Theodore said that cross-border share trading would develop through co-operation between existing national markets, each of which would remain the main centre of liquidity in its own domestic shares. What was needed was high standards of transparency and listing requirements on each market. He defended the view that this should be extended to all equity markets, including wholesale markets developed for professional investors, such as SEAQ International in London. 'Investors need some sort of price transparency, whatever the market they are dealing on,' he said. Mr Rawlins, though, argued against imposing a common level of price transparency, adding that such ideas 'could drive business away from regulated markets or, indeed, drive it away from Europe altogether.' Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director general of the EC directorate for financial institutions and company law, laid out the terms of the EC's planned compromise. He said that investors should be able to give a blanket authorisation to intermediaries to deal off-exchange on their behalf, and that it should be left to member states to decide whether and when the details of transactions are published, provided they are all reported to a market authority. Mr Jeffrey Knight, conference chairman and a special adviser to the Federation of Stock Exchanges in the EC, said Europe's various securities markets would inevitably grow closer. 'The question is not whether markets will become integrated, but how,' he said.</p>

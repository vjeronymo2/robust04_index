			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul subway workers'  strike continued for the fifth straight day Tuesday with the  fatigue felt by non-striking workers, after working overtime for  the past four days, causing a reduction in operating hours and  leaving many commuters stranded during the morning rush hours.    On lines two and three, operating hours were cut with trains  running from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., instead of from 5:00 A.M.  to 12:00 P.M. Moreover, intervals between train runs were  extended from three minutes to six minutes, causing traffic  congestion at nearly all stops during the morning rush hours.    At Sadang station, a transfer point for lines two and four,  some 300 stranded passengers delayed a train's departure by  about 15 minutes at 8:40 in the morning.    However, on lines one and four, which are linked with the  national railroads, the intervals were back to the near-normal  three to four minutes, as national railway operations were  nearly normalized with striking train engineers returning to  work.    As of 8:00 A.M. Tuesday, 3,823 or 44 percent of the 8,724  striking subway workers had returned to work, according to the  Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corp.    Consequently, the corporation extended the deadline for  returning to work to 4:00 P.M. Tuesday from 11:00 A.M. Saturday.    As a result, whether subway operations are normalized within  the week depends on how many more striking workers return to  their posts by the new deadline.    Corporation officials said the number of strikers returning  by the extended deadline would determine whether lines two and  three could resume normal operations within the week.    Meanwhile, railroad operations are rapidly returning to  normal as more than 90 percent of striking workers have returned  to work.    The Korean National Railroad (KNR) said Tuesday that freight  train operations, including those for containers, oil and  cement, had reached normalcy, with cargo train runs increasing  to the pre-strike level of 543 a day across the country.    Commuter train operations on major lines also achieved 90  percent normalcy, while passenger train runs on trunk lines such  as Seoul-Pusan, Taejon-Mokpo and Iri-Sunchon increased by 15  from Monday to 82, 18 percent of the normal level.    Passenger and cargo train runs totaled 1,444 across the  country for the day, more than 70 percent of the pre-strike  level, the KNR said.    By late Monday, 2,866 locomotive engineers, or 96 percent of  the striking engineers, had returned to work or expressed their  intention to do so, and 1,986 assistant engineers, or 95  percent, and 1,122 rolling stock inspectors, or 76 percent,  followed suit.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Leave it to the board After another week of dividend cuts from such as British Steel and Lonrho, UK investors might be forgiven for asking themselves if they are getting enough say in the matter of their income. The snag is that their position is weak in theory as well as in practice. One of the more popular arguments is that cuts are unfair to income funds. This is absurd. Anyone who buys a high-yielding share is betting against the market on the outlook for the dividend. There is no room for complaint if the bet does not come off. On a wider front, harried company directors must occasionally be tempted to say the unsayable: that when it comes to determining the dividend, shareholders are simply not qualified to take part in the debate. The fallacy lies in supposing that dividends are paid out of a residual lump of distributable earnings. In the real world, dividends are paid out of cash. All the cash flowing into the business has to be allocated somewhere: to capital expenditure, to stocks, to wages, to advertising, to earning money in the bank. The decision on how much to allocate to shareholders is intelligible only in the context of how else the money might be spent. On such internal budgeting matters, investors are in the dark. They must simply trust the directors to make the decision in the long-term interests of shareholders. If they do not so trust the directors, they should not have bought the shares in the first place. It might be argued that shareholders have a legitimate grievance in another sense. It is common ground among UK companies that dividends should be set at a sustainable level; that is, enough should be squirrelled away in the good years to pay for the bad. To cut the dividend is thus to break an implied promise. But in reality, the promise can only ever be conditional upon the bad times not turning out worse than could be reasonably expected. Since that seems to be just the position at present, shareholders must bear the discomfort along with everybody else.</p>

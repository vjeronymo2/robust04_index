			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / E German industry 'will differ from that of west' EAST Germany's former planned economy is being transformed into a market economy with a noticeably different structure to that of west Germany, according to a report by Berliner Bank. Industry in the east, once dominated by investment goods production, will be more weighted toward consumer goods, a sector already expanding at an annual rate of nearly 50 per cent. East German industrial output, which fell 28 per cent in the first eight months of 1991, would suffer a permanent loss in its share of regional GNP, the bank forecast. The sectors showing strongest growth in east German industry would differ from those in the west: Construction. Building activity revival has been delayed, but the report predicted that DM17bn (Dollars 10.6bn) in public infrastructure projects this year would help boost construction output by 30 per cent and serve as a catalyst for economic recovery. Food processing. Production fell in December 1990 to 60 per cent of the previous year's level, but output is set to expand sharply, following investment by west German food processors and a shift to local products by eastern consumers. Printing. Output fell 20.5 per cent by December 1990 but rose 14 per cent by August 1991 over the previous year's third quarter. Steel and light construction. In January 1991, this sector produced only 63 per cent of output compared with July 1990. Output has since recovered dramatically, soaring 50 per cent to August 1991.</p>

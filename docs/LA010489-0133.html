			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JOBLESS RATE RISES IN W. GERMANY  </P> <P> West German unemployment figures for 1988 show that despite the highest  economic growth this decade, West Germany's jobless rate rose and economists  are predicting worse to come.  </P> <P> Data released by the Federal Labor Office today revealed that an average of  2.24 million people were without work throughout last year -- a jobless rate of  8.7%, compared with 8.5% in 1987.  </P> <P> Petra Ott, Frankfurt-based economist for Citibank AG, saw the unemployment rate  rising again this year in the world's third-biggest economy. "A rate of over 9%  for 1989 doesn't seem unrealistic," she said.  </P> <P> The new Labor Office statistics showed the jobless rate declining in December  to 8.5% from 9.2% in the same month of 1987. But it attributed the decrease to  unusually mild weather last month.  </P> <P> West Germany's job market faces the special problem of having to employ  thousands of Eastern Bloc refugees invited by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  government into the country, said Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank AG  in Frankfurt.  </P></p>

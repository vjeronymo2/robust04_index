			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Passions have been running high lately in the  Crimea, but today the situation is somewhat less tense. Very  probably this is because talks are going to take place tomorrow  between the government delegations of Russia and Ukraine  concerning the situation on the peninsula. It will be recalled  that Kiev's delegation will be led by Yuhym Zvyahilskyy, the  acting prime minister. What results does Simferopol expect of  this meeting? Our correspondent is talking to Vyacheslav  Lebedev, the press secretary of the Crimean president.    [Begin Lebedev recording] The negotiating process has begun,  and both Russia and Ukraine realize there is a need for talks,  so the results are bound to come -- not at once, perhaps, but  there will be results. The very fact talks are taking place  will have a positive influence on developments in the Crimea.  As for the situation in the Crimea, the president is in control  -- that is, of the things he can control. He cannot, for  example, control the fleet, and the troops are also being  controlled by someone different. [end recording]    If the representatives of Russia and Ukraine discuss the  situation in the Crimea tomorrow, then talks between the  parliamentary delegations of Simferopol and Kiev will take place  on 24 May. [passage omitted] And what is the current situation  like? Once more, here is the press secretary of the Crimean  president:    [Begin Lebedev recording] The situation is normal and quiet.  The tension exists only on the top level and is largely  internal. We realize the presidential election in Ukraine is  scheduled for 26 June and Kravchuk is making his last attempts  to play the Crimean card and disrupt the election or put some  sort of pressure on the deputies. We shall try to defend  ourselves and not give him a pretext to introduce a state of  emergency and thus avoid the election. It is by this that the  present situation has been caused and these difficulties are  mainly temporary. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed M.N.: "Paris and Brussels at Loggerheads on </F> Bull"]    [Text] Brussels is expected to block tomorrow the payment  of a 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] grant earmarked for Bull [computer  firm] in 1994. The European Commission will also order an  inquiry into the amounts already paid to the French manufacturer  in December.    A warning shot from Brussels? Tomorrow, on the initiative of  [European Competition Commissioner] Karel Van Miert, the  European Commission is expected to block the payment of a  Fr2.5-billion grant earmarked by the French Government for 1994.  This is a serious hindrance to the recapitalization of the  state-owned group -- an overall Fr8.6 billion bill agreed to  last November. In addition to the state, capital subscribers  include France Telecom (Fr1.6 billion) and NEC [Nippon  Electronics Company] (Fr0.4 billion). In the meantime, an  inquiry into the Fr6.1 billion already received by Bull last  December will be opened by Brussels. The procedure will also  entail looking at the Fr2.5-billion advance made in February  1993 by Pierre Beregovoy's government.    The French state has now been warned. It must comply with  Brussels' demands within a month. Although the government is  eager to rescue the computer manufacturer, it may have to  contend with opposition from the European Commission. The  latter considers it has already shown flexibility. "We could  have blocked the grants allocated in December, but we did not  wish to put pressure on the French Government," it says. Today,  the Commission is no longer in an accommodating mood. It says  it has been waiting over a year for the business plan required  for its investigation. During this period, Karel Van Miert met  six times with French Industry minister Gerard Longuet.  However, the documents submitted by Bull and the French state  "are mere outlines and do not show details," it is said in  Brussels.    "We provided the Commission with the elements needed to  demonstrate our determination to reorganize the company.  Furthermore, the aid we received in December only amounted to  Fr5.5 billion," Bull says. "How can we let everyone know about  Bull's five-year strategy?" adds a senior public servant. As  for the Industry Ministry, it considers it has given Brussels  clear enough indications as to the changes implemented in the  computer manufacturer. "A new man from the private sector at  the helm of the group, recapitalization as the only financial  intervention, and projected privatization: This should be  enough."    In any case, the figures released by trade unions yesterday  as to Bull's standing are not likely to reassure Brussels.  According to the unions, there was a sharp drop in the group's  operating result in 1993 (a Fr3.2-billion loss as compared to a  Fr642-million loss the previous year). Sales have allegedly  fallen down 7 percent to Fr28 billion. These estimates are  "totally erroneous" according to Bull management. Still, Bull  and Brussels are now locked in a thoroughly inauspicious  wrestling match.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild biotech trust launch - Issue News The first investment trust to specialise in biotechnology shares is about to be launched by Rothschild Asset Management. Due to be announced in the next two weeks, the fund, which hopes to raise more than Pounds 100m, will seek to tap the upsurge in interest in the sector fuelled by a stream of flotations. Other fund management companies are hoping to launch similar trusts and will be watching the response keenly. The trust will be managed by the same team which runs Biotechnology Investments, a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) Guernsey-registered fund launched by Rothschild 12 years ago. Headed by Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, the team can claim to be the one of the most experienced in the sector outside the US. The fund, which Rothschild has been working on for two years, is expected to invest in both quoted and unquoted biotechnology companies. In Britain it will have a rapidly growing group of quoted companies from which to choose. Relaxation of listing rules for research-based businesses has led to a flood of new issues during the last 18 months with many more in the pipeline for this year. There has also been renewed investor interest in the US where biotechnology shares have started to recover after a two-year slump. US experience shows that, while a few biotechnology companies have been spectacularly successful, most disappoint. The promoters of biotechnology trusts will argue a broadly-based portfolio should provide investors with a better chance of picking the winners.</p>

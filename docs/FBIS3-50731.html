			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Caridad Carrobello, Luis Sexto, and Pedro Juan </F> Gutierrez]    [Text] It is a definitive step. It was meant to be and that  is what we are working for. Changes in agriculture are the most  appropriate adaptation, the adaptation most suited to the  circumstances in which the country finds itself, but those  changes are only now becoming apparent.    In this initial article, BOHEMIA takes a look at a number of  aspects relating to the formation and operation of the Basic  Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), but does not exhaust the  subject. In future issues, we shall focus on problems with  collection, the important participation of the Youth Labor Army  (EJT), and volunteer mobilizations. This look at the UBPC is  based on statements, questions, and answers that explain what  they are, the purpose for which they are being created, who the  fundamental participants are, the task being assigned to  science, and the role that will be played by the combined  study-work program.    The Cuban Ministry of Agriculture is hard at work developing  the UBPC because they must bear fruit in the near future and  help remedy the shortage of resources.    It is a secret to no one that, compared with previous years,  the early months of 1993 were marked by a sharp drop in all  types of farm production. As a result, various measures are  being adopted in order to make the most of the productive  reserves of farm workers.    Minister of Agriculture Alfredo Jordan is optimistic: "There  is one cardinal element that makes us feel confident and it is  that our farm workers are highly motivated, satisfied with what  they are now doing. The outlook has to be good."    In addition to being a realistic measure, turning the land  over to those who work it is unquestionably a strong incentive  for men in rural areas, but that is not all. According to  various experts, when an individual feels that he is the owner  of the means of production and thus of the product of his work,  he can face the challenge of producing more even though fuel,  lubricants, fertilizer, chemical products, and other resources  are in short supply. Because what is his is truly his, he will  take extra care to see that his crops are weeded, that no land  lies fallow, and that he has the right number of plants in his  furrows. He will plant and harvest at the right time because, in  addition to being responsible, he will be the direct beneficiary  of his work.    Deputy Minister Oscar Basulto, the Agricultural Ministry's  man in La Habana, explains: "We have always said that under  socialism, we were all owners, but to tell the truth, that was  just talk. We have never had the real owner in the field. With  the UBPC, the same man who formerly worked on the farm will  stand guard, machete in hand, making sure that no one riding by  on a bicycle will snatch a single one of the yucca cuttings that  he planted because they no longer belong to the enterprise.  Rather, they belong to him and his cooperative. I am sure that  millions of ways to save on transportation, fertilizer, and fuel  will emerge. The farmer will be much happier to get his shoes  muddy!"    Another argument wielded by those ordering the changes is  the  feeling of autonomy they give to producers. It is a feeling  growing out of the very creation of the Basic Cooperative  Production Units because the regulation gives the cooperative  complete freedom to decide how many members will band together,  elect or replace the board, and dismiss poor workers without any  other organ having any voice in the matter. It establishes work  rules, defines how much workers are to be paid in advance,  distributes profits, and approves production plans.    The new element is that these plans are not designed "from  above"; rather, they are drafted by the rank and file in  response to the voice of experience of producers, the  recommendations of experts in the unit and the enterprise, and  paying heed to government agencies that are responsible for  meeting the nation's needs. The single production plan is not a  "strait jacket," but may be adjusted. However, it does establish  production discipline based on the people's consumer needs.    In addition, we would like to address the subject of  something frequently heard concerning a change in thinking in  rural areas. I believe it is premature to use the phrase,  particularly when one realizes that it is impossible to remove  from the minds of those who for years were involved in  administrative centralism their poor use of resources, their  failure to make the most of work done in the fields, and other  forms of agricultural blight. We must not forget that the  current changes are being made using the same men.    However, we must also recognize that many persons are  beginning to take a serious look at problems in Cuban  agriculture motivated by a sincere desire to do something about  them. For example, incorporation into the UBCP means that team  members once irritated by the lack of management of countless  activities will now have an opportunity to participate in the  solutions directly.    Like every child that is born, these structures must be  raised in a healthy manner, far removed from strong and  inherently harmful temptations. A few reflections are therefore  called for.    Taking for granted the need to meet man's needs as a top  priority so that he will feel well and therefore produce more, a  number of dangers nevertheless lie in wait: excessive gloating,  commitments to take on more than one can accomplish, the use of  language and tones by the enterprise and the UBPC not likely to  achieve understanding, and excessive advance payments that will  not force the farm worker to better performances in search of  greater final earnings, thus compromising in the end financial  resources of the unit that would be better put to other uses.    Other viruses harmful to the health of the UBPC might  include  the failure to adequately estimate the requirements of planting  or the use of assigned resources, as well as not being alert to  the possible diversion of products for individual gain. A far  more harmful element affecting the collection process would be a  lack of punctuality in picking up products or discouragingly low  prices like those still paid for certain products.    Problems spotted in time have solutions. We desperately hope  that this new idea succeed because our kitchens depend on it.  <H5>  [Box, p 32] </H5> <H5>  Basic Questions </H5>   1--What are they? The UBPC are a new form of organization of  farm work. They emerged from a process of gradual adjustments  being made on farms, ranches, and state-owned enterprises aimed  at achieving a closer connection between man and the specific  area where he works. The experience of outstanding CPA's  [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative] was also taken into account.    2--Where are they being set up? Wherever farm work exhibits  suitable conditions in terms of crop features, land, and  infrastructure to be transferred to the unit's jurisdiction.  Land areas must not be too large or too small to operate  efficiently.    3--How are they being set up? On a voluntary basis, meaning  that anyone, whether it be a farm worker, crew member,  housewife, or worker from some other branch of activity may join  a UBPC. The cooperative community decides who will belong to the  unit and chooses its president from among the members. Although  there is no surplus labor force, the new units are to reduce  their staffs as a way to achieve efficiency and profitability.    4--What is their goal? To increase food production. This  task  goes hand-in-hand with a series of measures aimed at ensuring  the stability of the labor force and reversing the exodus from  rural areas to our cities.    5--Who will benefit from these changes? Cooperative workers  receive the land and housing for their use free of charge. In  exchange for their efforts, they are guaranteed of products for  themselves and their families and, in addition to receiving  advance payment periodically for their work, they participate in  the final distribution of profits. Those achieving the best  results will benefit the most. All of this will result in  increased productivity and in the end, the prime beneficiary  will be the recipient of this farm production: the people.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Audit Commission announces a review of probity in local government THE Audit Commission has announced a review of probity in local government. This arises from fears that its present method of measurement, which adds all convictions for fraud of more than Pounds 500, might be underestimating the scale of the problem. The commission said fraud reported to it by auditors had increased each year over the past three years, and a number of alleged corruption cases had been passed to the police for investigation. Publication of the review of fraud, which may include recommendations for legislation, is expected in November.</p>

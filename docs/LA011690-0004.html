			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Shandling May End Series: Garry Shandling is considering ending his comedy  series, "It's Garry Shandling's Show," on Showtime and Fox Broadcasting at the  end of the current season. "It's up in the air right now," said Brad Grey,  Shandling's manager and executive producer.  </P> <P> "Garry and I are talking about what the plan will be for next year. Garry's  really trying to sort out whether he wants to continue or move onto something  new and different." . . . But Fox had some good news to balance that on Monday.  The debut of its animated series "The Simpsons" was the most popular program in  its 8:30 p.m. Sunday time period in Los Angeles and finished second overall in  the 23 markets for which A.C. Nielsen gets overnight ratings, beating ABC and  NBC. National ratings will be released today. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

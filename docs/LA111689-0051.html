			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> GOLF TOURNEY RAISES $35,000  </P> <P> A charity golf tournament in West Covina last week raised about $35,000 for the  Life-Savers Foundation, a group that helps save the lives of sufferers of  leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and aplastic anemia.  </P> <P> The money will go to a drive to recruit bone-marrow donors.  </P> <P> Among the guests at the event were leukemia patients Anissa Ayala, 17, of  Walnut, and Danielle Nuccio, 8, of Glendora, both of whom are waiting for  donors.  </P> <P> Nationwide, Life-Savers estimates that 9,000 people are waiting for donors  whose tissue type matches their own. The odds of one person being a suitable  donor for another are one in 15,000, according to Susan Rafkin, spokeswoman for  Life-Savers.  </P> <P> Rafkin said that 25 people die every day because they lack suitable donors and  that 10 to 15 people in Los Angeles County are in need of a marrow transplant  at any given time.  </P> <P> The golf tournament, the first of its kind, attracted 144 players. More than  200 people attended a banquet that followed.  </P></p>

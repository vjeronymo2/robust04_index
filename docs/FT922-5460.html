			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: Slices of life in Edge City - Fiction JERNIGAN by David Gates, Picador Pounds 14.99, 238 pages THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET by Sandra Cisneros, Bloomsbury Pounds 6.99, 110 pages 1959 by Thulani Davis, Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 297 pages FLICKER by Theodore Roszak, Bantam Pounds 6.99, 672 pages THE eponymous hero of David Gates's remarkable first novel, Jernigan, is so down-and-out it's a wonder he can stay on the page. Peter Jernigan is a drunken 40-year-old widower who, having recently been deposited in a rehab clinic, finds himself in the unenviable position of trying to figure out what went wrong. The story he tells, set in a faceless New Jersey suburb, opens on the first anniversary of his wife's death. True to form, he marks the occasion by starting an impetuous affair with the mother of his teenage son's girlfriend. Soon, both couples are cohabitating in a ramshackle house, living the life of suburban survivalists by forgoing central heating and raising rabbits for dinner. This ersatz paradise provides Jernigan with scant comfort, however, as drugs, booze, teen suicide and sexual abuse intrude on his happy home. Unable to hold on to even the most tenuous thread of his life, he sets off on a nightmarish binge which ends with him institutionalised. What makes Gates's novel so good is not only its unblinking view of the horror and anomie of the American suburb, but also his hero's strangely seductive voice, which manages to be at once bitter and remorseful, funny and deluded. Jernigan's 78 rpm mind is stuck in a groove, forever lunging toward the truth only to skip backwards into a self-absorption that is both epic and comic. Not surprisingly, the novel's most lingering image is one of dissolution, as Jernigan remembers watching his wife's footprints evaporate after she ran from the pool to her drunken death. Some may find Jernigan too cynical to stomach, for this is a book for those who like their antiheroics straight. The House on Mango Street is so short that if you blink you might miss it, which would be a shame because this carefully wrought account of a young girl's coming of age in Hispanic Chicago affords many pleasures. Told in a series of vignettes, many no more than a few hundred words, Sandra Cisneros's first novel manages to convey the rich, sometimes stifling atmosphere of an ethnic neighbourhood, showing with admirable precision how her narrator, Esperanza, finally realises that she must flee Mango Street to survive, but must also keep it alive in her soul if she is to flourish. Cisneros is particularly good at eking volumes out of the smallest of images, such as the way 'dizzy' bees reel drunkenly above a young girl as she enjoys her first kiss. My only complaint is that the author is too frugal with her considerable talents, occasionally granting the pleasures of poetry by denying the consolations of prose. Thulani Davis's heartfelt 1959 is another ethnic coming-of-age story, this one set in the first turbulent days of the American Civil Rights movement. It tells the story of Willie Tarrant, a 12-year-old girl who watches her sleepily segregated Virginia town wake up in a spasm of sit-ins, law-suits and violent confrontations as it tries to come to terms with its racial divide. Davis has composed an evocative picture of a town's growing pains; the device of presenting it through the eyes of a girl as she becomes a woman is particularly apt. Indeed, the best parts of this book deal with Willie's evolving attitudes toward sex, family and her place in a hateful society. Davis is less successful in dealing with book's broader topics, content to let historical worthiness take the place of a more nuanced drama. Still, 1959 provides a welcome view of the public and private tensions at work on African-Americans as they decided to fight the good fight. An altogether different kind of coming-of-age takes place in Theodore Roszak's compulsive page-turner, Flicker. In 1950s LA, young Jonathan Gates goes searching for glimpses of sex at a local arthouse cinema only to discover the work of Max Castle, a forgotten master of early schlock horror movies. Castle becomes Gates' obsession, and his quest for the truth about Castle's genius causes him to discover a secret history of the movies, leading him eventually into fateful contact with a menacingly secretive religious order. The book's mystical elements work less well than the movie lore, in which Roszak brilliantly blends fact with fiction - dinner with Orson Wells and letters from John Huston fuel the plot, leaving us unsure which of the more obscure personalities, films and movie-making techniques are real and which made up. Indeed, this aura of verisimilitude eventually has you wondering if the book's sinister view of moviemaking might not really be true, a feeling of uncertainty which persists even after you turn the last page.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Waldegrave has the right pedigree - Britain's new agriculture minister is a farmer and a conservationist Mr William Waldegrave has the right pedigree to be a good minister of agriculture. First and foremost he is a farmer with a majority share in a 400-hectare specialist dairy enterprise in the Mendip hills. The tenanted farm carries three herds totalling 450 cows and while reports suggest that he does not actually milk them himself, he must be involved in management and knowledgeable about profitability. Secondly, he is the son of a man who was a minister of state for agriculture in a previous Conservative administration. Thirdly, he is a convinced conservationist. Moreover, when he was a minister at the department of the environment a few years ago, he made a speech at the Oxford Farming Conference that appeared to most of his audience to strike an acceptable balance between farming and other increasing demands on the countryside. But his predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, is a hard act to follow. She too was the child of a farming family. She too was able to talk to her agricultural constituency in language they understood. And in her 14 months as minister she persuaded most farmers that she had their best interests at heart without ever straying from government policy on stringent financial control. Mr Waldegrave, however, has made a promising start. At his first press conference after being appointed minister he declared his support for farm tenancy reform. For at least five years it has been accepted across the industry that restrictive laws governing farm tenancies were in need of revision. Moreover, few new tenancies have been established in recent years because of outdated rules on lifetime security of tenure for tenant farmers. Most landowners have avoided such traps by skirting the law and setting up limited life contract agreements instead. In December 1993, after years of debate and negotiation, agreement was finally reached between the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association and the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs on a more flexible type of agreement for new tenancies. All that was needed was parliamentary time to enact the necessary legislation to bring about the changes. Mr Waldegrave gave a commitment that time would be found by the end of this year. A more contentious issue that the minister will have found on his desk is the continuing saga of the future of the Agricultural Wages Board. The board was scheduled to be scrapped in line with government policy on free wage bargaining. But a campaign was launched to save it on the basis that it had historically set reasonable conditions and minimum rates for farm work that had become the baseline for negotiations between workers and employers. Interestingly, supporters of the AWB included employers as well as workers. All recognised that wage bargaining by an individual worker, who might be the only employee on a small farm, needed a statutory framework. A few months ago it appeared likely that the government would give way and allow the AWB to continue. The situation has since been confused, however, by abolition demands from some labour-intensive sectors of agriculture and horticulture and by a call from the farm workers' union for a judicial review against the AWB, claiming that it discriminates against part-time women workers. Mrs Shephard indicated that she would announce her decision on the AWB before the parliamentary recess. Mr Waldegrave says there is no rush and he would like to talk the matter through. A decision has already been made to wind up the Potato Marketing Board following similar action on the Milk Marketing Boards. Potato growers are divided, however, on the size, shape and therefore cost, of a successor body that all agree should commission research and arrange market promotion. A producer poll is being held that could wind up the operations of the present board before it has time to plan for the future. If that turns out to be the case, it will be up to the new minister to decide what, if any, successor body is set up. On wider issues Mr Waldegrave is known to be hostile to the European Union's common agricultural policy because of its inefficiencies and cost, as well as what he sees as its past failure to deliver environmental benefits. It is highly probable that, along with the other EU agriculture ministers, he will have an opportunity to help re-reform it. On the domestic front, however, he will need to address the ever-worsening problem of the food trade gap - the difference in value between the food the UK exports and that which it imports. At present, that gap is some Pounds 6bn per year and rising and many people in food and farming, myself among them, believe that there is an urgent need to create an effective initiative to promote British food to British people. These are just a few of the issues William Waldegrave will find in his in-tray at Maff. And as most other UK farmers gather their grain harvest he will begin the complicated task of familiarising himself with his brief.</p>

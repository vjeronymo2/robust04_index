			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 51-year-old construction worker was killed early Monday when he ran from the  center divider into traffic on westbound Interstate 8 and was struck by a car  and a tractor-trailer, the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> The victim, Johnny Vindiola of El Cajon had just escaped the grasp of CHP  officers when he ran out into traffic just west of the Interstate 805 on-ramp  and tried to get hit, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The CHP received a radio call at 5:18 a.m. that a car was parked in the center  divider, facing the wrong way. When officers arrived, Vindiola was standing  outside his car, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The officers persuaded Vindiola to come to them but, soon after he was grabbed,  Vindiola struggled free and ran out into the early-morning traffic, the  spokesman said. CHP officers said they knew no motive for what they described  as a suicide. The woman driving the car that first hit Vindiola told CHP  officers she tried to avoid hitting him, but he moved in front of her.  </P></p>

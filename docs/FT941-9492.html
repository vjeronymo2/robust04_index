			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Lebanon plan for part-privatisation The Lebanese government yesterday agreed partially to privatise the oil, transport and electricity industries, Reuter reports from Beirut. It is to ask parliament to approve a draft law allowing it to form joint companies with public and private capital to run some of Lebanon's utilities. The government said it wanted private enterprise to share in running the country's two oil refineries, its electrical power generators, public transport and railway services.</p>

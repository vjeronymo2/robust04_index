			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PAIR PUBLISH MAGAZINE ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD  </P> <P> James Crotty and Michael Lane don't wait to return home to spin tales of their  latest travels. In fact, they don't return home at all.  </P> <P> Crotty, Lane and their two cats have been on the road for four years and 85,000  miles publishing a totally mobile magazine: Monk.  </P> <P> They eat, sleep, travel and work in a 26-foot 1986 Fleetwood motor home. A  solar-powered Macintosh computer is mounted on the dashboard. Ads are sold by  Lane, 39, and Crotty, 30, from phone booths. A mailing address described as a  "suite" is actually a 5-inch by 10-inch postage box in Santa Fe, N.M.  </P> <P> What started as a newsletter has turned into a magazine with a circulation of  about 30,000 and a cover price of $2.95 ($3.75 abroad).  </P> <P> "Monk is about life on the road. In each issue we describe the latest segment  of our travels and encounters with the lucky victims of our latest pit stop.  Everyone from dogs to dancers, vision queens to country singers and  occasionally, even real live monks," the two Monks wrote in their seventh  issue, July 28. "We are a gentle tickle in the side of the earnest seeker, the  frazzled housewife and the corporate climber, though we can also be quite  useful. In fact, thousands of readers use our quarterly rag to teach dogs how  to fetch."  </P> <P> Lyrical, philosophical, kind of zany -- that's the kind of thing readers expect  from Monk and its founder-editors, New Age hippies who held down a series of  jobs in San Francisco before they answered the call of the open road.  </P> <P> "We represent a new style of spiritual nomad who is not bound by religious  norms," they say, a kind of "traveling soap opera, flophouse and nunnery all  rolled into one."  </P> <P> Initially, they were fed up with rising rents. But Crotty said the Monks'  odyssey was also a quest for simplicity in their lives and resulted from a  "burning desire to create a life style that was completely mobile."  </P> <P> "That's obviously a dream of a lot of people or mobile homes wouldn't be so  popular. We were just a little more passionate about that than most."  </P> <P> The magazine describes their adventures in a stream-of-consciousness, chatty,  gonzo style. Occasionally, people they encounter contribute articles.  </P> <P> "It's like Charles Kuralt with Jack Kerouac and they pick up Laurel and Hardy  hitchhiking and then go on an adventure," Crotty said.  </P> <P> Follow the Monks to New Mexico, where "it's high, it's clear, it's desert and  it's peyote land." Follow them to the "scene of the crime" -- White Sands  Missile Range, where one of the first nuclear test blasts occurred on July 6,  1945.  </P> <P> Listen as the Monks expound on turbans, China Cola, the benefits of geese in  weeding farms, how Arkansas got its name and "What You Won't Learn Through The  Arkansas Department of Tourism."  </P> <P> The magazine's advertisements offer all-natural sunscreens, herbal toothpaste,  the secret to instant memory, massage tables, Indian-style ceremonial drums and  "The X-rated Bible."  </P> <P> With advertiser and reader support, the Monks break even. Eventually, Lane  hopes to distribute Monk in Europe and to travel overseas. For now, they  explore the United States, changing directions on a whim.  </P> <P> Last winter, they were in Minnesota and chose to go to Mardi Gras in New  Orleans. But the motor home slid off an icy road, and about 30 residents of the  tiny village of Calico Rock, Ark. emerged with shovels. "We almost lost the van  and ourselves," Lane said. "These people all came out and rescued us and helped  us get started. It was touching.  </P> <P> "Being on the road you have to open up to all people. There're a lot of people  traveling like us in vans but they would never have these chance encounters  because they will just stick to certain tourist centers, or what's expected."  </P> <P> As a result, stereotypes crumble along the way.  </P> <P> "In the South we thought they were going to be a bunch of bigoted racist  rednecks, and though that exists, everyone you run into is really open-minded.  Most people everywhere are incredibly friendly," Lane said.  </P> <P> "This is a simple journey that many people have carried out. We just got very  complex about it," Crotty said. "We go to places that are unheralded or to  places that you dare not go with a motor home, and Manhattan fits into the  latter category. Absolutely no motor home magazine will recommend that you go  to Manhattan."  </P> <P> There is a reason, of course. While in Manhattan, the motor home was parked in  a garage. But that didn't prevent thieves from stealing a bicycle from the  Monks, who were last reported more safely ensconced in North Bergen, N.J.  </P></p>

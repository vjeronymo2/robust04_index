			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera has  asserted that, in his country, citizens of Cuban origin are not  persecuted and that there are only controls to prevent illegal  trips to the United States.    Danilo Garcia, president of the Association of Cubans in the  Dominican Republic, said the attempts to leave that country in  fragile boats are a result of the U.S. refusal to grant them a  visa to travel to Florida to join their relatives.    Observers noted that the attempts by Cuban citizens to  travel  illegally to the United States are linked to the favorable  greeting given to those who use those means, in spite of the  serious risk to their lives.</p>

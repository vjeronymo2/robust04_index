			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Hong  Kong opened three days of talks on an investment guarantee pact  in Seoul Wednesday.    The two sides agreed the pact was necessary based on the  growing volume of cross-investments, Foreign Ministry officials  said. South Korea had invested 112 million U.S. dollars in the  British colony as of the end of last June while Hong Kong poured  283 million dollars into Korea.    The negotiations have been approved by both China and  Britain  so that the pact will remain in effect after Hong Kong is  returned to China in July 1997, the officials said.</p>

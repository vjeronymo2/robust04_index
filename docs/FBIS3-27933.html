			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ministry of Finance Customs Bureau staff: </F> "Changes in Japan's Trade Structure and Foreign Direct  Investments"]  <H5>  [Sep 93 pp 21-28] </H5>   [Text] Foreign direct investments have played an  increasingly important role in the international economy since  the latter half of the 1980's. While world trade grew steadily  at an annual rate of 13 percent from 1985 to 1990, foreign  direct investments, showing even greater growth, expanded at an  annual rate of 34 percent. In the midst of these changes in the  world economy, we see the rapid growth of Japanese foreign  direct investments since the Plaza Accord of 1985 as well as  changes in Japan's trade structure.    In view of these changes, the International Research  Section of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] Customs and Tariff  Bureau conducted a survey over a one-year period to address the  following and other questions: 1) how has the expansion of  foreign direct investments changed Japan's trade structure; 2)  what kinds of changes have occurred with respect to Japan's  international air cargo industry along with these other changes;  and 3) what is the status of attempts by Japanese enterprises,  which underlie these changes in the trade structure, to localize  production? Here and in the following (October) issue, we would  like to introduce findings from this survey regarding changes in  Japan's trade structure from the latter half of the 1980's  through 1992.  <H5>  I. Introduction </H5>   During the latter half of the 1980's, Japan's trade  structure  underwent dynamic changes both in terms of imports and exports.  Using figures indicating the volume of trade in terms of  quantity [e.g., number of cars exported] rather than in just  dollar amounts, which is a less accurate measure of volume, we  see that during the first half of the 1980's (specifically, in  1980, 1981 and 1984), with the yen still weak, exports grew at a  two-digit rate. That changed to a single-digit, however, from  1987. In 1992, the rate of growth in exports had fallen to 0.2  percent due to the J-curve effect following the yen's  appreciation and to more higher value added export items (Tables  1 and 2).    For example, in the case of automobiles, which were Japan's  leading export through the 1980's, making up almost 20 percent  of all Japanese exports during that period, exports, as measured  in dollars, continued to grow while the actual number of cars  shipped from Japan fell (from 7.01 million cars in 1986 to 6  million in 1992), indicating that the growth in exports was due  to price factors rather than to a change in the number of cars  being exported.    Again, along with a growth in foreign direct investments by  Japan's enterprises, growth in export parts (for example,  semiconductor and electronic parts, car parts and engines),  which were hard to secure in the countries where Japanese  enterprises had set up their branch operations, became a  characteristic of the export trade during the latter half of the  1980's (Table 3).

Specifically, from the latter half of  the 1980's, clothing, office machinery (such as computers),  semiconductors and electronic parts (such as integrated  circuits) and audio-video equipment (color televisions, VTR's)  have all shown significant increases (Table 4).    The decline in the volume of manufactured imported products  in 1992 was due to a decline in luxury items such as cars, gold,  diamonds and paintings as well as in steel and nonferrous metals  (aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper and copper alloys), the  result of the bubble economy's collapse and the domestic  economy's entering an adjustment phase. Where local production  by Japanese enterprises had progressed--in apparel, office  equipment, semiconductors and electronic parts, and audio and  video equipment--imports continued to increase.    Behind such changes in the trade structure, we can find the  influence of the yen's sharp rise in value following the Plaza  Accord of 1985. The yen's appreciation lowered import prices  (calculated on the basis of the yen) and weakened the ability of  domestically manufactured goods to remain price-competitive. In  order to respond to the yen's sharp rise and deal with trade  problems, however, Japanese enterprises aggressively engaged in  foreign direct investments and succeeded in transferring their  production bases overseas.    As a result, re-imported products--for the most part mass  market consumer products--penetrated the domestic market while  exports, in order to keep the work force employed at home,  centered on high value added items that could not be produced at  overseas plants, thus creating specialization, or an  international division of labor, in the production of  manufactured goods. In the future, too, domestic and foreign  economic trends permitting, Japanese enterprises are expected to  expand their overseas operations even further, just as they have  since the latter half of the 1980's, as long as yen continues  its upward climb.

A  larger share of all foreign direct investments during the latter  half of the 1980's was going to Asia, reflecting the importance  placed on this region in the corporate strategies of Japanese  enterprises. While we can gather from their profits that  Japanese-owned enterprises engaged in local production in Europe  and the United States are having a hard time, operations in Asia  are proceeding smoothly, comparatively speaking, and in the  future, we can expect the relative importance of this region for  Japanese enterprises to increase even further.    Wide variations exist among different industries when it  comes to local production. The picture, however, in terms of  changes in trade structure due to foreign direct investments,  when considered on an industry by industry basis (here, the  automobile, consumer appliance and electronics, apparel, and  steel industries will be considered), indicates that in each of  these industries, manufacturers are exporting high value added  products. On the other hand, the trend in imports is toward mass  distribution consumer products. Thus, we can see that, in terms  of exports and imports, an international division of labor, or  "segregation of niche" [sumiwake] is developing.    During the latter half of the 1980's, a large wave of  foreign  direct investments was developing, even on an international  scale, (with investments going from advanced countries to other  advanced countries and from advanced countries to developing  nations), and as a result, there has been a shift in the world's  trade structure, including Japan's, from vertical to horizontal  trade. This shift can be understood in terms of changes in the  index of intra-industry trade (ITT), an indicator of the degree  to which horizontal (intra-industry) trade has developed. Not  only has Asia, a region actively receiving direct investments  from advanced nations, including Japan, seen a brisk, quickening  of trade, close trading ties within the region are developing as  domestic demand among Asian countries expands. Changes in  Japan's trade structure and in its regional ties can also be  seen from the perspective of Japan's international air cargo.  <H5>  II. Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct Investments </H5>   1. General Remarks    From the end of the 1980's into the 1990's, foreign direct  investments by Japanese enterprises have increased dramatically  as companies have embarked on plans to transfer their domestic  production bases overseas. This move has been in response to a  downturn in the profitability of exports due to the yen's steep  rise following the 1985 Plaza Accord and in response to  voluntary export restrictions and worsening trade relations of  the kind seen in anti-dumping suits (Table 5).    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 5.

Although investments  have dropped since 1990 for various reasons--the increasingly  unpredictable nature of market trends due to a global slump, the  difficulty of raising corporate funds following the collapse of  Japan's bubble economy, and the completion of a round of plans  by Japanese companies to build overseas production bases--the  level of investments, in 1992 amounting to $10.1 million, still  remains high when compared to the early half of the 1980's when  investments were at around the $3 billion level. (It should be  noted that, after an initial period of investments in local  production, additional funds for plant facilities are often  raised by companies in the country where those facilities are  located and the connection between direct investments from Japan  and the further development of local production becomes weaker.)    In considering regional changes in Japan's foreign direct  investments, we see that North America was Japan's principal  target for investors, their reasons for investing in this region  being to maintain and expand their market shares and to develop  new markets; additionally, investors have been motivated by the  desire to avoid trade problems. As can be seen in responses to  the questionnaire given to Japanese enterprises on their reasons  for branching out overseas (Table 6), oftentimes the motive, in  the case of North America and Europe was to cope with trade  restrictions set up by their trading partners. In 1988, 67  percent of [Japan's] foreign direct investments went to North  America, but that figure has since dropped, falling to 42  percent in 1992. Among the reasons for this decline are the  business slump in the United States and the fact that Japanese  enterprises have just finished a round of large-scale production  projects (Table 7).    Europe's share of foreign direct investments, about 10  percent, was relatively low until 1988, but with the economic  unification of the European Community (EC) slated for 1992,  Japanese-owned enterprises, believing they should try to gain  "insider status," hurriedly began to move into the region from  the latter half of the 1980's, bringing EC's share of Japanese  investments to 30 percent in 1990. Because of the business slump  in Europe, particularly in England, which receives from  one-third to one-fourth of the direct investments from Japan  (Table 7), less money is being invested in the area, and  Europe's share dropped to 21 percent in 1992.    Ideally, there are two routes companies can take when moving  into advanced market countries (i.e., North America and Europe):  they can either set up their own production bases there through  foreign direct investments (local production) or they can base  their production on tie-ups with [local] enterprises (establish  mutually complementary production relationships, OEM [original  equipment manufacturer] tie-ups, technical tie-ups, or joint  development). In recent years, rather than through foreign  direct investments, more weight has been given to the latter  route; namely, cooperative dealings between companies and joint  technical development based on strategic tie-ups with foreign  enterprises. As a result, Japanese companies have been placing  less importance on foreign direct investments.    Asia, with its abundance of cheap labor, on the other hand,  has been designated a production base for Japanese-owned  enterprises and since 1988, has steadily been receiving a larger  share of Japan's foreign direct investments. In 1992, this share  reached an all time high of 31 percent. But even within the same  region, interest has been shifting since 1990 from ASEAN  [Association of Southeast Asian Nation] member countries to  China. Thus, it seems that in recent years, Japan's foreign  direct investments have been shifting from North America and  Europe to Asia.    Table 6.

Regional Trends in Japanese Foreign Direct  Investments and the Earnings Situation of Japanese-Owned  Enterprises    If we consider regional trends in foreign direct investments  in terms of profits, we see that, according to a questionnaire  survey (on the overseas business activities of Japanese  companies), which was conducted by the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI], current profit-to-sales ratios for  companies in North America and Europe are low and, in some  cases, companies are even coming out with negative profit  ratios. In Asia, on the other hand, current profit ratios for  Japanese-owned companies are relatively high (Table 8).    Table 8.

The following are  among the factors thought to be responsible:    (1) North America was hit by a business recession during  the start up period for large scale projects    (2) In order to manufacture high quality goods on a scale  beyond a certain level, Japanese companies that have gone to  North America often have capital-intensive facilities and,  during their start-up period, have high depreciation costs and  are also burdened by heavy interest payments.    Again, local sales ratios for Japanese-owned enterprises in  North America are about 90 percent, and presumably having  invested in order to secure a share of the local market, they  may be sacrificing profits to a certain extent when they make  their investments (Table 9.1).

As  in the case of North America, many of the companies branching  out into Europe were doing so in response to trade problems  related to automobiles and scientific and optical equipment such  as duplicators and copying machines; but, for the most part, as  concern grew about the "fortification of Europe" with the  approaching unification of the EC in 1992, companies beat a  hasty path to this region during the closing years of the 1980's  in order to gain insider status so they could secure a piece of  the European market.    Over 90 percent of the sales of locally produced goods in  Europe comes from local markets. As in the case of the United  States, Europe is not a manufacturing base for exports to  countries, including Japan, that are outside of the region  (Table 9.2)    Table 9.2. Changes in Percent of Products Sold in Local Markets by  Overseas Japanese Enterprises: Europe (Unit: percent)                  1986      1987      1988      1989      1990      1991   Products for   95.9      95.9      94.4      95.6      96.1      93.9  local  markets   Exports for    4.1       5.6       4.4       3.9       3.9       6.1  non-local  markets   Exports for    1.2       1.5       1.7       1.7       1.2       1.9  Japanese  markets      Asia    Not only are current profit-to-sales ratios higher in Asia  than in North America and Europe, in 1990 and 1991, they were  even higher than those of domestic enterprises. This is probably  due to attempts to develop production networks there and to set  the region up as a manufacturing base for exports to third-party  countries outside of the region (such as the United States,  Europe and Japan). In this respect, the region presents the  following advantages:    (1) Labor costs in Asia are much cheaper than in  economically more advanced countries    (2) Many of the manufacturers that have gone to Asia are  labor-intensive, and depreciation costs and interest payment  burdens are low.    The market for products made by Japanese-owned enterprises  in  Asia differs very much from those of Japanese companies in North  America and Europe: local sales make up no more than slightly  over half of all sales for Japanese companies in Asia, while  exports to other countries outside the region, including Japan,  make up a little under one-half (Table 9.3).    Table 9.3. Changes in Percent of Products Sold in Local Markets by  Overseas Japanese Companies: Asia (Unit: percent)                  1986      1987      1988      1989      1990      1991   Products for   54.7      59.1      59.8      63.9      59.6      54.5  local  markets   Exports for    45.3      41.0      40.2      36.1      40.4      45.5  non-local  markets   Exports for    15.8      16.7      13.7      15.8      11.8      15.5  Japanese  market      Demand in Asia, considered the "world center of growth," is  expected to expand even further in the future, and foreign  companies, which were drawn to the area at first as a  manufacturing base for exports to countries outside of the  region (so-called roundabout exports) will probably be drawn  increasingly to the area for its own markets.    However, even within this "world center of growth," regional  differences of the type mentioned below are likely to occur, and  this diversity should be kept in mind.    During the second half of the 1980's, Asia's newly  developing  economies [NIE's], which received foreign direct investments  from Japan, all similarly underwent rapid growth. The 1990's,  however, find Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore in  different political and economic environments. In other words,  the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong are in the process of  merging with the economy of China, which has seen remarkable  growth through the foreign direct investments of overseas  Chinese merchants. Singapore's aim is to develop  knowledge-intensive industries such as service industries and  banking and financial services. On the other hand, Korea is  shifting its emphasis from heavy and chemical industries (for  example, steel and shipbuilding) to high-tech fields such as the  semiconductor and computer industries.    From the end of the 1980's, wages in Asian newly  industrializing economies soared, off-setting the advantages of  local production originally undertaken because of their low  wages. As a result, Japanese foreign direct investments were  then targeted to ASEAN member countries, which became production  bases for Japanese manufacturers, especially in the consumer  appliance and electronics industries for products like air  conditioners and VTR's. Wages in ASEAN countries have risen  sharply, however, since 1991, and manufacturers are encountering  such bottlenecks as inadequate infrastructure provisions and  difficulties securing engineers and other personnel (these  countries are having the same problem that Japan has had in  filling undesirable, so-called 3K positions [jobs considered  dangerous, difficult and dirty]. At present, ASEAN nations are  undergoing an adjustment phase in their progress toward  industrialization.    On the other hand, though Japanese direct investments in  China have been low-pitched due to the Tianamen Square incident  (June 1989) and to economic adjustment policies, the attention  of Japanese enterprises at present seem to be focussing on  China. This is due to such factors since 1991 as: (a) the  deteriorating investment environment in ASEAN countries and the  rapid emergence of China, with its conspicuously lower wages, as  a local production base for Japanese enterprises; (b) the fact  that, despite concerns about post-Deng Xiaoping political risks,  China is promoting reform and a policy of openness; and (c) the  expectation that domestic demand will expand, given China's  population of 1.1 billion and its huge, potential market.  <H5>  [Oct 93 pp 15-29] </H5>   [Excerpts] In the first installment of "Changes in  Japan's Trade Structure and Foreign Direct Investments"  (September 1993), we noted that significant changes had occurred  in Japan's trade structure due to increased foreign direct  investments during the latter half of the 1980's, including a  growth in locally manufactured re-import items. Particularly  noted was the growing importance of Asia as an overseas  production base. To understand in greater detail (i.e., in micro  terms) changes in our trade structure given the macro trends  described earlier, we will look at these changes and trends in  our foreign direct investments on an industry by industry basis.  Since foreign direct investments increased during the latter  half of the 1980's on a global scale, we will take a global  perspective in considering these structural changes and  trends.  <H3>  III. Changes in Trade Structure and Foreign Direct  Investments as Seen in Different Industries </H3>   With regard to exports, a look at changes in trade structure  and foreign direct investments as they apply to the different  industries (automobiles, consumer appliances and electronics,  apparel, and steel) generally indicates that, in each of these  industries, there has been a furthering of local production  through foreign direct investments (Table 11). However, because  of difficulties in locally obtaining parts due to the weakness  of supporting industries, Japan is also exporting more parts  and, at the same time, is substituting among some of its exports  finished goods (non-specialty items intended for the general  market) that have been based on local production.

In the apparel and consumer  appliance and electronics industries, where local production has  been undertaken primarily to take advantage of low-waged, local  labor, there has been a steady growth in reimports from Asia  that have been locally produced. The situation in the steel  industry, where local production has been undertaken primarily  as a way of dealing with trade frictions, however, does not  indicate any growth in reimports based on foreign direct  investments.    1. Auto Industry    The auto industry started moving its operations overseas  from  the early half of the 1980's, beginning with North America.  Initially acting in response to voluntary export restrictions,  the industry speeded this process up from 1985, when the yen  suddenly gained in value. Local production in Europe started  from the latter half of the 1980's in response to trade problems  between the United States and Japan and grew out of the desire  by Japanese auto makers to gain insider status in light of EC's  pending economic unification Table 12).

The number of re-exported cars in  1992 was 26,000, or about 14 percent of Japan's imported car  market (of 181,000 cars).    The market for passenger cars in Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN  countries, excluding Borneo) is not as large as it is in  advanced countries (in 1992, 1.448 million cars were sold in  Asia), but as motorization progresses, Japanese-owned  enterprises are expected to put more effort into strengthening  local production.    A sharp growth in the export of parts, including car parts  and engines, has accompanied the development of local production  bases in regions throughout the world (Table 13).    To take the export of passenger cars to the United States as  an example, we see that, in 1986, 2.348 million cars were  exported [to the United States], as compared to 508,000 cars  that were locally produced. In 1992, however, the number of  exported cars fell to 1.584 million while the figure for locally  produced cars rose to 1.416 million cars, indicating that  exports from Japan are being replaced by local production. The  same trend appears in the EC market. Though the car market has  been in a slump, operations have begun at plants built through  Japanese direct investments, and the figures for 1992 show a  decline in the number of passenger cars being exported from  Japan.

Consumer Appliance and Electronics Industries    The consumer appliance and electronics industries set up  branch operations in North America, Europe and Asia from a  relatively early date. Moving into North America and Europe in  response to trade problems, these industries are eyeing local  sales in these two regions. In Asia, particularly the ASEAN  countries, the aim has been to set up export supply  bases--production bases from which to export products to North  America and Europe--rather than local sales (Table 14).

Thus, along with active  local production in Asia, there has been a growth in exports to  the region of semiconductors and electronic parts (primarily  used for assembling consumer appliances and electronic  equipment), which are hard to secure locally (Table 15).

Thus,  since 1990, we see the volume of re-imports from these countries  in terms of the consumer electronics industry rapidly  approaching the volume of re-imports from Asian NIE's. In  looking for the factors behind this remarkable progress in ASEAN  member-countries, we should point out that Japanese enterprises  had to transfer their operations to Korea and the other newly  industrialized economies of Asia gradually while, at the same  time, adjusting their production process to existing local  industries; in the ASEAN case, however, the entire process could  be transferred from Japan in one piece, thus making it easier to  introduce the latest technology more effectively (Tables 16 and  17).

Within  China, durable consumer goods like refrigerators, washing  machines and television sets--consumer products that are  becoming part of the necessities of daily life--are coming into  general use, and manufacturers are anticipating growth in the  durable consumer market and products like air conditioners and  audio-video equipment along with a rise in China's standard of  living.    3. Apparel Industry    The apparel industry is labor-intensive, and because it  became less profitable to export apparel from Japan when the yen  gained strength following the Plaza Accord, Japanese enterprises  have gone about aggressively setting up local production  facilities in Asia in order to utilize the region's relatively  cheap labor (Table 18). China, where labor costs are especially  cheap, has emerged as an important production base for mass  market apparel. At the present time, however, technical  standards for cloth and dying and quality control are still  inadequate, and quality control is being handled in Japan. Cut  cloth is then exported and sewn and assembled locally. Thus,  there has developed a form of specialization or division of  labor.    Statistical data clearly show changes of this kind with  regard to Japan's import partners. Until 1990, Korea was the  apparel industries number one importer; then, from 1991, when  wages went up and Korea lost its price-competitiveness, China  assumed that head position (Table 19).    While inexpensive (mass market) apparel is being imported  from Asia, domestic apparel makers are manufacturing expensive  items (high value added items whose selling point is superior  design), which cannot be produced overseas, and are thus  creating a division of labor in terms of imported items and  domestically manufactured items.

Steel Industry    In addition to being one of the items subject to managed  trade and to voluntary export restrictions, steel exports have  dropped in volume (quantitatively) because they have become less  price-competitive following the yen's appreciation after the  Plaza Accord. However, the total dollar amount of steel exports  has shown very little change, and proportionally more high value  added items are being exported Table 20). Specifically, while  high value added export items like surface treated steel  sheeting (for use in auto bodies and treated to prevent  corrosion) and special steel materials exports are increasing,  the export of low value added products like hot rolled steel and  bar iron is decreasing (Table 21).    On the other hand, the trend seems to be toward a steady  growth in imports from Taiwan and Korea, both in terms of  quantitative and cash volume. (In 1992, however, there was a  large drop in import volume because the domestic economy was  entering an adjustment phase.) Types of steel materials being  imported are for the most part low value added products like pig  iron, semi-finished steel ingot products and hot rolled steel  sheets (Table 22). A comparison of unit prices for imports and  exports indicates that the latter is about twice that for  imports, indicating the development of a "segregation of niche"  (Table 20).    In the United States, where the steel industry's primary  overseas expansion has occurred, Japanese steel makers,  responding to concerns about U.S.-Japan trade friction, began by  providing U.S. manufacturers with technical assistance and, at  present, are undertaking production in the form of mergers with  U.S. steel manufacturers. This does not mean, however, that  re-imported steel from the United States has increased; rather  products manufactured in the United States are being sold on  the local market. Japanese steel makers have also provided  technical cooperation to developing nations, and as the  technical level in those countries improves, inexpensive steel  will probably start being exported to Japan in earnest (Table  23.)

Changes in Trade Structure as Seen From the Perspective  of International Air Cargo </H3>   From the latter half of the 1980's, a structural change has  been occurring in Japanese industries, with a move away from  large-scale and heavy industries (e.g., steel and shipbuilding),  where there has been declining price competitiveness, toward  high value added light industries (semiconductors and electronic  parts, office equipment, scientific and optical equipment, and  video equipment). Also, with the transfer of production bases  overseas, there has been an increase in the transport of  materials and assembly parts as well as maintenance parts to  service equipment and machinery. In order to meet delivery  deadlines, air cargo services are being utilized. Moreover,  along with the global development of horizontal trade  (intra-industry trade), Japan's volume of high value added  import products has also increased.    Through these changes, there has been a shift (particularly  noticeable with exports) from surface freight to air cargo in  terms of international distribution. This shift can be traced,  using as our indicator the ratio of air cargo export volume to  total export volume. In terms of the dollar-valued amount of  this air cargo, too, we can see that, regionally, there has been  a deepening of economic ties with Asia (Asian NIE's and ASEAN  countries) where Japanese enterprises have established  production bases.    1. Increasing Ratio of Air Cargo    Because there has been a shift in Japan's export structure  toward high value added industries and, along with foreign  direct investments by Japanese enterprises, an increase in  exported parts from Japan, there has also been a steady growth  in exports shipped as air cargo. Specifically, 1970 figures  indicate a 4.1 percent growth in the dollar-valued ratio of air  cargo exports to total exports and a 0.2 percent increase in  tonnage. By 1992, these ratios had climbed to 15.8 percent and  0.7 percent, respectively (Table 27).    With an increasing volume of high value added imports like  diamonds, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors and electronic  parts and office equipment, there has also been a growth in air  cargo on the import front. In 1970, the dollar-valued ratio of  air cargo imports to total imports rose by 7.9 percent and, in  terms of tonnage, by 0.01 percent. By 1992, these figures had  grown to 21.1 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively. The  percentages are low when considering tonnage, but that is  because heavy raw materials and resources like crude oil and  liquified natural gas make up a large percentage of Japan's  import structure (Table 28).    Carriage rates for air cargo are about ten times that for  sea  freight, so during recessions, companies will send via sea  rather than air in order to cut down on their operating expenses  (in other words, in the short term, the ratio of air-to-sea for  international delivery will be influenced by economic trends).  Since 1991, when Japan's economy entered an adjustment phase,  companies have been increasingly conscious of the mounting  distribution costs associated with just-in-time (JIT)  deliveries--an accommodation to the small volume, diversified  product approach taken by manufacturers in recent years--and the  pressure these costs are placing on profits. In terms of both  exports and imports, then, there has been a tendency toward  stagnant or falling growth rates in air cargo and, in fact, for  two years straight--from 1991 through 1992--the dollar amount of  air cargo imports fell in absolute terms. From the beginning of  1993, however, the volume of air cargo imports (in dollars)  appears to be rising.    In terms of predominant trends, we can expect Japan's  manufactured exports to shift toward high value added products.  If there is a cut in air cargo rates due to a buildup of air  cargo carrier capacity, we should be able to see a clear upward  trend in air cargo ratios as the domestic economy improves.    Table 27.

Regional Trends in Air Cargo    Exports    Of the $11.02 billion in exports shipped as air cargo in  1980, the largest dollar amount went to the United States (29.4  percent), followed by $2.67 billion to the EC (24.2 percent)  and $2.63 billion to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries (23.9  percent). In 1992, the total volume of air cargo exports  amounted to $53.8 billion, or about 4.9 times the amount in  1980. By region, exports to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries  amounted to $18.84 billion (35.0 percent). This 7.2-fold  increase over 1980 is due to an increase in exported parts to  Asia, where Japanese enterprises are furthering local  production, and to an increased demand in recent years for  Japanese office equipment. Exports to Asia were more than the  amount, $17.68 billion (35 percent) that went to the United  States, showing the close economic ties that now exist between  Asia and Japan (Table 29).    Imports    The largest percentage of all import from 1980 to 1992  consistently came from the United States. EC's share has also  increased significantly since 1986, but with the collapse of  Japan's bubble economy and a sudden drop in luxury items  (paintings, diamonds, etc.), import figures have been falling  since 1991. Increased local production by Japanese enterprises  since the latter half of the 1980's led to steady increases in  imports from Asian NIE's and ASEAN member-countries in 1991 and  1992. This increase was primarily in re-imported items such as  office equipment and semiconductor and electronic parts. Looking  at import trends in absolute dollar amounts [rather than  percentage shares], we see that imports from the United States  and EC countries declined in 1991 and 1992 while increasing  steadily with regard to Asian NIE's and ASEAN countries, thus  showing the development along the import front of horizontal  trade between Japan's economy and these Asian countries (Table  30).

Summary </H5>   Behind the sharp rise in Japanese foreign direct investments  and the furthering of local production by Japanese enterprises,  we can see, as major factors, their response to trade friction  and the steep rise in the yen's value during the latter half of  the 1980's. As overseas production began, Japan's trade  structure also began to undergo significant changes as the  production of manufactured goods which had lost their  price-competitiveness shifted from domestic industries to  overseas bases. Trend has caused concern about the "hollowing  out" of some of Japan's industries at home. A detailed  examination of trends within specific industries, however, shows  an aggressive effort by Japanese enterprises to shift domestic  production in the direction of high value added manufactured  items that do not have to be price-competitive. For example, in  the textile and home electronics industries, high quality items  (high value added products) are exported after being produced at  home, while mass market items (low value added products) are  re-imported to Japan after being made at Japanese-owned  production plants in developing countries where labor costs are  low. This kind of "segregation of niche," we can see, is  developing.    Future exchange rates will be a factor, of course, but in  general, we need not assume that particular industries will lose  their competitive edge in every item they produced (from low and  intermediate quality items to high quality items) or that there  will be a complete hollowing out of those industries. Rather,  the trend seems to be toward a greater differentiation of roles  in the production field, with domestic industries specializing  in high value added, high tech products through the development  of innovative technology.    While the furthering of local production by Japanese  enterprises is inescapable, the course will not necessarily be  smooth sailing. It holds out many difficulties, not only in  terms of production and production management technology but  also in the "soft" sciences of labor and business management. In  North America and Europe, where Japanese enterprises were  initially motivated to move primarily in order to avoid trade  problems, companies are having a tough time in terms of profits,  and the situation and future direction of local production there  warrants careful attention. In Asia, on the other hand,  companies were motivate by the sound economic desire to seek  cheap labor and are seeing satisfactory profits. At present,  North America remains the most important region for Japan in  terms of local production; but it seems only natural that, with  the growing, future potential of the Asian market, Japanese  enterprises will be embarking on overseas corporate strategies  that stress the importance of Asia. Designating Asia as a  production base not only means a production base for exports but  also signifies Asia's transformation into a production base  targeting local sales as regional demand expands.</p>

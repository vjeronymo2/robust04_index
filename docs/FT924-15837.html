			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Vauxhall extends car price reductions VAUXHALL is extending its campaign to reduce car list prices with cuts of up to Pounds 1,188 on its Cavalier, Calibra and Senator ranges, Kevin Done writes. At the same time, it is reducing its dealer margins from 17.5 per cent to 10 per cent - so customers are unlikely to see any cut in prices. The move reduces the scope for discounting by dealers. Vauxhall claimed that the parallel reductions in list prices and dealer margins had reduced 'the haggle factor disliked by customers'.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Ingham as teaching aid rejected A SUGGESTION that all new civil servants should be issued with a copy of Sir Bernard Ingham's memoirs to learn how to 'stitch up elected ministers at the request of the prime minister' was greeted with derision yesterday by Mr Tim Renton, the Civil Service minister. Mr Tony Banks, (Lab, Newham NW), had said Kill the Messenger, Sir Bernard's account of 11 years as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press secretary, would make an effective teaching aid at the Civil Service College. Earlier Mr Renton rejected a call by Mr Max Madden (Lab Bradford West) for a new inquiry into the Westland affair. In his book Sir Bernard denies that he authorised a leak from the department of trade and industry of a letter from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the then Solicitor General, referring to Mr Michael Heseltine's conduct throughout the affair.

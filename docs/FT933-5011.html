			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / How the wealth of nations changes One advantage possessed by economic analysts at the heart of the US, well away from the short-term preoccupations of Washington and New York, is that they have more incentive to study underlying processes. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis takes advantage of its situation to do just this; and it devotes the spring 1993 issue of its Quarterly Review to a study of changes in the wealth of nations*. The slogan of the growing gap between rich and poor nations has been with us for a long time. But the analysis in the review suggests that it is a highly misleading one. After carefully inspecting standard international data for the period 1960-85 it concludes that there is indeed a huge disparity in the performance output of different countries. The five countries in 1985 with the highest per capita real GNP had output 29 times as high as the five with the lowest real GNP. For comparison, the per capita output of the most prosperous US state, Connecticut, was only twice as high as the poorest, which was Mississippi. On the other hand the disparity in output between the least and the most productive workers in the US, as in most other western countries, was almost as great as that between rich and poor nations. (Relative productivity is here measured by pay differentials, which would enrage some egalitarians.) On the other hand there was no tendency for the international gap either to grow or to shrink. Measured in terms of relative GNP per capita, the gap was much the same in 1985 as in 1960. But this does not mean that countries were frozen in their relative positions. On the contrary, there were big changes in the identity of those at the top and bottom of the world distribution. There are of course well-known difficulties in taking relative GNP figures as indices of living standards. It is doubtful if a city dweller in the US could physically exist on an income one twenty-ninth of the national average. But, for all their failings, the GNP estimates provide at least a starting point for analysing international differences. The table shows some of the main development 'miracles' and 'disasters'. It is based on the relative wealth of each country, defined as the ratio of its GNP per head to that of the US. The Federal Reserve authors go on to define what they call the 'factor change' as the ratio of relative wealth in 1985 to that in 1960. At the head of the miracle countries comes Saudi Arabia, whose relative wealth has risen by a factor of more than three. One only has to utter the word 'oil' and pass on. Next in the list is Lesotho in south-east Africa, which had an enormous growth opportunity, as in 1960 it figured as the poorest country in the world. The Congo is another surprising miracle case which must have started from a pretty low base. These examples show the snags that exist even in the most sophisticated of international league tables. The other miracle countries are more predictable: Japan and some of the south-east Asian 'tigers', plus Egypt and Syria. Among the development disasters where relative wealth fell was Zambia, which fell by a factor of more than two and a half. Sadly it is followed in the disaster league mostly by other African countries. The two non-African basket cases are Nicaragua and Afghanistan - both ravaged by civil war. There are no prizes for guessing which part of Europe might have graduated to disaster status if the tables could have been extended to 1993. Explanations of these relative wealth changes are inevitably more speculative. The authors show once again that mechanistic models based on amounts of standardised labour and capital used do not explain comparative performance. The unexplained residual has often been attributed without adequate evidence to human capital, which is natural enough for writers working in higher education. But the Minnesota authors are unconvinced and suggest the missing factor is one that they call business capital. This is not the same as physical investment, but is some mixture of entrepreneurship and organisational skill. The Minnesota attempts to model this factor as a kind of inverse of taxes on profit and capital is less convincing and is carried out in terms of abstract algebra rather than examination of actual data. Why do US economists have to downgrade history, culture and plain luck in an exaggerated attempt to be useful policy advisers? But for all its imperfections, the Minnesota Review analysis is a big advance on the typical muddle-headed condemnation of the west for the poverty of the poorer countries or for the conventional guilt-ridden responses. *Research Dept, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, PO Box 291, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55480-0291  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              DEVELOPMENT MIRACLES AND DISASTERS, 1960-85  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Increases in relative wealth        Decreases in relative wealth Country        Factor change        Country        Factor change Saudi Arabia            3.32        Zambia                  2.63 Lesotho                 3.19        Mozambique              2.63 Taiwan                  2.60        Madagascar              2.50 Hong Kong               2.59        Angola                  2.38 South Korea             2.40        Chad                    2.13 Egypt                   2.38        Liberia                 2.04 Congo                   2.18        Ghana                   2.00 Japan                   2.10        Zaire                   1.96 Singapore               2.09        Nicaragua               1.85 Syria                   1.89        Afghanistan             1.75  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

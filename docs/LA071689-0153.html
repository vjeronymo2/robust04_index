			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BANNING BEATS CARSON IN GRID-HOOPS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> It took a lot of effort and more time than Banning football Coach Joe Dominguez  would have prefered, but his Pilots finally prevailed with a 3-2 championship  victory over rival Carson in the El Camino Grid and Hoops festival.  </P> <P> Carson forced a second game of the 7-on-7 passing competition with a 6-5 win in  the first championship game, but an hour later, on the last play of the second  game, Banning quarterback John Ma'ae hit Travis Davis with a seven-yard score  to give the Pilots a 3-2 victory.  </P> <P> "Mainly, it was a matter of the coach calling the right plays at the right  time," said Davis, who had four touchdown catches in the two games against  Carson. "I was working to get open and they were covering me pretty good, but I  got in the hole a couple of times."  </P> <P> Carson scored first when quarterback Armon Youngblood hooked up with Rashal  Lotario on a 14-yard touchdown, and Bobby Perkins' 40-yard interception return  gave the Colts a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Banning cut into the lead when Ma'ae connected with Davis from the 14, and tied  the contest when Ma'ae returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Both teams' offenses sputtered until Banning started the game-winning drive  with four minutes remaining.  </P> <P> "Ma'ae was a little sluggish on offense, so one of the coaches suggested we put  him on defense to see if we could perk him up," Dominguez said. "And sure  enough, boom, he picks off that interception and turns the offense right  around."  </P> <P> Ironically, Carson also forced the second championship game with a touchdown on  the last play of regulation when Youngblood hit Lotario from 17 yards out.  </P> <P> Tydus Winans, who had four touchdown catches in the contest, gave the Colts the  lead on the first play of the game when he grabbed a Youngblood pass on the 20  and outran the defenders into the end zone. Carson scored again five plays  later when Kenny Lincoln intercepted Ma'ae's pass at the one and ran it all the  way back.  </P> <P> Michael James caught touchdown passes of 29 and five yards, and Ma'ae and Davis  teamed up to give the Pilots a 3-2 lead from one yard out.  </P> <P> Winans scored, Banning's Davis scored and Winans scored twice more for a 5-4  Carson advantage.  </P> <P> Banning's two-minute drive resulted in a game-tying James touchdown from 23  yards out, but Carson got the ball back with 4:30 remaining.  </P> <P> Winans caught an 18-yard pass to the 12 and one play later, Lotario hauled in  the winning score.  </P> <P> Because Banning beat Carson in the semifinals, the Colts had to play West  Torrance before getting another shot at the Pilots.  </P></p>

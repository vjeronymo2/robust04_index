			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The Slovak National  Party (SNS) said today the statements by Gyula Horn, leader of  the Hungarian Socialists who won the parliamentary elections,  about chances to settle Slovak-Hungarian relations and to  conclude a basic interstate treaty were inadmissible. The  statement said that Horn's statement that Hungary would seek the  renovation of friendly relations with Slovakia, Romania and  Yugoslavia in exchange for guarantees for the rights of the  three million ethnic Hungarians living there were dangerous for  Slovakia and can be considered intervention in its internal  affairs.    Now in the opposition, the SNS was a coalition partner of  Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  until mid-March when the coalition government was dismissed.  The SNS has 9 out of a total of 150 seats in parliament. "It is  unacceptable for Slovakia that Hungarian politicians demand  administrative autonomy for their ethnic minority," the  statement stressed in reaction to Horn's words that he was going  to satisfy Bratislava's demand for the confirmation of the  existing border only at the cost of "autonomous rights" for  minorities.    Slovakia has been pushing for the confirmation of the border  which was determined after World War One and which has been  doubted recently by certain forces in Hungary. Some 560,000  ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, mainly in the south,  constituting about 11 per cent of its population. The SNS  pointed to the status of ethnic minorities in Hungary which  "cannot have their own political party and representation in the  parliament." Two ethnic Hungarians's political entities are  represented in the Slovak Parliament: the Egyutteles movement  (9 parliamentary seats) and the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement (MKDH, 5 seats). The statement said that  Hungarian-Slovak relations which have been tense over ethnic  minorities would probably become even "more stormy" following  the victory of Horn's Socialists in Hungary.</p>

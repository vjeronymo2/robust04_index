			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Little Rock setsits sights on a large future: Arkansans are already relishing the benefits they expect a Clinton victory to bring IN LITTLE ROCK'S sprawling, graceless downtown area, a few jutting skyscrapers attest to the ambition of the state of which it is capital, Arkansas. Here the most ambitious Arkansan of them all, Governor Bill Clinton, will sleep most of today to prepare for tonight's 10-party celebration climaxing his race for the US presidency. The state, one of the country's poorest, has seen nothing like today - or, indeed, the past five months of the presidential campaign. Arkansas has never had a presidential contender, although local historians have dredged up the memory of one senator who adorned President Franklin D Roosevelt's inner circle. 'Arkansas is ready, America.' This is the assertion inscribed on the press kits - assembled for the 4,000 journalists expected here tonight  - complete with maps, tour listings, brochures for local attractions, contact lists and ideas for articles. Campaign headquarters is also ready, functioning 'like a well-oiled machine', according to Mr Marc Ginsberg, deputy press secretary. Elaborate get-out-the-vote measures are under way, but last-minute nervousness about a Bush surge has dissipated. While Little Rock, capital of 'the Natural State', lacks the charm of the Old South, it also lacks its torpor. The natives are feverishly preparing for the gathering hordes of Clinton friends, media, and visiting dignitaries. Among the latter is a delegation from the Argentine government, come 'to show our support for Clinton'. The city was the first in the US to fight Washington-imposed school integration in the 1950s. Today, it has a governor who has vowed to heal the racial hatreds his opponents have long exploited. The Arkansas air is almost balmy this week; the pansies still bloom. At the Excelsior Hotel (bought in a single day two years ago by a Japanese couple who 'wrote a cheque') chefs are putting the finishing touches to a large ice sculpture of the White House. Every hotel room is booked between Little Rock and Hot Springs, 55 miles away. The Excelsior has even rented out its roof for satellite dishes and cameras, and its 150 extra staff include local teachers, lawyers and even investment bankers, all of whom want to be part of tonight's parties. At a long table in the media centre sit the state economic development specialists and business boosters. These are the people responsible for the 19 per cent increase in manufacturing jobs over the past decade, an achievement which Mr Clinton 'rang on' repeatedly in the campaign. Their excitement is palpable. They have heard their state described as a pollution haven by President George Bush, and as 'irrelevant' by independent candidate Ross Perot, but they are looking more for 'opportunity' than revenge. Among them are forward-thinking Arkansans planning to offer the Clintons (who own no home) a vacation retreat in Hot Springs, where they also hope to attract holidaymakers and pensioners. (Land here can still be bought for Dollars 300-400 an acre.) Some are even poring over sites for a Clinton presidential library, although it would not be built until after his time in office. In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention back in July, Mr Clinton said: 'There is no Arkansas miracle,' in a reference to the 'Massachusetts miracle' proclaimed by the last Democratic challenger, Mr Michael Dukakis. But there is also unlikely to be an Arkansas collapse of the kind endured by Massachusetts after the failure of their presidential candidate. Growth has been steady over the decade or so Mr Clinton has been here, and banks are so conservative that home building lags well behind demand. Like most state governors, Mr Clinton commands less awe at home than he does away. A giant sign near Little Rock airport informs startled visitors 'This is Bush country.' Outside the confines of state government, Mr Clinton's education reforms and economic expansion schemes are almost grudgingly praised; his sales taxes, levied to finance schools and development, are the subject of bitter complaint. It is by no means forgotten that when he ran for re-election two years ago, he promised to finish his four-year term. Win or lose, there are few Arkansans today complaining about his presidential run. It has pushed tourism to record highs. The number of companies inquiring about moving to the state has risen 30 per cent. The population may shrink a bit if all the governor's supporters get Washington jobs. But Arkansas Business, a weekly newspaper, spells out the possibilities of a boom in the state as a result of a Clinton presidency: increased highway spending, development of the impoverished 'Delta Region', new tax receipts from tourism, better airline services, promotion of rice exports in Asian markets, more convention business and the prospect of military installations. Arkansans dream of a new prosperity and, as the candidate sleeps off a gruelling campaign, his friends are adjusting to the fact that tomorrow he may be preparing to take on the world's most powerful job. His critics are also adjusting. One of the most severe, Mr Paul Greenberg of the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, waxed philosophical in Sunday's column. 'Just when the fabric of the old republic seems stretched to the breaking point, its tattered threads will be rewoven,' he said of election eve. 'The towering heroes and unregenerate villains who dominated the news the night before will be unmasked as human beings with virtues and vices. And the caricatures will have to be put aside for the next election.'</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Observer: Browned-off and bankrupt Calling all bankrupts. David Browne, made bankrupt in January, wants to hear from you. He's designed a nice line in souvenir neckwear for fellow bankrupts and he's now back in business. First week's trading saw 43 ties sold at Pounds 12.50 each, though Browne offers discounts to boards of directors. The ties, made of dark blue polyester, are emblazoned with a Pounds sign struck through by a white line, along with the initials TBC, standing for The Bankruptcy Club. Browne reckons the tie is bound to make an impression at any City gathering. Now he's thinking of expanding the market by selling franchises to judges in the bankruptcy courts. He has opened a 'Bankrupt's Tie Hotline' - 0273 771818 - to take orders from those customers whose phones are still connected. The merchandising spin-offs would, paradoxically, seem endless - so long as the recession endures.</p>

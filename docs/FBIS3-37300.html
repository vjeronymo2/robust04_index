			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Crimea: Harassment of </F> Journalists"]    [Text] In the Crimea, the forces of the "Republican  Movement of the Crimea" and of the "Russian Society of the  Crimea" have intensified their campaign of pressure against  dissident journalists. Picketing is organized of the Crimean  and Sevastopol television and radio broadcasting companies and  demands are advanced to dismiss television and radio journalists  Tatyana Korobova, Lilya Budzhurova, Leonid Pilunskyy, and Halyna  Khmelyovska, who occupy the position of common sense.    Clouds are gathering over president of the "Crimea"  Television and Radio Broadcasting company Valeriy Astakhov, who  is accused of pro-Ukrainian sentiments. In reality, Astakhov  occupies a balanced centrist position. Some people even assert  that a competition has been announced for the presently occupied  post of president of the "Crimea" Television and Radio  Broadcasting company. Those who claim this post include former  head of the company Anatoliy Sivachenko, one of the leaders of  the "Republican Movement of the Crimea" Boris Kizilov, and  leader of the "Russian Party of the Crimea" Sergey Shuvaynikov.</p>

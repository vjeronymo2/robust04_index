The results of the talks are also  being subjected to quite a lot of criticism. In particular, the  opponents of this visit consider that the Treaty on Friendship,  Good-neighborliness, and Cooperation that has been signed will  set in motion a new spiral of escalation of tension in the  Caucasus. Let us listen to what Emil Pain, member of the  Presidential Council, who was a member of the Russian delegation  to Tbilisi, thinks about this:    [Begin Pain recording] I think that the objections that are  being put forward against the treaty are groundless, for a  number of reasons. In the first place, uncertainty about  Russia's attitude to the integrity of Georgia to a considerable  extent stimulates the outbreak and escalation of conflicts.  Second, it is the third point of the treaty that has aroused  the greatest criticism; in accordance with this point Russia  pledges to help with the development of Georgia's regular army.  But this point is closely linked with a political settlement of  the Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts. And for  the first time the Georgian side at the talks has agreed with  the idea that Georgia could resolve its political problems with  the autonomies along the path of the federalization of Georgia,  that is, on the path by which relations are constructed between  the center and the autonomies in the Russian Federation.    Perhaps the most important result of this visit was that the  Georgians put their trust in the good-neighborliness and good  intentions of Russia toward that country that is now on the  verge of catastrophe. [passage omitted]    I think that the suggestion that no treaty should be  concluded with Georgia because its relations with Abkhazia and  South Ossetia are unresolved is groundless, because similar  contradictions exist in virtually all the post-Soviet states.  [passage omitted]    Furthermore, it is quite impermissible to impose any  particular model of political development on another country  that is recognized by world society as independent. We may say  that today federalization is one of the best models; it, to the  greatest extent, resolves the problems of interrelations between  the central authorities and the autonomies, but to directly  include in the treaty conditions specifying federalization or,  even more so, the granting of independence to some of its  components, is impermissible. [passage omitted] [end recording]    [Announcer] The results of the Russian-Georgian summit talks  were commented on, specially for Mayak, by Emil Pain, the  director of the Ethno-Political Research Center and member of  the Presidential Council.</p>

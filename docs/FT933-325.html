			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Treasury price gains eroded by retail sales figures AFTER posting solid early gains, US Treasury prices fell back yesterday following reports of strong September store sales. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 104 3/16 , yielding 5.94 per cent. Shorter-dated securities traded mostly flat throughout the day. After Monday's big gains, when the 30-year issue climbed more than one point, the bond market maintained its firm tone at the opening. Reports of strong demand for Treasuries in overseas markets, especially Tokyo, set the stage for early advances, and only the short end of the market, which has been ignored lately, failed to move higher in early trading. The market was strong enough initially to shrug off some potentially bearish news from the Conference Board, which announced that its September index of consumer confidence rose to 62.6 this month from 59.3 in August. However, prices fell back later in the day after the Johnson Redbook service reported a 10.2 per cent increase in retail store sales for the first four selling weeks of September. EUROPEAN bonds posted further gains, supported by the rally in the US as well as continuing hopes for near-term European rate cuts. Prices in most markets returned to the levels at which they had been trading just before political turmoil broke out in Russia last week. UK gilts continued to firm, in spite of imminent supply at today's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of new 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. The bonds have gained nearly one point in grey-market trading since their announcement last week, which had some dealers fearing that the price might be too high to attract the overseas demand needed to make the auction a success. However, most dealers were confident the auction would go smoothly. 'The market has a good bid to it, and the auction should go well,' said Mr Jan Laury, head of gilts sales at Daiwa. He expected gilts to firm further if the auction is a success. However, the pound, which is dogged by political jitters ahead of next week's Conservative Party conference, remains a risk for gilts. GERMAN bonds posted small gains, spurred largely by the breach of important technical resistance on the December bund future. After opening at 98.81, the contract broke through 99.00 and hit a high of 99.18 before closing at 99.04. Comments from Mr Dieter Hiss, Bundesbank central bank council member, who said that he did not foresee inflation coming below 4 per cent soon, briefly damped prices but had little lasting impact. He also said the yield curve would remain inverted until inflation had normalised to around half its current rate. 'His comments are not encouraging for easing prospects, though they are supportive for the long end,' said a Frankfurt dealer. FRENCH bonds gained on continuing talk of near-term rate cuts, with traders pinning their easing hopes on Thursday's Bank of France repo. Prices were further lifted when the notional French bond future on Matif breached its previous historical high at 123.72, rallied as high as 123.96 and closed at 123.82. The French government's auction of Ecu1.05bn 6 per cent 10-year OATs was 2 1/2 times oversubscribed and met with solid demand, said a London dealer. BELGIAN bonds were the day's poorest performer, dogged by currency weakness. The Belgian 10-year benchmark's yield spread over its German counterpart widened to 127 basis points from 115 on Monday. According to Mr Andre de Silva, bond strategist with Paine Webber, Belgium was still overrated, especially when compared to Italy where bonds yesterday rallied to new highs on strong volume. The Moody's rating agency rates Belgium Aa1, better than Italy's A1, but Mr de Silva said 'it is not unreasonable to moot the possibility of either a Belgian downgrade or an Italian upgrade'. Belgium's debt-to-GDP ratio of 130 per cent is clearly above Italy's 110 per cent ratio, he noted. Also, Italy has been taking far more stringent measures to deliver fiscal tightening than Belgium, he said.</p>

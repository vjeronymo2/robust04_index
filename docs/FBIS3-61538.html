Question: Andrey Georgiyevich, the situation in  Russian science is common knowledge; Russia has already lost  many great minds, and there will be more losses. Does the  ministry have any plan or idea to save at least what is left?    Answer: There is an idea and we are trying to  implement it as much as possible. While funding of research was  virtually unselective under the former socialist State, at  present we are striving to adopt expressly this attitude, which  is foreign to our science.    The market has shown how much people are worth. Those who  were failures before do not shine now either. Whereas active,  talented scientists are not needy today. They have the  opportunity to earn well, serve as consultants for projects and  programs, providing their exert opinions.    The State is unable to support economically all scientific  groups. Not a single state, even the richest one, can afford  such luxury. A strictly selective approach is used in the United  States, Germany, Japan and other countries. The State funds one  project and freezes another, since it believes that there are  more pressing problems at a given time. It is expressly this  direction that our ministry is trying to follow.    In short, there are three directions in our idea. The first  is to give economic assistance to implement major pioneering  projects and research programs that could raise our science to  the worldwide level. The second is to support selectively the  strongest and most promising research organizations. The third  is to provide financial assistance to outstanding scientists  deserving of worldwide recognition, as well as to the most  gifted representatives of the young generation. The RAN [Russian  Academy of Sciences] has already won a decision, according to  which the State pays high-class scientists something like an  increased grant. Of course, the money is not commensurate with  the research results, but still it is rather substantial  assistance.    Question: But this applies to basic science, what  is to be done about applied science?    Answer: Applied science should be funded on the  basis of return. If the project is promising, the State must  fund it, but not as was done before.    Question: Please explain.    Answer: In giving funds to support some laboratory  or some institute, the State is giving, so to speak, an advance.  When a buyer pays for a completed project, a specific part of  the proceeds, let us say thirty percent, must be returned to the  State.    Question: Is this something like a bank credit?    Answer: Yes, but on preferential terms, without  payment of high interest. At the present time, our ministry is  trying to involve commercial banks in this matter. In simple  form, the idea consists of the following: A commercial bank  investing in the support of innovative projects offers  considerable preferential terms to creditors and, in turn,  enjoys certain benefits from the State. It should gain from  supporting innovative work.    Question: In Russia, State research centers (GNT)  are formed at the initiative of the ministry. As a rule, these  are known research institutes that enjoy worldwide recognition.  However, some specialized research institutes involved in  applied science are also included. And this is wise: industry  cannot live without applied science. How many GNT are there in  Russia?    Answer: At present there are thirty-six.    Question: But there are hundreds of specialized  research institutes. It appears that most of them are either  doomed to fail or compelled to look for work on the side, rather  than in their own field. Plants do not have resources at the  present time for high-grade technologies and related research. I  think this is a very dangerous situation for industry.    Answer: Of course, we are striving to support  specialized science, which is carrying out highly effective and  promising work. But first the authors of such work must submit  to us technical and economic validation, results of marketing  studies and a business plan. Then this work is submitted to  expert evaluation and, if it has merit, it receives budgeted  funding. But this applies to pioneer projects that hold great  promise. And if a new processor is developed, it is a strictly  commercial development and its authors should look for buyers  themselves.    Question: Who evaluates the technical and  scientific level of a new development?    Answer: There is the Russian Institute of  Scientific Expertise. It has a data bank with information about  outstanding scientists, and they are called upon to do this  work. The names of the scientists are kept secret, even we do  not know them. The opinion of experts about a specific project  is given in the form of a recommendation. The final decision is  made by the ministry. Then, if the project is approved, we turn  to the Government, prove its timeliness and obtain funding.  Under present conditions of the Treasury, this is not a simple  matter.    As for GNT, and the list will grow, we believe that they  should enjoy not only preferential credit, but also preferential  rates for fuel and electricity. I wish to stress that the GNTs  status is not given permanently, but for only three years. If  the project does not yield the promised effect in this time, the  State stops funding it.    Question: Do the experts have some responsibility  for the results of their work?    Answer: Yes, unquestionably. This is stipulated in  pertinent documents. But I wish to make a comment. Let us assume  that our developers created an excellent computer and the  experts noted its high qualities. But who is going to buy it  when the Japanese sell the same one for one-third of our price?  Or, for example, the problem with sugar. People come to us and  offer a new technology for producing sugar from starch, and this  would solve the shortage problem. But, how much will the end  product cost? We find out that it is much cheaper to purchase  sugar abroad than to use this technology to produce it. What  sense is there in funding such a project?    Today there is no problem with the technical execution of  some specific task. There is another problem, that of its cost.  Is it economically expedient? Scientific technological progress  occurs at the intersection of technology and economics. The  ministry is approaching problems of funding science from  expressly these positions.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Woolworth steps up European drive WOOLWORTH, the large US retail group, said yesterday it would accelerate its plans to expand in Europe by opening at least 890 Foot Locker athletic footwear and apparel stores in the next eight years. The company, whose businesses range from general merchandise stores to specialty chains, has 110 Foot Locker stores in seven European countries, including Belgium, England and Germany. It expected to open 60 new stores by the end of this year. Woolworth had planned for about 1,000 Foot Locker stores in Europe in the next 10 to 15 years. It estimated these could pull in Dollars 2bn in annual sales. At a shareholders' meeting in North Carolina Mr Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive, said conditions in the athletic footwear market in Europe were similar to the North American market about 15 years ago. Between 1983 and 1990, Foot Locker sales quadrupled to Dollars 1.5bn, but the rate of growth has since slowed. As the US athletic shoe market nears saturation, expansion into untapped markets overseas has long seemed the logical next step. Earlier this year, Woolworth said it would overhaul its operations by selling or re-deploying 900 poorly-performing stores and eliminating 10,000 jobs. Universal Matchbox Group, the Hong Kong-based maker of Matchbox die-cast miniature cars and trucks, has received a reduced takeover offer from US toy maker Tyco Toys. Tyco, which has offered Dollars 10.75 in cash and stock for each Matchbox share in a deal worth Dollars 135m, did not release details of the revised offer.</p>

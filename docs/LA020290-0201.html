			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FRIENDLY LOAN LEADS TO COURT  </P> <P> "Miami Vice" actor Don Johnson may turn to a bank next time he needs a loan.  And a friend of his may be sure his next deal is done in writing.  </P> <P> Last year, Johnson's company, DJ Racing, secured an interest-free $300,000 loan  from Johnson's friend, lawyer and real estate investor Martin Ergas. Ergas has  sued for failure to repay the loan by November, but Johnson says the money to  build a racing boat isn't due to be paid back until 1995.  </P> <P> Donald M. Klein, attorney for Johnson and his company, said the lawsuit is "an  effort to embarrass Mr. Johnson into settling. He does not do that as a general  principle, and in this case he definitely doesn't do it."  </P></p>

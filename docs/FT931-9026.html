			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / City dealers profit from currency turmoil STERLING'S withdrawal from its rigid tie with other European currencies and the UK's deteriorating fiscal position turned 1992 into the best year since 1986 for gilt-edged marketmakers and turned stockbrokers and share dealers from losses to profit. Brokers and dealers in the equity market bounced back into profit by the end of the year, after earlier recording their worst losses for nearly three years, according to the Stock Exchange Quarterly review. Gilts marketmakers made post-tax profits of Pounds 65m between them last year, their best results since the reforms which reshaped the market in 1986, according to an article in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, published today. Heavy government borrowing helped breathe life back into the market, which seemed doomed to become a backwater as the UK began to pay off public debt in the 1980s. Trading in gilts jumped last year to Pounds 4.9bn a day, from Pounds 4.4bn a day in 1991. Some gilts houses are thought to have made good trading profits from gilt market rallies prompted by the Conservatives' election victory in April, and by sterling's departure from the ERM in September. These were balanced by a reversal in early summer, when Danish voters voted against ratifying the Maastricht treaty. But 1993 has got off to a bad start for gilts marketmakers. Interest rates were cut the day before a gilt auction in January, driving up gilt prices and hitting marketmakers who had left themselves short of bonds in anticipation of buying stock in the auction. Losses are estimated at Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m. Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange review estimates that Stock Exchange members made Pounds 24m in the final quarter of last year - a poor return on their Pounds 4.5bn of capital, but a sharp improvement after pre-tax losses of Pounds 126m in the third quarter. The flow of rights issues so far this year and continuing buoyancy in the equity market means that profits are likely to rise further. The figures disclose that a sharp decline in brokers' income in the third quarter accounted for the losses at that stage. Total income fell from over Pounds 1bn in the previous quarter to just Pounds 739m as trading volumes slipped. The boost to the stock market as sterling fell out of the ERM reversed this, as trading volumes jumped after a summer lull. 'Things have got dramatically better,' said the head of equities at one large bank in London. 'The question now is whether they continue to get better, or whether people start bidding up salaries again.' While the securities market continued to represent a poor return on capital, gilts houses made a return of 15 per cent on the Pounds 432m capital they had at the start of the year.</p>

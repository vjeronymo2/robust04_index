			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BOC shows 11% rise to Pounds 180m - Signs of UK recovery weak while upturn in US moving erratically BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group, yesterday reported profits on ordinary activities before tax up 11 per cent from Pounds 162.1m to Pounds 180.1m for the six months to March 31. The results were flattered by favourable currency movements. The rate was Dollars 1.53 to the pound during the six months, compared with Dollars 1.78 over the same period last year. At constant exchange rates the rise was limited to 3 per cent. The figures were achieved on turnover up 10.4 per cent from Pounds 1.37bn to Pounds 1.51bn. A second interim dividend of 11.6p (11p) is to be paid making a total for the year of 23.2p (22p). Earnings per share for the period came out at 23.55p (21.55p). The group, which believes its industrial gases businesses represent good economic indicators, warned that the UK recovery was weak, with the favourable trend in retail sales filtering only slowly into industrial activity. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said the upturn in the US was moving erratically and there were no signs yet that the recovery had staying power. The impact on demand remained restrained, he warned. Meanwhile, the German economy was heading for a crisis similar to that faced by the UK in the early 1980s, he said. The Japanese economy had hit the trough, he felt, but the north Pacific markets continued to boom. Gases and related products reported operating profits up from Pounds 144m to Pounds 154.1m on turnover of Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1bn). Mr Rich said demand for liquid gases was up, but demand for cylinders was static. Prices and margins for the businesses remained stable. Operating profits at the healthcare division increased from Pounds 48.2m to Pounds 54.9m on sales of Pounds 303.5m (Pounds 255.6m). The figures masked a deterioration in sales during the second quarter, following the expiry of the US patents of Forane, the group's best-selling anaesthetic at the end of January. Mr Rich said a tough and professional battle was emerging between BOC and Abbot, the US group which had launched a generic version of Forane. Headline prices had fallen between 10 per cent and 15 per cent, and data from IMS, the market research company, suggested BOC had lost 12 per cent market share by value. Before the expiry it held 70 per cent of the market, according to analysts. Sales of Suprane, BOC's replacement product, had been held up by a fire which had disrupted supplies, said Mr Rich. US trading profits, excluding exchange rates, rose from Pounds 64.4m to Pounds 77.1m on turnover up at Pounds 560.6m (Pounds 469.8m). European operating profits slipped from Pounds 62.1m to Pounds 62m on turnover of Pounds 450m (Pounds 423.4m). Asian profits were up from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds 54m on sales at Pounds 441.7m (Pounds 371.6m). African profits were up from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 28.2m on turnover up from Pounds 124.4m to Pounds 141.9m.</p>

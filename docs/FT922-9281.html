			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fokus Bank reduces losses to NKr137.6m FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a reduction in first quarter pre-tax losses to NKr137.6m (Dollars 21.4m) from NKr441.7m, helped by lower operating costs, a fall in credit losses and a steady level of earnings. 'The first-quarter result shows clear positive signs. I will specially focus on the point that the bank has been able to maintain earnings in spite of the large, planned reduction in loans which has taken place,' said Mr Leif Klevan, managing director. Net interest income fell by NKr76.6m to NKr286.1m as other operating income rose to NKr150.9m from Nkr149.4m. Fokus cut operating costs by NKr67m to NKr329.4m, helped by a reduction of 317 employees since the end of 1991. Most significant is a reduction in first-quarter credit losses to NKr246.9m from NKr451.2m in last year's comparative period. Fokus said the influx of non-performing loans had also been stemmed. The bank stressed that finding a permanent solution to its equity problem remained a high priority. At the end of last month, the guarantee fund of the commercial banks injected NKr1.83bn in preference capital into the bank to help cover last year's swollen losses. Last year, Fokus was de-listed from the Oslo bourse and taken over by the state in a NKr2.150bn rescue package after its share capital was wiped out by large losses.</p>

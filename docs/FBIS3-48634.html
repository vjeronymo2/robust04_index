Social Democratic Party  [SDP] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at a meeting with a  pro-SDP group of labor leaders, said the Japanese people do not  want to see a political vacuum emerge during a severe economic  slump.    Murayama said the seven-party coalition led by Prime  Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa should first compile and enact a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, ending March 31, and the  fiscal 1994 budget, both of which have yet to be submitted to  the Diet.    The House of Councillors last week rejected a package of  four  government-sponsored political reform bills which passed the  House of Representatives in November.    Hosokawa has vowed to "take political responsibility" if his  Cabinet fails to achieve political reform during the current  Diet session ending January 29, implying that he and his Cabinet  will resign en masse. Some of the ruling parties have called  for dissolving the lower house for an election if the bills are  killed.</p>

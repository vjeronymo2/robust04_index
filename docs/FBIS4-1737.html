The king is expected to visit Kim Il-song in connection with  Kim's 82-year birthday on April 15, an embassy spokesman said.

It was not immediately clear if Sihanouk would attempt to  exert any influence over North Korea to allow full inspections  of its suspected nuclear sites by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).

Sihanouk is expected to travel in his own royal airplane and  will leave Pyongyang and return to Cambodia next Friday by way  of Beijing, the spokesman said.    The king resumed his official duties Thursday when he met  with a Chinese leader, his first official meeting since  undergoing cancer treatment in Beijing last October.

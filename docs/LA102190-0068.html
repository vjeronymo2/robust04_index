			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: COME OVER, COME OVER BY LYNDA BARRY (HARPER: $8.95)  </P> <P> Lynda Barry's latest book, a series of letters and diary entries written by a  14-year-old girl during the late '60s, bridges cartooning and fiction writing.  </P> <P> Maybonne Mullen describes the pleasures and traumas of junior high school, that  awful period of adolescence humans somehow survive. The product of what was  called a "broken home," Maybonne must confront problems they didn't mention on  the re-runs of "The Donna Reed Show:" her father's alcoholism, peer pressure to  experiment with alcohol and sex, sibling rivalry and even child-abuse in one  dramatic, sensitively written sequence. Barry's prose cleverly reveals the  comedy inherent in adolescent self-dramatization; her quirky drawings, which  resemble notebook doodles, somehow capture the appearance of the nerdy heroine  and her baby sister.  </P></p>

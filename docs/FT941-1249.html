			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges in wake of killing of Colosio Wall Street US stocks went into a tail-spin yesterday after the assassination of the leading Mexican presidential candidate deflated confidence in the financial markets, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.37 lower at 3,821.09, after recovering somewhat from a downturn of nearly 64 points at 1.30pm. During mid-morning, the NYSE's 'uptick rule', which restricts program selling, was triggered when the blue-chip index's decline first breached the 50-point mark. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.19 at 464.35. Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 303m shares changing hands. Declining issues overwhelmed advances by 1,720 to 519. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 3.72 to 469.66, while the Nasdaq composite lost 10.83, or 1.3 per cent, to 786.68. Despite speculation that equity investors would become less focused on the direction of bond prices after this week's increase in short-term interest rates, stocks closely mirrored activity in the US Treasury market. Bond prices plunged as dealers sold off their Treasury holdings amid confusion in the market for Brady bonds and other emerging-market debt instruments. A subsequent surge in gold prices added to the selling pressure. The action came in the wake of the previous evening's shooting of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. By midday, yields on the benchmark 30-year government bond were again approaching the 7.00 per cent barrier, rattling investors in both markets. The lingering rate worries were brought into sharp focus with the decision by leading US commercial banks late Wednesday to lift their prime lending rates a quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 per cent. The higher rate will only modestly increase the cost of borrowing for businesses, but the move reinforced the impression that a period of easy money, which has fuelled the economy's recent recovery, was nearing its end. As result, cyclical stocks, which generally benefit from glad economic tidings, suffered severe setbacks. Caterpillar plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 116 7/8 , DuPont was marked down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 and 3M shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 100 1/8 . Automobile issues, a chief beneficiary of low rates, showed marked weakness. General Motors lost Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 , Ford backtracked Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 56 1/8 . Banks, which sought to protect their profit margins by lifting their prime rates, held up relatively well amid the general downturn. Citibank dipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and Chase Manhattan added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 . Canada Toronto stocks tumbled in active trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell 40.28 points, or 0.87 per cent, to 4,569.65, with declines outpacing advances 505 to 326. The volume of 87.22m shares was below Wednesday's 90.77m but trading value rose to CDollars 1.12bn from CDollars 949.0m.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Garcia rejects allegations of corruption NOBODY in Peru arouses such intense political passions as former president Alan Garcia, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. So allegations against him of massive corruption, unveiled last week in the country's congress, have all the makings of a long-running political drama. Mr Garcia is alleged to have deposited some Dollars 50m in foreign bank accounts during his five-year presidency, which ended last July after the victory of Mr Alberto Fujimori. Mr Garcia called the allegations 'a scandalous fabrication,' and warned that they would prove to be a 'political boomerang'. Mr Fernando Olivera, the deputy heading the parliamentary commission which has been investigating relatively minor discrepancies in Mr Garcia's declared income and house purchases, made the allegations before a full congressional session. He read reports from two North American investigation services. One of the investigators, Kroll Associates, has a track-record of probing the finances of dictators such as Panama's General Manuel Antonio Noriega, the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Their preliminary report on Mr Garcia alleges the existence of an account in his name at a now-defunct savings and loan in Dallas, Texas. Larc Investigative Services of Miami gives alleged details of 'several six-figure deposits (totalling approximately Dollars 50m) made between 1986 and 1989,' apparently in Mr Garcia's wife's name. Funds were subsequently transferred to various international financial institutions, it claims. Mr Garcia calls the charges an 'irresponsible and delinquent' attempt by the right 'to teach a lesson to the man who confronted the banking system. Why don't they just kill me once and for all?' The ex-President and his wife have legally empowered the presidents of the congress and supreme court to gain access to any bank accounts in their names and to withdraw any funds discovered.</p>

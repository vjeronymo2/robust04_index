			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT;  </P> <P> VOTING DEADLINE FOR UPS PACT EXTENDED  </P> <P> The Teamsters Union and United Parcel Services of America Inc. agreed to extend  a deadline for voting on a new contract, delaying the threat of a nationwide  strike.  </P> <P> The union initially told the company, headquartered in Greenwich, Conn., it  would strike if a new three-year contract wasn't approved by next Tuesday, when  the old pact expires, a UPS spokesman said. But he said the union needed more  time to get all its members to vote on the proposal. The deadline for ratifying  a contract was pushed up to Aug. 10 from next Monday.  </P></p>

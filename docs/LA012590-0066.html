			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: BATTERY DIES AFTER THE TWILIGHT HOURS  </P> <P> Question: My 1980 Dodge runs well but has a strange electrical problem that  causes it to die out suddenly at night. The battery is dead when this happens.  What could be the cause? -- Y.N.  </P> <P> Answer: If the battery is running down only at night, you have either a fairly  simple problem or a rather difficult one. It could be as simple as a loose fan  belt that is unable to operate the alternator at peak electrical demand when  the headlights are on.  </P> <P> The headlights are the largest single electrically powered device on the car,  and when they are on, the alternator must work hard to supply an adequate  current. The voltage regulator detects the electrical load being demanded by  the various systems on the car and controls the generation of current. It also  makes sure that the battery is fully charged.  </P> <P> The alternator is powered by a fan belt that runs between a pulley on the  engine and a pulley in front of the alternator housing. When the alternator  needs to produce more current, the pulleys become more difficult to drive. If  the belt slips because it isn't tight enough, then the alternator will not be  able to generate all the current needed for the headlights and other systems on  the car.  </P> <P> As a result, the battery begins to drain itself until it is so low that the  engine simply dies. If the belt is loose, the solution is usually to tighten or  replace the belt.  </P> <P> The more complex possible problem may involve a short in the headlight circuit  that causes the electrical system to drain but not blow a fuse. That could  occur almost anywhere in the headlight circuit. A mechanic should be able to  determine just what the problem is.  </P> <P> Q: I recently filled up my 1972 Ford Mustang with Arco EC-1 fuel. The company  says the gasoline is designed for older cars. Does that mean it contains a lead  substitute? -- M.K.  </P> <P> A: You might think because the new Arco EC-1 fuel is intended for use in older  cars, which were designed to burn leaded fuel, that the fuel contains a lead  substitute.  </P> <P> The gasoline contains neither lead nor a lead substitute, but the company  insists that it is safe to use in engines that were designed to burn lead. The  main difference between EC-1 and plain unleaded regular is that it carries the  somewhat higher octane rating required by older cars.  </P> <P> Lead was used in the past primarily to boost the octane of gasoline and also to  perform the function of cushioning engine valves and their valve seats. Under  heavy usage, such as speeds in excess of 55 m.p.h. or when towing a trailer,  old engine valves need lead or a lead substitute to cushion the surface between  valve and valve seat.  </P> <P> But in the past two decades, scientists have discovered that lead was poisoning  the environment and perhaps causing learning disabilities in children. Under  federal law, it is being phased out.  </P> <P> Starting in 1974, automobile manufacturers hardened the valves and seats in  engines so that they did not require lead. Some cars had hardened valves and  seats starting in 1970.  </P> <P> In cars produced earlier, heavy usage can cause premature valve failure. Under  heavy usage, motorists can use lead substitutes, which are based on sodium or  phosphorus compounds and are readily available in auto parts stores. Generally,  old marine engines, which are typically run under heavy loads, require a lead  substitute most of the time.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURER: DON'T BUY JUNK BONDS FOR STATE PENSION FUND  </P> <P> State Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, breaking sharply with the majority of  directors of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said Monday  that the $56-billion pension fund should stop buying junk bonds.  </P> <P> "Let's stop purchasing these types of investments," Hayes said during an  unusual public airing of differences with DeWitt F. Bowman, chief investment  officer of the pension fund, at a news conference in the treasurer's Capitol  office.  </P> <P> During the news conference, Bowman revealed that in addition to making an  unsecured loan of $25 million to the now-bankrupt investment firm of Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc., the pension fund has $87 million in paper losses stemming  from the collapse of the junk bond market.  </P> <P> Bowman said that as of March 1, the value of his pension fund's $529.3 million  worth of "high-yield" bonds had dropped to $442.7 million.  </P> <P> The investment chief said PERS had stopped buying junk bonds temporarily  because the bond market is "completely unsettled and embroiled in the Drexel  situation."  </P> <P> But he said he and other PERS officials still believe that the high yields  associated with the bonds make them a risk worth taking. "The maximum return  for the system over the long term can be gathered by diversifying the  investments, taking some risk when it's appropriate," he said.  </P> <P> Hayes -- seated next to Bowman at the news conference -- said, "My  recommendation is: Don't buy any more."  </P> <P> In February, Hayes attempted to persuade other members of the 13-member PERS  board of directors to temporarily halt the purchase of junk bonds pending a  review. The vote on his proposed moratorium was 7 to 6. He said he will try  again at the PERS meeting later this month.  </P> <P> His comments Monday went further than previous statements and seemed to reflect  the heat of the primary election campaign. Hayes, appointed treasurer by Gov.  George Deukmejian last year, is running for his first full four-year term this  year.  </P> <P> Hayes has been under fire from his opponent in the Republican primary election,  Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan, for accepting more than $4,000 in campaign  contributions from Drexel and its officers.  </P> <P> Buchanan, in Sacramento for campaign appearances, said later that Hayes "should  give a complete explanation" of the unsecured Drexel loan and should refuse to  accept any more contributions from investment banking firms.  </P> <P> "In a situation like this, people are going to be concerned that he wasn't as  tough as he should have been," said Buchanan. "When he's taking money from  them, when they are helping to finance his campaign, one wonders if there is a  quid pro quo here." She said she knew that the $25-million loan from the  retirement fund to Drexel was made in 1986, long before Hayes became treasurer.  But she said that as treasurer, Hayes should have seen the Drexel debacle  coming and taken steps to protect the PERS investment.  </P> <P> Hayes said the state has absolutely no control over the loan, a 10-year note  earning a 10% rate of interest. "It was a private placement. Once you buy it,  you are basically stuck with it till the end," Hayes said.  </P> <P> Hayes and Bowman both said they hope PERS will recover most if not all of the  money owed to it. Hayes said the loan to Drexel was "a business decision" that  "was not inconsistent with what their policy was at the time, nor what the  policy is at this time."  </P> <P> Also at the news conference with Hayes and Bowman was Thomas E. Flanigan, chief  investment officer of the State Teachers Retirement System. He said his pension  fund, which controls $29.6 billion in investments for retired teachers, decided  in 1985 not to purchase junk bonds. Basically, Flanigan said junk bonds carried  just too much risk. Hayes also said that there are no junk bonds in the  $21-billion investment portfolio that he controls as treasurer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE COUNTY 1990-1991 RESOLUTIONS  </P> <P> " I have made up my mind that the 1990s is my decade to retire from education.  I think I have been a highly intense person in terms of my career, and I have  been reflecting on that and working on bringing a balance in my life with a  mixture of hard work and also taking time out for myself.  </P> <P> I think that as a nation we have hit rock bottom in terms of supporting our  schools. But I'm not discouraged because I feel we have the attention of the  leadership -- on the federal, state and local levels -- and that's what it's  going to take. Either as an active public school administrator and/or as a  private consultant, I will dedicate the remainder of my life to young people.  I'm going to speak up and say, "If you want quality (education), you'll have to  pay for it."  </P></p>

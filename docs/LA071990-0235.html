			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TBS COVERAGE OF GOODWILL GAMES TO BEGIN TODAY  </P> <P> Cable mogul Ted Turner, whose TBS channel today begins 86 hours of coverage of  the Goodwill Games, calls the 17-day sports extravaganza "cable television's  largest original programming event ever." But about 17% of the 54 million cable  households that receive TBS -- roughly nine million homes -- won't have the  opportunity to watch it.  </P> <P> That's because many cable operators declined to pay a surcharge of between 90  cents and $1.10 per customer assesed by Turner to carry the Goodwill Games. The  Olympics-style event, taking place in Seattle and six other Washington state  cities, features more than 2,500 of the world's best athletes from more than 50  nations competing in 21 sports.  </P> <P> TBS officials said that about 95% of their Southern California viewers will see  the Goodwill Games. They were unable to specify the local systems that will not  be carrying the event, and a random sampling of cable operators contacted by  The Times found none that had refused to pay the extra fee.  </P> <P> The cable systems that did opt against the Goodwill Games will get alternate  programming from TBS, consisting of old movies.  </P> <P> Turner is charging extra for the games in an effort to cut his losses. Turner  said that cable companies will pay $38 million for the games and figures this  year's losses to be at least $10 million on a $180-million budget.  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting puts the loss for the inaugural Goodwill Games, held in  Moscow in 1986, at $24 million. Turner's plans were far more ambitious then,  with 129 hours of coverage, and rights were also sold to broadcast stations  throughout the nation, overexposing a product that had a limited audience in  the first place. Stations in Boston, Washington, Detroit and Chicago reported  ratings of less than 1% for Sunday telecasts.  </P> <P> Turner conceived the Goodwill Games in 1984 as an effort to decrease tensions  between the Soviet Union and the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Liquidity The nagging worry, though, is that such arguments are simply a justification of a rise driven primarily by liquidity. Such a conclusion seems indicated by the propensity of share prices to crumble when any leading company announces disappointing profits. That was the fate of GEC and Hanson a month ago. Beguiling as the re-rating argument is, there is also some underlying nervousness. Companies must produce some fancy earnings figures to justify present multiples, especially in sectors such as building materials where economic recovery has been most strongly discounted. Dividend growth is also unlikely to keep pace with earnings, given the level to which cover sank during the recession. That may explain the appeal of utilities which can offer relatively attractive yields and the prospect of some dividend growth. Banks have also benefited because dividend cover is likely to grow particularly fast as provisions come down after the recession. But the selectivity of investors again suggests their primary aim is yield enhancement, against the background of lingering scepticism about earnings. Such worries will come to the fore if the economic recovery does falter as taxes go up in the spring. Even then, though, the equity market could be saved by further cuts in interest rates. Relative to cash the attraction of equities would improve again, provoking further liquidation of retail bank and building society deposits. It is the switching of this money into equities and gilts coupled with large inflows of foreign capital which sustained the market in 1993. The resulting liquidity has not only enabled the government to fund its deficit at lower and lower interest rates. It has also seen the equity market absorb more than Pounds 11bn in rights issues and Pounds 5bn in new issues. The central question for 1994 is to decide how long liquidity is likely to stay abundant. On the domestic front the flow of retail cash may slow somewhat, simply because the largest part of the fall in base rates has already taken place. A combination of previous over-funding and tighter fiscal policy will also substantially reduce the supply of gilts. The end to pension holidays may create additional investment flows but these will be at least partly offset by a fall in income available for reinvestment as institutions are receiving smaller tax credits on their dividend income.</p>

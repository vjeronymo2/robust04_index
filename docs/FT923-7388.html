			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Parkside mine to close in March PARKSIDE, the last coal mine in north-west England, will close in March with the loss of 720 jobs. The colliery, near Warrington, is the last pit in the once substantial Lancashire coal field. Mr Terry Wheatley, group director for British Coal's Midlands and Wales area which now includes Lancashire, told unions that the colliery, which had been making substantial losses, had no prospect of survival after March.</p>

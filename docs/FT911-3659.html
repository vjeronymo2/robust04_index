			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Dunkel acclaims free trade moves by developing nations THE Uruguay Round on global trade liberalisation may have stalled last December, but 45 countries, mostly developing ones, have liberalised their trade policies since the round was launched in 1986. These moves are recorded in the annual report of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) presented to the Council yesterday by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general. While pointing optimistically towards this development within Gatt, which now has 101 members, Mr Dunkel records that, in volume terms, the growth of merchandise trade slowed in 1990 to 5 per cent from 7 the previous year. World output growth slipped from 4 to 3 per cent, but both figures were close to the average for the 1983-1990 period of expansion. In spite of the slowdown in volume growth in 1990, the value of merchandise trade rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 3,500bn, boosted by the 7 per cent depreciation in the average value of the dollar. Preliminary estimates indicate that trade in commercial services - including transport, tourism, telecommunications, insurance and banking  - increased by 12 per cent to about Dollars 770bn. Much of the standstill in the Uruguay Round talks has been caused by the impasse between the European Community and the US over the need for deep cuts in agricultural subsidies. Looking ahead to 1991, Gatt says that 'there is, as yet, no evidence that the slowdown in economic growth in the major industrial countries - including a fall in output in France, the United States and the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of last year - has run its course'. A world recession is unlikely, it says, but the timing of a broadly-based pick-up in growth rates is also unclear. The measures undertaken by the 45 countries include tariff reductions and 'bindings' (tariffs fixed in schedules to Gatt which can only be raised if compensation is negotiated), the elimination of quotas, the abolition of import licensing restrictions and the removal of other non-tariff barriers. Looking ahead to the remainder of this year, Mr Dunkel emphasises 'the importance of pushing ahead with the Uruguay Round negotiations'.</p>

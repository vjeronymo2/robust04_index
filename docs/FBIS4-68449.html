			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Is the President Without a National </F> Security Service?"]    [Text] The other day, Sh. Karamanukyan, head of the  Armenian president's administrative staff, called in the five  employees of the service headed by the president's chief adviser  on national security remaining in the ranks and notified them  that the service, which as we know was formerly headed by Ashot  Manucharyan and Vaan Avakyan, is to be disbanded in 2 weeks.  After their retirement the service was essentially inactive,  although the employees reported for work regularly. The head of  the administrative staff displayed kindness by not ruling out  the possibility of helping the dismissed personnel find new  employment.    To all appearances, an appropriate edict by the president  will be adopted by 15 April. It is on that day that the period  for implementation of another edict--on freezing the activity of  operations divisions of the GUNB RA [State Directorate of  National Security of the Republic of Armenia]--is completed. It  is hoped that the new document will at least state the reasons  for disbanding the National Security Service as well as the  GUNB. Finally, someone should familiarize the public with the  new conception of the activity of such services. Otherwise, we  must assume that the president is not concerned about national  security matters.</p>

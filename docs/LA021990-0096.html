			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL FACES A BUMPY RIDE TO COMPLETION OF TOLL PROJECTS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: WILLIAM C. WOOLLETT JR. PRESIDES OVER THE FIRST EFFORT TO BRING  MAJOR, PUBLICLY OWNED, USER-FEE HIGHWAYS TO CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> His friends call him Wild Bill. Some weekends he can be found roaming rustic  Bommer Canyon in Irvine, or sailing a 16-foot catamaran off the coast, or river  rafting in Colorado.  </P> <P> But at age 61, William C. Woollett Jr. says he has met his biggest challenge:  serving as executive director of Orange County's Transportation Corridor  Agencies, which plan to build a 70-mile, $2-billion network of three tollways  by mid-decade.  </P> <P> "I like this job because it involves something that's never been done before,"  Woollett said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Indeed, Woollett presides over the first effort to bring major, publicly owned  user-fee highways to California.  </P> <P> Although Woollett may not be well-known outside of Irvine, where he served for  17 years as the city's first city manager, he is one of Orange County's  highest-paid public officials, receiving $118,000 a year.  </P> <P> It's a pressure-filled job. John Meyer, Woollett's predecessor, quit last  summer, citing job burnout. Developers and politicians clamor to have the roads  built "yesterday"; environmentalists threaten to file lawsuits at every turn,  and engineers spend the agencies' money for design work faster than developer  fees can pay for it.  </P> <P> Woollett has been at the tollway post less than four months, but agency board  members, transportation officials and developers already give him high marks  for boosting morale and gaining control of what was an understaffed, unfocused  operation.  </P> <P> "I have been tremendously impressed by him," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor  Gary L. Hausdorfer, who chairs the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor  Agency board. "He is a very quiet and competent leader. He's a good organizer.  He is a quick learner who very quickly grasps very complicated transportation  issues."  </P> <P> For instance, Hausdorfer said, Woollett hired a financial expert -- Wallace D.  Kreutzen -- as a deputy director to bring board members much better cost and  cash flow analyses than they had before. Also, Woollett has been giving board  members written, weekly updates on financial, environmental and construction  issues.  </P> <P> In addition, final design contracts have been signed for portions of the  tollways, with construction expected to begin later this year or in early 1991.  </P> <P> But Woollett still faces major hurdles, including:  </P> <P> * Foothill-area opposition to federal legislation that would permit Orange  County's tollways to pass through park land, and an almost-certain  environmental lawsuit aimed at blocking the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway  bridge across Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> * Continuing criticism from some public officials and developers who complain  that the San Joaquin Hills tollway project is already two years behind  schedule, even though the planned Foothill tollway is far ahead of its original  timetable.  </P> <P> * Pending final tollway financing plans, with tollway officials still  negotiating developer fees and offsetting credits for donated rights of way and  grading.  </P> <P> Even Hausdorfer has acknowledged that tollway financing will be "very tight"  and critically dependent, perhaps, on projections that motorists will be  willing to pay tolls higher than the $2 to $3 maximums previously anticipated.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be easy," Hausdorfer said. But I'm confident the roads will  be built."  </P> <P> Said Woollett: "I didn't come here to fail."  </P> <P> Seeking to head off potential financial problems, Woollett has discussed with  some officials the possibility of borrowing money from the state or other local  transportation agencies, who would be repaid when tolls are collected.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind that the lack of an organizational framework  over there cost them some time," said Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of  the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But Woollett just got there, and  he's definitely brought a high degree of professionalism with him."  </P> <P> Tollway employees say Woollett is best at bringing people of opposing views  together and then quickly deciding what needs to be done.  </P> <P> But there are some people who remain unconvinced.  </P> <P> When the Tustin Hills Homeowners Assn. recently alleged that tollway officials  were white-washing projected tollway noise levels in their community, Woollett  promised to respond with the best scientific data available, even if it hurts  his cause.  </P> <P> Said Jeffrey Katz, president of the homeowners' group: "We'll see. He listens  to us, but it's clear that he knows who he works for. . . . He wants to get the  (tollways) done."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, developers such as the Mission Viejo Co., which had griped last year  that the tollways were taking too long to build, have been mostly quiet after a  series of private briefings begun by Woollett's predecessor.  </P> <P> During such sessions, Woollett has developed a reputation for saying exactly  what's on his mind, even to the influential Irvine Co., one of the agency's  staunchest defenders and a major donor of rights of way.  </P> <P> "I was attending a meeting with him (Woollett) and several others recently,  when we got into an argument and he turned to me and said simply, 'Hugh, you're  full of crap,' " said Irvine Co. transportation planner Hugh Fitzpatrick,  </P> <P> Still, critics point out that the tollway agency has spent about $54 million  since its inception in 1986, without any concrete poured. Much of the money,  though, has gone for environmental and route alignment studies, legal advice  and legislative lobbying in Sacramento, and costly design contracts.  </P> <P> And while Woollett is under pressure in some quarters to quickly appoint a  respected transportation engineering expert to an unfilled, second deputy's  position on his staff, he has bided his time, saying it's not easy to attract  the best people at a salary the agency can afford.  </P> <P> Known for his off-the-wall humor, Woollett kids board members by offering to  carry their bags on lobbying trips to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Woollett, the father of a son, 29, and a daughter, 27, reads historical novels  and admits to a certain fascination both with futurism and management  expertise, collecting works such as "Megatrends," "The One Minute Manager," and  -- most recently -- "The Excellence Choice," by James A. Belasco, which  Woollett said is about how vision creates excellence.  </P> <P> No stranger to issues such as growth control and land-use planning, Woollett  once worked privately on the development of Hollister Ranch north of Santa  Barbara, which is not unlike the Irvine Ranch.  </P> <P> While he was Irvine's city manager, his office discovered an error by the  city's Community Development Department that had led to too many development  permits being issued for the tightly controlled Irvine Business Complex.  </P> <P> And although urban planners have criticized Irvine's reliance on mostly  pro-automobile, anti-pedestrian development, Woollett has a jaundiced view of  the car.  </P> <P> "During World War II, we were forced to look at alternatives," Woollett said.  "But now it just isn't as high a priority for us -- at least not yet.  </P> <P> "Front porches allowed people to see what was going on around them, to  communicate face to face with their neighbors and children playing in the  neighborhood. Now nobody builds them anymore. We've lost that source of  communication. Similarly, cars have cut us off from each other. We're wrapped  in steel, chrome and glass."  </P> <P> But in a county where some government officials drive Cadillacs, Mercedeses and  BMWs, Woollett wheels around town in a 1969 El Camino that was so much in need  of a face lift that his former Irvine co-workers sprang for a bright red,  $2,000 paint job.  </P> <P> "He's basically a cowboy at heart," said Paul Brady Jr., who succeeded Woollett  as Irvine's city manager. "The El Camino fits right in."  </P> <P> But there's another side to Woollett.  </P> <P> In his spare time, he gets together with an architect and an upholsterer to  build bird cages. The men call themselves Red Door, because they attach a  little red-painted door to each cage they make. The cages are sold at Out of  the Woods, a crafts shop in El Toro, where Woollett's wife, Diane, works as a  floral designer.  </P> <P> Woollett said he sees no connection between his hobby and his job except the  urge to be creative.  </P> <P> The tollways, he said, will be state-of-the art masterpieces for the world to  copy.  </P> <P> Also, he's convinced that new development will not burden the tollways with so  much traffic that they will be obsolete as soon as they open, citing so-called  demand management strategies for the tollways that include the proposed  installation of rail transit in the medians, as well as car-pool lanes.  </P> <P> And in addition to speeding traffic, he said, the tollways will include vista  points that will open up thousands of acres of backcountry and spectacular  views above the Irvine coast to public view for the first time.  </P> <P> "I love to travel around California and see the countryside," Woollett said.  "And this is part of California."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLANNED TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:2.33IN:1.89IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Estimated Average  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Projected  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Daily Traffic*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opening  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Corridor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opening Day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2010  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Joaquin Hills  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 100,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 150,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1994  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Transportation Corridor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eastern Transportation  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 120,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1995  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Corridor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foothill Transportation  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 45,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 115,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1994  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Corridor (A)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foothill Transportation  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 75,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1997  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Corridor (B)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Organization: Transportation Corridor Agencies.  </P> <P> Purpose: Started in 1986 as joint powers authorities by Orange County and the  cities along planned routes to finance and build freeways. State legislation  later provided authority to collect tolls.  </P> <P> Top Administrator: William C. Woollett Jr., 61, of Irvine.  </P> <P> Headquarters: There are two corridor agencies that share the same office and  staff, at 345 Clinton St., Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Policy makers: The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency is overseen  by a board chaired by Newport Beach Councilman John Cox and consisting of  County Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez and council members  from Costa Mesa, Dana Point, Irvine, Mission Viejo, San Clemente, San Juan  Capistrano and Santa Ana. The Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency  is overseen by a board chaired by San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer  and consisting of Riley, Vasquez, and city council members from Anaheim,  Irvine, Mission Viejo, Orange, San Clemente, Santa Ana, Tustin and Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROJECTS  </P> <P> * The 15-mile San Joaquin Hills toll road would extend from the Corona del Mar  Freeway from its present terminus at MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach to  Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano, through Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo and  Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> * The 23-mile Eastern toll road would begin at the Riverside Freeway near the  Riverside County line and parallel the Costa Mesa Freeway through the Santa Ana  Mountains, splitting into two legs near Santiago Canyon Road. The west leg  would end at Jamboree Road near the Santa Ana Freeway, and the east leg would  connect with the Laguna Freeway at the Santa Ana Freeway.  </P> <P> * The 32-mile Foothill toll road would connect the east leg of the Eastern toll  road with Interstate 5 near the San Diego County line, through Portola Hills  and Rancho Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> Construction: Ground-breaking on all three projects in 1991. Portions open at  various intervals through 1997.  </P> <P> Cost: $2 billion-plus.  </P> <P> Tolls: Not final, but range could be 75 cents to $4, depending on facility and  distance traveled.  </P> <P> Financing: Developers must donate 120-foot-wide right of way without  compensation. In addition, 48.44% of the construction costs are to be paid  through the collection of development fees. The rest of the money is expected  to come from a combination of construction bonds, paid off with toll revenue  and state and federal loans or grants. However, developers receive credits  against the fees they owe when they donate additional land or do grading work  that is included in the cost of building the toll roads. Officials expect  development fees to increase, and tolls may be higher than originally planned.  Tolls must be removed when construction debts end.  </P> <P> Source: Transportation Corridor Agencies  </P></p>

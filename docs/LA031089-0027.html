			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> KCBS-TV's Valerie Coleman, who has been commuting for six months from her home  in San Francisco to Channel 2 where she anchors the noon news broadcast, has  decided to stay permanently in the Bay Area. Her duties on Channel 2's midday  news will be taken over starting Thursday by Tricia Toyota, who will also  continue on the station's 6 p.m. news. Up north, Coleman will rejoin KCBS  Newsradio as a morning co-anchor, a position she worked from 1984-86. However,  she'll still retain some ties here. She's going to provide Channel 2 with a  three-times-a-week opinion segment about the family, covering "light, easy  subjects and serious issues." The segments will be taped at her home.

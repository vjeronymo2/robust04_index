			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Oslo tries to buy back heavy water NORWAY said yesterday it would try to buy back from India a 12.5 tonnes consignment of heavy water (deuterium oxide) which was illegally diverted to India in 1986. It also said it was reviewing its NKr100m (Pounds 8.9m) aid programme to India. A public prosecutor claimed earlier this week to have evidence confirming that shipment, destined for a Romanian power plant, had been illegally re-routed to India. 'I think that it is dubious to give Norwegian aid to nations which use the funding to develop and produce atomic weapons. On this basis I think we must reassess our aid programme to both India and Pakistan,' said Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norway's foreign minister, in an interview with a domestic newspaper.</p>

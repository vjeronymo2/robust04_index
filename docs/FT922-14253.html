			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates stay firm QUIET conditions made for another dull session in the money markets yesterday. Rates continued to show pressure for a rise of at least half a point in the UK's base rate after the general election. The key three-month interbank rate began  1/16 firmer at 11 1/8 -11 per cent, but eased during the day to close at 11-10 15/16 . Interbank dealers said investors were lending and borrowing at the very short end, reluctant to take on obligations beyond one week because of intense political uncertainty. Short sterling futures opened down at 88.67. But during the day the contract was squeezed as investors who left themselves short on sterling last week scrambled to make-up the shortage. It gained 17 basis points with 30,307 lots exchanged and closed at 88.88. The contract will open around one hour earlier on April 10, the day after the general election, to give exchange members wider access to the marketplace. Mr Nick Parsons, head of the treasury advisory group at Canadian Imperial Bank, said the market was beginning to see increasing value in the 9 to 12-month area as the idea of two elections this year, with the Tory party victorious in a second, October, election started to circulate in the City. Although a definite lead for Labour emerged in the weekend's opinion polls, the results still point to either a hung parliament with Labour as the biggest party, or to a very slim Labour majority. The market scenario, according to Mr Parsons, is that given the state of public sector finance and the nervousness of the currency markets, the Labour government would probably have to raise interest rates. This unpopular measure would make it harder for them to win a second election, leaving the way open for a Conservative victory. The June 1993 sterling contract, which opened at 89.85, closed up at 89.93. Generally money was cheap. The Bank of England revised its initial forecast liquidity shortage from Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m in the late morning. Early assistance of Pounds 742m included Pounds 575m of band-1 bank bills, Pounds 118m of band-2 Treasury bills and Pounds 49m of band-2 bank bills, all at 10 3/8 per cent. Later it provided further assistance, buying Pounds 158m band-2 bank bills. The shortage was removed before lunch. Overnight rates closed at 9 1/8-9.</p>

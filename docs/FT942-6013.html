			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Bosnian talks to reopen amid warnings Bosnia's warring parties were due in Geneva today for talks on the republic's future which diplomats are describing as virtually the last chance for a negotiated settlement. While Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his military chief Radko Mladic said they would certainly attend, there was uncertainty up to the last moment as to whether, and at what level, the Moslem-led government would be represented. The talks have been arranged amid warnings from western observers that the conflict could soon escalate, and a series of grim new revelations about the scale on which ethnic cleansing has been practised in Bosnia. 'People who are close to the peace process give the current talks about a one-in-four chance of succeeding,' said Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies in London. France, and to a lesser extent Britain, were growing doubtful about the feasibility of retaining troops in Bosnia for another winter. Meanwhile, the latest revelations about ethnic cleansing were reinforcing the determination of the Moslems and their international sympathisers to resist any settlement that appeared to reward Serb military gains. The UN said 550 people crossed into Croatia yesterday, the latest in a stream of Croats and Moslem civilians who have been leaving the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka under pressure from local warlords. Separately, a UN commission on war crimes, in a report published in part by Reuters news agency, said 50,000 people had been killed or deported in one relatively small area of north-west Bosnia, around Prijedor. 'It is unquestionable that the events in the Prijedor region since April 30, 1992 qualify as crimes against humanity. Furthermore, it is likely to be confirmed in court under due process of law that these events constitute genocide,' the commission found. Despite the gloomy background, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy to Bosnia, sounded a more optimistic note after two rounds of talks with Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. He said he thought the Geneva talks would lead to a ceasefire. However, the government in Sarajevo, bolstered by the new alliance between Croats and Moslems, has expressed reluctance to take part in further talks unless the Serbs withdraw fully from the UN 'safe area' of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. The Serbs say their troops in the Gorazde area have a legitimate function of maintaining order and protecting Serb refugees.</p>

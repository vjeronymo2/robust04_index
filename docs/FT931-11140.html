			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Government stance over subsidy remains complex SINCE THE collapse of Daf was announced on Tuesday, the government has been adamant that the company cannot be helped from public funds. The true position may be slightly more complex. The official position is that government aid of any sort would be disallowed by Brussels, particularly in an industry with such a history of competitive subsidy as motors. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the only allowable source of funds is regional grants (technically, regional selective assistance, or RSA). RSA grants are for individual investment projects, with strict criteria. The plant must be located in an assisted area; it must be commercially viable; it must need assistance to go ahead with the project; the project must contribute to the regional and national economy; and it must either create jobs or safeguard them. Daf's Leyland plant qualifies on most criteria. However, as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the Commons on Tuesday, Daf applied for Pounds 450m of such assistance just before the general election in April. It was told it could only have Pounds 18m, and did not pursue the idea. Mr Heseltine also told MPs: 'Were there to be a request for short-term working capital . . . such a request could be put to my department by a myriad of different companies in the motor industries and many others.' The European truck industry has received assistance from individual countries in the past, however. The most striking instance is Leyland Trucks. When it was sold to Daf in 1987, the government wrote off almost Pounds 600m of debts and accumulated losses. The figure was to have been higher, but the EC intervened. Similarly, in October Daf received a state-backed loan of Fl67m from the Dutch government and a further loan of BFr2.2bn from the Flemish regional government. No commercial banks were involved and the governments had the option to convert the loans into shares. Assuming the loans were on a commercial basis, it could be argued that no subsidy was involved. However, of the three governments involved with Daf, the UK was the only one not to contribute.</p>

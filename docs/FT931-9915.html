			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Power chiefs reach accord on coal-fired electricity REGIONAL ELECTRICITY companies told the government yesterday that they had resolved potential differences over coal-fired power which had threatened to delay a solution to the pits crisis. Company chiefs assured officials at the Department of Trade and Industry that they have broadly agreed on the take-up of power generated by the coal which the electricity generators have tentatively agreed to buy from April. The move came as British Coal clashed with the National Union of Mineworkers over the future of 10 collieries whose closure has been declared illegal by the High Court. Mr Mark Stephens, acting for the NUM, said he had started proceedings yesterday against British Coal seeking an explanation why it had failed to comply with a High Court ruling on consultation over the 10 pits. British Coal said it would ask the High Court to confirm that it had complied with the ruling. The assurance to the DTI by 11 of the 12 regional companies is significant because their agreement is essential to support the tentative agreement between British Coal and the generators for the sale of 40m tonnes of coal next year and 30m tonnes in each of the four subsequent years. The regional companies are not yet prepared to sign agreements to take the coal-fired power, but they have indicated that no significant problems remain.</p>

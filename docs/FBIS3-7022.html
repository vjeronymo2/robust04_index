I have  toured many places in Japan, and I have been able to see for  myself where ROK-Japan relations are close and where they remain  not close.    There have been two big events of misfortune in relations  between the countries -- the war of 1592-97 and the 36 years of  colonial rule [1909-45]. It is regrettable that these  unfortunate historical events are still having their effects.  Historical events do not disappear completely but, given deep  mutual understanding, they can in fact beget strong relations of  friendship and cooperation.    Last year, about 2.6 million people visited each other's  country, and cultural exchanges are extensive. In the past, the  ROK Government put restraints on such things as Japanese  entertainment films and pop songs because it was thought that  these would adversely affect Korean society. The new government  has so far taken the position of opening up such types of  popular culture step by step, in view of the past events  concerning Japan. The question -- as it always has been -- is  that of when [to open up completely].    Next year it will be 50 years since the ROK became  independent, and 30 years since ROK-Japanese relations were  normalized. Maybe the time has come to think specifically about  the timing of lifting the bans, to enable the new governments of  the two nations to solidify their friendly, cooperative  relations. There are plans for the ROK-Japanese production of  movies, and there are also plans to show Korean movies in Japan.  Starting slow and then moving more quickly -- that is the way  we should do it. It is important that in the meantime the  people of both nations resolve, one by one, the issues that are  impeding their cultural exchanges.  <H5>  Economic Relations </H5>   The removal of the trade imbalance is a major pending issue.  South Korea had a $8.4 billion trade deficit with Japan last  year, and its accumulated deficit with Japan increased to $82.6  billion.    As a way of remedying the problem, Korea called on Japan to  implement "political considerations," for instance by removing  tariff and nontariff barriers on Korean products and by making  more technologies available to Korea. But such remedies lacked  practicality and thus only helped to complicate the two  countries' relations.    Consequently, the new government is trying to review this  problem from the viewpoint of "economic logic." There is also a  desire to create an atmosphere which can attract Japanese  companies possessing technology to invest in the country. What  we want to do is to improve on the system so that the  technologies of South Korea and Japan can be combined in  promoting industries.    Technical training carried out for small and medium  enterprises based on the action plans that came out of the 1992  ROK-Japanese summit has been effective.    But Japan needs to create conditions that will enable the  Japanese market to import more Korean goods. Japan's tariffs on  Korean products are very low. Thus, it can be said that the  outer walls have been taken down but that the problem now lies  with the inner walls.    For instance, even if a Korean company wants to sell  Korean-made vehicles to Japan, the former government officials  who now lead Japanese industry would not accept them. The  Japanese Government itself is making efforts to deal with the  situation by implementing a complaint arbitration system, but  the system is not working well. We will do some soul-searching  on our part and will make efforts to increase our exports to  Japan, but unless Japan takes action to take down the inner  walls by easing controls on foreign products, the problem really  cannot be solved.  <H5>  War Reparations </H5>   Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark specifically and  clearly admitting an "act of aggression" [Japan's invasion of  other countries in World War II] is considered refreshing and  has been highly appreciated [in South Korea].    As for the issue of Army comfort women, President Kim  Yong-sam takes the position of "not seeking financial  compensation from Japan," and the [Korean] government is  providing payments to aid the lives of these people. The ROK  Government will not make any further requests with respect to  this issue, but neither is Japan coming up with any specific  measures to deal with the matter.    Where the question of postwar reparations is concerned,  there are many other pending issues, such as assistance to South  Koreans left in Sakhalin and suits filed against the Japanese  Government by South Korean residents in Japan who were wounded  while serving in the Japanese Army. To resolve these, there is  no other way but for the two countries to come together and  tackle the issues sincerely and steadily within the framework of  the ROK-Japanese treaty.    It is important to learn from history if we do not want to  repeat the mistakes of the past. It would be desirable to  entrust private-sector specialists from the two countries with  the work of preparing schools' history textbooks which are not  biased and to encourage them to cooperate in studies otherwise.    In an Independence Day speech, President Kim said something  different from what past presidents had said. The president  said, "We must not cling to the emotions of past days. The  country must have confidence and pride in itself, and must  cooperate and compete with Japan in an open and frank manner."    What is demanded is a perspective on how Japan and South  Korea, which have common values with respect to a free democracy  and a market economy, should cooperate in contributing to the  coexistence and coprosperity of East Asia and the world in the  future.    Japan is about to reach a big turning point in foreign  relations, by wanting to become a permanent member of the UN  Security Council, for example. In doing so, Japan must first of  all make its connections with its nearest neighbor, South Korea,  sturdier. Otherwise, Japan's dealings with the other nations of  Asia will not go smoothly, either. Japan is asked to think  clearly about the roles appropriate for it as a great nation.  That will better enable Japan's neighbors to formulate a policy  toward it.  <H5>  North Korean Nuclear Issue </H5>   We are disappointed by the actions of North Korea (DPRK) on  the nuclear issue.    It is beneficial for that country itself and desirable for  the peace and stability of East Asia for North Korea to clear up  the nuclear issue and to behave as a responsible member of the  international community. I think that the North -- which has so  many issues on its plate, such as the problems of maintaining  its political system and of reconstructing its economy -- is  using the nuclear issue as a trump card. There is the question  of how much longer the international community can put up with  all of this. The situation is getting precarious. As far as  South Korea is concerned, it has no other choice but to act  according to strict principles.    President Kim Yong-sam called for a South-North summit, in  hoping to find a solution to the nuclear issue. If the summit  becomes a reality, and if agreements made at the summit are  implemented, mutual trust will grow, and this can develop into  South-North exchanges and economic cooperation.    For that to happen, it is important that the North actively  tackle the task of fulfilling the matters that have been agreed  on at the meetings of U.S.-DPRK senior officials. The North  should recognize fully that if it plays games with the United  States for too long, the latter's patience will wear out.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Sri Lanka poll snub for ruling party Sri Lanka's ruling United National party has been thrown into turmoil by its first big electoral defeat in 17 years. The party, which is preparing for a presidential election later this year and a general election in early 1995, was heavily defeated late last week in provincial council polls in the island's southern province. The party won just 23 seats, against 32 for the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom party led by Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The result was widely seen in Colombo as a vote against the policies of President D B Wijetunga, who took power last year after the assassination of President Ranasinge Premadasa. Mr Wijetunga has championed a hard-line approach to the Tamil Tigers, separatist guerrillas in the north of the island who want to create an independent homeland for the country's Tamil minority. The pursuit of the Tigers suffered a setback last November when the militants stormed an army base in the north, killing at least 200 soldiers and capturing much valuable equipment. While Mr Premadasa also pursued the Tamil Tigers vigorously, he softened his attack with a broad-based political appeal to moderate Tamils and to other minorities, including Moslems and tea plantation workers of Indian Tamil origin. A populist at heart, he used poverty-alleviation and public housing programmes to help win hearts - and votes. Unlike Mr Premadasa, who came from a poor background, Mr Wijetunga comes from an elite social group - the Kandyans. He has adopted a more condescending attitude to the minorities, saying they must regard the Sinhala majority as 'the great tree' on which other communities hang like 'creepers'. Mr Wijetunga has also been less assiduous in cultivating Mr S Thondaman, the only Tamil minister and a powerful trade unionist, whom Mr Premadasa made a point of favouring. Mr Premadasa's popularity enabled the government to push through an economic restructuring programme supported by the IMF, which included privatisation and austerity measures. The poll defeat may lead Mr Wijentunga to adopt more popular economic policies, possibly including spending increases.</p>

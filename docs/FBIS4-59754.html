			<p>BFN     [Text] An official in the Ministry of Defense denied  absolutely the claims that the forces of the bloody and  adventurous al-Ahmar family gang had seized the al-'Anad  military base. It also denied that any unit of the forces of  unity, democracy, and modernization, or any of their members,  had surrendered as alleged by the military sources in Sanaa.  The official source in the Ministry of Defense confirmed that  the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization are waging  heroic defensive battles toward Karish and al-Rahidah, and are  achieving sweeping victories, about which we are not boasting as  is the information media of the criminal al-Ahmar family. It is  our intention, however, to confirm to our Yemeni people, the  Arab public, and the world that we are waging a battle of  defense against [as heard] our people's dignity, their honor,  and their right to a free and dignified life.</p>

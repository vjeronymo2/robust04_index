			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Pale] </F>   [Text] The talks between the military commanders of the  Serbian and the Muslim sides -- General Ratko Mladic and [B-H  Army Commander General] Rasim Delic -- which were scheduled to  take place at Sarajevo airport yesterday, have not started yet.  The mediator in the talks, which should result in the signing of  a cease-fire agreement, today held talks with General Mladic and  conveyed to him the new demands posed by the Muslim side.  Namely, General Rose reported that Rasim Delic was making his  arrival to the airport and the talks conditional upon the  withdrawal of the Serbian army from all the positions around  Gorazde to the lines held prior to the outbreak of the latest  clashes.    General Mladic warned UN Protection Force Commander General  Rose not to accept any conditions for talks and said that only  an instantaneous halt of all combat activities on all the  separating lines in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina can be  discussed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Nine out of a group of 17  Palestinian deportees arrived in Cairo from Algeria today. They  were scheduled to return to the occupied territories last week.  These deportees will be joined by eight others who will arrive  tomorrow ahead of their return to the occupied territories.  Deportee Muhammad Abu-Shanab said this group was deported in  1989 for involvement in the intifadah. He said that despite his  companions' joy over their return, they will be even happier  when all the deportees return and all the detainees in Israeli  jails are released.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: Shock troops for the front line .. MICHAEL HESELTINE has been given a starring role in Mr John Major's 'A' team for the election campaign. The sole remaining survivor of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1979 cabinet - and the architect 11 years later of her downfall - Mr Heseltine has emerged as the most aggressive spokesman for the man who beat him in the race for the Conservative party leadership. The environment secretary will be among the most prominent of the party's television 'stars' during the campaign. If Mr Major were to lose the election badly he would almost certainly re-emerge as a leadership challenger. CHRIS PATTEN is the Conservatives' political philosopher turned party propagandist. Long regarded as one of the most intelligent 'thinkers' on the Tory left, as party chairman he has become the key strategist in Mr Major's election team. After a determined effort last year to shave the rougher Thatcherite edges off his party's image, Mr Patten has now switched his focus to attacks on Labour's tax, spending and trade union policies. With an estimated Pounds 20m budget at his disposal, the 47-year-old MP for Bath is promising the most elaborate and expensive election campaign in British politics. ROBIN COOK is acid-tongued. His friends and foes alike are well aware that the sharply intelligent shadow health secretary does not suffer fools gladly. Cool to the point of aloofness, the MP for Livingston prefers the stiletto to the sledge-hammer and wields it with considerable effect. Widely regarded as a potential leftwing candidate for the Labour leadership, Mr Cook, 46, belongs to the progressive, pro-electoral reform strand of radicalism surging through the constituency parties. He needs a good campaign and, with health high on Labour's agenda, is expected to have one. JOHN SMITH is Labour's trump card in the credibility war with the Tories. The shadow chancellor, 53, has honed his debating skills as an Edinburgh advocate to prove a formidable television performer, more than capable of 'selling' Labour's economic policy. With the election focusing on the tax cuts versus public spending argument, his reassuring Scottish burr could make the difference between victory or defeat. One of the few Labour frontbenchers to have served in a Cabinet - trade secretary in the Callaghan government - his next job will either be in the Treasury or as opposition leader. CHARLES KENNEDY, 32, the Liberal Democrats' president and health spokesman, will help the fresh-faced image that the party hopes to project. MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye since 1983, his strengths are an irreverent wit, charm and expertise in communicating - in print, on radio or television. His weaknesses are his lack of gravitas and paucity of political ambition. He will not be in the party's inner circle responsible for strategic election planning. Brought up in Fort William he surprised himself when he beat a Tory minister to win his seat as a Social Democrat MP. DES WILSON, campaign director for the Liberal Democrats, will not only supervise behind-the-scenes operations but do star turns on television. The 51-year-old, ruddy-faced New Zealander, still with an antipodean twang, has a contagious enthusiasm, but also a reputation for tetchiness and selfishness when the going gets rough. His campaigning zeal dates from his involvement with the Shelter lobby group for the homeless in the late 1960s. He can run effective campaigns on shoe-string budgets - largely by injecting boundless personal energy. He also writes racy, lightweight novels.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Securities trading hits record level in Frankfurt TURNOVER on the Frankfurt securities market reached a record DM2,430bn (Dollars 1,500bn) last year, a rise of 2 per cent. Trading in bonds was up sharply, while share dealings fell, although the DAX share index rose by 15.5 per cent on the year. Figures for German securities markets as a whole - there are eight bourses - showed that Frankfurt increased its share of business to 70 per cent from 66 per cent. The German securities market federation said total German turnover in bonds and stocks was DM3,450bn, a drop of 5 per cent. In Frankfurt, turnover in bonds was 21 per cent higher at DM1,520bn, while business in shares fell by 20 per cent to DM904bn. The city's traditional predominance of bond trading over stocks was thus restored, the Frankfurt Securities Exchange said. Average daily turnover in Frankfurt rose from DM9.6bn to DM9.7bn. The exchange said both total turnover and turnover in shares alone was higher in the first than in the second half.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe prepares Spanish 10-year bond contract THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is preparing to launch a new 10-year Spanish government bond futures contract which will compete directly with a contract on Meff RF, the Spanish futures exchange based in Barcelona. Liffe's decision to launch a rival contract was sharply criticised by Mr Jose Luis Oller, Meff RF's chief executive. 'We think it is the wrong policy for a market which is not very large,' he said. '(Liffe is) going to segment the market and split the liquidity.' Meff's 10-year contract currently trades around 6,500 contracts a day, while its three-year contract is hardly traded. Liffe argued that the new contract would be positive for the market. 'The listing. . .will increase international participation in the 10-year Spanish government debt market, widening distribution and hence potentially contributing to a reduction in the funding cost of this debt,' said Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman. Liffe already trades contracts listed on other domestic exchanges, such as German bund and Italian bond futures. The new Liffe contract, which starts trading on March 10, is designed to tap international interest in the Spanish government bond market, which is recovering after a severe dip last year. Foreign holdings currently account for around 20 per cent of the market, according to Bank of Spain figures, down from around 33 per cent a year ago. International participation is expected to recover further. 'Of all the high-yielding markets, Spain has most of the right credentials,' according to Mr Steve Major, an economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities. The introduction of the Liffe contract is expected to encourage spread-trading between markets, using other government bond futures listed on Liffe. The move is also likely to promote the development of a more active repo market in Spanish government bonds, traders said.</p>

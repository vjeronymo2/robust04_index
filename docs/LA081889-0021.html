			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANTIAGO FIT TO TRAVEL; PADRES WIN;  </P> <P> CATCHER CLEARS WAIVERS, CAN BE DEALT UNTIL AUG. 31  </P> <P> On what should have been a momentous and joyous occasion Thursday, Padre  pitcher Bruce Hurst instead found himself in the middle of a controversy of  which he wanted no part.  </P> <P> Hurst won the 100th game of his big-league career, 6-2, over the New York Mets  in front of 40,406 at Shea Stadium. But little did he realize the debate his  performance would trigger.  </P> <P> Just when it appeared safe to presume that catcher Benito Santiago would be  remaining with the Padres, it's now anyone's guess whether he'll return in  1990.  </P> <P> Manager Jack McKeon revealed before the game that the Padres have not only  requested waivers on Santiago, but that he has cleared them, making him  eligible to be traded to any major league club before Aug. 31, when playoff  rosters are frozen.  </P> <P> The Padres will continue to dangle Sandy Alomar Jr., now in triple-A, in front  of contenders in need of a front-line catcher. But McKeon said that if a team  wants one for the pennant race, it will likely seek Santiago, not Alomar.  </P> <P> "If I was a pennant contender," McKeon said, "I'd want Santiago. I wouldn't  take a chance on a kid.  </P> <P> "But I'm not going to give up Santiago for three or four young prospects, I'll  tell you that right now. That's why I don't think anything will get done. Maybe  in the winter, but not now.  </P> <P> "Hypothetically, would the Mets trade us (Juan) Samuel and (Sid) Fernandez for  Santiago? No, not right now. Would the Astros trade us (Ken) Caminiti and  Gerald Young for Santiago? No, not right now.  </P> <P> "Maybe in the winter, they'll make that offer, but not now."  </P> <P> McKeon, who is in the market for a young shortstop, a center fielder and a  starting pitcher, could possibly fill one of those positions by trading Alomar,  perhaps two by trading Santiago.  </P> <P> "Who knows what will happen, maybe it'll be Alomar going, he's the best in the  minors," he said. "The thing is, he (Alomar) could have been a real bargain for  somebody last winter. They could have gotten a pretty good deal. But now, it's  going to cost them.  </P> <P> "It's supply and demand, and I've got the supply. If you want them, come and  get them. It just depends on who wants to take a chance.  </P> <P> "Columbus took a chance and discovered America."  </P> <P> The Padres also are realizing more and more that it would be less of a risk  trading away Santiago than they originally thought.  </P> <P> Sure, Santiago is an All-Star who very well might be the best in the league  right now. But when the ace of your pitching staff struggles with Santiago  behind the plate and thrives with backup Mark Parent, it raises your curiosity.  </P> <P> Yes, it was Parent catching once again with Hurst (12-9) on the mound Thursday,  marking the third consecutive time he has caught Hurst, the fourth time in five  starts.  </P> <P> McKeon calls it a coincidence. Santiago is not so sure. Hurst refuses to get  involved.  </P> <P> But the difference when Parent, and not Santiago, is behind the plate in  Hurst's starts is quite clear:  </P> <P> Hurst is 5-2 with a 1.90 ERA in eight starts with Parent. He has thrown four  complete games, and the one no-decision occurred when he pitched 10 shutout  innings against Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Hurst is 7-7 with a 3.54 ERA in 18 starts with Santiago as catcher. He has had  four complete games with four no-decisions.  </P> <P> So Bruce, just who would you rather have in the lineup when you're pitching?  </P> <P> "I'm not getting in the middle of this," Hurst said. "I don't make up the  lineup."  </P> <P> While Hurst sidestepped the issue, Santiago stepped into full view, saying that  he's becoming rather annoyed by the implication. He says he understands when  he's provided an occasional day off but he doesn't think it fair that Parent  should be Hurst's personal catcher. Most of all, he said, he'd just like to be  told once and for all that he'll remain a Padre, not read rumors every day  where he's going next.  </P> <P> "I'm getting tired of all this stuff," said Santiago, who is hitting .239 with  six homers and 41 RBIs. "They don't know what they're going to do. I'm tired of  having my name in the papers every day. They leave me hanging."  </P> <P> Parent, on the other hand, would gladly trade places with Santiago but  realistically knows that he's destined to be a backup. He's sure that  eventually either Santiago or Alomar will be traded, but the only effect it'll  have upon him , he says, is that he would receive additional playing time if  Alomar were the catcher who was kept.  </P> <P> "If we're going to be close going into September," Parent said, "I'm pretty  positive I'll be catching a decent amount, to see if we can win this thing. But  if we go into September ei ght or nine (games) back, I'm sure I'll be warming  up guys in the bullpen."  </P> <P> McKeon said that Alomar, who already has more than 90 RBIs, will join the  Padres sometime in September. If the Padres still are in the pennant race, it's  logical to assume that Alomar will play only sporadically. If they're out of  it, expect him to play almost every day.  </P> <P> "It'd be great just to have him up here," said Roberto Alomar, Sandy's younger  brother, who obtained the second four-hit game of his career Thursday. "The  best thing would be if we could play together on the Padres with my dad (third  base coach Sandy Sr.) here."  </P> <P> The Padres (60-61) would like to put all trade talk behind them for now and  just concentrate on getting into the pennant race. And when they have games  such as Thursday's, they believe there's no reason why they should be left  behind in August.  </P> <P> With just two batters in their lineup having faced Met pitcher Frank Viola  (traded three weeks ago from the Minnesota Twins) the Padres greeted him  rudely. They pounded out four runs and five hits in the first inning en route  to their biggest offensive performance of the season against the Mets.  </P> <P> It might not have looked pretty at times, with the Padres finding every  conceivable hole in the first two innings, but the runs all counted the same.  </P> <P> "We used our short-yardage offense," said McKeon, whose team had just one  extra-base hit (a double) among their 13. "We hit them like he threw: nice and  soft."  </P> <P> So even though Hurst allowed 10 baserunners in the first four innings, with his  early 5-2 lead, the only real trouble he ran into occurred in the fourth, when  Howard Johnson stepped to the plate with two on. Pat Dobson, the pitching  coach, came out and said to feed Johnson outside fastballs, preventing him from  pulling the ball.  </P> <P> Johnson swung at the first fastball he saw, popping up to first baseman Carmelo  Martinez, and the Mets' final threat was over. They never again reached second  base the rest of the game, managing just three singles as Hurst pitched his  eighth complete game of the season.  </P></p>

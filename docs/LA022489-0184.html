			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KAREEM ASSAULT CASE NOT SETTLED  </P> <P> Lawyers for Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and an Italian man  who claims Abdul-Jabbar injured him during a shoving incident in a Phoenix  shopping mall have failed to reach an agreement. The negotiations Thursday  before Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Barry Schneider could have avoided  a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday in Municipal Court. Abdul-Jabbar, 41, the  NBA's all-time top scorer, faces two misdemeanor charges in the April 21, 1988,  incident. Fernando Nicolia, 40, of Rome claims he suffered facial injuries when  Abdul-Jabbar stiff-armed him as he was trying to videotape the basketball  player in the Metrocenter mall.  </P></p>

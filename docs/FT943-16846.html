			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Growth puts pressure on prices Robust US economic growth is putting upward pressure on prices in the manufacturing sector, purchasing managers reported yesterday as separate reports on business confidence and construction spending underlined the continuing vitality of the economic recovery. The purchasing managers' index of prices paid by manufacturers rose two percentage points to 73.5 per cent, the highest level since August 1988 when the Reagan boom was still under way. The index shows the direction of price changes, but not their magnitude as it is based on the proportion of com-panies reporting increases as opposed to decreases in prices. The overall purchasing managers' index - a guide to manufacturing output - registered 57.5 per cent in June, slightly below the May reading of 57.7 but still a sign of steady growth; 17 out of 20 manufacturing sectors reported an improvement in business conditions from May. The overall index has hovered around 57 per cent since last December. Readings of 50 per cent or more indicate the economy is growing. Indices measuring the strength of new orders and new export orders rose last month, indicating growth of manufacturing production later this year. Chief executives' 'assessment of the current state of the US economy is at the highest level in 10 years', said Mr Jason Bram, an economist at the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group. The board's index of business confidence dipped slightly to 64 in the second quarter from 65 in the first three months, but remained well above the level in the second half of last year when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent. More than 80 per cent of respondents said general economic conditions had improved over the past six months; fewer than 5 per cent cited a deterioration. The dip in the overall index reflected a slightly less optimistic view of future business conditions, probably prompted by the recent rise in bond yields. Construction spending rose 0.9 per cent in May to stand 2.9 per cent higher than its average level in the first quarter, confirming a strong rebound after severe winter storms. Construction was up 11 per cent from May last year. The official index of leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second month, but many economists regard it as a barometer of current, rather than future, economic conditions.</p>

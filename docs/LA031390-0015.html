			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE EXPECTED TO BE TWICE AS GRAND -- AND AS GREEN  </P> <P> Saturday's second Ventura County St. Patrick's Day Parade promises to be twice  as large and every bit as green as last year's event.  </P> <P> The procession, starting at 11 a.m. at Main Street and Ventura Avenue in  downtown Ventura, is expected to draw the limit of 100 entries, more than twice  as many as the 40 attractions of last year, said parade Director Bob Pollioni.  </P> <P> Pollioni said Ventura Councilman and former Mayor James L. Monahan, the grand  marshal, will set the mood by carrying "Paddy's Pig," a green-dyed piglet, as  the parade travels south along Main to its final destination at Ash Street.  </P> <P> The porker is "only green for the day," Pollioni said, noting that its nontoxic  coloring can easily be washed off.  </P> <P> Other parade highlights will include a Blarney Castle float representing the  King and I restaurant, whose leprechaun entry won the unofficial top prize in  1989; the marching bands of Ventura and Buena high schools; the "Big Red  Locomotive" of the American Legion's Forty and Eight Society; a green fire  engine provided by the Ventura County Fire Department, and the Ventura Trolley,  carrying mayors and other officials from throughout the county.  </P> <P> Other highlights include Irish dancers and minstrels, equestrian groups and a  drum and bugle corps representing the Elks lodges of Ventura and Santa Barbara  counties.  </P> <P> As it did last year, the parade will include some of the county's families of  Irish descent marching in traditional Old Country costumes.  </P> <P> Continuing another of last year's attractions, the public is invited to a  corned beef and cabbage meal starting at noon and continuing all afternoon at  the Elks Lodge, 11 S. Ash St.  </P> <P> The meal, which will be accompanied by Irish entertainment, costs $6 in advance  or $8 at the door. Advance tickets can be bought from parade committee members  or by calling the lodge at 653-1430.  </P> <P> Monahan, chairman of the parade committee and a longtime advocate of a St.  Patrick's Day celebration in the county, said the event has two goals -- to  honor the county's Irish and would-be Irish, and "to recognize the good work of  the Elks, Rotary, Lions and other service organizations."  </P> <P> He added that several service groups will have entries in the parade.  </P> <P> Pollioni predicted that this year's crowd will easily exceed last year's  10,000.  </P> <P> "We'll not only have a much bigger parade, but we'll be helped because this  time around St. Patrick's Day falls on a Saturday."  </P> <P> Not everybody in Ventura, however, is an all-out parade enthusiast. Kevin  Seelos, manager of the Main Street Home Furniture Collection, which operates  three furniture stores on Main Street, said he and his brother, Brian, the  firm's owner, believe the event's mid-Saturday scheduling will be harmful to  downtown retailers.

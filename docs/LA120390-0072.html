			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS ARE A FAVOR  </P> <P> In regard to development of the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Ventura  Boulevard in Studio City, Polly Ward, claiming she represents homeowners in the  area, is protesting the issuance of liquor licenses to three restaurants  planned for the shopping center.  </P> <P> I am a homeowner just a few blocks away.  </P> <P> I believe the developer, Ira Smedra, is doing us a favor by bringing three  upscale restaurants, with liquor licenses, to the area.  </P> <P> I would like to go on record as a homeowner who approves of this kind of growth  and welcomes the presence of new businesses in my neighborhood, especially food  establishments that have proven successful in other parts of the city, as  Kaktus, the Daily Grill and Louise's Trattoria have.  </P> <P> Polly Ward does not speak for me or any of the residents of this area that I  know of.  </P> <P> Her arguments against these liquor licenses make no sense. There are indeed  other establishments that already serve liquor in the neighborhood (30 by her  count).  </P> <P> So what?  </P> <P> Studio City is not exactly characterized by drunks roaming the streets in  search of alcohol. This is an adult community. Its residents are quite capable  of monitoring their own alcoholic intake. We do not need a headmistress taking  care of us.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the people who agree with me comprise a silent majority. For  now, you have only my own strong objection to one self-anointed spokesperson  pretending she speaks for the residents of Studio City. She does not.  </P> <P> BETTY BERZON, Studio City  </P></p>

I wanted to tell you how irresponsible your paper is in  regard to the black community. Any newspaper that exercised an un-American  policy of censorship in totally ignoring the Louis Farrakhan speech, which  attracted 30,000-35,000 people, and then spent many editorial lines on a trite  story about black reparations needs to examine its editorial policy and its  lack of journalistic fairness.  </P> <P> BOOKER GRIFFIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

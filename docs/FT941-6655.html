			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Cleaning up continental competitors - Case Study, ISS / High-quality cleaning can be a pan-European business, according to the Danish company that leads the world in this field With much of its work done in the hours of darkness, the cleaning business occupies a twilight zone of the service industry. Yet providing sparkling environments for offices, hospitals and industrial premises can offer Europe-wide growth opportunities comparable to those in much higher-profile sectors. ISS, the Danish cleaning group which is the world's leader in this field, has built up a European network of high-quality cleaners. Mr Waldemar Schmidt, the 53-year-old managing director of ISS's European operations, responsible for turnover of Pounds 330m a year, says: 'If other people can have pan-European businesses, we asked ourselves, 'Why shouldn't this apply to cleaning?' ' Cleaning is traditionally a fragmented, regional business, given scant attention by customers. By offering high standards and encouraging companies to take a cost-conscious look at their cleaning bills, ISS claims it can lower overheads and promote efficiency. ISS prides itself on higher wages and better training than most competitors. 'Cleaning is generally thought of as a job nobody wants to do,' says Mr Theo Dilissen, managing director of Belgian operations. 'We offer incentives and training courses so people can upgrade. Our workforce is our product. We're helping our customers to become competitive.' ISS's customers range from multinationals, such as IBM, Philips and Monsanto, to the European Commission, and Vienna and Geneva airports. Cleaning budgets can be surprisingly large. The annual cleaning costs of Asea Brown Boveri, the international engineering group, exceed Dollars 75m. 'If you have an in-house cleaning team, it's not part of the core business,' says Mr Schmidt. The key to better productivity, he says, is to bring in quality-conscious outsiders, sometimes combining cleaning with other duties. Under a recent contract with Slovenian railways, ISS is to have 300 cleaners on the country's trains and stations, down from 600 previously. In an annual Pounds 2m contract with British Airports Authority, 130 ISS cleaners work in three shifts at Heathrow's Terminal One. They are encouraged not merely to sweep floors but also to give directions to travellers. ISS is developing additional services for its hospital customers, such as catering, portering, technical maintenance and equipment supply. With 130,000 employees in 20 countries, ISS is present in every main European country apart from France and Italy. Its share of the cleaning market is between 20 and 40 per cent in Scandinavia (where it is the market leader), 6 per cent in the UK (where it is No 3) and 2 per cent in Germany (No 8). Mr Schmidt says expansion is customer-driven. He estimates annual growth rates of the 'contracted out' cleaning market at 5 per cent in Austria, Switzerland, Germany and France, 7 per cent in the UK, and 10 per cent in Belgium and Greece. If ISS is right, more and more companies will be coming round to the view that cleanliness and competitiveness belong together. This is the fourth part of a 10-part series. Tomorrow: Technology.</p>

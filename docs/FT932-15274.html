			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Salomon debt downgraded by S&amp;P SALOMON, the US securities house, yesterday had about Dollars 8bn of outstanding debt downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency. The downgrade, which could push up the cost of Salomon's borrowings, reflected the firm's reliance on proprietary trading activity 'which has increased its vulnerability to quarterly earnings volatility,' S&amp;P said. Salomon's longer-term senior debt rating was cut to Single A minus from single A. Its subordinated debt rating fell to triple B plus from single A minus. Preferred stock received a rating of triple B from triple B plus, and the commercial paper rating was cut to A-2 from A-1. Mr Donald Howard, chief financial officer said: 'In my view, some rating agencies focus too heavily on the short-term volatility of Salomon's earnings and give inadequate weight to our results measured over longer time-frames and to the exceptional quality and liquidity of our assets.' Mr Howard said that the volatility of short-term earnings was a result of the firm's practice of valuing its inventory of securities on a mark-to-market basis. S&amp;P noted that Salomon's expected first-quarter loss was consistent with a pattern of sharp quarterly fluctuations during the last year. S&amp;P said the company's fixed income distribution business, and its trading and other operations, had a strong earnings capacity and the company's balance sheet was extremely liquid. Furthermore, the predicted first-quarter loss was not expected to have a material impact on the firm's Dollars 4.3bn equity base.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: United Energy in Pounds 7.3m counter offer for AmBrit UNITED ENERGY, the USM quoted oil and gas group, has made a recommended offer for AmBrit International which values the oil and gas exploration company at Pounds 7.3m and its loan stock at Pounds 1.1m. The 9-for-32 offer values each AmBrit share at 11.1p while the 51 United Energy for Pounds 16 nominal loan stock offer values each Pounds 1 of loan stock at 126p. United Energy's white knight offer comes a day before the closing date of a hostile bid from Pittencrieff, the Scottish oil production and communications group. Pittencrieff now has until 5 pm today to announce whether it plans to extend its offer period in order to make a higher bid to counter United Energy. Mr Michael Monroe, Pittencrieff chairman, said that United Energy's offers were 'extremely generous.' The United Energy offer includes a cash alternative of 9p per AmBrit share and 102p per Pounds 1 nominal of AmBrit loan stock which values the whole of the AmBrit share capital at Pounds 5.9m and the loan stock at Pounds 900,000. AmBrit directors holding 6 per cent of the stock have agreed irrevocably to accept the recommended offers and holders of 5.7 per cent of this stock have agreed irrevocably to take new United Energy shares. Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, said the final offer compared with Pittencrieff's final offer for each AmBrit share of 6p cash or the equivalent of about 6.8p in new Pittencrieff ordinary shares. Mr Alan Russett, AmBrit chairman, said the merger was 'far better for our shareholders and employees than the hostile and inadequate offer from Pittencrieff'.</p>

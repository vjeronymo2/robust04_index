			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Campari incurs Pounds 8.6m deficit Campari International yesterday exceeded the losses predicted in its latest profits warning in January. The leisure and sportswear company ann-ounced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 8.6m for 1993 on dwindling turnover; it achieved profits of Pounds 1.11m in 1992. The directors saw little sign of optimism for this year. 'Sales and forward order performance remains disappointing for the first half, with projected revenue and contribution slightly below budget,' they said. Campari has lost more than 80 per cent of its market capitalisation since Wing Tai, the Singaporean textile group, bought a 29.9 per cent stake in 1990. The impact of recession has led to a string of profit warnings, and the share price closed 1p lower yesterday at 46p, having traded at 150p a year ago. Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 54.2m). Excluding currency movements, the decline was 8 per cent; sales to continental Europe account for 74 per cent of the total. Net assets fell 46 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, although the company still has net cash of Pounds 400,000. The fall was partly due to the reduction of stock levels from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 7.5m, including a Pounds 1.2m provision for write-downs. There were also goodwill write-downs. New management has been attempting to tackle costs. It has already eliminated Pounds 4.4m from overheads, and is focusing on reducing the number of suppliers and on tighter management of working capital. Losses per share emerged at 83.2p (earnings of 0.79p). The dividend is omitted; a total of 12p was paid in 1992.</p>

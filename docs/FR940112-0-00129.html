			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> principal display panel  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means that part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel must be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part without obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding. This definition does not preclude utilization of alternate principal display panels on a label of a package, but alternate principal display panels must duplicate the information required to be placed on the principal display panel by this part. This definition does not preclude utilization of the container closure as the surface bearing the principal display panel if that label location is the one most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel of a label appearing on a cylindrical surface is that 40 percent of the circumference which is more likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under normal and customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel of a consumer commodity marketed in a decorative type container, or a container having a capacity of 1/4 ounce (7.4 mL) or less, may be considered to be a tear-away tag or tape affixed to the container and bearing the mandatory label information as required by this part, but the type size of the net quantity of contents statement shall be governed by the dimensions of the container itself. The principal display panel of a consumer commodity marketed on a display card to which the immediate container of the commodity is affixed may be considered to be the display panel of the card, and the type size of the net quantity of contents statement is governed by the dimensions of the display card.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> random package  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights, that is, packages with no fixed weight pattern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SI metric  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refers to units belonging to the International System of Units (abbreviated ``SI'' from the French,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Le Systeme International d'Unites <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), as interpreted or modified for use in the United States by the Secretary of Commerce. They include the SI units (together with their multiples and submultiples) as well as other metric units (e.g., the liter) that are accepted for use with the SI units because of their practical importance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> customary inch/pound  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refers to units belonging to the system of units used in the United States based on or derived from the ounce, pound, and ton for weight; the inch, foot, yard, and mile for length; the fluid ounce, pint, quart, and gallon for volume; and dry pint, dry quart, peck, and bushel for dry measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``e'' mark  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refers to the symbol ``e'' used in connection with the quantity declarations on labels of some consumer commodities marketed primarily in the European Community (EC). The ``e'' mark constitutes a representation by the packer or importer that the package to which it is applied has been filled in accordance with the average system of quantity specified by the EC. The average system is a method of declaring package fill in the EC and other countries of the world, including the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;500.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibited acts, coverage, general labeling requirements, exemption procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) No person engaged in the packaging or labeling of any consumer commodity for distribution in commerce, and no person (other than a common carrier for hire, or a freight forwarder for hire) engaged in the distribution in commerce of any packaged or labeled consumer commodity, shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any such commodity if such commodity is contained in a package, or if there is affixed to that commodity a label, which does not conform to the provisions of the Act and of the regulations in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Persons engaged in business as wholesale or retail distributors of consumer commodities shall be subject to the Act and the regulations in this part to the extent that such persons are engaged in the packaging or labeling of consumer commodities, or prescribe or specify by any means the manner in which such consumer commodities are packaged or labeled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1454(b)), shall, upon being prepared for distribution in commerce or for sale at retail, and before being distributed in commerce or offered for sale at retail, be labeled in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b) of the Act, shall bear a label specifying the identity of the commodity; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; the net quantity of contents; and the net quantity per serving, use or application, where there is a label representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications obtainable from the commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Regulations will be promulgated by the Commission exempting particular consumer commodities from one or more of the requirements of section 4 of the Act and the regulations thereunder to the extent and under such conditions as are consistent with the declared policy of the Act whenever the Commission finds that, because of the nature, form, or quantity of the particular consumer commodity, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with all the requirements otherwise applicable is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of consumers. Proceedings for the promulgation of such exempting regulations may be commenced by the Commission upon its own initiative or pursuant to petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person or group stating reasonable grounds for the proposed exemption, pursuant to Section 1.15 of this chapter of the Commission's general procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

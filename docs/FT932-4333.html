			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tenneco unit to close plant NEWPORT News Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of the US industrial conglomerate Tenneco, will close its Asheville Industries plant, and lay off 1,000 workers, in response to declining submarine and aircraft carrier work. Newport has recently suffered from cuts in spending by the US navy, its main customer, which have only been partly offset by efforts to diversify into the commercial shipbuilding market. The company posted revenues of Dollars 2.3bn last year, 17 per cent of Tenneco's total turnover. Newport News will close the Asheville plant by June next year, gradually laying off its 500 workers over the next 12 months, and cut back operations in Newport News shipyard where 500 workers are to lose their jobs, most from next week. Mr Pat Phillips, chief executive at Newport News, said that because of delays in US navy orders, the lay-offs and closure were essential in order to keep the shipbuilder competitive. In recent years Tenneco has cut costs in various subsidiaries, with improvement most marked in Case, the troubled farm and construction unit.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Heavy-Duty NMHC Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In setting NMHC standards for natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas-fueled heavy-duty engines (HDE), the Agency intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish standards which would provide the same level of NMHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control as the THC standards in effect for petroleum diesel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline HDEs. In the absence of speciated exhaust HC data on HDEs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., data on the level of the individual HC components in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust), EPA applied the results of an analysis done on light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and light-duty trucks to arrive at NMHC standards which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were 82.5 percent of the level of the corresponding THC standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The resultant standards were very close to those adopted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Air Resources Board (CARB), and in the NPRM the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested comment on whether it should adopt CARB's standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Every commenter who expressed an opinion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this issue urged EPA to adopt the CARB standards in order that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the California and federal standards be harmonized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences between its proposed NMHC standards and CARB's are so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small as not to be an air quality issue. Further, EPA has learned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the NPRM that the CARB standards were based on speciated data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from HDEs. Thus, as EPA believes that the speciated data provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a sounder basis than EPA's, the Agency is adopting CARB's NMHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for HDEs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Evaporative Emission Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM it was noted that, due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealed nature of gaseous-fueled vehicle fuel systems, their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``evaporative'' emissions (i.e., emissions of unburned fuel from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel storage system) are expected to be near-zero. Nonetheless,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency proposed evaporative emission controls for gaseous-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled vehicles in order to assure that the fuel systems are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaking. EPA proposed that the evaporative provisions for gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and methanol-fueled vehicles, which were in the process of being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised at the time of the proposal for this rule, be applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicles as well, with modifications to the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures as necessary to accommodate gaseous fuels. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also proposed that certification testing waivers be available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative testing in order to reduce the testing burden as much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible, given the likelihood of near-zero emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although one commenter supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed evaporative requirements for gaseous-fueled vehicles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citing potential fuel leaks from the vehicle refueling receptacle,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most of the comments received expressed opposition. In general,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most commenters said that, for safety reasons, as well as to simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the complete escape of fuel from the vehicle for economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, the fuel systems must be sealed. Since sealed systems are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a practical requirement of gaseous-fueled vehicles, they argued,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no need for EPA to regulate evaporative emissions. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, any certification testing required would be unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters felt that if EPA were to require some form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emissions showing that it should be in the form of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering evaluation of the system, or simply a one hour diurnal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency agrees with the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment that there are practical considerations other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions concerns which force the use of sealed fuel systems on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicles. As a result, EPA would expect their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emissions to be near-zero. However, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that it is prudent to have some kind of evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standard which can be enforced, in order to assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel system leaks do not become a problem. Thus, the same new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative provisions applicable to other vehicles beginning with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1996 model year will also be applied to gaseous-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at that time, recognizing that compliance with these standards is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional prior to the 1997 model year. The Agency does recognize,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that it is likely that, by virtue of their design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicles will emit well below the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Therefore, certification testing waivers will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for all gaseous-fueled vehicle evaporative provisions if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer can show that, by virtue of the vehicle's design,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it will always meet the applicable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Air Force Veteran Named to High-Ranking Hughes Post  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft has named James A. Abrahamson, the recently retired director of  the Strategic Defense Initiative, to the newly created job of executive vice  president-corporate development.  </P> <P> Abrahamson, who retired as an Air Force lieutenant general last March after a  33-year military career, is the highest ranking Hughes executive who did not  move up through the Hughes organization or that of Hughes' parent, General  Motors.  </P> <P> Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie said Abrahamson's experience in strategic  planning and management "will strengthen our efforts to expand into new areas  and build our company for the future."  </P> <P> Abrahamson will be the third-highest ranking Hughes executive, after Currie and  Hughes President Donald White. D. Kenneth Richardson, also an executive vice  president, is responsible for operations at Hughes' six major corporate groups.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Abrahamson said his considerable background in U.S.  space activities, which includes formerly heading up the Space Shuttle program,  will be an important foundation in his new strategic planning job at Hughes.  </P> <P> "Part of my challenge will be to examine this application of advanced  technology in the civil field," he said. Hughes derives about 80% of its  revenues from government contracts, while the other 20% is generated from sales  of commercial communications satellites.  </P> <P> "I personally believe the key to the future is to reduce the cost of individual  spacecraft and space operations," he said.  </P> <P> Abrahamson was credited by many political pundits with personally saving the  so-called Star Wars program from deeper congressional cutbacks in recent years.  Since his departure, the program has lost support from the White House and is  under sharp attack in Congress.  </P> <P> As a retired senior military officer, Abrahamson will be barred by federal law  from participating closely in programs that he was involved with during his  government service. "What I can't do is go back and sell to the government," he  said. "I am not going to do that, and in my job I have no requirement to do  that." RALPH VARTABEDIAN  </P></p>

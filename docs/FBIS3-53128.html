			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two weeks before the holding of the national  conference, the National Dialogue Commission [NDC] is about to  embark on the drafting of the final version of the proposed  document on the transition period. This follows a series of  consultations and meetings with numerous parties, associations,  and organizations. In this context, the NDC held a news  conference at the El Mithak building in Algiers today. Over to  Abdelmoumen Dekkar with this telephone dispatch:    [Dekkar] The meeting held between NDC rapporteur Abdelkader  Bensalah and representatives of the national media this  afternoon was aimed at assessing the dialogue process in its  last stage which culminated in a series of multilateral  meetings. These meetings are due to be concluded today with a  meeting with professional and youth organizations. The end of  the multilateral meetings does not mean that the door of the El  Mithak building [NDC headquarters] will now be shut. On the  contrary, consultations will continue between the NDC and its  partners in the dialogue.    Bensalah said that regarding the subject of clearing the air  and holding contacts with Islamic trends, the commission has  received from the authorities concerned definite guarantees that  a first batch of people will be released from detention centers  in the south in the next few days. He added that the commission  has received similar guarantees that house arrest orders will be  lifted on all those to whom the decision applied.    The NDC rapporteur went on to say that these measures have  been taken with a view to clearing the air, restoring people's  peace of mind, and thus providing the best conditions to ensure  the success of the national dialogue conference and achieve  national consensus. He added that the commission hopes that  this will be a major turning point toward the restoration of  tranquillity and the gradual return of civil peace.    Talking about the pilot study undertaken in connection with  the platform of dialogue and the reactions of some parties to  this study, Bensalah indicated that the commission based its  draft on the declaration of 1 November [1954], the 1989  Constitution, and the positions expressed by the parties to the  dialogue either in writing or verbally during numerous meetings  with the commission. He said that the document adopts the views  repeated by most members and added that it was impossible to  adopt the views of all sides at the same time and include them  in a single document. The NDC rapporteur stated that this  document is only, as its title indicates, a pilot study; all  parts of it are open to enrichment, amendment, and revision, he  asserted.    Regarding the position of the Socialist Forces Front, which  has decided to boycott the national conference, Bensalah said  that the commission heard of the front's position the same way  everyone did and that it had not been notified officially.  However, the rapporteur added, the commission stresses its  desire to involve everyone and not to dismiss anyone. At this  crucial period of its history, Algeria needs the effort,  sacrifice, and magnanimity of all its children, particularly  those who made huge sacrifices to enable Algeria to recover its  sovereignty and dignity, he stated.    We will try to give you further details on the meeting  between the NDC rapporteur and representatives of the national  media in our subsequent news bulletins.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINOSAUR DEATH-BY-COMET THEORY GETS NEW SUPPORT  </P> <P> Scientists examining ancient rocks have detected organic molecules that they  believe could only have been deposited when an extraterrestrial object,  probably a comet, crashed into the Earth 65 million years ago.  </P> <P> Some researchers say the finding lends powerful support to the hotly debated  theory that a cosmic collision threw up a worldwide dust cloud that hampered  photosynthesis and set off a mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other  animals and plants.  </P> <P> Other scientists, however, say there are puzzling questions in the report and  that the cause of the extinctions is still in doubt.  </P> <P> The detection of two extraterrestrial amino acids in rock layers deposited  around the time of the mass extinction represents "the final nail in the  coffin" of volcanism as an explanation for the mass extinction, said Jeffrey L.  Bada, professor of marine chemistry at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of  Oceanography.  </P> <P> "We have provided completely independent molecular evidence that there's no  question that a large object hit the Earth 65 million years ago," Bada said. He  advances no opinion on whether the impact actually caused the dinosaurs to die  off.  </P> <P> Walter Alvarez, a UC Berkeley geology professor who remains among the strongest  proponents of the impact theory, sees the amino acids -- which are the  essential building blocks of proteins -- as strong evidence for the theory. "I  can't imagine how you can explain it any other way," he said.  </P> <P> Bada and graduate student Meixun Zhao reported the results in today's issue of  the scientific journal Nature.  </P> <P> However, their findings appear unlikely to change the minds of those who look  to intense volcanism, rather than an object from outer space, to account for  the geological evidence of a cataclysm 65 million years ago.  </P> <P> "It's interesting. But you've got people who are true believers and people who  are skeptics. If you're a true believer, you'll grasp at any straw that  supports your case. If you're a skeptic, you too will grasp at any straw that  supports your case," said Charles L. Drake, professor of earth sciences at  Dartmouth College and a major proponent of the volcanism theory.  </P> <P> Also, some scientists regard the Bada-Zhao conclusions as premature because the  amino acids were found in larger amounts than would be expected after a cosmic  collision, and because the deposits were located above and below -- but not in  -- the geologic layer that marks the time of the extinctions.  </P> <P> The key evidence for the impact theory has been deposits of a rare element,  iridium, in sedimentary rock layers that were laid down about 65 million years  ago, around the time when dinosaurs disappeared. The idea was first published  in 1980 by Alvarez, his late father Luis, Helen Michel and Frank Asaro.  </P> <P> However, critics have contended that intense volcanism could both have  deposited the iridium and extinguished the species. Others argue that no single  factor was responsible for the mass extinction because the extinction was  already in progress at the time as a result of other, more gradual processes.  </P> <P> Unlike iridium, the two amino acids detected by Bada and Zhao could not have  come from massive volcanic eruptions because the molecules are destroyed by  heat, the researchers say in their Nature report. Furthermore, the amino acids  are common not in the Earth but in meteorites, they said.  </P> <P> Working over the last four years, they developed tedious purification methods  to isolate billionth-of-a-gram quantities of the two amino acids. They worked  with one- to two-ounce samples of rocks collected by the Alvarezes at a known  iridium site in Denmark.  </P> <P> They found the molecules, isovaline and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, or AIB,  present in quantities up to 2,000 times higher than in both deeper and  shallower rocks taken from the same site in Stevns Klint, Denmark.  </P> <P> The amino acids were not found in rocks taken from sites where there is no  iridium layer.  </P> <P> These molecules were ideal targets for confirming the impact theory because  they are exceedingly rare on Earth and are not known to be formed during  geologic processes but are common in meteorites, Bada said. Neither substance  can even be used by plants or animals, because their structure varies from that  of the amino acids in proteins that are the workhorse molecules in all living  things.  </P> <P> The AIB and isovaline were found in such large quantities that the most likely  explanation for their origin would be a comet, because it consists mainly of  water that could harbor the amino acids and their precursor molecules, whereas  a rocky asteroid could contain fewer of both, Bada said.  </P> <P> However, it is this "embarrassment of riches" that cosmo-chemist Edward Anders  of the University of Chicago says is the biggest obstacle to this Bada-Zhao  hypothesis.  </P> <P> For delicate amino acids to have survived an impact in such quantities, a major  part of the object would have to have survived the collision, implying a soft  impact that would seem unlikely, Anders said.  </P> <P> Bada suggests that the amino acids were plentiful because they may have somehow  resynthesized during the impact process.  </P> <P> Furthermore, previous analysis by Anders and others at Chicago found no "noble"  gases in the rocks around the iridium layer, yet they would have been more  likely to have survived an impact than amino acids would have, he noted. Noble  gases are inert elements common throughout the universe.  </P> <P> Also, the AIB and isovaline were found not in the iridium-containing layer but  in rocks that were a foot to a yard above or below the iridium. Bada said the  amino acids may have slowly migrated after the impact, accounting for that, an  explanation that deep-sea sedimentologist Wolfgang Berger at Scripps said is  plausible.  </P> <P> Anders, who thinks the Bada-Zhao conclusions may be premature, nevertheless  said he has no doubts about Bada's methods.  </P> <P> "He is going at it in a very responsible way," Anders said. "He is not a  trigger-happy person who comes up with an interesting result and makes a big  splash. He has sat on this data and worked on this problem for several years  trying to verify it in every possible way."  </P> <P> Furthermore, if the amino acids prove to have come from a comet, the  researchers will have shown something that international expeditions to study  Halley's Comet in 1986 were unable to do, Anders noted.  </P></p>

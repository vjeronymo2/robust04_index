			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Lucas to pay Dollars 12m to settle US claim Lucas Industries, the British-based aerospace and motor components group, is to pay the US Defence Department Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) to settle claims that it provided US forces with faulty equipment. A settlement reached with the US Attorney's office in New York provides for Lucas not only to pay the money but also to admit guilt of falsifying the results of tests on certain of its products and to keep in place procedures to make certain there can can be no repetition of the claims. This accord, which Lucas said yesterday would be placed before a federal court, ends two years of FBI investigations. It removes the possibility of court proceedings against Lucas Aul, a US subsidiary. The investigation sought to establish whether Lucas Aul supplied defective missile launching components and military radios which failed to meet specifications. The Components are used in Maverick ground-to-air missiles. Mavericks were the cause of 16 Allied deaths in two 'friendly fire' incidents on January 29 and February 26 1991 in the Gulf War. But the US authorities made clear there was no link between these deaths and the defective equipment. Lucas acquired Aul in 1986. Many procedures for testing components were in place before then. So were the Pentagon supply contracts.</p>

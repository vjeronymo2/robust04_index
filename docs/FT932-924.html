			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Widespread falls in D-Mark THE D-MARK slipped against virtually all the major currencies yesterday and set a new post-war low against the yen, writes Sandeep Deol. It closed in London at Y63.79, compared to Y64.50 on Wednesday. Against the dollar it weakened to DM1.7115 from DM1.6935, but it finished New York trading at DM1.7073. The D-Mark's decline began with a call from Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, for a meeting with German government ministers to discuss 'co-ordinated monetary policy easings'. Mr Alphandery said: 'The Germans must speed up their rate cuts.' The news had knocked the D-Mark to DM1.71 per dollar by mid-morning. The German Finance Ministry later denied that the two countries were discussing co-ordinated rate reductions, but pressure on the D-Mark intensified. There were strong rumours of Bundesbank action to buy D-Marks via German commercial banks to prop up the currency. However, any such defence action was hardly helped by reports from Japan that other Group of Seven nations would step up calls for cuts in German borrowing rates at next month's Tokyo summit. The increased pressure for a cut in German rates raised expectations that the German central bank might ease monetary policy at its council meeting next Thursday, although the fall in the currency may limit the Bundesbank's room to manoeuvre. Mr Keith Edmonds, international economist at NatWest Securities, believes the Bundesbank will not be forced into an early easing. As a result, the D-Mark may move up slightly before dipping again. The D-Mark's loss of favour has been reflected in the rise of the French franc. In spite of French interest rates being lower than German official rates, the franc firmed early yesterday against the D-Mark before slipping later on profit-taking. It ended unchanged at FFr3.363 per D-Mark. Sterling rallied against the weaker D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5125, up 2 pfennigs from the previous close. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4685, after Dollars 1.4725 on Wednesday. The pound's performance is being harmed by political tensions. Yesterday's resignation of another UK government minister was viewed by many traders as further eroding the government's credibility. However, assuming the political tension subsides, sterling could recover quickly. Many dealers report that continental European institutions are waiting to buy pounds when the political mood has settled. This is considered the more likely on the grounds that growth prospects this year for the UK economy are thought to be relatively good, compared with the gloomy outlook for much of the developed world. Elsewhere in Europe, the reduction of European interest rates continued as the Danish central bank cut its two-week repo rate by 15 basis points to 7.95 per cent.</p>

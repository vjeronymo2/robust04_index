			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Pensions ombudsman says his scope is too limited THE GOVERNMENT'S pensions ombudsman said yesterday he was able to resolve only 47 of more than 2,100 complaints received by his office last year. Nearly half were rejected for consideration because they were either out of his jurisdiction or concerned events that happened too long ago. Mr Michael Platt was delivering the first annual report since the office was established early in 1991. 'I think it only right to record that my inability to act in these circumstances has given rise to a sense of frustration among the members of some schemes who are worried that their pension rights may be insecure,' he said. He added that this lack of power should be taken up by government advisers currently reviewing pensions law. Mr Platt said the recession had tempted some employers to use their pension schemes in ways they should not. In some cases, this has resulted in underfunding of the scheme or in self-investment in a parent company already under pressure. Some of the complaints received by his office but determined to be out of his jurisdiction concerned the employers' use of pension scheme surpluses for their own purposes. Mr Platt urged the government to consider clarifying in law the question of the ownership of surpluses. The average complaint took seven months to handle, a period which Mr Platt said was too long to meet the requirements of the Citizen's Charter. Delays had occurred partly through the difficulties involved in setting up the ombudsman's office. Additional staff had been hired in recent months. Of the 47 complaints which were resolved by his office, only 18 were upheld in favour of the complainant and a further four decisions supported the complainant in part. In most of the other cases, the complaint was not upheld. A spokesman for the National Association of Pension Funds, the trade organisation for the industry, said the fact that fewer than half the complaints proved justified was evidence that serious problems did not exist in the pensions industry. 'The number of complaints upheld is quite reassuringly low,' he said, adding that the current trust law which governs pension arrangements is probably adequate. Nearly half the complaints which were not resolved were sent to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, a quasi-governmental body which provides advice to pensioners, because the ombudsman's rules require complainants to turn there for help first. Of the 922 cases referred to Opas, determinations were achieved in only 47 cases.</p>

The tax relief measure, agreed upon at a meeting of the  parties' policymakers, is intended for those who inherited land  between 1989 and 1991 when land prices skyrocketed amid a real  estate investment boom and plan to pay the tax in installments,  the officials said.    The coalition parties intend to implement the tax relief  measure as part of tax reforms for fiscal 1994, they said.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FLAP OVER PIGEONS IN TORRANCE HOME  </P> <P> The second appeal of a Torrance Building Department's decision to reject a  special animal permit for the keeping of racing pigeons was held on Sept. 5,  1989. Like the first, the appeal was made to the City Council. Again, the  outcome was the same: It's OK for residents to keep large quantities of  pigeons!  </P> <P> At issue is the rights of one household versus the rights of the surrounding  neighbors. Both appeals were made by citizens who are deeply involved in a  hobby/business which gives them satisfaction and income.  </P> <P> The "rats with feathers" create a nuisance for surrounding neighbors as well as  a health hazard. Both appeals required the council to weigh the benefits to one  household with the negative effects experienced by a greater number of nearby  neighbors. Both decisions by the council favored the pigeon proponent. A track  record is now established: The Torrance City Council favors the rights of  residents who create a nuisance! This is not acceptable!  </P> <P> A second track record is being established. Council Members Bill Applegate,  George Nakano and Dee Hardison (who voted against approving the permit) put  themselves in the position of the affected residents and judged the situation  with empathy. Around City Hall, Council Members Tim Mock, Mark Wirth and Dan  Walker (who voted in favor of approving the permit) laugh about the matter;  they think it is a joke. Mayor Katy Geissert was the swing vote in both  appeals.  </P> <P> Mayor Geissert had an interest in approving this latest permit approval. She  supported rewriting the city's long-standing animal control ordinance to allow  pigeon owners to seek a permit to keep more than four pigeons or doves. In  June, she voted in favor of a permit for a Country Village proponent even  though 24 neighbors petitioned the council to deny approval because the pigeons  create a nuisance.  </P> <P> Although the mayor admitted that residents in the more recent case should not  have to put up with the nuisance in their Los Codona neighborhood, she proposed  a "compromise." Her proposal will allow the nuisance to continue another six  months, during which time she hopes the pigeons will change their behavior.  </P> <P> Ridiculous!  </P> <P> This indecision demonstrates wanting leadership skills.  </P> <P> Quite frankly, the council has made a bad decision and has neglected the best  interest of the residents. Their loud and clear message is that the council  condones residents who cause problems and will not help affected residents to  get relief; handle your own nuisance problems!  </P> <P> This decision is the reason why increasing numbers of citizens are taking  matters into their own hands. It is clear that the council needs to be  reoriented in their responsibility to act in favor of the best interest of  their constituency rather than allow the dynamics of our community to become  upset by a few nuisance peddling residents.  </P> <P> DAVE BRENT  </P> <P> KEN KUSTRA  </P> <P> founders of Residents (of Country  </P> <P> Village) Against Pigeons, (RAP)  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / People: 'Managed career' leads to Pru The Prudential has recruited Symon Elliott, director of consumer banking in Britain at Allied Irish Bank, as its new managing director of Prudential Investment Products (PIP), to replace Alan Wren who left in September. Keith Bedell-Pearce, chief executive of the Pru's financial services group, explains that Wren's departure was prompted by a 'cleaning up' of responsibilities within this area. Hence, whereas Wren had previously been in charge of production, marketing and distribution, responsibilities on the distribution side - whether through direct sales or via intermediaries - had been passed to the managing directors in charge of the specialist salesforces. This leaves the managing director of PIP in charge of production, strategic marketing and customer service for unit trusts, PEPs, and currency funds. Bedell-Pearce says that the current climate afforded him a wide range of candidates in the course of his search, both 'seasoned campaigners from the unit trust and PEP business' as well as those from outside who measured up to his 'person specification'. Elliott, 35, who has an MBA from the London Business School, fell into the latter category. The financial services chief says he was attracted by an individual who had 'consciously managed his career'. After a spell in corporate planning at BP, Elliott was sales and marketing director at TSB Direct, and most recently director of consumer banking in Britain for Allied Irish Bank. 'At both TSB and Allied Irish, he had responsibility for delivering sales through distribution channels over which he had no direct control. It will be an identical situation at the Pru where you have to use persuasion rather than direct management control.' A contributory factor to Wren's departure was Bedell Pearce's decision to put expansion into continental Europe 'on hold' until the economic climate changed. Bedell-Pearce says that the decision, reached in April, has been vindicated given the current gloomy prospects for Germany, the country in which the Pru would have wanted to initiate its push into Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci continued discussions with  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in New York today on  possible sanction against the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK), the State Department announced here.    Gallucci began consultations on possible sanction against  the  DPRK with a South Korean special envoy and Japanese officials in  Washington on Friday [3 June] and Saturday.    "We've had useful and productive consultations so far with  officials from Japan and the Republic of Korea," said Christine  Shelly, State Department spokeswoman, at a regular news briefing.    "All sides had agreed to consult closely as the U.N.  Security  Council considers its next steps on the North Korean nuclear  issue," Shelly said.    "We are also continuing our exchanges up in New York, via  the  Security Council mechanisms and discussions in that context,"  she added.    "I think there's a very full range of exchanges on this  right  now," she claimed, but "at this point, no draft resolution has  been circulated or distributed in the council."    Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff  will be traveling to Japan and South Korea this week for more  discussions, Shelly said.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Douglas McGregor Knowingly or otherwise, every western manager who is applying the lessons learned on an organisational 'change' programme of any kind has become a follower of this social psychologist-turned college president (1906-1964). His influence has reached us by two routes over the past decade: through the work of popular writers such as Tom Peters, Robert Waterman, Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Warren Bennis, the leadership expert who was a pupil of McGregor; and via his impact on modern performance appraisal processes, reward systems and other personnel management techniques. McGregor's main contribution came just four years before his death, in The Human Side of Enterprise, a book which transformed into a convincing managerial theory the overworked and often cynical mantra that 'an organisation's greatest asset is its people'. The theory was taken to extremes by the 'human relations' school which followed McGregor: its excessive emphasis on bottom-up management at the expense of authority damaged his credibility. But the more balanced practice of his principles in recent years has rightly restored his reputation. McGregor's creed will be familiar to every manager trying to operate in a flat, high-performance organisation in Europe or the US today; that most people, in most situations, are best motivated by being treated as part of a community where objectives and responsibility are shared. They will then exercise self-direction and self-control, and use their creativity to help resolve the organisation's problems. This doctrine of 'intrinsic' motivation, which McGregor christened 'Theory Y', contrasted starkly with the traditional command-and-control doctrine propounded earlier in the century by, among others, Henri Fayll, and still practised by many organisations today. McGregor called this 'Theory X', and lambasted managers for subscribing to its underlying assumption that most human beings are lazy, avoid work and responsibility and need to be controlled, threatened and kicked in order to contribute even just adequately to organisational objectives. McGregor's distinction between theories X and Y has become so influential in the US and Europe over the past few years that it has been taken as being applicable around the world. But this is open to question. In a speech last month Gerrt Hofstede, an expert in national cultures, argued that the distinction is irrelevant, for instance, in south-east Asia, where people's attitudes to work, and to the groups of which they form part, are very different from those of westerners. As with so many other culture-bound management principles - eastern as well as western - the worst mistake of all is to think that McGregor's approach constitutes the 'one best way' of doing things in all circumstances. To embroider an accolade from Bennis, 'McGregorian chant' may be 'profoundly true' in the west, but not for everyone everywhere.</p>

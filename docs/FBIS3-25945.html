			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the  leading port city in north China, has established a complete  market system composed of both national and local markets, spot  goods and futures markets, and retail and wholesale markets.    An official of the municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce  said that over the past few years, the city government has taken  all possible measures to restore Tianjin's status as a commodity  distribution center for the whole of northern China and turn  Tianjin into an international commercial city.    To date, Tianjin has formed 64 wholesale markets and 28  national and regional markets for capital goods (iron, steel,  copper and other raw materials), financial trading, technology  transfers and labor services, he said.    According to the official, the Tianjin iron and steel market  run jointly by central and local authorities, the Beiyang  Rolled-Steel Wholesale Market, the Tianjin Petrochemical Trading  Center and the Tianjin Textile Raw Materials Trading Center are  now rated among the largest of their kinds in China.    These markets have introduced a modern trading system  including a membership sub-system and involving the trading of  both spot goods and futures. They are now shifting to futures  markets, the official said.    Moreover, local commodity markets are mushrooming throughout  Tianjin. On average, every 20,000 local residents are served by  such a market, he said.    In recent years, Tianjin's retail sales have risen at an  annual rate of 20 percent, totaling 22.7 billion yuan in 1993.    Furthermore, lending and borrowing in the local money market  amounted to 36.6 billion yuan last year, second only to  Shanghai, the official said. The figure represented a 223  percent increase over the previous year.    A securities exchange and a foreign exchange swap center are  growing rapidly in Tianjin.    Last year foreign banks opened six subsidiaries in Tianjin,  bringing the number of such subsidiaries to eight, the official  said.    The establishment of a comprehensive market system has made  it possible for Tianjin to form four pillar industries --  automobiles and machine-building, electronics, chemicals and  metallurgy, he said.    These industries now account for at least 70 percent of  Tianjin's industrial output value, profits and taxes.    The formation of a market system has also made Tianjin more  attractive to foreign investors, he said.    In 1993, Tianjin approved 3,528 foreign-funded businesses,  involving a total overseas investment of 2.26 billion U.S.  dollars.    According to delegates attending a recent economic  conference, Tianjin plans to build a number of new markets this  year, including a financial market, an enterprise property  rights trading market, a technology trading center and a real  estate market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose David Guevara M.] </F>   [Text] If the past is any indication, the phrase "much ado  about nothing" will sum up the short-term fate of the Third  Economic Adjustment Program (PAE III).    The fact is that this initiative, promoted by the current  administration since December 1990 and approved by the World  Bank last June, will be sent to Congress on 14 February and will  be buried.    That is what we gather from President-elect Jose Maria  Figueres' remarks to LA NACION yesterday.    He expressed surprise over the Executive Branch's decision  to  send the package of state reforms to the Legislative Assembly,  "because everyone knows full well that I and the National  Liberation Party deputies will oppose it in its current form."    Figueres reiterated that his opposition to the program --  which includes loans totalling $300 million -- stems from the  fact that it requires the approval of a series of laws which, in  his opinion, have not been closely examined and would compromise  the country.    Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle announced the night before  last that the PAE III would be sent to Congress.    Social Democratic Deputy Federico Vargas supported Figueres'  position, stating that "we are about to witness the burial of  the PAE III."    Despite that assertion, Social Christian Legislator Gerardo  Bolanos said his faction will do everything possible to pass the  reform package.    President Rafael Angel Calderon hopes the same. "The PAE III  is advantageous for the country," he said. Planning Minister  Carlos Vargas Pagan reiterated that opinion: "What we are  sending (to Congress) is what the country needs and what will  allow it to become a developed nation."    Javier Sandoval, assistant director of public credit at the  Finance Ministry, announced that the only thing certain about  the PAE III is that as of this month the country has lost $1.43  million (almost 220 million colones) which must be paid --  regardless of whether the program is approved -- by way of loan  commissions to the World Bank and Inter-American Development  Bank.    A loan commission clause is customary in contracts with  international organizations. It establishes that 60 days after  signing an agreement, the debtor country must pay between 0.75  and 1.25 percent on the sums it has not received.</p>

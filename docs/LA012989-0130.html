			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC SOOTHES TEMPERS AS PUPILS AUDITION  </P> <P> Los Angeles teachers and school district officials might not agree on much  these days, but harmony prevailed Saturday when 50 teachers volunteered to work  on their day off to help young musicians get a start on their careers.  </P> <P> The sounds of flutes, pianos, saxophones and other instruments filled the  hallways of the Los Angeles City College Music Building as 150 nervous  elementary school students auditioned for a chance at scholarships offered by  the Los Angeles City Elementary School Music Assn.  </P> <P> "It's a chance for them to get their foot in the door," said Evelyn Cain, a  music teacher in Los Angeles schools for 25 years. Cain brought 14 of her  students from Sheridan Street Elementary School in Boyle Heights to audition  for the scholarships.  </P> <P> The "E" string on sixth-grader Alia Edwards' violin snapped just before she  launched into her audition, a rendition of a Bach march. The mishap didn't seem  to faze her, though.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Came Natural'  </P> <P> "I was scared at first, but then it just came natural," the 11-year-old from  South-Central Los Angeles said as she received an embrace from her mother,  Rachel Boodram.  </P> <P> "This is a big opportunity for her, an inner-city kid getting a chance,"  Boodram said.  </P> <P> The scholarships are paid for by the music association's members, most of whom  are elementary school teachers, said Fran Benedict, a music teacher who helped  coordinate the annual auditions. The 40 students who win $250 scholarships will  receive private lessons, many for the first time, Benedict said. The program  began in 1947.  </P> <P> "We feel strongly about this, that's why we're here on our day off," said Merv  Chase, 37, a voice teacher at several schools in the San Fernando Valley. "You  don't get paid for it, but you do get paid in a different way, by seeing the  kids excel and do well."  </P> <P> Members of the United Teachers of Los Angeles have been involved in a contract  dispute with the Los Angeles Unified School District since last year, and say  they will refuse to turn in grades next month. Last week, thousands of high  school and junior high school students protested, demanding their grades and  supporting teachers in the dispute.  </P> <P> But the controversy seemed to be far from the teachers' minds Saturday as they  helped their students through the sometimes stressful auditions.  </P> <P> Music teacher Cain played a piano accompaniment while one of her students,  Anthony Zuniga, 10, auditioned on the trombone.  </P> <P> "Give a great big wind, the best that you've got," Cain counseled the  diminutive trombonist as he launched into a rendition of "900 Miles," an  American folk song.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel applauded loudly when he finished, remarking with  astonishment that he had memorized his piece.  </P> <P> "All right, Anthony, nerves of steel," said judge Les Lovitt, a professional  trumpet player. Anthony and the others will find out if they won early this  week.  </P> <P> Asked how he had done, Anthony merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PASSES COMMUNITY COLLEGE ELECTION BILL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: MEASURE SEEKS TO BOOST MINORITY REPRESENTATION ON BOARD BY ELECTING  TRUSTEES BY DISTRICT. A VETO IS THREATENED.  </P> <P> The state Senate this week gave final passage to a bill supporters say is aimed  at boosting minority representation on the Los Angeles Community College  governing board by forcing trustees to run for election by district.  </P> <P> The seven trustees now run for election at large, meaning all registered voters  within the sprawling community college system are eligible to cast ballots in  the races.  </P> <P> By a vote of 23 to 11 Monday, the Senate sent the measure by Assemblyman  Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to Gov. George Deukmejian. The governor vetoed  the same proposal last year and has indicated he plans to do so again this  year, a Polanco aide said.  </P> <P> The community college system encompasses the city of Los Angeles and several  surrounding communities. It is composed of nine campuses, including West Los  Angeles College in Culver City.  </P> <P> Polanco and those backing his bill argue that elections by district would  increase the chances of minorities winning more seats on the governing board  because several districts would contain large percentages of minority voters.  </P> <P> Polanco said he initially pressed to change the voting system "to allow for  more racial minority representation . . . because that's what true democracy is  all about."  </P> <P> The current board is made up of one black, one Latino, one Asian and four  Anglos.  </P> <P> In vetoing the same bill last year, Deukmejian said the state should not  interfere in local issues. "Local government election matters have  traditionally been placed in the hands of local citizens and should remain  there," the governor said.  </P> <P> Deborah Ortiz, an aide to Polanco, said the governor's office recently restated  its opposition in a letter to the assemblyman. "We're likely to get a veto  again," Ortiz said.  </P> <P> But Polanco said, in an effort to change Deukmejian's mind, he intends to  appeal to the governor's reputation as a fiscal conservative and stress the  cost savings that could be realized by district elections. A state Senate  analysis of the proposal estimated that district elections for board seats  could cut balloting costs for the community college system by as much as 50%.  </P> <P> Board President Lindsay Conner acknowledged that district elections could save  the system $350,000 to $500,000 annually. But he said a majority of the current  board opposes such a change because it would lead to "a highly politicized,  log-rolling board, and a paralyzed central administration."  </P> <P> Conner said district elections eventually would force trustees to represent the  special interests of individual campuses, rather than all nine schools, and  would create "a much more intensely political system."  </P> <P> He also disputed the claim that changing to district elections would increase  minority representation on the board. To support his argument, he noted that  the board's current makeup is the same as that for the Los Angeles Board of  Education, which elects its members by district.  </P></p>

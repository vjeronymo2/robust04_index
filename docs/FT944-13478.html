			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Apollo launches rights to fund Aviation Metals deal Apollo Metals, the aluminium distributor and processor, is expanding into specialised steels with the Pounds 8.55m cash purchase of Aviation Metals. The acquisition is being financed by a rights issue - Apollo's second in two years - underwritten by Granville Davies to raise a net Pounds 7.79m. Aviation Metals is a private company specialising in sales of stainless steel to the aerospace and defence industries. Despite depression in these markets, it has raised turnover marginally over the last three years. Sales during the year to July were Pounds 8.21m, giving pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m. The rights issue of up to 11m shares is on a 3-for-5 basis at 77p; preference shareholders are offered 24 ordinary shares for every 29 preference. Apollo shares dipped 1p to 95p yesterday. Apollo estimated pre-tax profits for the year to September would not be less than Pounds 270,000, against Pounds 1.02m. The group lapsed into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 219,000 during the first half but said yesterday it was experiencing improvement in its trading environment. It intends to pay a 2.4p final.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Channel Islands company in Kazakh gold and diamond venture A small company based in the Channel Islands is part of a joint venture that was yesterday awarded a licence to explore for gold and diamonds in a huge area of Kazakhstan. The Moonstone Group, which says it can call on Australian, Bahraini, Swiss and UK finance and expertise, has joined with Altynalmas, Kazakhstan's gold and precious stones organisation, to form the Altyn-Tas joint venture. This has been licenced to explore 56,000 sq km of the Zhambyl region in the republic's south-western gold belt. The 50-50 joint venture will also build a gold bullion plant at the Akbakai mine in the region and introduce bacterial leaching technology into the country to help treat difficult ores, particularly those containing arsenic. The joint venturers will start in a modest way. Mr Yannic Mercier, chairman of Moonstone and who shares chairmanship of the joint venture with Mr Abdrakhman Begalinov, president of Altynalmas, said the licence agreement commits A-T to spending a minimum of USDollars 2m annually on exploration for five years. However, it also gives the joint venturers the right to mine any gold and diamond reserves they discover. A-T will also provide Dollars 3.7m towards the cost of the gold plant at Akbakai, a facility designed by the Western Australian company, Signet Engineering, whose founder, Mr Tom Duckworth, is an A-T director. Moonstone owns 22 per cent of BacTech (Australia) which uses bioleaching technology first developed in the chemistry department of King's College, London. Moonstone has exclusive rights to the use of the BacTech process in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The first commercial application of BacTech started recently at Gold Mines of Australia's Youanmi Deeps mine near Mt Magnet in Western Australia. Mr Mercier said the Russian Ministry of Geology had spent about USDollars 22m during the past 30 years to map the Zhambyl region so that its its mineral resources could be evaluated. Kazkhstan is welcoming foreign capital for its mining industry because it aims to increase gold output substantially. Altynalmas's Mr Begalinov said earlier this year that his government wanted to lift annual output from about 14 tonnes to between 42 and 56 tonnes very quickly to build reserves to back the country's new currency.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government tinkering over cars Sir, The government is tinkering at the edges over its latest proposals to limit the use of private cars ('Gummer aims to reduce car use', March 16). Without a clear strategy to find and develop superior public transport systems as an alternative, car usage will continue to grow. The aim of the Planning Policy Guidance Note on Transport, to limit the use of private transport to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions, is laudable, but the proposals have not been thought through. A massive cultural change would be needed to wean the public away from cars. To have any hope of achieving this, the alternative system must be exceptionally efficient, comfortable and secure. This has a price, but so far the environment secretary has ducked the issue. His policy does set out some measures to reduce the attractiveness of cars, including increasing duty on fuel, electronic tolling and congestion charging in urban areas. But these will only serve to force less well-off car owners to use public transport rather than choose it as an alternative. If the government is really committed to reducing car usage, cutting the top speed limit to 50mph would have an immediate impact. This would at least get more people travelling on long journeys by rail. Otherwise the government has got to make a major financial contribution to public transport to prove it is serious. Philip Robin, head of planning &amp; development, Healey &amp; Baker, 3 Tenderden Street, London W1</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei stays below 17,000 for second day THE Nikkei average remained below 17,000 for the second consecutive day but was lifted from the day's low by bargain hunting, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The 225-issue average was finally a modest 51.79 up at 16,839.12 after a day's high of 16,930.75 and low of 16,572.46, its worst level since 1986. Volume was again light, totalling 230m shares. The Topix index of all first section shares ended 2.83 better at 1,283.03, but declines still led gains at the close by 556 to 380, with 174 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.75 to 1,044.54. Index-linked activity continued to dominate trading, with some bargain hunting and buying interest in electricals and other issues which stand to benefit from an economic recovery in the US. Sony climbed Y80 to Y4,230 and Pioneer Electronic Y30 to Y3,760. Banks also fared well, with Industrial Bank of Japan rallying Y80 to Y1,750. However, overall buying interest remained light, with investors remaining cautious after the Ministry of Finance said it was delaying its May bond auction, which had been scheduled for yesterday. Some analysts said there is concern that the ministry will proceed with the issue when the stock market improves, which could depress share prices further. Investors are also reluctant to carry open positions overnight with New York poised for a correction and volume in Tokyo likely to remain thin before next week's Golden Week holidays, said Mr Daniel Kerrigan of County NatWest Securities. Drug makers and securities firms lost ground, with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical finishing Y60 cheaper at Y2,490 and Yamaichi slipping Y10 to Y530. Department stores declined on slack sales and earnings. Takashimaya retreated Y30 to Y1,120 after announcing a 35 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 78.50 lower at 19,135.03 in volume of 9.6m shares. Roundup AN all-time high established by the Hong Kong market featured an overall mixed performance by the Pacific Rim region yesterday. HONG KONG rose on strong overseas demand for blue chips. The Hang Seng Index gained 95.94 or 1.9 per cent to 5,189.03. Turnover was HKDollars 2.85bn, up from HKDollars 2.45bn. HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, rising 25 cents to HKDollars 40.50, while Cheung Kong gained 70 cents to HKDollars 21.50 and Pacific Concord advanced 25 cents to HKDollars 3.02. Jardine Matheson climbed HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 49.50 and Swire Pacific added 40 cents at HKDollars 31. AUSTRALIA rose in anticipation of some positive economic forecasts. The All Ordinaries index gained 11.0 to 1,599.0 in turnover of ADollars 165.4m. Analysts expect next week's release of the first-quarter CPI to show a smaller than expected increase. BHP put on 20 cents to ADollars 13.72 after announcing a rise in domestic and export steel shipments for last month. Coles Myer rose 32 cents to ADollars 11.60 and Brambles 22 cents to ADollars 16.04. NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest since March 24. The NZSE-40 index gained 16.77 to 1,428.31 in NZDollars 20.97m turnover. TAIWAN weakened in nervous trading as opposition parties continued their demonstration to demand direct presidential elections. The weighted index relinquished 51.02 to 4,505.07 in turnover of TDollars 14.3bn, against TDollars 16.1bn. KUALA LUMPUR improved on bargain hunting. The composite index gained 1.38 to 573.97 in turnover of MDollars 69.2m, after MDollars 57.2m. Pilecon firmed 4 cents to MDollars 2.63 after Magnum Corp and Dunlop Estates said they had acquired a joint 23 per cent stake in the construction group. SINGAPORE was little changed. The Straits Times Industrial index edged up 0.45 to 1,403.10 in volume of 25.1m shares, after 24.8m. MANILA eased on profit-taking. The composite index shed 7.15 to 1,164.39 in combined turnover of 218.2m pesos, compared with 191.9m pesos. SEOUL was weaker as manufacturing issues declined. The composite index dipped 4.29 to 584.22 in turnover of Won386.23bn. Hyundai Construction and Engineering fell Won600 to Won17,000. BANGKOK's SET index rose a modest 1.84 to 786.93 in turnover of Bt4.1bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- A flow of  statements by political personalities of various leanings about  the likelihood of early elections, a flurry of travelling from  one territorial branch to another of party executives, seasoned  with statements of intention of more and more political parties,  have raised the temperature of the political life in Romania.    This animated picture of party life became obvious after the  government reshuffle of 6 March this year, and some political  observers see it as a direct effect of the changes made by  Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu, considered to have dissatisfied all  the parliamentary political forces. Two weeks after the  reshuffle, two leading polling institutions were reporting a  redistribution of the electorate's preferences. Though  susceptible of interpretations as interests were dictating, the  results of the two opinion polls revealed a slight advance of  the opposition on the ruling party, and practically spread among  Romanian voters the idea of early elections. Asked about such a  development, many political leaders said early elections were  untimely.    Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Social  Democracy Party (PDSR), and speaker of the Chamber of Deputies,  was saying on 29 March that calling early elections "would block  Romania's political and economic functioning." He was also  saying that what the polls seemed to indicate was that the  ruling party was still enjoying a high degree of popularity,  even if the opposition's hold was increasing. Close to this  point of view was Corneliu Coposu's (National Peasant Christian  Democratic Party-PNTCD) assessment that "early elections would  be noxious for romania, they would halt the on-going of the  reform, would entail huge expenses, and would carry a pretext  for social troubles."    Concomitantly, the leadership of PDSR started, in mid-March,  a series of meetings with its local organizations in  Transylvania and in the counties of Buzau, Bacau, Ploiesti.  PDSR's executive president explained this as an activization of  its branches, and denied that his contacts in the province had  electoral purposes. The following days, however, the parties  allied with PDSR, and among them were the National Unity Party  (PUNR), and the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), started a touring  campaign in the territory, or scheduled such activities for the  period following.    in the meantime, the leadership of the ruling party  continued  its meetings with opposition parties, initiated by its honorary  president, Oliviu Gherman, on 4 February this year through a  letter sent to PNTCD, Democratic Party-PD(FSN), PAC,  Social-Democratic Party (PSDR), and to the independent group  which titles itself "A Future for Romania." The overt  intention of the ruling party is that the negotiations proposed  help reach a political pact, apt to bring to light the best  solutions for the problems of the transition period. The  Saturday, 9 April dailies were writing about a meeting PDSR was  planning to have with Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania  (PDAR) this week, an opportunity for the small parliamentary  supporter of the ruling party to claim the agriculture  portfolio, commentators say.    It was also at the end of last week that three party  documents surprisingly had something in common: They were all  pleading for the necessity of political compromise. The ruling  party launched the initiative of "the pact for national  consensus," which maintains that the present internal and  international context, the world and European developments of  the moment "compel all the political parties and conglomerates  that claim to pursue the good of this country to join solidary  on the platform of national consensus." PD(FSN) launched the  "Statement of Oradea", and the Democratic Convention of Romania  (CDR), the largest opposition bloc, issued a "Manifesto for the  Salvation of Romania."    The plea for national consensus by parties of different  leanings is something new for the political life of Romania  after December 1989, so far "stimulated" more by party  interests rather than national interests, often sacrificed for  the sake of the former.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Britannia Marine to float in June Flotation is an abiding concern for Britannia Marine, which operates safety standby vessels for oil and gas companies on the UK continental shelf. However, the Lowestoft-based company will be concentrating on a different kind of launch when it comes to the market in June through a placing. Britannia owns and operates nine standby vessels, which can evacuate staff from drilling rigs and production platforms, and one supply vessel. The listing will offer an exit route to the company's existing 1,120 shareholders, most of whom backed the company through two business expansion schemes which raised a total of Pounds 4.2m. Mr Charles Lister, managing director, said there was scope for further consolidation in what was a very fragmented industry. In due course the group would also be interested in diversifying into other shipping activities. The company was formed in 1987 as the vehicle for a management buy-out of the safety standby fleet of Boston Deep Sea Fishers for the North British Maritime Group. Mr Lister led the buy-out, which was backed by BES investors through funds managed by Castleforth Fund Managers and Johnson Fry. In 1989 it bought Suffolk Marine for Pounds 9.3m. Britannia last year increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.5m, compared with Pounds 1.4m, on turnover ahead Pounds 1m to Pounds 13.8m. The group said no new money would be raised through the issue of new shares at the time of the listing since the company would have net cash and was cash-generative. Peel Hunt has been appointed sponsor and broker to the issue, with Smith &amp; Williamson acting as financial adviser.</p>

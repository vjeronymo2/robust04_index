Therefore, every application for a new construction project (conventional or turnkey) must be accompanied by either the information described in paragraphs B.1 and B.3 of this section, or, at the applicant's option, the information described in paragraphs B.2 and B.3 of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

A statement that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Although the application is for new construction, the PHA will accept acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation, if HUD determines the PHA cost comparison or certification of insufficient housing does not support approval of new construction; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The application is for new construction only. (In any such case, if HUD cannot approve new construction under section 6(h) of the USHA, the application will be rejected.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> C.

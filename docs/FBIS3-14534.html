			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, member of the </F> Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee, in Aden, by  political affairs correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, in the  studio, on 28 March -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Dhiyab] Mr. Ahmad, the Yemeni Council of Ministers  met in Aden yesterday. Can you shed some light on the results  of this meeting?    ['Afif] First of all, I would like to thank you, especially  His Majesty King Husayn and the people and Government of  fraternal Jordan for following the situation in Yemen.    In fact, the Council of Ministers met on Wednesday [23  March]  and today it is still in session. It made many decisions to  implement the accord document, which was signed in fraternal  Amman. The government is continuing its efforts in order to  implement this document. The implementation is the government's  responsibility.    [Dhiyab] How do you assess the work of the Jordanian-Omani  military committee?    ['Afif] This committee, particularly the Jordanian team,  carried out excellent work and is highly appreciated by all the  sons of Yemen. I say this, because I feel that Major General  'Id [head of the Jordanian team] and his team did good work with  the joint military committee at many locations. Confrontations  among the Armed Forces were prevented at many locations. In  fact, the joint military committee exerted intensive efforts. A  few days ago, I heard His Majesty King Husayn say upon his  return to Amman from the Gulf that he still has much hope and  optimism. Of course, his majesty is holding the people of Yemen  responsible in this regard. However, Jordan, especially His  Majesty King Husayn, continues to follow this issue because  Amman is the Yemenis' final resort.    We hope that all the people of Yemen will implement this  accord signed in Amman, and I frankly reiterate that all the  people of Yemen admire and are proud of King Husayn and the  Government and people of fraternal Jordan for their continued  efforts and they will continue this work because the accord was  signed in fraternal and great Amman.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment drought threatens platinum metals Lack of capital for investment and even for maintenance is threatening to hit production of platinum group metals - essential in many industrial catalysts - in the two biggest producing countries, South Africa and Russia. According to Johnson Matthey, the biggest marketing group in the business, as far as South African producers are concerned platinum prices are not so much of a cause for concern as the collapse in the price of rhodium, mainly used in automotive anti-pollution catalysts. Car makers became very wary about being too dependent of supplies of rhodium after the price of the metal jumped to an unprecedented Dollars 7,000 a troy ounce in 1990, when the market was squeezed by a combination of teething troubles at a new Rustenburg refinery in South Africa and a sharp increase in demand from the automotive industry because of tightening international anti-pollution legislation. By making changes in their use of rhodium and running down stocks, car makers, particularly the Japanese, have been instrumental in pushing the rhodium price below Dollars 600 an ounce. In its latest annual market survey, Johnson Matthey suggests: 'We do not foresee any significant deterioration in the (rhodium) price but neither are we confident that it will exceed Dollars 1,000 before the end of 1994.' JM points out that operating margins at the two biggest South African producers, Impala and Rustenburg, fell from 94 per cent in 1989 to 26 per cent in the financial year to June, 1993, because of falling revenues and increasing costs. 'All the (South African) mining companies have been forced to re-evaluate their spending plans; between 1990 and 1993 several mining operations were mothballed or closed, while a number of planned expansion projects have been shelved. The focus is now on containing costs and improving efficiencies. 'Continued cuts in capital expenditure could eventually threaten output if investment drops below the threshold necessary to maintain the mining infrastructure,' the survey points out. There also remains the possibility that the Dollars 494m Northam mine, controlled by Gold Fields of South Africa, will be forced into closure, Johnson Matthey suggests. Not only has Northam, the world's deepest platinum mine, been battling low prices but serious mining difficulties cut predicted output by half last year and it incurred substantial operating losses. Meanwhile, in Russia most platinum comes from Norilsk, one of the federation's new joint stock companies. Mr Michael Steel, JM's market research director, says that Norilsk's nickel production was reported to have dropped by 45 per cent last year and he believes the fall in platinum metals output was even greater. Norilsk's plant, built in the 1940s, has suffered years of neglect and this resulted in at least one major accident - in in October 1993 one of the furnaces in the original nickel smelter split and molten metal was spilled, causing a fire that burned for more than eight hours. There were also reports that there had been a separate incident in which a roof at the plant collapsed. More evidence of the plant's decay came early this year when a strong wind destroyed an emissions stack and the debris fell on top of a pedestrian gallery through which supply lines ran. 'The funds for essential maintenance, let alone for further development of the mining and processing facilities at Norilsk, are unlikely to come from the hard-pressed Russian government. Future investment is therefore largely dependent on the success of the limited privatisation scheme currently under way,' says Johnson Matthey. There is little short-term prospect of substantial western investment in the plant. Despite the clouds over the medium-term production outlook, South Africa's previous expansion programmes, mainly to cope with expected increased use by the car industry, created a substantial platinum supply surplus last year: one of 340,000 ounces compared with a surplus of 20,000 ounces in 1992. Johnson Matthey says that demand for platinum rose by 6.3 per cent to 4.04m ounces, matching the record set in 1991, while supply jumped by 15 per cent to a record 4.38m ounces. Mr Steel said that the surplus was likely to be eliminated this year because the surge in South African supplies was over. Consequently, Johnson Matthey expects the average platinum price this year to be above Dollars 400 a troy ounce, up from a 1993 average of Dollars 374.06, itself 6 per cent higher than in 1992, 'with a maximum of Dollars 430 if no serious (political) unrest occurs in South Africa.' Advancing demand and continued speculative activity 'should give solid support at about Dollars 380'. Platinum 1994: Free from Johnson Matthey, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8JP, UK.</p>

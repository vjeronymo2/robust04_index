			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIBYAN TWINS, 3, JOINED AT HEAD, ARE SAFELY SEPARATED  </P> <P> Hassan and Salem, Libyan-born Siamese twins joined at the head, were  successfully separated early Friday in an 11-hour operation, doctors said.  </P> <P> The 3-year-old brothers were in "relatively good condition" and are expected to  recover fully, said Dr. Wolfgang Koos, chief neurologist at Vienna's General  Hospital.  </P> <P> The hospital did not release the boys' surname.  </P> <P> Koos said the fifth and most difficult operation on the twins severed a common  artery that supplied blood to the brains of both and "decided life or death"  for the boys.  </P> <P> Hassan and Salem were flown to Austria shortly after birth and have spent their  entire lives in the Vienna hospital.  </P> <P> After a recovery period, each will undergo cosmetic surgery to construct a new  section of skull, using bone, skin and hair from other parts of the body.  </P></p>

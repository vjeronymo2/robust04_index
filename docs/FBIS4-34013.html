			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) --  Central America today insisted on requesting democratic changes  in Cuba in a statement by Costa Rican President Jose Maria  Figueres within the framework of the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit. The statment proposes that the topic be discussed  within the OAS.    The governments of the isthmus, who yesterday requested the  island's democratization at the end of a regional summit in San  Jose, are willing to meet with Cuban President Fidel Castro to  ask him for political openness in Cuba, according to Figueres.    Figueres also suggested that the Cuban case "be reviewed by  the Inter-American system in bloc," and he noted that the  Colombian president's assumption of the OAS Secretariat in  August will be "an important ingredient" for the matter to be  taken up by a strengthened and invigorated organization.    This is not a case of creating obstacles but, rather, one in  which the Central Americans want a peaceful solution to the  Cuban situation, the Costa Rican president stated.    Figueres added: "More and greater progress must be achieved  in the areas of democratization, freedom of speech, religion,  domestic and foreign association, and others to promote a  climate of understanding."    The Costa Rican president, who took office 8 May, said  Cuba's  situation is a legacy of the Cold War, adding that its  resolution must mainly involve the various groups of Cubans. As  an example of such a transition, he noted the case of the  Central American countries "in which the securing of peace has  been the fruit of concerted efforts and dialogue."    In terms of Cuba's democratization, he said, all of the  members of the island, without distinction, including the  dissident groups abroad and those in the country, must  participate. However, "any planned transition" must strengthen  and secure "the revolutionary achievements in the areas of  education, health, and housing," he said.    Fidel Castro, who was the last president to arrive in  Cartagena on Monday evening amid tight security, has again been  the focus of attention of newsmen and chiefs of state attending  the summit.    Argentine President Carlos Menem, who at last year's summit  requested Cuba's democratization, told EFE that this is "the  wish" not only of his country, but of many Latin American  countries. He also noted that "there is no problem" in meeting  with Castro, if he wishes to meet or if the opportunity exists  within the framework of the summit.    The Cuban leader today surprised the summit participants by  attending the opening ceremony wearing a guayabera shirt instead  of the traditional olive drab uniform he has worn at previous  summits.</p>

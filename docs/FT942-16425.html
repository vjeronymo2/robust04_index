			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / IADB warns on growth hopes: Latin Americans must distribute benefits of reform more fairly Latin America's growth and economic modernisation efforts are unlikely to be sustainable unless there is a fairer distribution of the benefits of economic growth, the InterAmerican Development Bank says. In its annual report, released today to coincide with the bank's annual meeting, the bank argues: 'Economic growth and modernisation are not likely to be sustainable in the absence of political and social stability, which in turn will depend upon a more equitable distribution of the benefits of that growth.' The message has been underlined by the meeting's venue in Mexico, where a peasant uprising in the south and the assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate this year have increased concerns about social stability. The meeting will concentrate on discussions to finalise a Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) capital increase for the bank, which will allow it to expand lending to Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn a year and take its total capital past Dollars 100bn. Final agreement was being held up early yesterday by a disagreement between European and Latin American shareholders about an extra seat on the board for Chile. European governments have argued that if Chile wants the seat it should increase its stakeholding in the bank - as many of them, with the exception of Britain, are proposing to do. The annual report says economic reforms adopted to date have been essential to social development in that they encouraged investment and growth, thereby bringing about a more egalitarian distribution of income. But the reforms must also be broadened to tackle social policy - improving the efficiency of government action in social sectors, assisting education, health and nutrition and reducing poverty. Nonetheless, the prospects for sustained economic growth are positive, the bank says. The region enjoyed its third successive year of economic growth last year, with the regional economy expanding 3.3 per cent. Growth in 1992 was 2.9 per cent and in 1991 3.7 per cent. The conclusions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and the momentum of market-oriented reforms support the positive expectations, the report says. Some Dollars 65bn of net capital flows entered Latin America last year, exceeding the region's current account deficit and allowing a build-up of international reserves by some Dollars 23.9bn. The region's current account deficit was Dollars 42bn, about 3.8 per cent of regional GDP, as the overall trade deficit expanded to Dollars 17.7bn last year from Dollars 10.6bn in 1992. The larger trade deficit was a result of continuing rapid growth in imports  -9.1 per cent in 1993 after 18.2 per cent in 1992 - although exports also grew, by a more modest 3.6 per cent in real terms. The report remarks on notable declines in import activity in Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela that 'is generally associated with a transition to more sustainable rates of output growth'. Import growth had been fuelled throughout the region by 'the vigorous demand for capital goods'. The bank authorised Dollars 5.96bn in new loans last year, slightly below the 1992 figure of Dollars 6.02bn. Its last capital increase, of Dollars 26.5bn, was agreed in 1989. The bank expects to raise Dollars 3.3bn in international borrowings this year, compared with Dollars 3.9bn in 1991 and Dollars 5.1bn in 1992. The bank repaid last year nearly Dollars 1bn equivalent of high coupon borrowings, against Dollars 1.1bn in 1992. This year's lower borrowing expectations reflects lower debt repayments and the need to make only small additions to the bank's cash.</p>

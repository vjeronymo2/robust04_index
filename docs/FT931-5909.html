			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Frankfurt draws a discreet veil over extreme right: Local elections in the state of Hesse will test support for Republicans FRANKFURT has been tidied up in preparation for local elections in the state of Hesse this Sunday. The city authorities have cleared 'Needle Park' in the banking quarter of drug dealers and their clientele. The homeless have been shifted out of the main station's shopping galleries. Unofficial action has ensured that other unsightly elements - the extreme right - have hardly shown their face. Election meetings on behalf of the Republicans and German People's Union (DVU) have been confined by public pressure to backrooms in down-at-heel pubs. Overt signs of their activities  -posters installed nightly on lamp posts three metres above the streets - disappear before dawn. But the result of the vote for 21 district presidencies and 426 local councils, the only scheduled popularity test for Germany's political parties this year before the grand slam sequence of local, state, federal and European elections in 1994, is likely to be an untidy affair. In the state overall, the Social Democrats (SPD) are expected to sustain light losses on the 44.5 per cent share of the vote last time in 1989, while Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) suffer more substantial reductions from their 33.3 per cent. The Greens seem set to improve on their 7 per cent overall share won in 1989, mainly because disillusionment with the main parties has prompted a drift among voters seeking respectable alternatives. These apparently do not include the Free Democrats, who have been losing ground and appear from most recent samplings likely to emerge with less than the 4.4 per cent of the Hesse vote they won in 1989. But most eyes, in Bonn and abroad, will be focused on Frankfurt. As well as being the largest city in the state, it is the most crime-ridden and most cosmopolitan in the country - a quarter of the population is non-German. It is amply qualified as a political proving ground for the far right. The weekend election will show the extent to which the Republicans and DVU have been able to transmit their 'foreigners out' message beyond their meeting rooms, and the extent to which they may influence the federal electorate next year. Opinion surveys in the city have shown the SPD fading sharply and the CDU gaining on the popular perception that for all their failings in Bonn, the Christian Democrats are better equipped to deal with the main issues in this election: a mostly mundane mix of budget management, housing shortages, traffic bottlenecks and rising crime. At the last count the two main parties were neck and neck with 35 per cent each among those who had decided how to vote. This placed the CDU marginally below its 1989 result and SPD down five percentage points. Meanwhile, the Greens, the SPD's current coalition partners have gained five points to reach 15 per cent overall. The Republicans, representing the other extreme of the spectrum, seem set to win almost 7 per cent of the vote - the same as the National Party (NPD), their ideological predecessors, in the 1989 election. The figures suggest that the recent widespread public condemnation of racist violence, orchestrated candle-lit processions and posters preaching 'Tolerance' on every corner have had some effect on the city's collective conscience. But although the issue of asylum-seekers has slipped down the political agenda and is mentioned by only 6 per cent of voters as an important issue, the more general 'foreigner problem' (17 per cent) remains inextricably bound up in local minds with crime (27 per cent). The final judgment must wait until all the votes have been counted, including those of the 17 per cent of Frankfurters who say they have yet to decide which way to vote.</p>

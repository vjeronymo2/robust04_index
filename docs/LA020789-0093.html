			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREAMLINED MANVILLE POSTS LOSS FOR YEAR  </P> <P> Manville Corp., the former asbestos maker that emerged from bankruptcy in 1988,  announced Monday an after-tax charge of $1.3 billion against fourth-quarter  earnings to reflect the cost of its reorganization.  </P> <P> "We have been anticipating a charge upon emerging from Chapter 11," it said.  "It was the price we knew we had to pay to put our asbestos financial  obligations behind us."  </P> <P> Manville also reported Monday that it had a net operating loss of $27.9 million  in the fourth quarter on sales of $522.1 million, against an operating profit  of $29.3 million on sales of $486 million in the comparable 1987 quarter.  </P> <P> For the year, the company reported net operating profit of $89.1 million on  sales of $2.06 billion, compared to a profit of $157.1 million on sales of  $1.94 billion.  </P> <P> Including the charges, Manville had a net loss of $1.31 billion in the fourth  quarter, against a net loss of $59.9 million a year ago. For the year,  including the charges, it had a net loss of $1.29 billion against a net profit  of $72.6 million in 1987.  </P> <P> Denver-based Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 as it faced massive lawsuits  by asbestos victims. Although its reorganization plan providing for a  $2.5-billion trust to pay for health injury claims was approved in 1986, the  company had been held in bankruptcy because of appeals.  </P> <P> In separate news, the New York Times reported that the trust fund could run out  of money by later this year, causing delays in payments to thousands of  claimants. The fund is running out of money because settlement payments have  averaged about 50% higher, and settlements have been reached at a quicker rate  than expected when the fund was established, according to court documents and  officials quoted in the Times story.  </P> <P> The 131-year-old company was once the nation's largest maker of asbestos, a  fireproof insulator whose fibers if inhaled can lead to lung cancer and other  serious diseases.  </P> <P> Other earnings, Page 7  </P></p>

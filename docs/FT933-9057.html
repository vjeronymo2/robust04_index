			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Supermarkets call shots in lager price war: Tesco's discounting of Stella Artois imports was the start of a squeeze on brewers NATIONAL BREWERS, whose profits are already under pressure from increasing competition in the pub trade, are now coming under attack from a fresh source. Imports by supermarket groups of well-known lagers at substantially lower prices from continental Europe threaten one of the brewers' fastest-growing and most profitable markets. Tesco led the way. It obtained supplies of Stella Artois, the Belgian beer, through its French subsidiary Catteau instead of through Whitbread, which brews the lager under licence in the UK. In a four-week promotion that has just ended, it offered a 24-pack of 25cl bottles for Pounds 9.99p - a discount of 25 per cent on the normal UK price. 'We sold more beer than we have ever sold on any previous promotion,' said Mr David Wild, the Tesco commercial director who is responsible for drinks. Whitbread has responded to the threat by offering to supply Stella Artois to Tesco in continental-style packaging. But Mr Wild said: 'As yet, they can do so neither at a price that is attractive nor in the volume we want.' Tesco intends to repeat promotions of imported Stella Artois - and on Monday to begin a series of similar offerings of other popular continental lagers. J. Sainsbury, now offering imported Stella at Pounds 9.95p for a 24-pack, said it was considering obtaining other brands from mainland Europe. Mr Graeme Eadie, analyst at NatWest Securities, said: 'The Tesco promotion represents the first skirmish in a take-home beer price war; the first move in a process which will permanently reduce the profitability of UK brewers.' The creation of the European single market and its encouragement of cross-border trading has generated the process. Tesco said its decision to buy Stella through its French subsidiary was partly defensive. 'We are very concerned about the effect on our business of the increase in personal allowances for cross-Channel shoppers, who can buy beer more cheaply because of lower rates of duty on the Continent.' Mr Wild said. But tax is only one element - though the biggest - in the difference between the retail price of beer in the UK and on the Continent. Lower production costs, in raw materials and packaging as well as scale efficiencies, contribute to cheaper continental retail prices. More importantly, lagers which are regarded and priced as standard products in the rest of Europe are heavily marketed as premium products in the UK, with three times greater profit margins. Having established the popularity of the brands, the UK brewers may increasingly fail to reap the rewards. Even with UK duty rates, retailers such as Tesco and Sainsbury can exploit the price advantages of cross-Channel supplies to undercut normal UK prices while retaining a useful, if lower, profit margin. Mr Eadie said: 'So long as price differences remain between the UK-brewed and continental-brewed versions of the same brand, no UK brewer can regard premium pricing as secure.' Apart from Whitbread's 'reassuringly expensive' Stella Artois other vulnerable beers could be Courage's Holsten and Scottish &amp; Newcastle's Beck's if the present trickle of imports turns into a flood. The brewers' ability to combat such an influx appears limited. Supermarkets dominate the growing take-home market in which premium lager accounts for a third of sales. If brewers ignore a concerted price challenge in the sector, they will lose volume. Yet reducing prices would have not only an immediate impact on profits but a knock-on effect on the whole pricing structure of the market. If the brewers are unable to maintain the price level of premium lagers, the price of standard lagers, such as Whitbread's Heineken and Bass's Carling Black Label, will come under pressure. Consumers meanwhile must be smacking their lips in anticipation.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INTENSIVE-CARE NURSE ARRESTED IN DRUG USE  </P> <P> A registered nurse has been arrested for allegedly injecting himself with  morphine while on duty in the intensive care unit at Burbank Community  Hospital, Burbank police said Monday.  </P> <P> James Ross, 40, of Van Nuys was released on his own recognizance after he was  arrested at the hospital about 2:30 a.m. Sunday on suspicion of being under the  influence of a controlled substance, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. Ross is scheduled  to be arraigned Dec. 12 in Burbank Municipal Court, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> A nursing supervisor called police when he saw the man acting unusually and  noticed a substantial amount of morphine and Demerol, a brand-name sedative and  painkiller, were missing, Goldberg said. The supervisor also said medical  records had been altered to increase the quantity of morphine delivered to the  unit to more than twice the 18 milligrams originally requested, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> "When police responded and talked to the subject, he displayed all the  objective symptoms of someone being under the influence of morphine," including  lethargy, slow and deliberate speech and constricted eyes, Goldberg said. Ross  also had three fresh puncture wounds on his left arm, and admitted to injecting  himself with about 10 milligrams of morphine around midnight Saturday, he said.  </P> <P> Melanie Landman, spokeswoman for Burbank Community Hospital, said patient care  was not jeopardized because the supervisor noticed Ross' condition a short time  after he took the drugs.  </P> <P> Landman said Ross is employed by Specialty Care Nursing Service Agency,  headquartered in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles, and had worked at the  hospital only once before, in late October. The hospital gave him a favorable  evaluation for his work on the earlier occasion, she said.  </P> <P> Landman said prospective nurses are screened by the registry for medical  problems and are given an orientation before working at Burbank Community  Hospital.  </P> <P> A supervisor at Specialty Care refused to comment on the arrest, and said  questions from a reporter would have to be submitted to the company in writing  before a response could be considered.  </P></p>

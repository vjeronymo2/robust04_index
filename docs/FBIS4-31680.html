			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marinko Culic: "Tudjman Returns--to Continuity"] </F>   [Text] From Tudjman's restrained answer to  Izetbegovic, it can be concluded that the Croatian president has  decided on the tactic of procrastinating, evidently convinced  that it is only a question of time until Bosnia-Herzegovina  disappears from the map. After the failure of the international  community on the test of Gorazde, it seems that Tudjman's hopes  are being realized. However, it might be useful to warn the  local mediators in the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina of an  opposite result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama--Bosnia stays,  they fail.    While a ceremony for the Croatian-Bosnian agreement was  being  prepared in Washington, Ivan Bender recommended from Siroki  Brijeg, not at all jokingly, that the Croats there will see how  "this" looks in practice, and only then decide whether to accept  the agreement. Several days after the rainy wedding ceremony in  Washington, the Presidency of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic  Community] of Bosnia-Herzegovina had already resolved, it seems,  all dilemmas and announced actions that will be "louder than you  think and different than you expect."    Indeed, events followed that are unambiguous, and some  really  announced "loudly" that the Washington agreement is staggering  before it was put on its feet. The first contacts of the two  sides showed that they are not in a position to find a common  language even for that rare matter that is not fixed by the  agreement but is left to their internal decision (the order of  the election of leaders of the federation). Not long after  Franjo Tudjman gave the usual interview on the eve of the visit  of the chief of state to the other country and, quite unusually,  announced that the visit to Sarajevo would perhaps--not take  place. Finally, 15 days ago, someone very expertly set off an  explosion in Livan, leveling the minaret of the 150-year-old  mosque of Curcinica. In only a month, therefore, everything  occurred that was necessary for the conclusion to be drawn that  one side traveled to Washington not with the intention of  achieving an agreement under the sponsorship of the most  powerful administration in the world, but, under the umbrella of  that authority--which was perhaps lulled that everything was  ready--of doing just the opposite.  <H5>  Why Curcinica? </H5>   The incident with Curcinica is too striking and resonant to  be treated simply as "just another" mosque that no longer stands  erect. First, it was destroyed in a city that at one time was  cited as an example of where that doesn't happen; this means  that someone passionately wanted to emphasize that not even  small islands exist in the sea of Croatian-Muslim hatred any  longer. Therefore, if the other side is held to account for much  lesser war crimes than its own, although it is claimed at the  same time that the army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is more a  leaderless army of bandits than a real, disciplined army, then  the question of the responsibility of the allegedly well  organized HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the Croatian police  arises with two-fold weight. In truth, they cannot be  accused--without firm proof--as directly guilty parties for the  destruction of the mosque, but they can be accused of not  bringing in criminals and terrorists, because there is already  proof of this. For example, it is known who leveled Stupni Do  and why (the aim was to "warn" the Muslims, but also to incite  them against Croats in Vares in order to resettle them), but  that man is still--now under a new name--in his old position in  the HVO.    Those who are leaving him in freedom are probably projecting  through him intimate notions about prohibited, but desirable  filthy messes--my God, it's war!--as Slobodan Praljak did  several days ago, when he decisively denied that he had ordered  the destruction of the Old Bridge.... But he then added, in the  same breath and equally resolutely, that, in a situation where  military reasons demanded it, he would do the same thing. As you  can see, the "dogs of war" are not to be foreseen and tied up,  but the chains are long and tight on which they are placed and,  one hopes, anyone can easily reach home along them. Here it is  interesting to mention that, according to Akmadzic's recent  statement, two sides have agreed that each will clean from its  ranks those who are hindering the establishment of a joint  state, and it is certainly not accidental that right here and  only here was "full sovereignty" insisted on. We will not guess  who was more interested in this clause, but the conclusion is  inevitable in view of the later series of recent actions by both  sides.  <H5>  Road Tax </H5>   Although the facts were different, the Bosnians first  roughly  activated the staff sieve, having already replaced Safer  Halilovic some time earlier, and then mercilessly having  eliminated several "warlords" who could no longer be controlled  (Caco, perhaps even Prazina). The only thing with which the  Croatian side reciprocated was its moving of Boban and the  arrival of the moderate Bosanac Zubak. But as nothing beside  this happened, it was clear that the aim was not to clean up  their own ranks but to blackmail the other side into sweeping  them according to what was already swept, or, if it didn't want  to--to refrain from everything. The present taking of bids on  the election of the first leader of the federation is aiming at  that. Croatians do not want a Muslim in that position, claiming  that after five or six years it's the Croats' turn, but just  when one thinks that it is a case of a stand on principle, he  changes into--possibly a Muslim, but not the "belligerent"  Izetbegovic.    Since we are talking about the leader of a state that,  whatever has been said, enjoys the support of a large part of  the citizens, the challenged one has evidently been sent not  only to Izetbegovic personally, but also to the whole Bosnian  people, who are just entering a period of maturity and  self-awareness. This is all the more insulting in that, contrary  to the internal agreement mentioned, what is exclusively in the  jurisdiction of these people is being encroached upon, and at  the same time notorious criminals are being tolerated in their  own ranks. Moreover, local propaganda has set loose a mill of  insinuations about how the Bosnians have abandoned the  Washington agreement--it was claimed earlier that they had  abandoned Bosnia-Herzegovina--allegedly swayed by Izetbegovic's  legal adviser Boyle, who believes that the agreement practically  sanctions the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But  Bosnia-Herzegovina deputy prime minister Edib Bukvic stated  lately that the Bosnian side had an insight into Boyle's opinion  even before the signing of the Washington agreement; this means  that it nevertheless believed in it, while only some trends in  Bosnian policy, claims Bukvic, were submitted to Boyle's  analysis.    In addition, Bukvic stated that Herceg-Bosna is again  assuming the old form of a pseudo-state, which functions well  only in a robbery. A road tax has again been introduced, this  time with a firm scale of charges, so the shipment of goods over  the border is encumbered with levies of 100 to 150 percent (!),  and even humanitarian convoys for central Bosnia pay a "road  toll." Although one shouldn't doubt the material greed of the  leaders of Herceg-Bosna, the aim of the highway robbery  described by Bukvic is indeed broader and is directed at  provoking Muslims to erect firm borders toward Croats. With this  the concept of cantonal division would definitely be destroyed,  and a partition into two parts would be consolidated, which Ivo  Komsic says is being hastily carried out. A further, more  ambitious aim is to leave the Bosnians with the conviction that  "their" Bosnia-Herzegovina is impossible and that it has  remained only on their shoulders (about which Milovan Sibl  recently wrote, in DANAS, an unusually detailed text, having  failed to answer only the trifle of whether he wrote it as a  journalist in politics or as a politician in the newspaper).    This could also be the explanation of why Djapic and his  Croatian Rights Party members were recently attacked with tables  and chairs in Siroki Brijeg. Although they say that he has often  been on Pantovcak recently, where an alliance of the "right"  against the "vampire-like left" has been worked out, Djapic  nevertheless poured the cup too full. And this, it seems, not so  much through attacks against the great (Zagreb) and the small  (Mostar) leadership, and not even with charges that Tuta  Naletilic is "responsible for destroying the Livanj mosque," as  through dreaming by the Croatian Rights Party about the fighting  unity of the Croatian and the Muslim people, which has also been  supported in recent days by the announcement about a new  founding of the HOS [Croatian Defense Force].  <H5>  Sarajevo Is Far Away </H5>   If the Bosnians rear on their hind legs at all of this, so  much the better! At an SDA [Party of Democratic Action]  convention, Alija Izetbegovic recently reduced all the aims of  his party to one basic and undoubtedly justified one--"We want  all the territory back"--but with this also fell into the trap  of national and confessional exclusivity, stating that there  would be no more genocide against the Muslim people, because  weapons would not be taken from anyone "except criminals." It is  interesting that now, when critical repercussions from this  should be expected in Zagreb, all of a sudden there are none,  although whole tomes were written until recently about alleged  Islamic fundamentalism. As if a little real fundamentalism in  Sarajevo would be appropriate to the masters of local  propaganda, so it would be easier for them to steal away from  the Washington agreement, into which they have been pushed  against their will anyway. Recent correspondence between  Izetbegovic and Tudjman, in which the former is understandably  concerned, and the latter not understandably satisfied with what  has been achieved, indicates that the Croatian president has  favored a tactic of making a resolution difficult (he announced  a visit "soon" to Sarajevo, but he immediately mentioned  "technical and communications" problems, as if we are somewhere  in the middle of 1992), evidently convinced that it is only a  question of time until Bosnia-Herzegovina disappears from the  map. Taught by experience, he will just not keep making inroads  this time, but he will let someone else do the coroner's job,  possibly the United States.    After the failure by the international community of the  Gorazde test, it seems that Tudjman's predictions and hopes are  being realized (thus Sibl hurried to be hailed as a journalistic  analyst). But both foresee that Bosnia-Herzegovina has been  trying to divide itself in quarters, now, for more than two  years already, but it isn't working. That this is really a  question of an "artificial state," "a colonial creation," and  however they have already called it, this would surely happen  even without any great effort by Belgrade and Zagreb, and even  the United States and Russia together would not be able to  prevent disintegration. Thus we are warning the local mediators  in the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina to keep in mind the  opposite result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama--Bosnia stays,  they fail.</p>

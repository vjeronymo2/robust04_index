			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Shekel curbs to go if inflation rate is reduced Israel will make its currency, the shekel, fully convertible but only after its inflation rate has moved much closer to those of its leading trading partners, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of Israel's central bank, said. He also said he wanted further measures to liberalise the economy before allowing Israelis and foreigners complete freedom to buy and sell the currency. However, Mr Frenkel made clear in an interview that the bank would move to full convertibility as soon as possible but the move would have to be sustainable and not subject to setbacks. Israel has progressively liberalised its once strictly controlled foreign exchange and money markets since the middle of the 1980s as part of a policy of opening its economy to the outside world. But while trading in the shekel for trade and business purposes is practically free of regulation, Israeli residents still face restrictions on opening bank accounts and buying property abroad. Mr Frenkel said because of Israel's geo-political position, 'there is a lot of vulnerability' in the economy. Full convertibility could expose Israel's economy to 'very huge swings' of capital in and out of the country. The experience of former communist countries that have rapidly made their currencies convertible showed that premature action in this area was counter-productive and inevitably forced a retreat, Mr Frenkel said. Israel's inflation rate - currently about 10 per cent - would have to be much closer to the 2 or 3 per cent inflation rates of the big industrialised countries. This would be a precondition for making the exchange rate of the shekel more stable. Israel has set an 8 per cent inflation target this year and hopes to achieve further staged reductions in inflation in the years ahead. Consistent with its inflation target, the Bank of Israel pursues a 'crawling band' exchange rate policy that envisages a 6 per cent depreciation of the shekel's value against the currencies of its main trading partners this year. Mr Frenkel said the bank was waiting to see the impact of new housing and land policies on inflation but would not hesitate to raise interest rates further if necessary to achieve the 8 per cent target for this year. 'We will not give any weight to questions of controversy in the conduct of interest rate or monetary policy. It would be a mistake,' he said.</p>

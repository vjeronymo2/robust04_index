			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN's aid agency for small farmers faces funding crisis The United Nation's small farmer agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, is facing a financial crisis because the countries that provide funds have been unable to agree over replenishing its kitty. Delegates from over 140 countries are to meet in Rome from January 26 to 28 for a crucial meeting of Ifad's governing council that could decide to look for alternative means of financing. The Rome-based agency, set up in 1977, is jointly funded by western countries and members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It makes interest-free loans to poorer farmers that are often missed by other agencies. In 1993, it committed USDollars 268m to projects in 33 countries. But funds have been shrinking after years of disputes between donors. In its early years, Ifad was receiving about Dollars 1,000m for its three-year work cycles and donors have agreed that it should receive Dollars 600m for its next three years' work. Last October, however, Saudi Arabia, the biggest Opec contributor, announced that it would give only Dollars 3m, instead of the Dollars 30m it gave for the present cycle. The Saudis want Ifad to be funded in a different way. The agency's president, Mr Fawzi Al-Sultan, of Kuwait, will propose at next week's meeting that a committee be set up to look at alternative ways of raising money. But this could take a year to report. While other countries could make up the Saudi Arabian shortfall, donors such as Britain and Canada have cut their aid to developing countries. But the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries might be prepared to pay more. 'The fund is very highly regarded and this could help to save it,' said an official of a European donor country. Ifad earns about Dollars 150m a year from its own investments and loans and has enough money for its work this year. But unless donors agree to replenish the fund, it may not be viable and will have to cut back or even close in 1995. African countries would be the hardest hit if Ifad cut back or closed. About two-fifths of its loans have gone to Africa.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERY SUBTLE WINS LAS FLORES HANDICAP  </P> <P> Very Subtle pulled away in the stretch to win the $70,600 Las Flores Handicap  by 3 lengths over Sadie B. Fast before a crowd of 29,001 Monday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Ridden by Laffit Pincay and carrying high weight of 124 pounds, Very Subtle  covered 6 furlongs in 1:08 3-5 and paid $2.60 to win.  </P> <P> Sadie B. Fast, ridden by Bill Shoemaker and carrying 113 pounds, was 3 1/2  lengths ahead of Comical Cat at the wire.  </P> <P> The $5 exacta of Very Subtle and Sadie B. Fast paid $18. Serve N' Volley was  scratched. Because there were only three entries in the 37th running of the  race for older fillies and mares, there was no place or show wagering.  </P> <P> The victory was the 12th in 26 starts for Very Subtle, a 5-year-old daughter of  Hoist the Silver, and the $44,350 top prize increased her career earnings to  $1,560,860.  </P></p>

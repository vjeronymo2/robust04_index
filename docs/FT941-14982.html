			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Exports up as regions report improved trade Export orders for east Midlands companies have started to rise again after declining during the summer, the Association of East Midlands Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. The survey was published as the latest report on business performance in north-east England and Cumbria recorded, for the fourth quarter of 1993, the highest ever positive balances for home sales, home orders and profits since the survey began in mid-1990, before the recession hit the area. In the latest survey of business performance at 353 companies in the east Midlands, the chambers found 36 per cent of companies reporting an increase in export orders in December, compared with 27 per cent in September and 38 per cent in June. But the level of domestic business appears to have flattened out after a surge of orders last spring. The chambers said 40 per cent of companies had bigger order books in December than three months before, compared with 42 per cent in September and June and 28 per cent last March. The east Midlands data illustrate the uneven spread of recovery. Last week, the west Midlands chambers reported a fall in the number of service companies increasing export orders, and a small rise in manufacturers with higher export orders. However, both regions have large amounts of unused capacity. The east Midlands chambers reported that 32 per cent of companies were operating at full capacity, 4 percentage points higher than September but 8 percentage points lower than June. Last month, 59 per cent of companies were expecting a rise in turnover, but only 45 per cent expected a rise in profitability. The main concern of companies remained a cut in interest rates, the east Midlands chambers said. Meanwhile, Business Survey North, the quarterly report by the Northern Development Company, the region's economic regeneration body, said most companies in north east England and Cumbria appeared to have put recession behind them. The report was produced in association with the Teesside and Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce. Following two successive quarterly falls, export sales and orders were up, plant and machinery investment reached a new peak and training expenditure rose sharply, in response to continuing skills shortages. The survey is based on responses from 744 companies, 40 per cent of them manufacturers. Of the respondents, 21.7 per cent were running at over 90 per cent capacity, compared with 27.5 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today's sitting of the Georgian parliament was  remarkable for its poignancy and outbursts of passion. Before  MPs set to discussing the principal issue on the agenda, that  is, the approval of the staff of the government, the morning  sitting was overwhelmed by harsh, radical, and sometimes  unfounded speeches. Several statements were made.    Eventually, at the evening sitting, the parliament got down  to approving the Cabinet of Ministers. A deputy prime minister,  Avtandil Margiani, faced the parliament. He made an extensive  speech about the work done and the future plans. The deputy  prime minister had to answer numerous questions.    Voting was conducted to approve Mr. Avtandil Margiani to the  post of deputy prime minister. The (?party) of Republicans and  the Ilia Chavchavadze Society did not take part in voting. They  had announced their refusal to participate in any voting on the  approval of members of the Cabinet of Ministers at the previous  sitting.    Some 105 votes were cast for Avtandil Margiani, while 31  were  against and five abstained. The nomination of Avtandil Margiani  has failed. A deputy speaker, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili who  chaired the sitting, said that the head of state had the right  to once more nominate his candidate to this post.</p>

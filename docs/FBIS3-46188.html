The official, from the Organizational Department of the  Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said this at a  forum attended by leaders from the party's organizational  departments at all levels which closed here today in Beijing.    He stressed the importance of the study of Deng Xiaoping's  works and his theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and its relation to the formation of leading  bodies.    He pointed out that the emphasis should be placed on the  building up of ideology and work style in strengthening the  leading bodies.    It should also be linked with the anti-corruption campaign,  he added.    The official said that it is necessary to maintain and  safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee in order  to enable the policies and reform measures made by the Central  Committee to be carried out successfully.    He said that redoubled efforts should be made to foster and  select outstanding cadres, both young and middle-aged, to the  leading posts.    Addressing the issue concerning the party's grassroots  units,  he said, it is necessary to explore how to enhance the building  of the party organization in the state-owned, foreign-funded and  township enterprises, as well as in the private sector.    He said that the pace of reform of the personnel system must  be quickened.    A scientific, classified personnel management system and a  fair, just and competitive mechanism for selecting cadres should  gradually be set up, in line with the principle of putting the  cadres' management under the party's control.    He stressed that party organizations should take active part  in, and give guidance to, the implementing of the state civil  servant system in the new year.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENEWAL PROJECT FOR HOLLYWOOD WINS 2ND BATTLE  </P> <P> The state Court of Appeal has ruled that the city of Los Angeles properly  considered the environmental implications of the 1,100-acre Hollywood  redevelopment project when the City Council approved it in 1986.  </P> <P> A ruling against the city on Jan. 30 would have brought the $922-million  renewal effort to a halt and forced the Community Redevelopment Agency to  undertake a lengthy new environmental review.  </P> <P> "We are pleased as all get out," said R. Bruce Tepper, an attorney for the  redevelopment agency. "Environmental compliance in the context of any land-use  decision is critical. It can knock you out."  </P> <P> This was the second setback in less than a week for critics of Hollywood  renewal.  </P> <P> On Jan. 24, the city and redevelopment agency won a separate court battle over  the project. A Superior Court judge let stand a decision allowing the city to  replace a citizens advisory committee controlled by redevelopment critics with  a new group favoring the project.  </P> <P> The Hollywood redevelopment plan calls for investing $922 million in public  funds in central Hollywood over 30 years to spruce up old buildings, construct  new ones, address traffic and housing problems and provide public amenities.  The project area includes about 35,000 residents and covers an area bordered  roughly by La Brea Avenue on the west, Serrano Avenue on the east, Franklin  Avenue on the north and Santa Monica Boulevard and Fountain Avenue on the  south.  </P> <P> Hollywood businessman David Morgan, who filed the suit challenging the city's  environmental review of the redevelopment project, said he will ask the  appellate court to reconsider the case. If he loses again, he said, he will  appeal to the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "I will keep fighting," said Morgan, who runs a camera shop on Sunset  Boulevard. "I am not giving up on this. It is too important an issue."  </P> <P> In the ruling released Tuesday, a three-judge panel rejected Morgan's claim  that the project's environmental impact report was flawed because it did not  discuss the medical effects of potential relocation on residents. Morgan  contended that medical research shows forced relocation causes "severe  emotional stress . . . upon the human spirit and body often leading to illness  and death."  </P> <P> The panel also rejected Morgan's claim that the Community Redevelopment Agency  did not follow proper procedures in holding public hearings and releasing  information to the public about the report. Morgan said the agency's actions  deprived him and others of "due process" under the law.  </P> <P> Morgan, who lives in Los Feliz, has been one of the most diligent critics of  the 3 1/2-year-old redevelopment project. Although originally represented by an  attorney, he acted as his own lawyer during the appeal, writing his own brief  and arguing the case in court.  </P> <P> Morgan has also joined several other Hollywood activists in a separate lawsuit  challenging the validity of the redevelopment plan, a blueprint for renewal  approved by the City Council in 1986. A Superior Court judge ruled against the  group last year, but Morgan and the others have appealed.  </P> <P> Tepper, the redevelopment agency attorney, said last week's ruling "sets a good  framework" for the Court of Appeal to consider the second lawsuit, which he  predicted will be resolved "fairly quickly."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>   [Text] Barnaul 24 March, TASS -- Several people were killed  after a soldier opened fire in one of the Russian ICBM units in  southwestern Siberia.    The accident occurred during a guard mounting ceremony when  one of the soldiers armed with a sub-machine gun suddenly opened  fire, killing his commander and several fellow soldiers. The  guards on duty did not retaliate, fearing that bullets may hit  fuel tanks of nuclear missiles deployed at the site. In that  case a catastrophe would have been inevitable.    The local newspaper ALTAYSKAYA PRAVDA said that the guards  are prohibited from firing in the direction of the missiles even  in the event of an attack by a subversive group.    It took the commander of the unit three hours to persuade  the  soldier to surrender. During all this time the soldier,  resident of Daghestan, did not leave a combat vehicle he had  seized earlier.    The newspaper said that the "critical" accident that  happened  on March 10 was not reported to local counterintelligence  officials, which explains why there was no order to send  paratroopers to the site.    The newspaper did not speculate about possible motives of  the  accident.</p>

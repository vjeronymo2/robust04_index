			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY REDISTRICTING DECISION  </P> <P> With respect to your latest editorial on redistricting, it needs to be pointed  out that Judge Kenyon has no right to be out of patience with the Board of  Supervisors. It was the Department of Justice and the ACLU that waited seven  years before filing the lawsuit.  </P> <P> It was Judge Kenyon himself who declared that the trial would be over in  February and then let the case drag on until June.  </P> <P> It is absurd and unfair for the judge now to order the county to submit a  redistricting plan within 20 days. This allows no time for public hearings to  be held and effectively shuts off citizen participation in redistricting.  </P> <P> Common sense would allow Sarah Flores and Greg O'Brian the right to run in  November (for a seat on the board), and the board to reapportion using the 1990  census figures, not antiquated projections.  </P> <P> RICHARDS D. BARGER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

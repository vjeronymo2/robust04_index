			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Arco takes stake in Chinese refinery Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the US oil and natural gas group, has conditionally taken up 237.6m shares in Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company, one of the biggest refineries in China which will next month launch a public offering in Hong Kong. The stake will give Arco some 9.9 per cent of the registered capital of Zhenhai. The stock has not yet been priced, but the company is understood to be aiming to sell its shares on a multiple between 10.2 and 12.5 with an issue price range between HKDollars 2.05 and HKDollars 2.50. Arco's interest is a vote of confidence in a company which is perceived  - in Hong Kong at least - to have problems. In May, Beijing reimposed controls on the pricing, import and distribution of crude oil and oil products and, in spite of attempts by Zhenhai's parent, Sinopec (China Petrochemical Corporation), to smooth the impact of this, the company is seen as being in effect unable to control the pricing of its products. While analysts see the introduction of a foreign partner as a positive sign, many caution there is no direct corollary with this and expansion in overseas markets. In July 1993 Tsingtao Brewery, the first mainland company to list in Hong Kong, sold 5 per cent of its shares to Anheuser Busch, the US brewer, but appears to have had little help in building markets abroad. Zhenhai is due to release its prospectus early next month, with the initial public offering pencilled in for November 15. It plans to issue 600m shares, or 25 per cent of the company, to raise HKDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 155m) to HKDollars 1.5bn. It will become the 12th mainland company to have its primary listing in Hong Kong.</p>

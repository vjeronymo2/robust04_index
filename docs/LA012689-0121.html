			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY DEMOCRAT REVIVES NO-FAULT INSURANCE LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Despite voter rejection in November of a no-fault initiative, the chairman of  the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee on Wednesday introduced  legislation that would enact a California no-fault auto insurance system  modeled on a successful one operating in New York.  </P> <P> The proposal has strong backing from Consumers Union. But its author,  Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), acknowledges that it faces an uphill  battle in the Legislature where opposition from trial lawyers has stymied  similar efforts for nearly two decades.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Johnston told reporters Wednesday that there is a new recognition  among lawmakers of the need to control legal costs that drive up insurance  premiums, which he contends was not accomplished by voter passage of the Ralph  Nader-backed Proposition 103.  </P> <P> "If we do not act in 1989," Johnston warned, "there will be another voter  revolt in 1990."  </P> <P> Johnston's proposal drew cautious support from the insurance industry, which  spent tens of millions of dollars promoting Proposition 104, its own, less  generous no-fault proposal that was overwhelmingly defeated on the November  ballot.  </P> <P> But while one insurance spokesman lauded Johnston's proposal as "on the right  track," industry lobbyists stopped short of an outright endorsement and  confided that they believe the bill does not go far enough to restrict lawsuits  and clamp down on medical claims.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speaker to Offer Own Bill  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said he will  introduce his own insurance bill, and officials of the California Trial  Lawyers' Assn. are unequivocal in their opposition to Johnston's measure. They  contend that the legislation would increase costs rather than reduce them and  is actually "an attempt to undermine Proposition 103."  </P> <P> "We just had an election where the people were given an opportunity to choose,  and they rejected no-fault by 75%," said Will Glennon, the association's legal  analyst. "Now Pat Johnston and Consumers Union are saying, 'Let's look at  no-fault again.' It's ironic, to say the least."  </P> <P> In fact, Johnston's proposal offers far more generous benefits to motorists and  is less restrictive of legal rights than the insurance industry's defeated  ballot initiative.  </P> <P> Under the traditional "tort liability" system used in California and 24 other  states, the negligent driver's insurance company must reimburse the innocent  party in an accident.  </P> <P> With no-fault, motorists are compensated for injuries by their own insurance  companies no matter who is at fault. Costs are reduced because lawsuits are  prohibited unless injuries are particularly serious or medical bills exceed a  certain limit.  </P> <P> Johnston's legislation would provide up to $50,000 in medical benefits, $3,000  for funeral costs and up to $2,000 per month for three years to compensate for  lost wages. It also would allow "reasonable and necessary" payments for child  care and other services up to a maximum of $50 daily for one year.  </P> <P> To cut costs, the legislation would allow lawsuits only when the total loss  exceeds the $50,000 maximum medical benefit or in the case of a "serious  injury."  </P> <P> By contrast, Proposition 104 would have allowed a maximum of $10,000 in medical  benefits, $15,000 in lost wages and $5,000 in funeral costs, with no provisions  for other expenses incurred by an accident victim. The insurance  industry-sponsored initiative would also have made it much more difficult to  sue, allowing a case to go to court only when an injury is "both serious and  permanent."  </P> <P> Voter passage of Proposition 103 does not prohibit the adoption of a no-fault  system. Moreover, when combined with Proposition 103's stringent regulation of  the insurance industry, Johnston's proposal would result in a system that  closely mirrors New York's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New York Plan  </P> <P> According to New York insurance officials, the adoption of that state's  no-fault system prompted an 80% reduction in the volume of lawsuits and a  significant increase in the amount of each premium dollar that goes to accident  victims. Premiums also rise more slowly than in many other states although New  York remains the seventh most costly state in which to buy auto insurance.  </P> <P> Harry Snyder, West Coast director of Consumers Union, conceded that Johnston's  proposal, like New York's system, is unlikely to actually reduce premiums. But  he contended that it will keep rates from raising as rapidly as they might  otherwise, "and that is very significant in itself."  </P> <P> Although there are sharp differences between Johnston's proposal and the  defeated no-fault initiative, the insurance industry's unsuccessful campaign to  sell its ballot measure as New York-style no-fault may confuse some lawmakers  and make it more difficult for Johnston to win support for his proposal. The  trial lawyers, whose fees from lawsuits would be jeopardized by any no-fault  system, were quick to capitalize on that point.  </P> <P> "The insurance industry spent $70 million, mostly aimed at selling Proposition  104 as New York no-fault," said the association's Glennon. "(Johnston's)  proposal will be washed out by that campaign."  </P> <P> Johnston will also not be able to count on support from Speaker Brown, a trial  lawyer loyalist. The plan Brown said he will introduce would continue the  present system but would require that injury claims for less than $50,000 be  submitted to arbitration rather than allowed to go to court.  </P> <P> Another major hurdle faced by Johnston is the vocal opposition of Harvey  Rosenfield, the primary author of Proposition 103. On Wednesday, Rosenfield  said the Legislature should take no steps to modify the insurance system until  Proposition 103 is fully implemented and the insurance industry is forced to  open its books and justify the need for further cost-cutting measures.  </P></p>

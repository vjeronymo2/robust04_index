			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE WAS NOBODY'S ALL-AMERICAN  </P> <P> When you think of the top running back in the NFL, you figure a guy who spent  four years at tailback for USC, a guy who had 10 Texas schools fighting over  him when he went to high school. You're talking a guy who had a football in his  hands since he could walk. You want him, you have to fight Notre Dame, Joe  Paterno or Miami for him.  </P> <P> What I'm saying is, the football recruiters don't hang around the secondary  school in Enugu, Nigeria, all that much.  </P> <P> They may now. Because the leading ground gainer in the NFL last season was not  Eric Dickerson, Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, Roger Craig or even the remarkable  rookie, Barry Sanders. Or, any other product of American sandlots. In point of  fact, it was a guy who never heard of the NFL growing up, who didn't even know  what a football looked like.  </P> <P> Christian Okoye is the unlikeliest football hero this side of a Hollywood  script. The first football game he ever saw, he was in.  </P> <P> He came to this country as a track athlete. In his native Nigeria, he somehow  managed to perfect a decent form in the discus and the hammer and won whatever  meets his war-ravaged country was able to stage.  </P> <P> It's not revolutionary for football players to be recruited from track teams.  Red Grange, no less, was a champion hurdler who was ordered to go out for  football by his fraternity brothers. George Gipp left track for the football  field to feed his gambling habit. But, they had laid eyes on a football before.  They had kicked or thrown one in play.  </P> <P> The first American football that Christian Okoye saw, he thought was broken.  "Why isn't it round?" he complained. "That's not a ball. It's been run over."  </P> <P> He came to little Azusa Pacific University to escape the tribal strife that  devastated his homeland. The tribe to which he belonged, the Ibos, tried to  secede from the government at Lagos and form their own Republic of Biafra. In  the resultant civil war, Biafra became an international symbol for suffering  and starvation.  </P> <P> Actually, it was residual animosities from the civil war that turned Okoye to  football. Despite his world-class marks in the discus and weight throws, he was  left off the Nigerian Olympic team in 1984. That put into jeopardy his future  in returning home as a coach one day. Old enmities would not die.  </P> <P> So, Christian Okoye presented to the football staff at Azusa Pacific a  260-pound, 6-foot-1-inch body that could run the 40 in 4.4, the hundred in  10.15 and was used to pain and suffering. The only thing he had to learn was  how to grip that funny object they called a ball. They tell the story of the  first time he hit a line, and the dazed linebacker picked himself up.  </P> <P> "Where'd they get that?!" the linebacker demanded. "He's from Africa," he was  told. "Oh, yeah?" was his reaction. "How'd they get the stripes off him?"  </P> <P> He was as unstoppable as lava. When told his African nickname was Cho Cho, a  defensive lineman had a better idea. "His nickname should be 'Ow!' " he  recommended.  </P> <P> He ran for 3,569 yards and 34 touchdowns in college. His school won the NAIA  track meet every year he was there. His time in the hundred, 10.15, would have  won the Moscow Olympics, and his time in the 200, 20.5, was the NAIA record.  </P> <P> But speed and power in Division III football is greeted with cautious  skepticism by NFL scouts. It often evaporates in competition where everyone  runs the 40 in 4-plus and most people weigh 260 or more. Besides, there was  that lack of experience.  </P> <P> As his fame grew, ignorance about Africa surfaced. Did he have to watch out for  lions on his way to school? Do people wear bones in their noses? Okoye laughs.  "They wear more things in their ears here than we do in Africa." Enugu is  actually bigger than Peoria.  </P> <P> Okoye was hardly a secret, but NFL general managers did not sit up and consult  their draft lists till Okoye ran for four touchdowns in the Senior Bowl in  1987. Then, the Kansas City Chiefs traded up 11 places to draft him.  </P> <P> A cheerful, modest, deeply religious man, Okoye goes through a football game as  he goes through life -- with a smile on his face. If he leads the Chiefs to the  Super Bowl, the NFL may conclude the experts were wrong. There's still plenty  of ivory in Africa. Only not in tusks, in helmets and pads.  </P></p>

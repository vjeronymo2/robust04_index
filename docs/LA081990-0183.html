			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATING 'A DEED OF DEATH'  </P> <P> Sidney Kirkpatrick's review of my book, "A Deed of Death," (Book Review, July  22) mistakenly states that I was "unaware of the explosive new information"  concerning "Mary's and her mother's frantic last trip to (William Desmond)  Taylor's bungalow on the night of the murder, a trip never even alluded to in  Giroux's book." Kirkpatrick commits three blunders in one sentence -- mistaking  the date of the murder, confusing Minter's mother with her grandmother, and  overlooking my detailed account of the visit. No competent reviewer would have  skipped Pages 149-51 of my book, which reveal what happened, as recorded by  Detective Lt. Edward C. King of the Los Angeles Police Department. This is not  new, except to Kirkpatrick. It surfaced in 1930, as my bibliography shows.  Kirkpatrick did not cover it in his 1986 book, "A Cast of Killers," since he  knew nothing of it, and he has misread and misreported what he thinks he found  in Minter's posthumous papers.  </P> <P> Minter's visit to Taylor occurred not "on the night of the murder" (Wednesday,  Feb. 1, 1922) but two nights before (Monday, Jan. 30). She was accompanied not  by her hated mother, Charlotte Shelby, but by her devoted grandmother, Julia  Miles ("I always call grandma 'mama' "). Since Minter went home carrying  Taylor's goodby letter on the night of Jan. 30, Mother Shelby's motive for  killing Taylor -- his "amorous advances" to her daughter, as Kirkpatrick puts  it -- no longer existed. Yet Kirkpatrick would have us believe the mother shot  him during this "frantic last trip to Taylor's bungalow," two nights before he  died.  </P> <P> Let me confirm that I certainly did depend on the "archival newspaper accounts"  that Kirkpatrick sneers at, as well as on police records. I am indebted to The  Times for Mary Miles Minter's long account ("the first I have ever given under  my own name"), which she gave to The Times because it was "the only newspaper  which has not hounded me day and night with questions, questions, questions  about Mr. Taylor."  </P> <P> Finally, Kirkpatrick's statement that my book does not "begin to explain what  the cover-up was all about" is hogwash. He ignores (or never read) Pages 31-49,  which spell out the triple crisis -- the Fatty Arbuckle rape scandal, Wallace  Reid's death from drugs, and Taylor's murder -- which, coming together in 1922,  frightened Hollywood out of its wits for fear of federal censorship. "The movie  bosses were anxious to suppress the whole thing," as my old friend King Vidor  said. "They'd rather sacrifice Taylor than sacrifice the whole industry."  </P> <P> ROBERT GIROUX  </P> <P> NEW YORK  </P> <P> Sidney Kirkpatrick replies:  </P> <P>  Robert Giroux, in his spirited letter as in his book, makes no mention of  Detective Lt. Leroy Sanderson's final, 10-page, confidential report to City  Hall on June 13, 1941. That report, one among many that Mr. Giroux has  overlooked, reads in part as follows:  </P> <P> "It is reasonable to assume that Mary visited Taylor on the night of Feb. 1,  1922. Miss J. M. Berger (Minter's accountant) stated to Officers that Mrs.  Shelby called her at 7 p.m., Feb. 1, 1922, and asked if she knew where Mary  was. When informed by Miss Berger that she did not know Mary's whereabouts,  Mrs. Shelby hung up the receiver. This would indicate that Mrs. Shelby was  searching for Mary 45 minutes before Taylor was killed. Carl Stockdale  testified . . . that he was with Mrs. Shelby from 7 to 9 p.m., Feb. 1, 1922.  Mrs. Faith MacLean (Taylor's neighbor), when shown a picture of Stockdale,  partially identified him as a suspect seen leaving Taylor's apartment, after  the murder. . . .  </P> <P> "Mrs. Shelby made statements, in the presence of several persons, that she  feared she would be indicted for the Taylor murder. By some means she evaded an  official questioning concerning the Taylor murder, until April 9, 1926, and in  that statement, she obviously misrepresented the truth concerning many facts. .  . . She has never told the truth as to her whereabouts and actions on the night  of Feb. 1, 1922.  </P> <P> "Mary Miles Minter has stated that her mother said she had killed Taylor. Mrs.  Shelby informed Miss Berger and Chauncey Eaton (Minter's chauffeur) before 7:30  a.m. that Taylor was murdered. His body was not found until 7:30 a.m. The body  was examined and it was believed he died from natural causes. It was not  determined that he was murdered until 8 a.m. . . ."  </P> <P> SIDNEY D.

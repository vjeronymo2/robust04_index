			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Assistant Professor Masahiro Asada and others in a  Tokyo Institute of Technology research group succeeded in making  an experimental quantum box laser and confirmed its oscillation.  Theoretically, it is predicted that this future-type  semiconductor laser will make ultra-low current oscillation  possible. This laser is different from the conventional element  which consists of layers of ultra-thin semiconductor film. The  new structure lines up minute semiconductor particles that are  30 nanometers in size. With this structure, the electrons can be  used for radiation without waste. Right now it is necessary to  supply a large current under an ultra-low temperature condition  and the laser is not at the point where its full potential can  be realized. However, it can be expected in the future that the  performance level can be raised if the manufacturing technology  is improved.    Minute semiconductor particles are lined up.    The experimental laser consists of a plane surface  indium-gallium-arsenide film with many particle forms of  gallium-indium-arsenide lined up in a grid pattern and embedded  in it. This film itself is sandwiched between indium-phosphorus  films. The diameter of a single particle is 30 nanometers, the  thickness is 12 nanometers, and the space between adjoining  particles is 70 nanometers.    These kinds of semiconductor particles are called ``quantum  boxes'' since the electrons are confined in these particles one  by one just as if they are in boxes. The conventional  semiconductor laser is a thin film with electrons held in it.  The electrons can be trapped in a much smaller space when this  is chopped up into boxes and it is predicted that the radiation  efficiency will be exceptionally advanced.    For this reason, in comparison with semiconductor lasers  actually in use at the present time, it is possible that these  lasers will be able to oscillate with only several tenths or  less of the current. Since the current consumption is small, the  result is that heat generation and such will not be a problem  even if a number of them are grouped together and it is expected  that the laser will be useful in the development of optical  communications and optical computers.    In experiments with the experimental laser at 196 degrees  below zero Celsius, light pulses were oscillated at about 1.3  microns. It was also confirmed that the quantum box confined the  electrons well. However, the current necessary for oscillation  is 1.1 amperes, which, when compared with the current required  by a conventional semiconductor laser, is rather larger.</p>

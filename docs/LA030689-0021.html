			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ILLUSION OF SHAMIR'S 'PEACE' PLAN;  </P> <P> ISRAEL MUST REJECT NONSENSE AND BEGIN TO DEAL WITH ARAFAT  </P> <P> The new Israeli "peace ideas," revealed last month by Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir, bring to mind the stage routine in which the illusion of walking and  even sprinting is created without the pantomimist advancing a single inch.  Shamir's intention was to generate feverish diplomatic activity, giving the  illusion of movement without actually advancing even an inch closer to peace.  </P> <P> Key elements in Shamir's sham "ideas" for settling the Palestinian conflict  are: autonomy Camp David style, election of a new Palestinian leadership  without ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization and negotiations about  the occupied territories with Jordan and other Arab governments.  </P> <P> None of these elements make sense.  </P> <P> It is not for mere autonomy, a caricature of independence, that Palestinian  boys and girls are sacrificing their lives. The Palestinians, who were a beaten  and humiliated people, ignored by the world and by their fellow Arabs, have  been transformed by 15 months of struggle. Having stood up to an aggressive and  efficient army, the Palestinian people have a new sense of pride and national  resolve. They know their uprising cannot be quelled. It is ridiculous to think  that they will halt their growing rebellion in return for the privilege of  administering their own sewage system.  </P> <P> The idea of establishing an alternative Palestinian leadership is equally  ridiculous. The most important achievement of the intifada has been the  strengthening of the PLO and the enhancement of its prestige and authority.  From a secondary and neglected pre-intifada status, Yasser Arafat and the PLO  have moved to center stage in the Arab world. Arab leaders look to Arafat to  mediate disputes and world leaders are vying for an official visit with him.  </P> <P> For any emerging state, universally recognized leadership is of the utmost  importance. The Palestinians understand this and, with few exceptions, rally  behind the PLO. The exceptions, marginal splinter groups and foreign agents,  are not tolerated any more than similar splinter groups were tolerated in other  emerging countries, including the pre-state Jewish settlement in Palestine.  </P> <P> The Israeli government insists that it will never negotiate with the PLO  because it has conducted terrorist activities. This stand is not credible as  long as Israel sits in the United Nations along with 50 other countries whose  leaders, like Shamir, were terrorists until their independence was achieved.  This stand does not make sense when it is remembered that Israel signed an  agreement with West Germany only six years after the end of the Holocaust.  </P> <P> In favor of negotiating with Jordan's King Hussein rather than with Arafat, the  tired argument is made that there are more Palestinian Arabs in Jordan than in  the occupied territories. But there also are more Jews in the United States  than in Greater Israel. Should then the Arabs negotiate with George Bush rather  than with the government of Israel?  </P> <P> If we abandon Shamir's insincere nonsense, what remains is for Israel to  negotiate with the PLO. After 100 years of enmity between the two peoples, the  recognized leader of the Palestinian people has stood up and declared his  willingness to negotiate with Israel to achieve a peace in which our country  and a Palestinian state will stand side-by-side. The only rational response is  immediately to stop the bloodshed, for which there is no longer any excuse, and  to enter negotiations now.  </P> <P> Those who doubt Arafat's sincerity can rest assured that negotiations are not  about words; rather, they are about issues of substance: the border between  Israel and Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, defense arrangements, the  refugee problem and relations between the two countries. If Arafat is not  sincere, that will be discovered very quickly.  </P> <P> Those in Israel who refuse to negotiate with Arafat are saying in essence that  they prefer not to have peace. Shamir's sham is a game played to gain time. But  as the intifada grows, augmenting the moral and political strength of the  Palestinian people, and as our strength and international prestige decline, we  are not gaining time, we are losing it.  </P> <P> It is in Israel's vital interest at this time to come to the negotiating table  with Yasser Arafat, the only man whose signature can hold the Palestinian  people to a peace agreement. The price that we Israelis will pay for peace is a  dear one: all of the territory captured in 1967. But there is no other rational  choice. Those Israelis who propose to free Arafat from his commitment to peace  are risking Israel's very existence.  </P></p>

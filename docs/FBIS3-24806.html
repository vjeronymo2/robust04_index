			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Three weeks ago, Nigeria's military ruler, General  Sani Abacha, set up a 19-member commission to prepare for a  forthcoming constitutional conference. But since then, there  has been mounting criticism from civil rights groups, student  bodies, and from individuals over the commission's membership.  Some people think there should be a sovereign national  conference instead. At the moment, the commission is inviting  submissions from interested parties to work out an agenda.  Later this week, the commission will be deciding on certain key  issues, including fixing a date for the conference. In Lagos,  Sola Odunfa went to see the commission's secretary, Debor  Okandi, and he asked him if he would be passing on to the  conference all the suggestions the commission receives.    [Begin recording] [Okandi] No. You see, our commission is  expected to collect the memoranda, sift through them and pull  out the ideas the public would like to discuss, so we will not  pass all the memoranda received to the conference.    [Odunfa] Will that not be seen as the commission censoring  the opinions put forward?    [Okandi] No, that is not censoring, because what we are  going  to do is to look at all the points raised by the memoranda and  to reduce the work of the conference in the sense that if you  have got 10 memoranda repeating some items, it is better to  collate them into one, instead of making the whole conference  look at them all over again. So, we are not going to censor, we  are going to ensure that all the different points raised are put  into the agenda for the conference.    [Odunfa] Let us assume that some Nigerians suggest that the  country should break up and give reasons for this. Will you  forward this to the conference?    [Okandi] Definitely, you see the agenda for the conference  will represent the views and the moods of the country. The mood  of the country will be reflected in the agenda. You can take it  from me that the members of the commission are aware that some  members of the public are in fact saying that the starting point  should be: Should the country remain one, or should it break up,  or should it have clauses for secession, or you know, expelling  any section of the country that becomes troublesome. Whatever  the public want, we will formulate into the agenda.    [Odunfa] At the end of the conference, will you simply  forward the decisions taken to the Provisional Ruling Council,  or will you insert your own comments by way of recommendations  and so on?    [Okandi] No, our recommendations will be put there and  without trying to forecast the work of the commission. Whether  the views as reached by the conference will be final or not will  be determined by my commission when they formulate the agenda.    [Odunfa] It is not sure yet that the views of the conference  will be final?    [Okandi] No, you see, I am speaking to you just as one  member. The members have not got to that stage, but I am sure  the members of the commission already know what the public want,  and I can assure you, our work will reflect the mood and  aspirations of Nigerians.    [Odunfa] Will the conference appoint its own officers.    [Okandi] The conference... [pauses] I daresay, that will be  part of the recommendations the commission will make and we have  not got to that stage yet. [end recording]</p>

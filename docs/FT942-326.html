			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Heavy rain washes out Thai rubber output Unusually heavy rainfall in southern Thailand has reduced June rubber output by an estimated 50 per cent, according to senior officials of the state Rubber Research Institute, reports Reuter from Bangkok. In past years, rubber production in June was around 100,000 tonnes, but the unusual weather pattern this year has cut that figure in half, creating shortages and causing prices to surge.</p>

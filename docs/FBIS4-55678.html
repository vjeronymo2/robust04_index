			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 19 (AFP) -- A UN  flight landed safely at Tuzla airport Thursday, two days after  Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the airport when another UN plane  landed there, UN spokesman Jens Kirk said. No damage was caused  in that incident, but the plane took off abruptly as the eight  shells thudded in. Captain Kirk, of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR), said another plane would land at the airport  Thursday afternoon if no shelling took place. The mainly Moslem  Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the UNPROFOR  on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN  forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14,  but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.</p>

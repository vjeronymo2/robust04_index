			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- "The Korean people owe  their remarkable progress in socialist construction to the wise  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the immortal chuche idea,"  Choummali Sai-ngason, politburo member of the C.C. [Central  Committee], the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and defence  minister of Laos, told KCNA, giving his impressions of Korea.    "Korea, the stronghold of socialism, gives great courage to  the world people," he said. "The Korean people are advancing  along the road of socialism, not wavering in whatever storm  because they are equipped with their leader's idea and are  closely united behind him."    He said the U.S.-led imperialists cannot act arbitrarily  because the Korean people have respected Comrade Kim Il-song as  their leader, enjoy the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il and are firmly united around them.    "The Laotian people and Army," he declared, "will actively  support as ever the Korean people in the efforts to defend the  sovereignty of the country and achieve the independent and  peaceful Reunification of the country and always fight shoulder  to shoulder with the Korean people."</p>

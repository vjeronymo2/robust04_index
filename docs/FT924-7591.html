			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Banks fight watchdog plan THE FUTURE of the proposed Personal Investments Authority looked uncertain yesterday as it emerged that months of talks have not moved the British banking community any closer to joining the self-regulatory organisation. The authority's formation committee, which includes two bank representatives, is to meet this week to consider amendments to its proposed charter in the light of comments from potential members. Participation by a majority of Britain's banks is considered crucial to the success of the new body. The Association of British Insurers said last week that its members - which will provide the bulk of funding for the PIA and its contribution to the Investors' Compensation Scheme - would not join unless at least 95 per cent of potential members joined as well. That means that unless the banks join, the life insurers will not join, ensuring the authority's failure. The British Bankers Association is said to have spelled out in a detailed memo late last month its objections to the structure of the PIA and to have outlined several changes which would have to be made before the organisation could obtain its approval. The bankers' association stressed that individual banks had to make up their own minds, but is said to have told the formation committee in strong language that the PIA proposal remained unconvincing on its merits, even after months of discussions. The bankers are said to have told the committee that there were few obvious benefits to consumers from merging all the self-regulatory operations for retail financial services into a single body. Moreover, they said the new association was likely to be even more expensive than the present system, under which different types of pro-viders belong to different self-regulatory organisations. Regulation was already underfunded for some businesses and, if the PIA felt the need to keep costs down, it might sacrifice enforcement of conduct of business rules in order to concentrate on efforts on reducing fraud claims on the Investors' Compensation Scheme. The bankers said that the proposed 30-member PIA board of trustees was unworkable and would encourage conflict between constituency interests. They said that the problem with the PIA was that its membership was too disparate for the body to work well. Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

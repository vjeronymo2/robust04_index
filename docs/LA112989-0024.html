			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Beatles Watch: There was no Beatles reunion at the Forum Monday night, despite  Paul McCartney's suggestion at an afternoon press conference that he'd be  receptive to getting together with George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Harrison  was in town but not at McCartney's third night at the Forum. Before McCartney's  press conference, Harrison had told Musician magazine's Mark Rowland that at  this time he has "no relationship" with his former bandmate. But there was a  surprise guest appearance for McCartney fans Monday: Stevie Wonder came onstage  for a duet of "Ebony and Ivory," which he wrote and recorded with McCartney.  Daniel Cerone  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lome, 26 May (AFP) -- Togo's main opposition  leader, Yaovi Agboyibor of the Action Committee for Renewal  [CAR], in an interview with AFP yesterday evening, "expressed  regret" that Togolese Prime Minister Edem Kodjo "continues to  deceive the people by claiming to belong to the parliamentary  majority." Mr. Kodjo has formed a government in which he has  attributed eight out of the 19 ministerial posts to President  Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters; eight to "independent"  candidates, and only three to members of the Togolese Union for  Democracy [UTD], his own party.    The opposition CAR and UTD which formed a coalition to  contest the elections and which won last February's legislative  elections -- the CAR won 34 out of 78 parliamentary seats and  the UTD won six -- had agreed to propose Mr. Agboyibor for the  post of prime minister but to the general surprise, General  Eyadema on 23 April appointed Mr. Kodjo to form a new  government. Edem Kodjo, a former dignitary of Eyadema's regime  and an opposition member "boycotted" by his former political  "friends," has since his appointment been trying to form his  government team. "Mr. Kodjo knows very well that he intends to  rely on another presidential majority to govern the country, as  reflected in the composition of the government," Mr. Agboyibor  said.    Earlier in the evening, the prime minister told AFP that the  new government he has just formed is "an interim government."  He further said that "if the CAR decides to join the  government, there will be a cabinet reshuffle to enable it to  take the portfolios due it." [passage omitted]</p>

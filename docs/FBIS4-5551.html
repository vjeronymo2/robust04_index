			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The 11th meeting of  the board of the International Institute of the Chuche Idea  (IIJI) took place in New Delhi on April 8.    The meeting dealt with the question of ensuring the success  of the International Chuche Idea Seminar on Independence, Peace  and Friendship to be held on the threshold of the 82nd birthday  of the great leader President Kim Il-song, reviewed the  activities of the IIJI in 1993 and discussed the action program  for 1994.    Shuhachi Inoue, director general of the board of IIJI, made  a  report at the meeting under the title "Let Us Conduct More  Energetic Study and Dissemination of the Chuche Idea for the  Building of an Independent New World".    The reporter said the chuche idea founded by respected  President Kim Il-song and developed in depth by esteemed  Secretary Kim Chong-il serves as the guiding idea of our era,  the era of independence, because it is the outlook on the world  and the view of value indicating the way of realizing the  independence of man.    Touching on the achievements made in last year's activities  for the propaganda and dissemination of the chuche idea and its  study, he said political parties of a number of countries have  defined this idea as their guiding idea and are assiduously  studying it and the chuche-based theory of party building and  applying them to their party activities.    He outlined this year's tasks to invigorate the study of the  chuche idea and its propaganda and dissemination.    "All the chuche idea study organizations and followers of  the  chuche idea," he said, "should continue to widely conduct the  study and discussion of classical works of President Kim Il-song  and Secretary Kim Chong-il, regarding them as the textbooks."    He stressed that they should deeply study and discuss the  general principles and theories of the chuche idea in  combination with practical problems, thus finding a correct way  of building an independent, new world and accelerating the  historical turn to this world.</p>

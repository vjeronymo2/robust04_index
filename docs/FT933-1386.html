			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Export orders in manufacturing drop back WORRIES about the strength of the UK recovery have increased after a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed that export orders for manufactured goods have slipped this month to their lowest level since April. The survey, published today, showed a contraction in overall order books between August and September, although companies' optimism about their ability to increase output rose for the ninth month in succession. The CBI's soundings underline concerns that weak domestic demand and the poor economic climate in key export markets may inhibit the gradual UK upturn apparent in the past six months. Inflationary pressures remain weak, according to the survey, with only 10 per cent of companies expecting to increase prices in the next few months. The poll was conducted between August 27 and September 15. It covered 1,468 companies, accounting for about half of total manufacturing employment. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economics committee, said export order books were 'substantially' below the levels of the early summer and the recession in the rest of Europe was 'a major cause for concern'. The fears about future levels of exports are particularly relevant to recovery prospects because in the past year strong export growth has been among the main influences pushing up overall UK output. Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI economics director, said a cut in interest rates, now 6 per cent, might be needed over the next few months to help boost UK demand. In a speech in Manchester he said that the poor climate for exports meant growth would remain 'hesitant' until next year's expected recovery in demand in continental Europe. Sixteen per cent of companies in the survey said export order books were above normal, with 37 per cent saying they were below normal. This gave a negative balance of 21 percentage points for this question, compared with one of 15 points. In September last year the negative balance was 33 points. As for overall levels of orders, these were thought to be above normal by 17 per cent of companies with 38 per cent thinking they were below normal. The negative balance for this question of 21 points was slightly below the August level of 18 points, but a marked improvement on the negative balance of 53 points 12 months ago. Thirty per cent of companies said they thought they would increase output over the next four months, and 13 per cent predicted this would go down. The resulting positive balance of 17 points is the strongest since May and compares with a negative balance for this question of 14 points last September.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Propylene. Propylene is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. Propylene does not contribute to ozone depletion, nor does it contribute significantly to global warming. Propylene is a flammable refrigerant and as such, EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities which already manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety standards required for managing flammable chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Butane. Butane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. Butane does not contribute to ozone depletion, nor does it contribute significantly to global warming. Butane is a flammable refrigerant and as such, EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities which already manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety standards required for managing flammable chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Hydrocarbon Blend A. Hydrocarbon Blend A is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration equipment. This blend does not contribute to ozone depletion, nor does it contribute significantly to global warming. This blend contains flammable refrigerants and as such, EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities which already manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety standards required for managing flammable chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Chlorine. Chlorine is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration equipment. Chlorine is a highly reactive chemical and as such, EPA recommends but does not require that chlorine only be used at industrial facilities which manufacture or use chlorine in the process stream. Note, however, that OSHA's Process Safety Management Standards apply to the use of chlorine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 Industrial Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refrigeration, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HFC&hyph;227ea. HFC&hyph;227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;227ea under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B. R&hyph;402A and R&hyph;402B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, propane, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) R&hyph;404A. R&hyph;404A, which consists of HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) R&hyph;507. R&hyph;507, which consists of HFC&hyph;125, HFC&hyph;143a, and HFC&hyph;134a, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

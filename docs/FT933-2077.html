			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / People: Changing chairs in Vocational Qualifications Education and training enthusiast Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office, has been appointed chairman of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications which, over the past few years, has been developing competence-based vocational qualifications. He replaces Sir Bryan Nicholson who is leaving at the end of his three-year term and who becomes president of the CBI from April 1994. Sir Bryan, a skilful negotiator, has been an enthusiastic chairman of the NCVQ, using his skills of persuasion to gain greater acceptance for national vocational qualifications. According to Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, under Sir Bryan's leadership the NCVQ had made 'excellent progress'. She also said that Heron's background, experience and commitment to education and training made him ideally qualified to build on the achievements of his predecessor. Heron has had both a strong professional and personal commitment to training. Before joining the Post Office in January, he was director in charge of personnel worldwide for Unilever. He is deputy chairman and a member of the board of Business in the Community (pictured in that capacity right) and was recently appointed vice chairman of the National Advisory Council on Education and Training Targets. Made up of senior business leaders and academics, Nacett's role is to oversee progress towards the attainment of the very same NVQs that the NCVQ has been developing.</p>

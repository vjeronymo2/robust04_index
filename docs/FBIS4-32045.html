			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Julius Gembicky; place and date not given]    [Text] The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] is the  backbone and the core of the Left Choice [electoral alliance  formed by the SDL, the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, the  Green Party in Slovakia, and the Farmers Movement]. Because of  its stable preferences in preelection polls, it has good  prospects for the fall elections. In spite of this, it is being  alleged that there are disagreements among its leaders, a rift  within the party, and even a secret plan on a postelection  coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].    [Gembicky] Mr. Weiss, under what circumstances would the SDL  be ready to form a coalition with the Meciarites after the  elections?    [Weiss] If we had the certainty that no HZDS deputy would  give the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to a recent  incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak  greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament, who has  black hair and wears a moustache, with a "Heil Hitler"] and that  the policy of this movement, which incites the people and sets  Slovaks against one another and Slovaks against Hungarians, will  change; if they stopped fabricating theories about a conspiracy  against the Slovak Republic and if we had the certainty that  their policy will be based on expertise and that HZDS  representatives will be able to abide by agreements and will  give up the idea of steamrolling and breaking up other parties  by rectifying or dismissing their leaderships. It would be  possible if we were linked, moreover, by a relative proximity of  our programs. In that case, we would be ready to consider even  a coalition with the HZDS.    [Gembicky] Does all of this apply to a coalition with the  HZDS even if it is headed by Mr. Meciar?    [Weiss] I do not think the problems of HZDS policy are  caused only by the personality of Vladimir Meciar, even though  he did everything within human power to damage relations with  all of the other parties. The extempore performance staged in  parliament by Ivan Luptak demonstrated what kind of  undercurrents there are in this movement and in which direction  it could evolve. The decision about what will happen after the  elections will be made by the voters, but the further direction  of the evolution of the HZDS must be determined by this movement  itself. The HZDS is in evident foreign political isolation,  and, despite its considerable influence in our society, it has  also drifted into domestic political isolation. Its inability  to prepare any coalition is proof of this.    [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the formation  of a coalition with the HZDS, including Vladimir Meciar, after  the elections, in case it shows interest in it?    [Weiss] If the HZDS keeps reverting to the political tone it  uses vis-a-vis the SDL, I must raise the question of whether he  who spends his entire energy on breaking up his future partner  can be trusted as a partner for cooperation.    [Gembicky] Would the SDL reject postelection cooperation if  the demand of the HZDS or its chairman was: Yes to the SDL but  without Weiss and [SDL Deputy Chairman] Ftacnik?    [Weiss] I do not think the HZDS will be in a situation,  after the elections, in which it will be able to set conditions.  Such an ultimatum is unacceptable to us. The decision on with  whom we will enter into a coalition will be made by the Republic  Council or an SDL congress.    [Gembicky] The SDL's preferences are relatively high, and  the Left Choice could have the decisive influence on the  formation of the government coalition after the elections. What  is the ranking of the SDL's potential partners?    [Weiss] In view of the proximity of programs and acceptance  abroad, the Democratic Union of Slovakia [DU] is the most  natural ally. After all, a leftist-liberal coalition is nothing  exceptional in the world. We would again offer cooperation to  the Association of Workers of Slovakia (ZRS) and, depending on  the correlation of forces, we would consider other potential  partners. We continue to proceed from the idea that the depth  of the crisis in Slovakia and the complexity of the tasks that  will have to be tackled by any government are so huge that  broader cooperation will have to be sought. And such  cooperation rules out diktat by any of the partners.    [Gembicky] Did you come across any negative reactions to the  rejection of cooperation with the HZDS during your recent  meetings with the [SDL] mayors of towns and villages in central  and eastern Slovakia?    [Weiss] Both citizens and mayors understand why it was  necessary to support the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir  Meciar. This is not the SDL's main problem. The SDL's problem  is, rather, that some of our members and supporters cannot  comprehend why we entered into a coalition with the right-wing  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The emotional reactions to  some statements by KDH representatives about the SDL before the  1992 elections are still vivid in memory. Because we had to say  a resolute no to the confrontational style of politics, the  systematic search for an enemy, and the neoparty [neostranicka]  terminology of labeling anyone a traitor, a janissary, and a  saboteur, it was necessary to look for allies.    It was necessary to put an end to the political crisis  generated by the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS], two  political entities without a clear-cut profile, by their falling  apart. A minority government would be unable to accomplish  this. That is why a new majority was found that was able to  stabilize the situation and agree on calling early parliamentary  elections.    The historical dimension must be taken into account as  well. Slovakia has experienced several political coups since  1938. Each of them produced many losers, who can become  exponents of longing for revenge and the settling of accounts.  It is very important for Slovakia not to exhaust its energy on  hatred but on cooperation. A coalition of the left, the center,  and the right is a certain experiment in Slovak political life.  However, it forces all political parties to cooperate, in  defiance of differences in their programs. Slovenia has had  good experience with such a coalition, and a red-black coalition  [of Socialists and the conservative People's Party] is working  well also in Austria.    The KDH, too, is having problems accepting the SDL as a  coalition partner. However, if we were to build only on  negative experience, it could easily happen that we would stop  talking to one another and be unable to shake hands. My idea of  politics is such, however, that, regardless of different  programs and divergent political values and irrespective of a  tough electoral contest, we must not hate one another.    [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the coalition  with the KDH continuing after the elections, should this become  necessary?    [Weiss] This possibility is open but so are other options.  The HZDS's speculations and calculations with the SDL's breakup  are self-serving. The dictum I am the strongest current  [allusion to a statement by Vladimir Meciar] does not apply to  the SDL. The SDL is not founded on a single political star. It  has a constellation of experienced politicians. Even though  these personalities have different views on some tactical steps,  we discuss these differences democratically in order to arrive  at a common opinion.</p>

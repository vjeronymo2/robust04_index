			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Insurance policy fraud 'cut by 25%' Insurance companies have succeeded in cutting fraudulent claims by about 25 per cent in the past two years, says an Association of British Insurers survey released yesterday. The association calculates, however, that fraudulent claims, estimated at Pounds 600m this year, still add about 4 per cent to the cost of insurance. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general, said efforts at preventing fraud were 'now beginning to pay off, with signs of a fall in the number and cost of fraudulent claims. There is still some way to go and that is why further anti-fraud initiatives can be expected from the insurance companies'. Creditor insurance policies, which provide protection against unemployment when goods are bought on credit, are most prone to fraud. For such policies the cost of fraud is worth about 6 per cent of premiums. Household policies are also vulnerable.</p>

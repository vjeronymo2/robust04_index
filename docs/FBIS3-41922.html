The team is working at a site near Baghdad and hopes to  complete its mission by the end of January, the sources said  without specifying the quantity involved.    Last month the same group supervised the removal and  shipment  by air of 33 kilograms (73 pounds) of irradiated fuel from Iraq  to Russia.    In October, IAEA chief Maurizio Zifferero said that some 35  kilograms (77 pounds) of enriched uranium would be transferred  to Russia.    The IAEA, a Vienna-based United Nations agency, and Iraq  signed an accord in April for the removal of 35 kilograms of  uranium. The agreement was reached during a mission of IAEA  inspectors led by Zifferero, who said at the time that the  operation would cost Iraq several million dollars.    Last November the IAEA shipped 12 kilograms (27 pounds) of  non- enriched uranium from Iraq to Russia.    The transfers are in line with UN Security Council  resolutions to disarm Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991.</p>

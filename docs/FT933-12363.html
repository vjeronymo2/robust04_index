			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone secures agreement with lenders THE FUTURE of Hartstone looked more secure yesterday after the hosiery and leather goods group announced that it has reached agreement with its lenders on a formal standstill arrangement pending a longer-term refinancing, writes Paul Taylor. The board also said it had reached agreement with its group of 14 lenders on new facilities to cover the group's anticipated new money requirements until the expiry of the standstill arrangement on January 16. Hartstone's share price gained 7p to close at 56p yesterday. The group stunned the City at the end of June by announcing Pounds 31m above-the-line costs, to cover rationalisation charges, write-downs and exceptional restructuring costs, and a Pounds 9.86m pre-tax loss for the full year. Hartstone announced at the time that it had breached banking covenants and had begun refinancing talks with its bankers. Yesterday Mr Shaun Dowling, executive chairman, said;'The signing of the standstill arrangement and the provision of new money represent a significant step in ensuring Hartstone's future. The new money facilities include: Cash advances and letters of credit facilities provided by the CIT Group/Commercial Services under a new secured arrangement with Hartstone's two principal US subsidiaries, Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, to support their working capital requirements. A FFr35m cash advance facility provided by the UK bank group through Hartstone to Cogetex, the group's French hosiery company.

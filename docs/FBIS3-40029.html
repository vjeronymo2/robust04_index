			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F> Fini by "a.lo."in Rome; date not given: "`Exclude Us From  Palazzo Chigi? It is up to The Voters to Decide'" -- first  three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- [League Secretary] Bossi wants to eat up  Forza Italia and restore the League's supremacy, as long as he  still has time. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is being  snobbish. He joined forces with the Bandwagon [League  nickname], but is keen to explain that the only thing he and the  Senator [Bossi nickname] have in common is the purity of their  Lombard origins, which amounts to very little, not to say  practically nothing. A prudent Knight [Berlusconi nickname]  would like to use the National Alliance [AN] as an "external"  prop for a possible government formed jointly with the Bandwagon  -- a fairly close prop, but not too close. Fini, for his part,  is keeping Bossi at a distance, thus cordially returning the  latter's feelings. He defined Bossi as being "unreliable," in  addition to geographically limited.    Is strife not excessive within the liberty-inspired  alignment? Gianfranco Fini, as one of its members, asserted that  the exchange of poisons was "physiological" in nature. Will the  AN actually be excluded from the government in the event of a  victory, as Berlusconi predicts?    The MSI [Italian Social Movement] secretary dodged the  provocation, but his reply was also a warning of a sort: "It is  the voters who are dealing the cards." Voters, not Bossi or  Berlusconi.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Deputy Fini, you are saying that the center  is crumbling to pieces, and that the right is the only "national  and winning" alternative to the left. Would you agree that  there is a bit too much tension among you? What sort of  impression are you giving the voters?    [Fini] Disagreements are typical of electoral campaigns.  There has been a tough exchange of rhetoric between Bossi and  Berlusconi, but not everything is going smoothly for [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto and [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti  either.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the exchange of pleasantries nbetween you  and Bossi also part of the preelection ritual dance?    [Fini] No, the situation is different between us. It is not  just by chance that we decided to run in all the northern  constituencies. Bossi has ignored two problems that we  initially posed to him: national identity and the need for  solidarity within the country. By doing so, he has taken on a  very serious responsibility.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How can such a troubled alliance lead to any  positive results?    [Fini] It is up to the voters to decide. Strong support for  the AN will enable us to uphold the principles we believe in.    [LA REPUBBLICA] [Northern League lower house floor leader]  Roberto Maroni was already complacently commenting on the  Berlusconian scenario whereby you would be propping up the  government from the outside.    [Fini] I am totally indifferent to what Maroni thinks or  says. I see no difficulty. We have not entered into any  agreement with the League.    [LA REPUBBLICA] However, it is Berlusconi who envisages you  outside.    [Fini] There are no issues capable of causing tough  rhetoric.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The Knight, however, seems to be a bit  embarrassed by certain candidates such as Bontempo, known as the  federalist.    [Fini] Berlusconi knows very well that giving birth to an  electoral alliance means joining forces. I believe that  Berlusconi's possible comments or reservations simply stem from  the current competitive mood. The proportional voting system  automatically pushes parties to safeguard their own identity in  relation to their allies.    [LA REPUBBLICA] When push comes to shove, will you be inside  or outside the government?    [Fini] I do not think anyone can now afford to rush ahead of  events.</p>

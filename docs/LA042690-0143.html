			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DECISION ON SCHOOL AT AMBASSADOR SITE  DELAYED  </P> <P> The State Allocation Board has delayed its decision on whether to give the Los  Angeles Unified School District the money it needs to build a high school on  the site of the Ambassador Hotel.  </P> <P> The board, which allocates school building funds, met Wednesday in Sacramento,  but postponed its decision for 30 days because two members were absent.  </P> <P> The school district is asking for $120 million to buy the 24-acre Mid-Wilshire  site, demolish the hotel and build a 2,500-student school. But the land is  owned by developer Donald Trump, who has his own plan to put the world's  tallest skyscraper there.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's hearing, several Mid-Wilshire area business owners and residents  spoke against the school district's proposal, saying it would hurt economic  development. But a group of parents and teachers pleaded with the state board  to fund the school, which would provide classrooms for some of the 4,000  children who must now be bused out of the neighborhood because of overcrowding.  </P></p>

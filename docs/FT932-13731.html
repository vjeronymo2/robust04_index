			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: ICI chairman defends job units A COMMONS committee yesterday suggested that shareholders of Imperial Chemicals Industries (ICI) might force the group to disband units that help redundant staff find new jobs if they were more aware of their activities and associated costs. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, told the employment committee that the company - which employs 50,000 people today compared with 140,000 in 1970 - had redeployment units on its sites. These helped employees being made redundant find alternative employment, both inside the group and externally. The units are successful - at ICI Agro-Chemicals 80 per cent of the division's staff affected by redundancies over the past two years have had new jobs within six months. Sir Denys agreed with the committee that the Employment Service did a similar job - but he said that it came in at a later time when the individual was jobless. Labour MP Mr Ernie Ross said he would like his committee to recommend more in-house units like those at ICI. But he was worried that if the job units were given such prominence in a government report 'greedy' ICI shareholders might call for their abolition. Sir Denys said the sums spent on the units were 'relatively modest' and that he had no such fears.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Smith New Court down 35% but shares up sharply Difficult conditions in the financial markets sent pre-tax profits at Smith New Court, the equities market maker and broker, down 35 per cent from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 20.2m for the six months to October 28. However, Smith shares, which fell initially on the news, rallied sharply following the announcement of merger talks between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley, amid speculation that it could become similarly involved. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, refused to comment on Smith's intentions in this direction. But he predicted that there would be further consolidation in the securities industry. 'We are beginning to see the second big fall-out from Big Bang. As we move towards globalisation of world markets, further mergers and acquisitions are inevitable,' he said. Smith shares ended the day 23p ahead at 396p. The first-half results were undermined by significantly lower trading volumes in the group's south-east Asian markets, with some down 70 per cent year on year. These were compounded by levels in the London market down by 20 per cent. Smith blamed lower institutional demand for the decline, which in turn was a consequence of investor concern over volatility and rising world interest rates. Mr Marks described the group's overall performance as 'satisfactory', with all areas of business staying in profit. He added that while the group was seeking to identify areas in which to save costs, large-scale staff cuts were not under consideration: 'Our customers expect a high level of consistency from our service and we have to maintain that.' Return on capital was 17.5 per cent compared with 36.6 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 44.4p to 19.3p and from 25p to 14.4p on a fully-diluted basis. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p. The lower level of trading activity was also reflected in a lull in Smith's overseas expansion with no new offices opening. But the company confirmed it was seeking to become a full member of the Tokyo stock exchange when a seat becomes available.</p>

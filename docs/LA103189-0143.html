			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> FOOD FIRMS ACCUSED OF LYING  </P> <P> The chairman of a House panel investigating cereal makers' health claims said  today that pressure from the Office of Management and Budget on federal  regulators has allowed food manufacturers to lie about the benefits of eating  their products.  </P> <P> Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) said the Food and Drug Administration proposed in 1987  that explicit disease-prevention claims be allowed on food labels.  </P> <P> Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human  resources and intergovernmental relations, said that under OMB pressure the FDA  bypassed the normal regulatory rules and allowed companies to begin making the  health claims immediately.  </P> <P> The FDA said recently it had serious concerns about cereals that contain husks  of psyllium, which contains soluble fiber. Manufacturers say the grain is safe  and can help lower cholesterol.  </P></p>

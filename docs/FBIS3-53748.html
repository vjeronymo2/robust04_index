However, it is clear that the United  States will bless the agreement among the parties concerned, but  it will not be a third party in the dialogue. What it is  directly interested in is ending terrorist actions in Lebanon,  and from within."    He added: "The Lebanese -- people and officials inside and  outside -- know that terrorist actions are Syria's  responsibility, but by different names. From what was said  about the discussion of the issue of the Kurdish Workers' Party  [PKK], Hizballah, and the [Ahmad] Jibril group [Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command] it can be  concluded that Syria was requested not to tackle the unstable  situation in Lebanon, but to stop it, on the grounds that Syria  is acting like a fireman who starts a fire so as to extinguish  it."    He went on: "Establishing peace in the region will have a  positive effect on Lebanon, because this peace means that no one  should play someone else's role. Every state should play its  role within its own borders, not outside them. We will continue  to achieve our aims as regards full sovereignty and good  relations with our neighbors. Our rights in our homeland are  fixed and are not wishes or demands."    In conclusion, he said: "As for the agents, they have been  impudent, to the extent that they accuse anyone who talks about  sovereignty and independence of extremism. They are not ashamed  of their baseness in dealing with the occupiers."</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Personal pension sales face tougher guidelines Tough guidelines designed to stop personal pensions salesmen evading their responsibility to give proper advice to clients are to be published shortly. The guidelines are part of a wider effort to restore public confidence in the selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes. Research published last year suggested many people transferring were poorly advised. A report published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, will impose stricter rules on sales agents. The rules should make it less likely that sales agents will say that they were simply following a client's wishes or that their advice was overruled. These are explanations sometimes offered by sales agents for cases where clients have acted against what seemed to be their best financial interests. The SIB set out to tighten regulations covering pensions transfers after a pilot study published last December provoked widespread public concern that a significant proportion of the more than 500,000 people who have transferred into personal pensions since 1988 may have been poorly advised. Having set new standards for future pensions sales, the SIB is working on how to compensate investors who will be worse off as a result of poor advice. It is to publish guidance on compensation by August. The report yesterday proposes that customers should have a 'cooling off' period of at least 14 days to decide whether to go ahead with a transfer. It should be compulsory for firms to use a computerised system to check the value of a lump sum which a client would take out from an occupational scheme. As a way of ensuring tighter control over what the sales agent or adviser says to the customer, the report says that every transaction must be accompanied by a 'reason why' letter, explaining the advice given to the customer. The letter would go to the investor and would also have to be filed by the sales agent. The requirement for the letter, the new guidelines and the compulsory use of computers to analyse the value of lump sums, will come into effect from July 1. Among the longer-term moves recommended by the report is the requirement for regulators to treat pension transfer business as a special category of business. This would enable regulators to look at whether a firm was suited to carrying out that specific activity and to discourage any that were merely dabbling. Pension alarm, Page 8</p>

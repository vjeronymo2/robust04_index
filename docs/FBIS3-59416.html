			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Filkus, deputy chairman of Alliance </F> of Democrats, by Ivo Grycz; place and date not given: "Through  the Spectacles of the Economy"]    [Text] Parties change, but professors and their ideas  remain. This is possibly connected with the fact that  politicians know sufficiently well how to make use of the ideas  of the professors. The Alliance of Democrats has elected Prof.  Rudolf Filkus as its deputy chairman, and his ideas have also  found their application in the economic program of this party.  We took an interest in the political views of Mr. Filkus after  his finding a home in a liberal organization, and we received  the economist's answers to our questions.    [Grycz] At one time the SDSS [Social Democratic Party of  Slovakia] offered you the position of chairman. You decided in  favor of the Alliance. Why?    [Filkus] First of all, no one offered me a position in the  SDSS. But the essence of the matter is that I perceive the  transformation process in social terms even now, when I speak of  liberal steps toward a market mechanism. I understand this  process as being without direction by the state while  maintaining continuity with the steps we have already taken.  This does not mean that I do not perceive the social barriers  that could be formed by some liberal measures or that would  prevent the transformation of the economy. And this is connected  with social democracy.    [Grycz] So you see the Alliance as a moving force for the  transformation of the economy?    [Filkus] Yes, because we will get to a market economy most  rapidly by steps of a liberal nature, with the exclusion of  direction by the state. In my concept, this is not connected  with centralized macroeconomic actions. The economic center is,  for example, the National Bank, which must see to currency  stability, and the center must take care as well of the  infrastructure and take action especially under conditions when  the market is still not fully functioning. But it cannot be  allowed to act on prices or regulate wages, production, or its  composition.    [Grycz] The population has been offered declarations of  liberalism in the programs of the movements and parties since  November. Unfortunately, in its practical political and economic  form, the people perceive it more as a negative, which the  forces oriented against the liberals are naturally exploiting.  Does the Alliance have a chance after its previous failures in  the application of liberalism in Slovak conditions to acquire an  adequate voter base for its program?    [Filkus] The liberal process was discredited especially by  insufficient social sensitivity. The social explosions that can  take place represent insurmountable obstacles, which prevent any  kind of movement forward. In addition to this, I reckon with the  fact that the macroeconomic restrictive policies of a budgetary  and currency nature have already brought about their sacrifices,  and we are now further along. We know more, we know that it  works, but, on the other hand, it is necessary to clean up this  entire process of transformation. It is not possible to let the  process of privatization, which is an economic tool for changing  the composition of ownership, become a tool of political power.  This has happened and we cannot accept it.    [Grycz] But don't these tendances move the voters' opinions  rather to the left?    [Filkus] That depends on the makeup of the voters. When I  put  in the program revitalization of the economy through foreign  capital, acceleration of privatization, assistance to small and  medium-sized businesses, I am addressing a specific group of  voters. I meet with them in the okreses and I know that they are  the tradesmen, the bankers, the intelligentsia, and the small  and medium-sized businessmen. That is, we deal with the  countervailing, most affected strata of the populace.    [Grycz] Alliance means doing things together. With which  personalities and groupings to the right and to the left of the  center do you mean to cooperate?    [Filkus] We look at this in economic terms. We will join  those who agree with us that it is necessary to continue with  the liberalization of the marketplace. We will also join those  who are against the state directing the economy but who do not  exclude some economic initiative by the center. And we also  accept those who do not overlook the social aspects of the  transformation process. Whoever is against misusing the process  of privatization for the sake of acquiring political  power--well, we will join them. I think the type of our  potential allies should now be clear to you.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / High-powered decisions ahead: After the death of two drivers, the sport of grand prix motor racing faces difficult choices The world of grand prix motor racing, still mourning the death at the weekend of three-times world champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger, yesterday began the process of analysing the causes of the fatalities at the San Marino Grand Prix - and their implications for the sport's future. A formal investigation is being launched by the Paris-based world governing body of motor sport, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile. Before the lights turn green at the Monaco Grand Prix on May 15, the drivers will have held their own meeting to discuss whether additional steps should be taken to improve safety. Ironically that meeting was initiated by Senna himself. In part it was a consequence of his concern that changes made this year to the rules governing grand prix cars, in particular a ban on 'active' (computer controlled) suspension, traction control (to prevent wheel spin under acceleration), and other driver aids, were making the cars more difficult to control. Senna lived for the satisfaction racing at the limit gave him. He brought to grand prix not just natural driving talent but a self-discipline and analytical rigour. Nevertheless, in spite of his renowned aggression on the track, no one was more aware of motor racing's risks than the 34-year-old Brazilian: 'I know you are always in danger of dying . . . and it can really get to you. If you're not careful you can see how fragile you are; that you can be gone in just a fraction of a second,' he said recently. His death raises questions not just about the safety record of grand prix racing and measures that might be taken to improve it but also the extent to which it should regard itself as a entertainment spectacle, necessarily involving risk. The FIA's president, Mr Max Mosley, yesterday defended this year's rule changes of which Senna was critical. The FIA introduced them, Mr Mosley says, as a means of restoring a greater role for the driver. Had the trend to greater electronic control of the cars gone unchecked, maintains Mr Mosley, 'we would fairly quickly eliminate the driver. One skill after another would go until, in the end, almost anybody would be able to drive the car. It's all technically fascinating and very relevant to road cars - but we felt it would destroy an essential element of grand prix racing.' He perhaps did not realise it but Mr Mosley was in effect saying that technology has given grand prix, the ability - and the responsibility - to decide what level of risk should be involved. The ramifications of the questions raised extend beyond the grand prix teams to embrace all the participants in what has become a global industry, as well as a sport. With each race watched in more than 100 countries and by about 1bn television viewers, Formula One Grand Prix has become a marketing tool for carmakers and other multinationals ranging from clothing group Benetton to the tobacco industry. Yesterday the Ford motor company, which provides engines for several teams including current championship leader, Benetton-Ford, withdrew a series of newspaper advertisements to celebrate its weekend victory. And Renault, whose engines powered the Williams car in which Senna died, itself called for greater safety measures. Such reactions are understandable, as is that of the German driver Michael Schumacher, whose third win in a row in his Benetton-Ford at the weekend was overshadowed by the tragedies. Schumacher has pledged to lead the Monaco meeting himself in the quest to secure greater safety. The immediate investigations will concentrate on discovering what caused Ratzenberger to leave the track at such high speed - close to 200mph - on Saturday and Senna, 24 hours later, to crash head-on into the concrete wall lining Imola's notorious Tamburello curve at a similar speed. Video and eye-witness evidence indicate that bodywork broke away on Ratzenberger's car, causing it to lose stability. In Senna's case there are few clues, except that on the evening before the race he was reported as worried about his car being 'nervous' on the Imola circuit, one of the world's fastest but criticised by several drivers for being bumpy. The data-logging 'black box' from the wreckage of Senna's car may hold the answers to the crash and will be flown to the UK for examination within the next few days. Another issue of immediate concern is the safety of racing circuits. The Monaco drivers' meeting is expected to concentrate on this issue. More gravel traps to slow the cars before they hit barriers and longer run-off areas might well have reduced the catastrophic consequences of the weekend's crashes. Honeycomb barriers, rather than rigid steel or concrete ones, might also have slowed Senna's and Ratzenberger's deceleration rate enough for them to survive. But there are more fundamental decisions to be made. The FIA could chose to retain the new rules, thus placing the onus on the drivers, not technology, to control the cars. The rules also have the advantage of curbing costs, allowing smaller teams to close the gap on the front-runners, thus making racing more interesting for spectators. But this concept of grand prix racing - as commercial spectacle first, technology race second - has increased the risk to drivers. The number of spins from driver error in grand prix races this year shows how big the impact has been, although there is no evidence that this was a factor in the weekend's crashes. The alternative is for the FIA to relax the restrictions on driver aids. This would give a fresh impetus to the technological side of racing: such is the pace of technology, the cars would not even need drivers within the next five years. Last year leading drivers had merely to press a button when the lights turned to green. It was the on-board computer which operated the accelerator and clutch, changed all the gears and stopped the wheels spinning wastefully until the first corner had been passed. Such driver aids are among those currently banned. One problem, however, as the investigations into the weekend's accidents is likely to show, is that while the cars' carbon-fibre driver 'survival' cells are surviving impacts of great severity, the drivers they contain can simply no longer cope with the impact of the gravitational forces in high-speed collisions, even in the absence of other injury. The blunt question grand prix must ask itself is whether audiences are interested in racing as a risk-free giant Nintendo game, fought by computers with little human input during the races themselves - or whether commercial interests will drift away towards something more adventurous. The advances in circuit design, car technology and materials have in fact made grand prix motor racing safe beyond all reasoned expectation. Until this weekend it had been 12 years since a driver was killed while competing in a grand prix; a decade since one died in testing. That is almost 200 races, each of about 200 miles. When testing and practice undertaken throughout each year is added in, nearly 1m grand prix miles have been covered between fatalities. It is no grounds for complacency. But neither is it necessarily a record to be ashamed of, given this is a sport which has as its essence the human control of half-tonne projectiles travelling at up to 100 yards per second - and in which success is measured by how closely the limit of control can be approached without being exceeded.</p>

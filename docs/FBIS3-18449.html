The Amethyst mini-submarine hit the seabed at low speed  during a training dive on Wednesday and dented a protective dome  for its sonar in the bows, the Navy said.    The Amethyst, at 73.6 metres (225 feet), is one of the  smallest nuclear submarines in the world. It is armed with 14  SM39 missiles or wire-guided torpedoes. It was the second  incident involving a French Navy nuclear submarine in less than  a year. On August 18, the submarine Rubis rammed the tanker  Lyria as it surfaced, gashing its hull and causing an oil slick.  The captain was relieved of his command.</p>

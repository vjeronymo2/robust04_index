			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Ahmadi, director general of the </F> Economic Department in Khorasan Governorate, by unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given: "A New Look at the  Economic Relations Between Herat and Khorasan"]    [Text] The outlook on economic and commercial relations  between Khorasan and Herat Provinces has become quite hopeful  following the exchange of high-level provincial delegations  during the past year. The subsequent meetings that resulted in  the signing of cooperation protocols and, in some cases, of  agreements indicate that these two contiguous provinces have  frequent and close exchanges. It can be stated that economic  and commercial moves have been initiated and are continuing but  that these moves are not as dynamic as had been envisaged.    The reason for this slow pace is the political situation in  Afghanistan, especially in its central government. The  government has not been able to establish a security framework  and is still grappling with acute political problems, which is  why it is paying less attention to economic issues.    On the other hand, the political fervor is not the same all  over Afghanistan. There is more stability in Herat Province  than there is in the capital, which is why economic and  commercial relations with Khorasan are at the present level and  are expected to expand.    To become better acquainted with the current relations  between Herat and Khorasan, our correspondent interviewed  Engineer Ahmadi, the director general of the Economic Affairs  Department of the Khorasan Governorate, and we draw our readers'  attention to the detailed text of this interview:    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Could you please tell us about the  economic protocols [preceding word in English] signed between  the Provinces of Herat and Khorasan and to what extent they have  been implemented? What results have been achieved so far?    [Ahmadi] I should say that the economic protocols were  signed  to activate commercial relations in the private sector and that  the trading companies in these provinces have become active.  This is borne out by the customs statistics, and the exchange  of commodities is continuing. Some of these agreements are  based on offering technical and engineering services, as well as  technological training and research matters, such as  reconstruction of industrial and agricultural installations,  planning, revival of fields, and repair of water sources. Some  work has been done on this matter. A report on this subject has  been submitted to the relevant officials and the necessary  allocations have been made. These plans will be implemented as  soon as the other side expresses its willingness to provide  funds and designate the necessary backing. Of course, some of  the agreements regarding the provision of free development  services, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides for plant diseases and  seed-yielding plants have been implemented.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] What is the situation on the transit of  goods between Herat and Khorasan Provinces?    [Ahmadi] The agreement on the transit of goods between the  two countries expired last year and it took quite a while to  extend it, but this was eventually done with the cooperation of  Khorasan officials. Fortunately, it was approved in the Islamic  Majles and the transit of goods continues between the two  countries. The ingress and egress routes of these goods do not  face any legal problems and traffic is continuing.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] There was mention of the establishment  of joint border markets in the agreements between the provinces  of Herat and Khorasan. Will this happen in the near future?    [Ahmadi] Yes. It was mentioned in the agreements that joint  border markets would be set up on the border in Eslam-qal'eh and  Do Gharun and an agreement was signed on this matter. We have  repeatedly expressed our willingness on the subject but Herat  officials have stated that their final concurrence depends on  approval by Kabul officials, and no results have been announced  so far. However, there is no problem on our side. As soon as  the other side expresses its willingness, we will be ready to  set up the border market. We have set up border stores in Do  Gharun unilaterally, which are very active and sell items  required by returning Afghan refugees at reasonable prices to  expedite the return of the refugees and to cater to their needs.  These stores are relatively prosperous.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Do the economic agreements only  include Herat Province or do they encompass the other parts of  Afghanistan as well?    [Ahmadi] No. The agreements are not exclusively for Herat  Province and Iranian traders are active in other parts of  Afghanistan as well. Some of our transportation companies have  succeeded in setting up offices in Herat and the exchange of  goods with Herat, Heyratan, and Mazar-e Sharif continues.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] In the current conditions prevailing in  Afghanistan, do you think that the necessary security exists  regarding industrial and commercial investment?    [Ahmadi] Of course, the economic officials of the two  countries have announced their readiness to implement some of  the protocols, such as putting the installations in Herat into  operation, or joint investment in industrial and agricultural  projects. We are optimistic that conditions will soon be  conducive to their implementation. Afghanistan is currently in  a transitional state and is moving from one set of circumstances  to another, while the government is seeking to consolidate its  position. It has to compile a new set of regulations and needs  coordination.    For this reason the implementation of new accords is being  pursued with greater caution. As I stated earlier, since we  opened our offices of representation our relations have  flourished and, God willing, this will be a precursor to the  implementation of agreements. It would be more expedient to act  after reviewing the situation and the current circumstances.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] How far has the repair and renovation  of highways progressed?    [Ahmadi] According to the latest reports from the  governorate's technical office, the road has been paved and is  ready for asphalting. [preceding word in English] A segment of  it had been scheduled for asphalting but it was postponed,  probably because of the onset of cold weather and the need for a  survey by the contractors.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] It has been decided that Khorasan  Province would hold an industrial and trade exhibition in Herat  Province. Could you elaborate on that?    [Ahmadi] Regarding the forging of economic relations with  neighboring countries, we consider the convening of trade and  industrial exhibitions as the first step toward progress in this  path, whether it is for the sale of goods or for the exchange of  expertise.    It was for this purpose that Khorasan Province announced its  readiness to set up an exhibition in Herat Province a year ago.  As soon as the go-ahead is given, and the other side is ready,  we will immediately hold the exhibition.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Have any measures been taken on banking  relations?    [Ahmadi] Some officials visited Herat to discuss the  establishment of a branch of Saderat Bank and talks were held on  the subject. We still await the other side's concurrence and we  hope that a branch of the bank will be set up in Herat.    [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Thank you very much.</p>

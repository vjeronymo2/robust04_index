			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in  Burmese at 1330 GMT on 31 March carries a 50-minute report on  the 31 March National Convention Plenary Session to draw up the  basic principles for drafting the new state constitution, held  in the Central Meeting Hall of the President's Residence  compound on Ahlone Road, Rangoon. The report includes recorded  extracts of proposal papers read by 11 delegates from the group  representing elected representatives -- six from political  parties and five independents.    The proposal paper belonging to the elected representatives  of the National League for Democracy [NLD] is read by four NLD  representatives. Dr. Thein Lwin reads first. Addressing the  chapter heading on the state, he quotes the Western definition  of a state. He says: "Myanmar [Burma], a nation composed of  national races, shall be established according to democratic  practice under a federal system." He proposes the nation be  called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.    U Tun Aung, alias U Tun Tun Hein, elected representative  from  Shan State's Nawnghkio constituency, continues reading the NLD  report. He quotes a Western constitutional expert and a  political scientist on the essence of a country's constitution  and democracy. He says: "In prescribing self-administered  zones, special care must be taken not to divide the country into  many segments, so that a Yugoslavia-type situation does not  arise in the country. Therefore, it will be necessary for  national races from regions concerned and the entire people to  have identical outlooks and desires."    Next, U Saw Oo Rei, elected representative from Kayah  State's  Phru-so constituency, continues reading the NLD report.  Addressing the issue of state structure, he says: "The  democratic and correct method is for the ruled to elect their  rulers freely and fairly." He then quotes a political scientist  on the need for national races to coexist peacefully. Quoting a  philosopher, he says everyone likes to participate in the  process of determining their destiny, and people are  increasingly less willing to follow orders dictated by others.  He says ethnic races that have been fighting each other for  many years are now holding talks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that  Israel and the Palestinians have likewise reached an agreement.  He also cites similar events in Mozambique, Angola, South  Africa, and Mexico. He then cites remarks by British and  Singapore leaders on the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian  peace accord. He notes that in Burma, the government and the  armed organizations are also holding talks to find a solution  for the country. He says: "There are good prospects for  internal peace. It is normal practice among nations to hold  talks to solve internal and external problems."    Continuing, U Saw Oo Rei says: "The basic foundation of  democracy is self-help and self-determination. In other words,  it is the appointment of a people's government elected by the  people for themselves." He then refers to a quotation by  President Suharto calling for management of development by the  people themselves. Quoting political philosophers, he explains  that "the declaration of one's intention to practice democracy  tomorrow without practicing it today is meaningless" and that  "the wishes of the voters constitute political sovereignty."    Next, U Hla Min, elected representative of Tenasserim  Division's Kawthaung constituency, continues reading the NLD  report. Addressing the chapter heading on the president as head  of state, he says one vice president is enough and that the  president should be elected by representatives duly chosen by  the people and should be made responsible to the Union  Parliament. He says it is the NLD's view that "the people of  Myanmar have never experienced the presidential system of  government. It is a very new system. The people -- who have  only experienced the parliamentary democracy system -- are well  aware of this system's good and bad lessons. It will be  beneficial for the country to take the good lesson and reject  the bad lesson."    Continuing, U Hla Min says the presidential system of  government should ensure it has a good beginning and should take  into consideration the country's political stability, economic  development, and progress in education and technology. He also  points out the need for national unity, internal peace, the  prevalence of law and order, economic stability, and a  disciplined and responsible populace. He says it is especially  necessary to promote democracy and the Lokapala [universal]  principles of justice, liberty, and equality. He says it is  also important to ensure that the three sovereign powers that  stem from the people are delegated to the people's  representatives.    The session recesses at 1120.    When the plenary session resumes at 1220, U Sai Hsaung Hsi,  alias Nelson, and U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, read the proposal  paper of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy [SNLD].    U Sai Hsaung Hsi, representative from Shan State's Kyaukme  constituency, reads first. Referring to the principles  contained in Article Five on prescribing "self-administered  areas to national races other than those national races who have  been granted the status of state or region" if they meet  population and territorial requirements, he voices his  difference of opinion. He says: "Shan State has always existed  as a state, and it did not achieve statehood through a grant.  Shan State joined the Union under the Panglong Treaty."    He says it is the SNLD's view that even national races who  already have state status "should be able to claim the status of  autonomous region with administrative autonomy, or national area  with cultural autonomy" if they meet population and territorial  requirements. For instance, he says, the Bamah [Burman] do not  have a region or state despite their status as a major race.  Under the present rules, Bamah nationals can claim  self-administered areas. He says the constitution must be clear  and its provisions must not be contradictory. He says,  therefore, the constitution should not include the phrase "other  than national races who have been granted state status."    Next, U Sai Hpa, alias U Hla Pe, elected representative from  Shan State's Kyaukme constituency, reads the second part of the  report. Referring to self-administered zones, he says the  criteria for granting self-administered status should be uniform  and that the phrase "other than national races who have been  granted state status" should not be included in the constitution.    He then cites the existence of Karen communities living  outside Karen State and Mon communities living outside Mon  State. He proposes a "Tai Lian State or self-administered zone  for Tai Lian nationals living in upper Sagaing Division and  lower Kachin State." He concludes the report by reiterating the  SNLD's proposals.    Next, U Hla Maung, an independent from Karen State's Kya-in  Seikkyi-1 constituency, reads his report. Bureau records show  he was elected as a representative of the deregistered Patriotic  Old Comrades League. He proposes that the state be organized as  a union with the existing seven divisions and seven states,  which will all be called states. He proposes that the 14  states, with equal status, retain their original names.    On the issue of the head of state, he says the president  should be the head of state and should be elected through an  electoral college. He proposes constitutional restrictions on  the government to prevent autocracy and the revival of absolute  monarchy. He proposes that Parliament, where national  sovereignty lies, be elected by the people. He proposes the  electoral college, which elects the president and vice  president, be formed of representatives of the two chambers of  Parliament.    The plenary session recesses at 1400 after U Khin Maung Cho,  an independent from Kayah State's Dimohso constituency-1, reads  his report. Bureau records show he was elected as a  representative of the deregistered Kayah State Nationalities  League for Democracy. No extracts of his report are given.    U Tun Hlaing, an independent from Rangoon Division's Bahan  constituency-1, reads his report when the plenary session  resumes at 1500. Bureau records show he was elected as a  representative of the deregistered Democracy Party. He explains  the differences between the definition of the state and the  government, saying: "The state is a permanent entity while the  government is a temporary institution that changes from time to  time." He explains: "State power belongs to the citizens, who  are the real owners of state power." He says that because  citizens enjoy the benefits of the state, they should serve the  interests of the state and should not oppose or betray it. He  defines government as "an entity that accepts the power  entrusted to it by the citizens and administers for the  development of the state. Citizens may or may not like the  government's policy. Citizens have the right to openly speak,  write, and protest about what they like and dislike according to  democratic practices. A government that is not in accordance  with the wishes of the majority of citizens cannot have a  genuine mandate. Only if these basic principles are clear can  the basic principles be laid down in the constitution."    He says the following basic principles should be enshrined  in  the constitution: "Myanmar is a sovereign independent state;  the sovereign power of the state lies with the citizens; all  powers stem from the citizens; and citizens shall enjoy social  justice, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of  belief, freedom of worship, freedom to earn a livelihood,  freedom of organization, freedom of action, and equality before  the law, without discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or  class."    He says he has previously proposed that the "prime minister  is the best head of state for the country; I do not believe a  president with full executive powers is best and I do not like  the election of a president through an electoral college. If  the majority supports a president with full executive powers,  though, I will have to abide by their decision according to  democratic practice."    Continuing, U Tun Hlaing explains that he considers it  appropriate, as proposed by the work committee chairman, to have  two groups of members from the two chambers of Parliament elect  the president. He explains it is appropriate to have the  participation of national races and elected representatives in  national construction tasks, and perhaps members of the Defense  Forces, depending on the circumstances, although it should not  be stated in the constitution that members of the Defense Forces  will participate. He says: "I believe it will be appropriate  for the two chambers of Parliament to elect the president  without the participation of representatives of the Defense  Services." He says that in addition to the qualifications  stipulated for members of parliament, a provision should be  added requiring the president to have a university degree. He  explains that because the head of state will have to interact  with other countries, the head of state should be well versed in  international law and politics. The head of state must also be  well respected by the general public. He believes these  qualifications will best serve the interests of the nation and  its citizens.    Next, U Tun Kyaw, an independent from Shan State's Namhsan  constituency, presents his report. Bureau records show he was  elected as a representative of the Ta-ang Palaung National  League for Democracy. He proposes that the chapter on the state  should say: "The Republic of Myanmar is a nation where national  races live collectively."    Addressing the state structure, he recalls how the Ta-ang  Palaung took up arms after their demands for self-determination  were ignored before and after independence. He says: "During  the current period of the State Law and Order Restoration  Council, the Ta-ang Palaung have given up the armed struggle"  and have worked on local development schemes. He says the  Ta-ang Palaung national leaders and people welcome the National  Convention and the peace agreements with nine other national  races.    Continuing, U Tun Kyaw calls on the national races who have  obtained the status of regions and states as well as those who  have not obtained this status to cooperate with magnanimity in  prescribing self-administered areas. He then proposes that a  Ta-ang self-administered division be granted. The territory  should be based on Namhsan in northern Shan State with Namtu in  the east; Kutkai and Namhkam in the north; western Hsipaw and  Kyaukme in the south; and parts of Momeik and Mogok in Mandalay  Division in the west. He also proposes that Kyaukme and part of  (Mong Gaw), Namtu, and (Man Tong) be upgraded as townships and  formed into two districts and prescribed as a Ta-ang  self-administered division.    He then discusses the appointment of the president and vice  presidents, saying: "In accordance with the three Lawkapala  principles -- liberty, equality, and justice -- and to allow a  member of the national races to be one of the three vice  presidents, a principle should be stipulated that allows for the  appointment of a Shan national -- not a Bamah -- as a candidate  for vice president in the upper chamber, with equal  representatives from the regions and states."    Next, U Aung Thein, an independent representative from Shan  State's Ywangan constituent, reads his report. Addressing the  state, he proposes that the principles "the Republic of Union of  Myanmar is a genuine democratic state" and "the Republic of  Union of Myanmar is a social state" should be added to the  fundamental principles.    Continuing, he proposes that Kalaw, Pindaya, Ywangan, and  Yatsawk in Southern Shan State and Naungcho in Northern Shan  State be prescribed as a Danu self-administered region. He then  cites a book on Burmese cultures in explaining the areas  inhabited by the Danu national people.    Addressing the head of state, he says: "As our president  will have full authority to exercise administrative power, the  two vice presidents will become figureheads. They will become a  burden to the country." That is why those who are elected by  the three organs responsible for appointing the president and  vice presidents should be called presidential candidates rather  than being directly designated as vice presidents. He says that  whichever of the three presidential candidates gets the largest  number of votes in the Union Parliament should become president  and the one who gets the second largest number of votes should  become vice president. He believes it would be suitable for the  situation in the country. He then says the selection of a  president will be in accordance with democratic principles and  will show honor and respect for the people. He concludes his  proposal paper by reading basic principles on the qualities of  the president.    After the presentations, Alternate Chairman U Tin Maung  explains the work remaining to be carried out. In his  explanation, he notes that since 23 March various delegate  groups have presented 53 proposal papers at the National  Convention Plenary Session. He says the Panel of Chairmen has  to review and analyze all of the proposals in order to give  explanations on every point at the upcoming plenary session.  Therefore, the Panel of Chairmen hopes to hold the next plenary  session on 5 April. In conclusion, he says the Panel of  Chairmen will inform the delegates of the exact date of the next  plenary session before 5 April.    The session concludes at 1650.</p>

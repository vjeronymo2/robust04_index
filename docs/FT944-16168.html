			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho unsettled by Bock rumours Shares in Lonrho, the international trading group, fell 12p to close at 131 1/2 p yesterday after rumours that Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier and Lonrho's joint chief executive, might dispose of some or all of his 18.8 per cent shareholding following financial difficulties at his Advanta property group. Mr Bock strongly denied the rumours. One of his advisers said that Mr Bock's private holding company was in good shape. He pointed out that it made an after-tax profit of DM88.6m (Pounds 36.3m) in 1993 and was on course for a similar result in the current year. The rumours were apparently sparked when a leading London stockbroker received an order to sell 500,000 Lonrho shares from an unnamed client. There had been speculation that Deutsche Bank was concerned about loans to Advanta, but Deutsche put out a statement saying it had no credit links with the comp-any. Mr Bock is battling for control of Lonrho with Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive who has dominated the group for 30 years.</p>

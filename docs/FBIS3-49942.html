After  the talks both premiers expressed their countries' willingness  to cooperate, particularly in concrete economic projects.    Pawlak said that, in addition to the Partnership For Peace  Initiative, partnership for economic development was significant  at present. He said that frequent contacts between the two  countries' premiers should be followed up by meetings between  the two countries' ministers and businessmen.    Together with Polish President Lech Walesa and Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski, Pawlak is in Prague attending talks  between leaders of the Visegrad Group countries (the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) and a U.S. delegation  led by President Bill Clinton.</p>

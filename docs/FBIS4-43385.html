			<p>BFN     [Text] A big bang in the Socialist Party: Michel Rocard is  prepared to put everything on the line -- his post as Socialist  Party first secretary, and even his candidacy in the  presidential elections. It should be said that since the  Socialist Party's European election flop, criticism has been  raining down on him from all directions. Marie-Eve Malouine  reports from Rue Solferino, where a meeting of the Socialist  Party bureau is taking place:    [Malouine] Michel Rocard is facing up to his  responsibilities. The first secretary considers that he bears  the major responsibility for the 12 June results. The Socialist  leadership asked him to put a question mark over his candidacy  in the presidential elections. He has agreed. It is the  Socialists who will choose their candidate, but the time has not  yet come. Anyone who so wishes can run, but these concessions  made by Michel Rocard do not yet mean he is abdicating.    The very serious failure in the European elections, the  first  secretary said, is an individual and collective failure for the  party. Renewal of the Socialist Party is imperative, and Michel  Rocard announced that he will be the one to oversee it. He is  to make these proposals at the first national council meeting --  very likely on 19 June -- at which he will ask for a vote of  confidence, a way of regaining a certain legitimacy. This is not  the most difficult challenge, however, as Michel Rocard goes for  double or nothing.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT, WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON: DUPREE HANDLING LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson says running back Marcus Dupree seems to be handling his  recent media attention well.  </P> <P> "I think it's an interesting phenomenon," Robinson said.  </P> <P> "He comes in, he hadn't played in five years, and yet there are four TV cameras  following him around every day. He handled that good and seems to be right in  the middle of this team. He's just one of the guys."  </P> <P> In 1991, the Dallas Cowboys, who will play the Rams Sunday in Anaheim, will  have three potential top 10 first-round choices -- their own and picks from the  New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings.  </P> <P> Does Coach Jimmy Johnson find himself cheering against those two teams to  better the Cowboys' selections?  </P> <P> "Of course, any time you have the opportunities to upgrade the talent on your  football team," Johnson said, "that gives you some anxious moments. And I feel  like we'll be able to do that with, I think, nine ones and twos over the next  two years."  </P> <P> The Cowboys have stockpiled five No. 1s and four No. 2s in the next two drafts.

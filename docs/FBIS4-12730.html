			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Rosenfeld] </F>   [Excerpt] In a surprise decision yesterday, Jerusalem  District Court Judge Miryam Na'or imposed prison sentences on  three former senior banking officials convicted in the bank  shares manipulation case.    Although State Prosecutor Moshe Lador had asked for prison  sentences to be commuted to community service, Na'or imposed  prison terms of eight months each on IDB Bankholding chairman  Refa'el Recanati and Mordekhay Einhorn, former chief operations  officer of Bank Le'umi. Eliyahu Kohen, then Discount's deputy  chairman, received a six-month prison sentence.    Only Giyora Gazit, former managing director of Bank  Hapo'alim, received a three-month prison sentence commuted to  community service.    Aharon Me'ir, former managing director of Bank Mizrahi, and  Udi Recanati, who headed Bank Discount's stock market operations  at the time, were not given prison sentences.    Na'or imposed fines of NIS [new Israeli shekels] 600,000  each  on Refa'el Recanati, Einhorn and Me'ir. Gazit and Kohen each  received a NIS 500,000 fine, while Udi Recanati was fined NIS  400,000.    Hayim Buksbaum, the former head of Le'umi financial division  and Dan Bavli, who audited Le'umi's books were each fined NIS  109,000. Mizrahi's accountant, Dov Nave, was fined NIS 90,000.    Banks Hapo'alim, Le'umi, Discount, Mizrahi and IDB  Bankholding were each fined NIS 1 million. Bank Discount has  already set aside the NIS 1m. to pay the fine, according to last  year's balance sheet.    Na'or noted in her 26-page decision that despite all of the  mitigating circumstances that might have justified lighter  sentences, the scope of the fraud and the economic damage it  brought upon the banks, their shareholders and the state is so  large that even after 10 years it is impossible to let the  affair go by.

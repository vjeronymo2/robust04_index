			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Political Notebook: Mr Molyneaux sets his terms He has not slammed the door quite shut. But the operative word in that sentence is 'quite'. Mr James Molyneaux, the 73-year old MP for Lagan Valley and leader of the Ulster Unionists, holds a veto over Mr John Major's efforts to broker a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland. This week he added his voice to those predicting that efforts to secure a constitutional agreement - let alone a voluntary cessation of IRA violence - are probably doomed. When Mr Major talks of the consent of the majority as the precondition for any new agreement he is talking about the Ulster Unionists. In the words of one cabinet minister, Mr Molyneaux's veto is 'absolute'. Mr Major knows well that without the backing of Mr Molyneaux he could never claim that vital 'consent' for any political settlement with Dublin. Nor could he carry with him his own Conservative and Unionist party. For the past several weeks Mr Molyneaux had been watching from the sidelines the intense diplomacy between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. He let the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist party make the running with its depressingly ritualistic condemnations of the threatened Whitehall 'sell-out' of the Protestant majority. But this week Mr Molyneaux moved centre-stage. After the leak last week of draft proposals from the Dublin government for a successor to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement he joined the unionist critics of the Major-Reynolds initiative. Mr Molyneaux is not a politician who speaks in short, sharp, sound-bites. He is disparaging of those who fail to understand the complexities of Northern Ireland. But in a 45-minute interview with the Financial Times yesterday his meaning was clear. Take a few sentences from that interview. He was pressed at the outset on whether Mr Major and Mr Reynolds should break off their search for a new intergovernmental agreement. The response: 'Well, its futile, isn't it?' The voters in the republic would agree to renounce its constitutional claim only in return for 'something which has the same effect as the territorial claim plus the enforcement of the territorial claim'. Mr Molyneaux is careful not to criticise Mr Major directly. But he is scathing about the British government's willingness to allow the Hume-Adams 'peace initiative' to become entangled with political negotiations. The strategy drawn up by Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, was 'a fiendishly clever operation, totally lacking in principle'. The aim was the 'phased integration' of North and South, imposed by British troops over a 14-year period. The media had been tricked into presenting Mr Adams as a man of peace. After 25 years of miserable violence Mr Major is going for the big prize of a global accord acceptable both to the Protestant and Catholic communities in the province and to Dublin. He is determined to explore the possibility that the IRA has tired of violence. But Mr Molyneaux's fundamental point is that the leaked Irish proposals have shown there is no possibility of squaring Dublin's commitment to a united Ireland with the wishes of the majority in the province. The 'three-stranded' approach to a settlement had lost its validity. The notion behind it - that 'nothing could be agreed until everything is agreed' - was 'completely daft'. It was better then to restart talks on devolved government in Ulster. Here Mr Molyneaux's words will cause some surprise. He has always been known, in the jargon of Ulster unionism, as an integrationist - a supporter not of a devolved assembly but of tying the government of the province much more closely to the political process at Westminster. Now he is arguing for the focus to switch to all-party talks on a new power-sharing assembly. Ulster needed 'close-contact' government before it could begin to explore new relationships with the Republic. If Mr Hume was willing to return to the table, then progress could be rapid. That view is shared neither in London nor among the constitutional nationalists in the north. Without a comprehensive settlement it is hard to see the SDLP agreeing terms for an assembly. Mr Major's aides understandably were searching for a positive gloss. Mr Molyneaux had not said the prime minister should break off talks with Mr Reynolds. It was to be expected that the Ulster Unionists would harden their position from time to time to avoid being outflanked by the DUP. As in all negotiations, it was inevitable that all those around the table would not offer public concessions. So as long as Mr Molyneaux leaves the door ajar Mr Major will soldier on. Nothing is lost until everything is lost. True enough perhaps. But hardly encouraging.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / India and Pakistan to resume talks India and Pakistan are to resume talks on bilateral problems, including the status of the contentious Jammu and Kashmir, after a gap of nearly 15 months. Mr JN Dixit and Mr Shahryar Khan, the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan, agreed to meet in Islamabad from January 1-3, under an accord signed by the two countries in 1972 after Pakistan lost to India in a war over Bangladesh. The talks had been postponed for more than a year as relations between the two neighbours reached their worst point in 20 years. India has consistently held that Kashmir is a domestic dispute to be resolved internally, and has accused Pakistan of training and funding Kashmiri militants engaged in armed warfare in the Kashmir valley. Pakistan has denied the allegation and insists on interpreting the so-called Simla Agreement of 1972 in the light of a United Nations resolution of 1948 providing for an internationally supervised plebiscite through which Kashmiris could choose between India and Pakistan. An Indian foreign ministry official said that the recent peaceful resolution of the month-long stand-off between armed Kashmiri separatists and the Indian armed forces at Hazratbal, Kashmir's holiest shrine, and Islamabad's subsequent inability to move a resolution on the human rights issue at the UN general assembly paved the way for talks. Both nations appear to be responding to US pressure to resolve the Kashmir dispute through talks. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, had expressed India's readiness to resume a dialogue in his congratulatory message to Ms Benazir Bhutto, the newly elected Pakistani prime minister. The Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, India's largest opposition party, yesterday demanded that the ruling Congress government should convene a meeting of all Indian political parties before resuming talks with Pakistan. Mr Krishan Lal Sharma, the party spokesman, said Pakistan must be told that India would not tolerate interference in its internal affairs, that Pakistan should stop funding infiltrators fighting a separatist war in the Kashmir valley, and that the issue should not be raised in international forums. Officials on both sides are sceptical that the talks will resolve the Kashmir dispute which has hindered relations between the two countries since partition in 1947, and over which two wars have been fought. But they agree that the resumption of talks is 'a step in the right direction'.</p>

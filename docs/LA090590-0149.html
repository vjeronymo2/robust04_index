			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IBM INTRODUCES NEW LINE OF MAINFRAME COMPUTERS  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp., aiming to tighten its grip on the  mainframe computer market, today introduced the Enterprise System/9000 line,  ranging from intermediate computers for office environments to its most  powerful mainframe systems ever.  </P> <P> The unveiling came one day after Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., the world's No. 2  producer, unveiled a new series of mainframe computers it called the world's  fastest.  </P> <P> But IBM's powerful new line is expected to deliver more than sheer horsepower  to customers who have outgrown its current 3090 J models.  </P> <P> "ES/9000 has the industry's broadest single-family range of performance and  upgrade options," said the company, based in Armonk, N.Y.  </P> <P> The new machines range in price from $70,480 to $22.8 million.  </P> <P> IBM said its new top-end model will be the most powerful computer on the  market; however, this model will not be available until the third quarter of  1991. Many of the lower-level models will be available later this year or early  next year.  </P> <P> Industry analysts had said making available an enhanced 3090 J soon is meant to  keep customers in the IBM fold until the more advanced machines are ready.  </P> <P> "The new generation can be customized," said Rick Martin, who tracks IBM for  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It's a total change in strategy."  </P> <P> Mainframe computers, long used by large customers to store and manipulate  massive amounts of data, have not been made to talk to each other easily. But  IBM's new machines, in addition to providing extra power, are expected to have  the capacity to be linked together, sharing data and programs.  </P> <P> This recognizes a growing consumer demand for connectivity and compatibility,  analysts say. But even with the souped-up mainframes, IBM faces competition as  an increasing number of companies turn to cheaper personal computers linked in  local area networks.  </P> <P> IBM said the ES/9000 processors share advanced architectures, a compatible  family of operating systems and many common functions.  </P> <P> These would enable customers to be able to increase programmer and end-user  productivity significantly, handle more data in less time, improve current  applications and facilitate development of new, high-potential applications for  competitive advantage.  </P></p>

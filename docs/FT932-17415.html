			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Ambulance board dissolved THE London Ambulance Service board was dissolved yesterday after a devastatingly critical report on the failure of the capital's computerised ambulance control system. Under arrangements approved by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, South West Thames regional health authority will oversee the service - contrary to the trend towards devolved management in the National Health Service. Mrs Bottomley said yesterday that previous accountability arrangements had left the ambulance service, board and health authority 'unclear about their respective roles and responsibilities'. Last month's report highlighted a series of management failures in the London Ambulance Service, the biggest in the world, culminating in chaos when the computer system collapsed. It said the board had failed to seek or obtain enough information to exercise its responsibilities and Mrs Bottomley gave the regional health authority a month to produce a better structure. As yesterday's changes were announced, evidence emerged that the service's reputation for unreliability may have begun to cost it contracts in the National Health Service market. It has lost the contract to provide non-emergency hospital transport services in Newham, east London and to Essex Ambulance Service. Other contracts may be at risk. Mr Martin Gorham, London Ambulance Service chief executive, said no purchasing authority considering withdrawing contracts had said explicitly it was because of concerns over the quality of performance, but he accepted that 'an issue in determining contracts must be performance'. South West Thames will set up a committee of the authority to oversee the ambulance service. It will also establish an advisory group of specialists in information technology, accident and emergency medicine, industrial relations, finance and marketing. The authority plans other mechanisms to increase scrutiny and 'provide safety valves in case of any failure in line management'. These will include an annual report concentrating on performance; performance reports to MPs, community health councils and local authorities, and regular meetings between senior managers and full-time union officers.</p>

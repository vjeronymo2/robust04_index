			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Users to have say on water charges CUSTOMERS are to have a big role in deciding water charges, according to Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, in a letter sent yesterday to all water companies. Mr Byatt, the industry's economic regulator, said in July that he would conduct a review of all companies' charging limits in 1994 to take effect from April 1 1995. It will set the charging pattern for the following five years.</p>

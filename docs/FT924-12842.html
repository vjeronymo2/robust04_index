			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Monday Interview: Conjuror in the cabinet - John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, speaks to Richard Tomkins Britain's transport secretaries rarely stick around for long. You only have to look at the record: eight have already gone since the Conservatives took office in 1979, moving on to higher office, oblivion or the House of Lords. Even so, a more-than-usually noticeable air of impermanence surrounds the ninth incumbent, John MacGregor. After barely six months at the Department of Transport, this one-time conjuror, banker and chief secretary to the Treasury has suddenly, and however improbably, emerged as the current favourite for the chancellor's job should the beleaguered Norman Lamont go. Of course, Mr MacGregor is not so lacking in tact as to say he actually wants to be chancellor. Mr Lamont is doing very well indeed in the post, he says, and he himself has quite enough to be getting on with at the transport department even to think about moving just yet. His words, however, have a hollow ring to them. A rather stronger impression is that Mr MacGregor is dying to get his hands on the job. During the course of an hour-long interview, he emphasises his deeply-rooted interest in economics and enthusiastically sets out his stall on Europe. Somehow, Transport just doesn't seem to arouse the same fervour. So who is this would-be chancellor? One of the less charismatic figures in the cabinet, Mr MacGregor, 55, suffers from a low public profile. His reputation, too, is that of a consolidator rather than an innovator  - witness his slowing down the pace of educational reform when education secretary. On the other hand, he is bright, tough, modest and well-liked, his pragmatism can be seen as a virtue, and he is one of the Cabinet's most experienced politicians. A doctor's son, Mr MacGregor was born in Glasgow and brought up in Shotts, a Lanarkshire mining village. He was later schooled in Edinburgh, then went to St Andrews University with the intention of becoming a Scottish advocate. They were hard times: in his university days, he recalls, he only scraped by thanks to scholarships, his father, and his income from conjuring. Conjuring? 'Yes. I can't remember how it started, but the very first public performance I gave was aged 11 in the miners' welfare hall in Shotts. Then I did quite a lot at school, and very particularly at university, where I had the professional name of Del Genie.' His speciality was, and remains, mind-reading. Even today Mr MacGregor is a member of the Magic Circle, though his ministerial duties leave him little time to practise his craft. But he has lost none of his old skills. Challenged to give an impromptu performance, he fixes his interviewer with a penetrating gaze and says: 'I think you are probably thinking this is a very strange way to conduct an interview about British Rail.' Incredibly, he is correct. Conjuring apart, Mr MacGregor's university days were notable for stimulating his interest in politics and economics. Quite by chance, he says, he took up political economy as a secondary subject to law, and became hooked. He joined the students' Conservative association and later became chairman of the Federation of University Conservative Unionist Associations. That marked him out for politics. Completing his law degree at King's College, London, he became special adviser to the then prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home, in 1963. Then, with the Conservatives in opposition, he headed the private office of party leader Edward Heath. MacGregor has held five cabinet posts since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. The reason for the speculation over his next job is that, in a party riven by dissent, he looks less divisive on the critical issues of the economy and Europe than his cabinet rivals. Where, then, does Mr MacGregor see himself on the political spectrum? His two biggest preoccupations, he says, since his university days, have been Europe and the economy. On Europe, he proclaims himself a passionate supporter of Britain's membership of the European Community. This partly reflects his belief in the Community's original role as a means of securing peace; but beyond that, he says, Britain's population of 55m is simply not a large enough market to allow the country's industry and commerce to thrive. At the same time, however, Mr MacGregor makes the necessary nod to the Euro-sceptics. 'I feel equally strongly nowadays that the EC has too often got too far involved in areas which have nothing to do with the development of the Community, and therefore I have been one of the strongest advocates of subsidiarity all the way through.' He regrets Britain's withdrawal from the ERM and believes the country should rejoin when the conditions are right - though that, he says, is unlikely to be soon. But he is cautious over economic and monetary union. The conditions for entry must be acceptable, he says, 'and I have considerable doubts as to whether we will see Emu as a practical matter this decade, because those conditions are just not going to apply.' On economic matters generally, he says he supports 'everything we did' during the Thatcher years. If that sits oddly with his former position as Mr Heath's adviser, he says the reason is that Mr Heath had broadly the same policies as those that came to be known as Thatcherism till he shifted ground in 1972. 'I am a very strong believer in low direct taxation and encouraging people with incentives - particularly to save, because I am very pro wider ownership. I am also very strongly in favour of privatising, very strongly for private enterprise, very strongly for letting the markets work, very strongly for small businesses. I think a lot of this comes from my Scottish Presbyterian background. I have always been very strongly in favour of giving people the opportunity to be independent.' Quizzed on his political ambitions, he re-emphasises his strong interest in economic policy, then reminisces about the years he spent on the opposition finance team with the likes of Nigel Lawson, Cecil Parkinson, Norman Lamont and Nicholas Ridley. It is almost as though he is trying to say something; but suddenly, he says his one regret is that he would have liked to have stayed longer as education secretary. As it was, he was unable to see his policies to fruition. 'I don't want that to happen in transport - I have only been here for a very short time and there are a lot of exciting things going on.' Ah yes, transport. We have just turned to the subject when Mr MacGregor cuts in. He has forgotten to mention the 11 years he spent at Hill Samuel, the merchant bank - latterly as a director. 'I found that immensely interesting, and that experience of business has lived with me in politics all the way through, and I do actually think it's been very significant to me in my career.' Firmly back on transport, Mr MacGregor's views seem to be best summed up in three words: roads, roads, roads. Ever the pragmatist, Mr MacGregor acknowledges that it would be nice to see more traffic switch from road to rail, but says it is just not practical. Some 90 per cent of all traffic goes by road, and as long as people keep buying more cars and using them, they are going to need more road space. 'I do wish to do what one can for public transport, and we have done quite a lot, but there is no doubt that we have a need for improved roads. And the demand for by-passes is very large. I sometimes think that the more extreme environmental lobbies don't recognise just how strong the pressure is from the public for by-passes. I have seen the benefits of by-passes in my own constituency - they are quite enormous.' Road users may not have things all their own way. Mr MacGregor accepts that the day may come when charging for road use may become necessary to ease congestion in urban areas. But that is a long way off: and everything else he has said tends to confirm the suspicion that, faced with the need for cuts in the current public spending round, he would not resist the axeing of London's Jubilee Line extension if the result were to leave his roads programme intact. If only he were chancellor, the decision would be up to him. PERSONAL FILE 1937 Born 14 February.

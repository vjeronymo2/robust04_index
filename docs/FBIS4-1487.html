			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IFP spokesperson Ziba Jiyane and </F> unidentified party official; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Jiyane] Many of the problems experienced yesterday  are continuing today, in fact, even worse problems have been  reported by our informants on the ground in the whole process of  elections. Now, the most disturbing thing about this is that in  many areas we continue to have ballots without IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] stickers being used in the vote, and we  understand that there is now tremendous pressure being put by  some political parties to cause the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] to accept these as valid, and we have said from the  beginning if anything could really threaten this whole election  process it would exactly be that -- to count ballots without IFP  stickers.    Now, nonapplication of IFP stickers in many areas has  happened even today in areas like Chatsworth, Mtubatuba,  Newlands West, Glenhills School, Zilungisele School, Nomhlebe  Preschool, plus more than 17 others. Voting continued in all of  them without IFP stickers and of course late opening of the  stations continued to be a problem today, and shortages of  supplies was a problem today, now polling stations on the IEC  list which have not yet been opened at all, are such as the  eight stations around Vryheid. We were told that these will be  remedied by Judge Kriegler yesterday, and we have seen the  situation deteriorating today.    But you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are more troubled by  the fact that of the more than 20 million missing ballot papers  we have now more and more evidence that certain political  parties have possession of this. We have heard reports from  KwaMashu that people were given ballot papers with IEC stickers  at the back, which were already marked ANC. Now this happened  in an area called (Amatikwe). Voters were given two or three  ballot papers for national and provincial lists. Now, we also  have here in our possession something signed by police which has  been distributed all over the country, of evidence of many  ballots that were distributed, around which have the clear  marking of the ANC votes. These have been distributed and the  police have alerted us here and all over the country. These  were used in PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging].    Now, we just received also a message here as you saw me  entering, reading it from Gerrie Beetge, who is an informant who  will...[pauses] from an informant will not reveal his or her  name, told Gerrie Beetge, that last night at the Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center] stadium -- counting 34 polling  station ballots in Soweto, Johannesburg, people opened boxes and  removed the IFP sticker and replaced it with others. Today  there are no IEC officials at the stadium and the IFP banners,  etcetera, have been ripped off. Now this happened at Nasrec  stadium -- now, in 34 polling stations in that area. We have  evidence that the missing ballots are in the hands of certain  political parties, because where else would they get he ballots  with IFP stamped at the back and giving these to people on the  queue, who in a station near Ntuzuma were not even inked,  because the presiding officer allowed this despite protestations  from our party agents.    I was first pleased to hear that Judge Kriegler has  indicated  that he has raised the issue of extending the election time to  tomorrow because if that did not happen that would be a serious  infringement of thousands of people's right to vote. It would  effectively disenfranchise thousands of voters, in particular,  in northern Zululand -- in northern Natal. Now I don't know if  my colleague here will add other...Lastly, I would like you to  also be informed of this because the real problem, the main  problem today is the evidence that is coming in that the missing  ballots are actually in the hands of certain parties, and so far  the only evidence we have is that the ANC -- because including  this ballot paper which the police has been warning us about,  has possession of many ballot papers.    Now, there is a case, a serious case here also, with an  affidavit in front of me here, which is still being investigated  by the police, of what happened yesterday at 7 PM, Ntuzuma  court, where people had to guard the ballot boxes. An Isuzu was  seen full of ballot boxes, and its registration number was  NU136960. It looked suspicious to the people there, and the cap  of the Isuzu was white and the back was black. People were  afraid and they approached this vehicle because there were too  man people in the area and many cars parked behind the bakkie  [pickup truck]. The Isuzu van was then moved outside the gate  of this court. Furthermore, three women arrived carrying ballot  boxes into Ntuzuma court, without any guards and were not marked  with IEC identification. What struck us was that this truck was  open without a canopy and nobody was looking after the boxes.  We then rushed to the nearest police station in order to report  this incident. The police opened a report, OB1680. Now, this is  a common thing now, that lastly, besides this particular case of  Isuzu, we have received at least three reports of people saying  that private ANC cars, in particular, have been seen carrying  away ballot boxes to destinations not known.    [IFP official] At the heart of the election campaign we  noticed a government or a ZP vehicle which was in our yard here  and was loading posters, and there were press people taking  photographs, and within a couple of minutes we had been alerted  by people in Ulundi that ZP and ZG number plates had been stolen  from government vehicles and these same number plates appeared  suddenly at the information center and there were a lot of press  around taking photographs of these...I'm sure quite  legitimately, because there were large numbers of pressmen here  all the time, but I mean obviously it's very damaging, that it  just goes to show that this...what in fact was happening, those  numbers were stolen and in fact they used some vehicles that  were driven into our information center, loaded up with IFP  stickers, in order to try and create the impression that in fact  government and KwaZulu Police transport was being used to  transport IFP election material, and I'm afraid propaganda put  out by Mr. Ramaphosa today is exactly the same thing. We have  personally checked and you are welcome to go and check. Those  officials will categorically deny that that ever took place.  It's just sheer propaganda.    [Jiyane] ANC, in particular, are panicking. The reason why  Ramaphosa has come out with such a diatribe on national  television is because they see the tremendous amount of support  that the IFP seems to be getting through these votes. The long  lines in northern Natal for example, are IFP. In fact, all that  he has alleged are things which are done by the ANC here. The  party agents of the IFP are being intimidated by ANC people, and  as you will all know, the IEC staff that are mostly presiding  officers and others, do not include IFP people, because IFP  entered late. The people who are intimidating party agents  there are ANC partisan officers, as well as thugs who come, like  the thugs who came to KwaMashu to threaten old people there, but  we are confident that the IFP, if this election has any  semblance of freeness and fairness, the IFP will win by a wide  margin here.</p>

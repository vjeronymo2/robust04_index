			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: IPounds 70m issue provides first test for Dublin THE Irish Permanent Building Society is providing Dublin's new corporate bond market with its first test, issuing IPounds 70m of an 8.5 per cent Irish Permanent Bond 2004. The bond was placed with domestic and foreign institutions by Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin at a price of 99.35, giving a yield of 8.59 per cent. A spokesman for Davy said that the issue was placed 'about 50:50 between domestic and foreign institutions. There was a healthy appetite out there for them.' A corporate bond market has not existed in Dublin until now, because of a 1 per cent stamp duty payable on the issue and transfer of corporate bonds. This duty was abolished last week with the publication of the 1993 Finance Act. The Irish Permanent bond is the first to take advantage of the new fund-raising environment. Mr Peter Fitzpatrick, finance director of Irish Permanent, said: 'The success of our placing signals the importance this emerging market will have for the funding activities of Irish companies.' Mr Fitzpatrick pointed out that for lending institutions such as the Irish Permanent, the corporate bond market gave greater flexibility for the future in providing long-term funding for mortgage borrowers. 'Irish Permanent looks forward to a continuing role in developing the market for Irish corporate bonds,' Mr Fitzpatrick said. The bond will have coupon payments of 4.25 per cent made on January 15 and July 15 each year, with final maturity on July 15 1994. The bond will be listed and traded on the Irish Stock Exchange. Irish Life, the insurance group, has placed 4m shares in the Dublin market at 215p each, Davy Stockbrokers said. Irish Life confirmed that the shares were placed by the insurance group's own pension funds.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Plan of Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize that considerable time and effort will be required to achieve an open aviation regime worldwide. We can get there by making a concerted effort to eliminate the obstacles to that regime and by taking a more strategic and long-term approach to our overall international aviation policies. At a minimum, we must increase our focus on emerging markets and their contribution to global networks; build a coalition of like-minded trading partners committed to the principles of free trade in aviation services; work closely with our trading partners to address their concerns; develop new incentives for encouraging market reform, such as increased opportunities for cross-border investment in airlines; and devise alternatives to the bilateral aviation system for achieving our objectives. We are launching our new initiatives to create freer trade in aviation services by taking the following steps:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Extend invitations to enter into open aviation agreements to a group of countries that share our liberalization vision and offer important flow traffic potential for our carriers even though they may have limited Third and Fourth Freedom traffic potential. This would assist the development of global systems and increase the momentum for further worldwide liberalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Give priority to building aviation relationships between the United States and potential growth areas in Asia, South America and Central Europe. This recognizes the importance of these trading partners and the need to provide air transportation to support those developing trade markets. It will also make available new markets to build global networks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Renew efforts to achieve liberal agreements with trading partners with which our aviation relationships lag behind those of our general trade advancements, such as Canada and the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Emphasize the importance of economic analysis in developing policies and strategies for achieving our overall aviation goals. This will enable us to remain focused on the overall strategic objectives, understand developments in the industry and market, and plan for the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Seek changes in U.S. airline foreign investment law, if necessary, to enable us to obtain our trading partners' agreements to liberal arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increase our efforts to reach out to Congress and constituent groups, such as consumers, multinational corporations (aircraft manufacturers, telecommunications, travel and hotel industries), cities, airlines, labor and travel agents to learn their anticipated needs over a 3&hyph;5 year period. This will provide us with valuable information for developing our positions, as well as enlisting their support in pushing for greater liberalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish stronger connections with U.S. government agencies whose functions are to promote U.S. business and trade interests ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Department of Commerce and the Export/Import Bank) to ensure that we share a single vision of the future global marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

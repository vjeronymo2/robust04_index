He said: "The separation has  existed since olden times, and there is nothing for Yemen to  lose from this separation."    In an interview in Jeddah al-Shayif told AL-HAYAH that  "unity  grants no superiority over anyone." He accused "those who made  the Pledge and Accord Document" of planning not only to separate  the south from the north, but to establish five separate  regions, each divided into several governorates with their own  resources, independence, and sovereignty, to be united  temporarily under the Council of Ministers and then become  independent later."    Al-Shayif described Yemeni unity as "abnormal; it does not  reflect the will of the two parts of Yemen. And it has never  been in the interests of the Yemeni people or friendly states in  the region."    He expected "the ties of unity binding north and south Yemen  to split soon at the end of the current tragic events."    He said that "the current deterioration in conditions  between  the two parts is the result of developments which are not new.  They are the result of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn, whose ambition was to seize the Arabian Peninsula  as a whole. And when the scheme aimed against the region's  states and its friends, they [Yemeni leaders] invented the unity  between the two parts with a view to destroying Yemen and its  people. The outcome is the infighting and dispute which  everyone is watching and which is harmful to Yemen."    He said that "by allying with the communists, they tried to  sabotage Yemen's relations with its friends and brothers."  Al-Shayif accused those he called "Shiite leaders" of  "cooperating with the communists to openly instigate subversive  actions in Yemen in order to attribute them to Yemen --  government and people." He noted that "the aim is for Yemen and  its people to be held responsible for what the communists did in  order to divide the people of the one march in Yemen and the  Arabian Peninsula."    He said: "As for the Socialist Party and the other parties  allied with it, they caused the disaster." He added: "We felt  sorry for our colleagues who were fooled by the methods of  deception and did not wake up until recently, that is, until the  introduction of the Pledge and Accord Document by the dialogue  committee." He said that those who formulated this document  "are members of the parties allied with the Socialist Party,  nothing of which is left except its name, as socialism has died  in the world as a whole."    He pointed out that members of the dialogue committee  composed of the leaders of the parties allied with the Socialist  Party "are running affairs in Yemen, even though they do not  enjoy the support of honorable Yemeni citizens." He said that  leaders of the Socialist Party "have reached that level only  with the help of leaders of the General People's Congress and  some of its members, who are working behind the scenes to serve  the Socialist Party."    He criticized the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the General  People's Congress, the House of Representatives, and the  Presidential Council, which he said "lack authority, as affairs  are run behind the scenes by elements from the Shiites allied  with the communists."    He said that he had warned of the danger of what is  happening  at a meeting of Yemeni tribal chiefs held under him a few months  ago.    He said that "what is happening in Yemen at present is that  the ship is steered by the dialogue committee arising from  Shiite sources, which pushes everyone to implement its members'  schemes."    He stressed that "if the situation continues as it stands,  we  will find ourselves compelled to intervene and obliged to take a  decisive initiative, even if hostile groups interpret it as  aimed against our comrades in destiny. What we are interested  in is to tackle the general situation, in which our comrades in  common destiny are interested."</p>

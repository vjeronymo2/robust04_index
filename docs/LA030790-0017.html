			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISM  </P> <P> If Karl Marx were alive today to see the fall of "communism" in the Soviet  Union and Eastern Europe he would be unable to understand why people associate  totalitarian systems and closed economies as communist societies.  </P> <P> For Marx a communist country is altruistic and he would be insulted that people  equate the Soviet Union with his name.  </P> <P> Today, Marx would predict the world is transforming from dictatorial systems  that repress people as in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and South Africa, to  democratic systems that provide greater freedoms.  </P> <P> Once society no longer represses people, socialistic systems will develop,  providing all people with the basic human needs for survival, and from  socialism will come communism.  </P> <P> JEFF POLAK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

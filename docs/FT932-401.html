			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Letter: Industry must get into melee of education Sir, Michael Dixon's article, 'Self-imposed stranglehold on recovery' (June 23), makes the important point that what matters most in the wealth of nations is knowhow, but that Britain's universities are all about the 'know-why'. An example might be the ratio of technical staff in manufacturing - scientists are a fraction of 1 per cent. Even in my own very high technology field - semiconductor manufacturing equipment - the number of people who need to know why are far outnumbered by those who need to know how. Part of the reason for Britain's emphasis on know-why is cultural, but part is also due to the small role industrialists, and particularly manufacturers, have taken in directing policy in education and science. At least in science and technology education and R&amp;D, the time may now be right for manufacturers to involve themselves. The new white paper, Realising Our Potential - the first government paper on this for many years  -is all about encouraging manufacturing industry to participate. New mechanisms will be set up, such as Technology Foresight, led by the Office of Science and Technology, while existing mechanisms such as the CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) and the Teaching Company Scheme will be extended. The future wealth of this nation depends upon industry getting into the melee of education and science policy rather than whingeing from the sidelines.

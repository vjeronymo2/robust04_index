			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UAP in deal for Colonia Union des Assurances de Paris yesterday announced it was mounting a DM1.2bn (Pounds 493m) deal to pay Oppenheim, the private German group, for its minority stake in a holding company in order to give the French insurance group 100 per cent control of Colonia, its German insurance subsidiary. In a complex deal, UAP has been able to reduce the amount of cash paid to Oppenheim by exploiting Westdeutsche Landesbank's desire to raise its stake in the French insurance company. Last October UAP and Suez, the French financial group, swapped their insurance holdings. Suez gained Victoire's French insurance subsidiaries, and UAP took Victoire's 78.8 per cent stake in Vinci, a specialist holding company controlling Colonia, the third largest German insurer. The remaining stake in Vinci was held by the Oppenheim family. 'With the Oppenheims having a 'put' or option to sell their stake, it was always clear that if they exercised it we would try to buy the stake,' said UAP. UAP's opportunity arose when it was privatised earlier this year. Westdeutsche Landesbank joined the 'noyau dur', or core of institutional investors organised by the French government. Like other core investors its stake was scaled back to 2.2 per cent by the government, but the regional German bank wanted a higher stake. By putting up FFr482m (Pounds 58m) to buy bonds convertible into UAP shares  -thereby providing the French group with cash - the German bank will raise its stake in UAP to 3 per cent.</p>

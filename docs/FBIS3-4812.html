The package was sent to the House of Councillors.    The revised package, jointly submitted to the Diet by the  governing coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), features changes in the districts of proportional  representation for lower house elections and in corporate  donations to political fund-raising organizations.    The original government package banned corporate donations  to  politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the  revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per  year during the next five years as a temporary provision.    The package maintains that 300 seats in the lower house will  be elected through a single-seat constituency system and the  remaining 200 by a system of proportional representation.  Current lower house members are elected from constituencies  with two to six seats.    The package was passed on January 29 at the last  extraordinary session of the Diet shortly after Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the  amendments and date of enforcement would be discussed during the  current ordinary session.    On February 24, the ruling coalition and the LDP agreed on  the revisions weeks after discussions of the package began.    Lower house elections based on the political reform  legislation will be able to commence after a bill on the  locations of the 300 single-seat constituencies clears the  parliament.</p>

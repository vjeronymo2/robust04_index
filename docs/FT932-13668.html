			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Zeneca ahead in first quarter after decline in 1992 ZENECA, the bioscience business of Imperial Chemical Industries, said yesterday that it had started 1993 on a 'firm note' and that first-quarter trading profits were 'usefully ahead'. The statement came in the pathfinder prospectus for Zeneca's planned demerger, flotation and Pounds 1.3bn rights issue published yesterday. ICI shares rose 41p to 1236p yesterday. Zeneca also confirmed that arrangements had been made to encourage investors outside the UK to purchase Zeneca shares. Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said Zeneca's aim was to produce 'sustainable earnings growth supported by strong cashflow'. Mr John Mayo, finance director, said the fall in Zeneca's trading profits from Pounds 682m to Pounds 587m, before exceptional items, in 1992 was a 'downward correction'. The prospectus said that if Zeneca had had the benefit of the rights money in 1992, and ignoring the Pounds 52m costs of the demerger, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 278m not the Pounds 102m reported. The rights issue will be priced and underwritten on May 12 and demerger is due to go ahead on June 1, subject to shareholders' approval at a meeting on May 28. Two syndicates of investment banks - covering the US and the rest of the world - have been appointed to solicit purchasers for shares. SG Warburg Securities, the global co-ordinator, will cover these purchases by buying Zeneca rights in the market. The intention to tap this pool of demand for Zeneca shares is expected to add tension to the pricing of the rights issue. Mr Mayo said 'the key objective is to reduce the cost of capital to the group'. With Warburg, Goldman Sachs International and Barclays de Zoete Wedd will be international marketing co-ordinators. Goldman will head the US syndicate and Warburgs the rest of the world. The three are also primary underwriters for the rights. On top of the usual underwriting commissions for the rights issue, Zeneca will pay a commission of 2.15 per cent of the value of shares sold by the international marketing group. From this Warburg will pay syndicate members a 1 per cent commission. Warburg will also receive a fee of Pounds 50,000 plus expenses. However, the international marketing co-ordinators will return half their profits to Zeneca. Lex, Page 24</p>

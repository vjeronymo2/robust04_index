			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Russia takes radical rhetoric with a grain of salt: Mr Yeltsin's government may have trouble putting its package of economic reforms into practice RADICAL economic reform in Russia leads a strange existence. It is universally called 'shock therapy' by its many detractors inside and outside parliament, who blame it for high inflation, high prices, the decline of living standards and the fall in production. Its supporters within the cabinet would say it has not really begun. The package of measures revealed to the cabinet on Thursday on the eve of the Congress of People's Deputies session yesterday is designed to give it a kick-start. Designed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for the economy and finance, the package was the cabinet's answer to President Boris Yeltsin's call at the weekend for urgent proposals to stabilise the economy. According to Interfax news agency, the package includes lifting the bank rate to 8 per cent a month (from a rate of between 80 per cent and 100 per cent a year), putting a strict limit on the issuing of credits to enterprises, establishing a hard currency fund to be used for stabilising the rouble, demanding a six-month moratorium on foreign debt repayments, easing the way to allow citizens to buy private plots and take part in privatisation, and enforcing personal responsibility of ministers for the success of their briefs. If implemented, the package will be radical in its effects, especially if credits are limited, since it would indicate the government is winning its struggle with the central bank to slow down what it sees as the main engine of inflation. But Mr Fyodorov wants to go further. He is seeking the head of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the bank chairman, and has asked Mr Yeltsin to fire him. Mr Yeltsin may oblige: he blames the central bank for playing 'a negative role. . . in stirring up inflation'. Limiting credits and pushing up interest rates (albeit to a point still far below the inflation rate of around 25-30 per cent a month) should finally force to the wall many of the companies that are staggering on with credit infusions to keep them alive. The resulting bankruptices will raise the low unemployment figure and is calculated to send a shock through the company sector, forcing restructuring and development of market mechanisms. But will it be implemented? Mr Fyodorov told the cabinet the measures would have to be trimmed to keep in mind the political imperative of winning a large vote of confidence in the president on April 25, when Mr Yeltsin's proposed popular vote of trust in him is scheduled to take place. More weightily still, Mr Yeltsin said yesterday in his speech to Congress that the government had made many mistakes and that insofar as a 'new course' in the econonmy was required, it should be a course towards more social balance. The president said nothing about the harsher measures in Mr Fyodorov's package, stressing instead a raising of the minimum wage, new benefits and pay for the military and the need to stop the slide in living standards. Further, the cabinet will face another battle with the Congress over the budget, approved on Thursday - though the ambiguous relationship between the government and parliament after Mr Yeltsin's assumption of presidential powers may mean it will simply ignore the lawmakers' proposals. The approved budget amounts to Rbs17,000bn (nearly Pounds 17bn at the current exchange rate) and would, says the government, push up the budget deficit from an estimated 12 per cent of GNP this year to about 22.5 per cent. Mr Fyodorov is the key figure in this. Firing Mr Vassily Barchuk as finance minister and Mr Andrei Nechayev as economics minister puts the two ministries, which he already oversees as deputy prime minister, in his hands. He will be his own finance minister and can probably get an ally in Mr Nechayev's job. If he also gains the ousting of Mr Gerashchenko and has a more compliant central bank chairman, he will be monarch of economic policy in a way Mr Yegor Gaidar, former acting prime minister, was only for the first quarter of last year. But everyone is cautious. The rhetoric of radical reform has been devalued by so many false starts and obstacles. Once again, there must be a pause while yet another hurdle - the April 25 vote - is negotiated. The cabinet is divided and Mr Fyodorov has inherited a demoralised bureacracy and lacks the mechanisms for making his plans concrete. There is little question that Mr Fyodorov's general line will be supported by Mr Bill Clinton during the summit meeting with Mr Yeltsin next week and by the Group of Seven leaders in their later meetings. But the line still needs to become practice.</p>

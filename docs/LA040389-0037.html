			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BALINESE DANCE TROUPE PERFORMS IN PASADENA  </P> <P> Translations would have helped the unenlightened Westerner better appreciate  the Dancers and Musicians of Bali presented by the Ambassador International  Cultural Foundation at Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Saturday.  </P> <P> The long, closing dramatic stretch in particular left a non-Balinese speaker  with little to take in other than the striking, colorful, opulent costumes of  the characters.  </P> <P> But with at least one character courting or perhaps telling jokes to the  audience, the experience must have been equally frustrating to the players who  probably are used to more interaction or immediate response at home.  </P> <P> For all its sinuous mirror images unfolding in leisurely, expansive time, even  the dance-drama "Legon Keraton" evoked similar moments of frustration. The  story was related by an (amplified) offstage singer taking various roles with  effective throaty, hoarse and nasal chantings, as well as battle sounds a la  Victor Borge.  </P> <P> One got the impression that this was not arcane art intended to be remote from  everyday people, as it turned out for many in the theater.  </P> <P> Still, there were many moments to savor in watching the dancers so skillfully  execute the distinctive Balinese style -- torsos twisted angularly, arms held  in asymmetrical positions, fingers flexed outward, hands shimmering, eyes  darting, bodies sinking from raised-toes to crouches close to the floor.  </P> <P> Westerners somewhat familiar with gamelan music got a few surprises. The brief  opening instrumental piece revealed unexpected close-tone dissonances,  call-and-response sequences and short, apparently discontinuous sections. CHRIS  PASLES  </P></p>

In exclusive statements to  AL-WAFD, Jibril affirmed that following the restoration of ties  between Egypt and Libya, Libyan President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi  pledged not to touch his opponents in Cairo.    Jibril noted that the Egyptian authorities had relaxed  protection measures around Libyan opposition elements residing  in Egypt upon the normalization of relations with Libya in view  of al-Qadhdhafi's pledge. He pointed out that Egypt and other  Arab and European states have rejected the Libyan authorities'  request to hand over the opponents of al-Qadhdhafi's regime.    Jibril noted that he has received many death threats  involving him and other figures of the Libyan opposition and  their families. He said that al-Qadhdhafi's regime has been  involved in 23 attacks against Libyan opposition elements in  European capitals.    He estimated the number of political prisoners in Libya at  3,000 and affirmed that the Libyan opposition is closely  monitoring developments in the case of the disappearance of  [former Libyan foreign minister] Mansur al-Kikhya through daily  contacts with the Egyptian authorities.</p>

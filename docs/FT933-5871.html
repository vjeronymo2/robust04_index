			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Observer: Sundown in the east Britain's new ambassador to Azerbaijan, who takes up his new posting in Baku today, will not be lacking in ex-pat company. Many officials from British Gas and elsewhere, involved in a multi-million pound gas exploration deal, are flocking to the region. This is in marked contrast to his colleagues scattered around the rest of the former Soviet Union, where the British government's tightly-drawn purse-strings have left a diplomatic community definitely lacking in depth. In the Baltic states, Lithuania and Estonia manage just four diplomats between them; Latvia has the same number all to itself. These territories may be small - boasting a combined population of just 8m. All the same Malta, which is not generally considered to be a bridgehead to the lucrative Russian market, has seven people, excluding the local hires. The Germans, Danes and Swedes are ubiquitous on the ex-USSR's western frontier - partly for historical reasons, to be sure. But even France which, like the UK, has few traditional links to the region, has opened a trade mission in Vilnius. Next door, in Belarus, it gets worse. The UK 'shares' an embassy with Germany - meaning that the man in Minsk has one room in the old east German consulate, where the receptionist barely speaks English. At least Graham Greene's Man in Havana employed a secretary. In Kazakhstan, the Germans are also being similarly hospitable, while Britain so far goes unrepresented in Turkmenistan and Georgia. The Foreign Office is not insensitive to the problem, and defends the distribution of resources, saying that these new states are 'still very much on the periphery'. But who will be on the periphery in a decade or two?</p>

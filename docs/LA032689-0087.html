			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: DEVELOPER SEEKS LOAN  </P> <P> Stalled work on the Compton Lazben Hotel, begun in 1986, may resume shortly  following a request to Compton's City Council last week for a loan of at least  $1.5 million to the developer of the long-delayed, $30-million project.  </P> <P> Naftali Deutsch, a principal in several firms building the city-backed hotel  and convention center, told officials that he cannot complete work because he  is $3 million short.  </P> <P> City Manager James Goins confirmed his intent to recommend to council members  that they accept Deutsch's offer to come up with $1.5 million if the city is  willing to loan him the other $1.5 million.  </P> <P> The project has been beset by financial problems, labor disputes and work  stoppages since it began. The original completion date was May, 1988, but city  officials agreed to adjust the completion date to mid-December.  </P> <P> Loaning more money to Deutsch is only one of several alternatives to get going  on the project again, Goins said. One could include suing Deutsch and his  partners for breach of contract and hiring a new contractor to finish the job.  </P></p>

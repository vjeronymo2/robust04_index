			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (8): Managers are discovering new Lans - New technologies are linking local and wide area networks / Many observers see ATM technology as the key to high-speed networking, both for wide-area and national networks Network managers do not install new local area networks (Lans) - 'managers discover them,' says Sean Phelan of the Yankee Group Europe. 'It's not unknown for a Lan to be purchased out of the furniture budget, and only to come to light when the finance director queries a maintenance demand on furniture.' Low prices are turning Lans into a commodity, with a compound sales growth of 70 per cent a year, according to the consultancy, Ovum. But increasingly, the challenge companies face is not how to connect personal computers into Lans, but how to integrate all the Lans within a building - and beyond that, around the company. Many Lans are installed to meet a specific need (such as the need for a group of workers to share information); others are set up on an ad hoc basis. The latter tend to be introduced to share a printer, after which a file server (a computer which stores files), and basic electronic mail (e-mail) follow. The drivers for Lan integration are somewhat different. They include: Globalisation: As companies increasingly compete on a global basis, they want quick access to market intelligence from around the world and better internal communications. This can be achieved using Lan e-mail. Legacy systems: If aging, mainframe-based 'legacy' applications are made available via company Lans, some of their complexity can be disguised by graphical user interfaces. Cost-savings: Companies can cut costs by moving applications off the mainframe and on to smaller systems, such as local-area networks of PCs, where hardware and development costs are lower. Lans are also an important component of client-server computing (where processing is shared between 'client' PCs and more powerful 'server' systems). Delayering: As company remove layers of management, the information and tools for dispersed decision-making need to be made available to users throughout the organisation. Lans can be interconnected using a number of devices including bridges, routers and gateways. Routers have become the most popular for large-scale Lan integration. They are so-called because as well as connecting two networks they also have the ability to select routes through a network. The drive towards Lan integration is boosting sales of routers, benefiting suppliers like Cisco and Wellfleet. The Yankee Group says router sales are doubling every year. If two or more Lans are to be connected, a router most be put on each and the two routers linked by a cable. If the two Lans are within the same building or at the same site they become a bigger Lan. EXPANDING THE NETWORK If two or more Lans at different sites are connected, they become a wide-area network, or Wan. (Any public or private network which connects computers over distance, such as a public X25 network, can also be described as a Wan.) The main difference between a Wan and a Lan, says Phelan, is that 'you have to pay other people for bandwidth.' The situation is analogous to the telephone. If you phone a colleague in the same building, the call is free, but if you phone someone in Manchester, the chances are that your company is paying BT or Mercury for the call, or at the very least renting leased lines from them. A number of technologies are available - or becoming available - for linking Lans into Wans. They include: leased lines, X25 packet switching, frame relay, and ATM (or asynchronous transfer mode). Each has their pros and cons. Leased lines (point-to-point telecoms links) are fast, offering data-transmission speeds of 64 Kbits or higher, but they are really expensive. X25, a form of packet switching, once seemed like a good compromise. It can be used over a public data network (provided by BT, Mercury or others). Because users share the network, sending their data in 'packets,' costs are lower than for leased lines. The drawback is that X25 is slow, offering typical speeds of 9,600 bits per second. Today, frame relay provides a better solution for connecting Lans. Peter Cook, marketing director Europe at AT&amp;T Istel, describes frame relay as 'like X25 on speed' because, though similar, it is five to 10 times faster. It starts where X25 finishes at 64 kilobits. But a lot of error-correction codes - not needed on modern telecoms lines - have been stripped out. Frame relay is also cheaper because companies only pay for the bandwidth they actually use. It is ideal for the 'bursty' traffic typical of Lan usage, where data (such as a file) is only sent from time to time. Frame relay networks are being rolled out by a number of companies including BT and AT&amp;T. These cover larger cities in the UK and a growing number in other countries. Interest from users is high. Twenty-five per cent of the requests-for-proposal that BT Global Network Services (GNS) receives include frame relay. Nick Brooks, product manager for Lan interconnect at BT GNS, says: 'Later in the year, we will also be offering ISDN (integrated services digital network) as an alternative to frame relay for occasional Lan traffic, or as a back-up.' Market researchers Frost &amp; Sullivan believe that technologies such as frame relay and ATM will take market share from widely available (but limited) Lan protocols like TCP/IP (Transaction Control Program/Internet Protocol). FRAME RELAY CHALLENGE ATM could, however, also pose a threat to the emerging frame relay market. Though still only in the trial phase in Europe, there are great hopes for ATM because it was designed from day one for fibre-optic networks and multi-megabit speeds. It processes data in hardware rather than software, which is much faster. So ATM chips can be designed to do nothing but pump out 53-byte data cells at phenomenal speeds. As well as superseding frame relay, ATM could also replace metropolitan-area networks, (Mans). These systems were originally conceived as high-speed networks that would cover a city. Mans have been talked about as possible on and off-ramps for information highways, the national information networks envisioned by US vice-president Al Gore. Many of the ideas behind Mans have influenced the development of ATM. But so much more research and development money is going into ATM, that Mans are unlikely to play more than a niche role. For example, BT now uses the technology behind Mans - SMDS (or switched multi-megabit data service) - to provide very high speed links between computers, such as high-powered workstations and supercomputers. 'ATM is happening in Europe this year,' says Phelan. 'A lot of people are seeing it as the future of high-speed networking, both for wide-area and for national networks'.

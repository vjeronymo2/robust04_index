			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US input helps raise Ivory &amp; Sime to Pounds 6m Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund managers, lifted pre-tax profits by 27 per cent, from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 6.2m, during the year to April 30. Mr Allan Munro, managing director, said the company was continuing the progress made in the four years since management changed in 1990. Managed funds increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.8bn at the year end, though the rise was 'not as fast we would like'. During the year the company lost the contract to manage portfolios controlled by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, leading to Ensign Trust selling its 16.7 per cent stake to investors including Abtrust and Scottish Value Trust. I&amp;S also lost the contract to manage New Frontiers Development fund. However, funds under management in North America doubled to Pounds 470m despite the loss of one client worth Pounds 110m. Mr Munro said I&amp;S could present a good five-year record in managing UK pension funds which meant it attended 'beauty parades' to win new mandates. Profits were boosted by the high level of world stock markets over the year. Sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 14.3m). Administrative expenses rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 11m. The final dividend is 5.25p, making a total of 7.5p, up 15.4 per cent, and payable from earnings up 20 per cent to 12.87p per share.</p>

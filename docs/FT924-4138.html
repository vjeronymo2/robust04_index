			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (13): Deals flow steadily - The Regions FIVE-and-a-half weeks ago, Interactive Media Services (IMS), a Leeds-based telephone information specialist, was bought by its management from the troubled Brent Walker Group in a Pounds 12.7m deal. The Leeds office of 3i arranged the funding, bringing in Murray Johnstone and County NatWest Ventures jointly to buy Pounds 7m of equity. Debt facilities came from the Bank of Scotland's Edinburgh office, a specialist in assessing risk for IMS's low asset, high cash-flow type of operation. IMS is the largest UK user of British Telecom's premium rate network, providing sports information services using 0891 numbers. Its most recent coup was to secure an exclusive three-year contract with the Test and County Cricket Board so people can dial in for the latest scores, making money for both IMS and the game. The deal was typical of the sort of buy-out activity under way in Britain's regions. A large group needed to divest a sound but non-core business. Selling to the management made the most sense for continuity and professional expertise was on hand locally. Crucially for the industrial and commercial infrastructure of the regions, the parent group's own problems did not automatically spell doom for a healthy subsidiary, as has happened in past recessions. In the IMS case, Mr Bill Wilson, the chief executive, turned to Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Leeds for financial advice and to Booth &amp; Co, one of the Leeds 'big five' commercial law firms which have made the regional capital Britain's strongest legal centre outside London. Two weeks later, it was Manchester's turn, when its network of professionals arranged the management buy-out of Celmac, the UK's leading manufacturer of toilet seats, from Burmah Castrol, which had picked up the non-core business last year when it acquired Foseco. Nearly all the same national firms of professionals were involved in Celmac as with IMS. However, it was their Manchester offices this time, with Barclays Development Capital investing rather than Murray Johnstone and the Manchester firm of Eversheds Alexander Tatham doing the legal work. As Mr Charles Richardson, a 3i main board director, puts it: 'While some people thought the buy-out was a late 1980s phenomenon, time is proving them wrong. There are some very good ones around now - especially in the regions, and at lower prices.' Mr Richardson is responsible for the seven 3i offices in northern England and Scotland. A drive on overheads has seen 3i close its small bureaux in Sheffield and Hull this year, to centre operations on Leeds. It is also moving to smaller, more economic offices in Edinburgh, putting its prestigious but over-large building in Charlotte Square on the market. Mr Richardson says this is to save overheads in cost-conscious times, not because there is a shortage of work. Indeed, 3i's latest published figures show Pounds 66.5m invested in 81 management buy-outs in the Midlands, north and Scotland in the year to last April. The north-west had most money - Pounds 18.5m - for 12 deals. The East Midlands used Pounds 16m in 17 deals and Scotland Pounds 14.5m in 24. While most deals are relatively small compared with the highly-leveraged ones of the late 1980s, regional work is steady. The past six months have even seen some larger deals. Standard Fireworks, based in West Yorkshire, was bought from Scottish Heritable Trust in a Pounds 27m deal; Swift Transport, in the East Midlands, was a Pounds 26m buy-out from LEP; in the north-west, Tulchan Textiles' management needed Pounds 15m to separate from a privately-owned leisurewear parent, and Taco Holdings was in a Pounds 10m deal with its parent, a polyethylene film manufacturer. Ten years ago, the local networks of professionals who put these deals together did not exist, so neither did the deals. With local knowledge and contacts essential to good deal-making, the change from the recession of 1980-1982 is profound, enabling more businesses to survive and corporate ownership to spread. Coopers &amp; Lybrand's experience illustrates how fertile this ground is. In spite of his name, Mr Paul Southern is in charge of northern operations, which he says have grown at a rate of 70 per cent a year for seven years and now involve 37 fee-earners, plus supporting staff, in the north alone. According to the latest report of the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at Nottingham University, the south-east's pre-eminence in buy-out markets is slipping. It accounted for only 35.9 per cent of buy-outs in the first half of this year, compared with 38.1 per cent in 1991. The north-west has accounted for 10 per cent of the national total in the past 18 months, while the south-west's share rose from 5 per cent in 1990 and 1991 to 8.2 per cent in the six months to June this year. Meanwhile, the north-east and Cumbria achieved a record share of deals at 5.2 per cent of the national total for the six months. Scottish and Yorkshire's shares dipped slightly in the six months, but this may reflect a slowdown in the time taken to do them. Mr Southern says the more cautious economic climate means it takes three or four times longer to close a deal now than in the late 1980s. Six or eight months is typical. Discussions with IMS started last year. Raw numbers may well be a better indicator: the south-west recorded 19 buy-outs in the first half of 1992, after averaging 10 per half-year since the beginning of 1989. By contrast, the bigger south-east regional economy saw more than 100 deals in the first half of 1991, but only 67 in the second half. The figure picked up to 83 in six months to last July, but the directions of the two regional trends is obvious. Mr Richardson of 3i says: 'There is more caution all round, but there is a good enough flow of buy-out proposals for this to be our main activity today. 'Prices are well into single-figure multiples of earnings, compared with up to 14 four or five years ago, when earnings were also higher.' Four or five times earnings is the current price level quoted by other professionals, such as KPMG Peat Marwick's Manchester office. Does this mean, therefore, that the higher-priced buy-outs of previous years have run into trouble in the recession because their managers paid too much? 'Most have proved remarkably resilient,' Mr Richardson says. 'One or two have failed, a few have been refinanced, but most have been able to continue. It proves the virtues of owner-management: they have an incentive to succeed. Also, good managers see things coming, adjust to problems, take difficult decisions early and plan their way through.' Capital providers say this latter point is a principal reason managers win their backing in the first place. Mr Southern says three other ingredients also have to be present: 'Cash, cash and cash.' These always improve recession-resistance.</p>

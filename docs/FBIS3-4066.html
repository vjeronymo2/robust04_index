			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Lin Ya (2651 0068): "China's Economy Is in a Dilemma-- </F> Economist Dong Fureng on Economic Situation in 1994"]    [Text] In the early half of 1993, China's economy was  overheated. Although macroscopic regulation was strengthened  from July and marked results were achieved, the annual national  retail price index rose 13 percent and residents' cost of living  expenses rose 14.7 percent, creating problems for the economy in  1994.  <H5>  The Growth Rate in 1994 Is Still High </H5>   This year, the government is in a dilemma over macroscopic  regulation. It has to maintain rapid economic growth but, on  the other hand, it must once again keep inflation in check. If  economic growth is too high, inflation will be exacerbated. If  the growth rate drops excessively, it will also create problems  though prices may tend to stabilize. On the one hand, there  will be less supply but, on the other hand, many enterprises  will be in a state of halted production or semi-production and  some workers and staff do not have a sense of security regarding  their livelihood, thus causing social instability. It is  necessary to seek a balance of the two and properly handle it.    Overall, the rapid growth last year was a trend and there  will still be a high rate of growth this year. After the  control over money supply was eased in the latter half of last  year, the judgment of the economic situation by some localitites  this year was faulty and they wrongly believed that they could  arbitrarily increase investment this year. In consequence, the  price of rolled steel, which had dropped, rebounded to a level  which is almost as high as that before last July. As a matter  of fact, it is still necessary to work through better  macroscopic regulation this year to realize a "soft landing."  Gradual steps must be taken to control the speed of economic  growth within the following levels:    1. We must be able to integrate readjustment of the  industrial structure with the speed of economic growth in a very  good form, thus enabling the industrial structure to sustain  rapid economic growth. In the first half of last year, the then  industrial structure could not sustain the high rate of economic  growth and the bottleneck constraints were aggravated. In this  way, the high rate of economic growth dropped even though the  government did not take the initiative to regulate it. This  year, the speed should gradually drop to a level which the  industrial structure, with step- by-step readjustment, can  sustain.  <H5>  $10-Billion Trade Deficit Seen Last Year </H5>   Last year, while enhancing macroscopic regulation, we took  pains to readjust the industrial structure and to integrate  macroscopic regulation with readjustment of the industrial  structure, which was the correct direction. Since readjusting  the industrial structure is a long-term task, this year, we must  still make great efforts in this respect. Some departments  should slow down, whereas some others must speed up their  development, for example, in energy, communications, and raw and  processed materials. If tangible results are achieved on  structural readjustment this year, it will create good  conditions for future economic development because only with a  coordinated industrial structure can we achieve sustained and  high-speed economic growth.    2. It is necessary to maintain the speed of economic growth  at a level which foreign exchange reserves can sustain. If the  speed is too rapid but we do not have sufficient domestic  resources, we will have to spend a large amount of foreign  exchange on imports. Last year, we imported a lot and there was  a $10-billion trade deficit. In the long run, our foreign  reserves will be exhausted and will not be able to meet the  needs of repaying foreign debts and stabilizing the exchange  rate of renminbi. However, if the speed of economic growth is  too low, the growth of exports will be affected and there will  be less foreign exchange.    3. Our finances must be able to sustain it. Overall, our  country's economic growth is still mainly an extensive one and  our country's financial revenue still relies mainly on state-run  enterprises. If the rate of growth is too low, enterprises will  have very poor benefits and there will be more financial  difficulties.    4. The pressure of employment must be taken into account.  There is a very great pressure of employment in our country,  particularly in cities, and every year, we have two to three  percent unemployment. If the speed of economic growth is too  low, it will not only create problems for new employment but  will also affect the employment of current staff and workers.  Last year, many enterprises fully or partially halted  production and some workers and staff took part of their wages  and lived by selling small articles on the street. Hence, the  economic growth rate cannot be too low and we have to take the  pressure of employment into account.    5. When taking into account the rate of economic growth, we  must pay special attention to the issue of controlling  inflation. Under the current situation, it is unrealistic to  achieve zero economic growth but, if we can control the economic  growth rate within a certain limit, that is, the raise in the  cost of living index not exceeding 10 percent, it will be a  brilliant achievement.    An outstanding issue in this year's economic development is  how to bring inflation under control. The question now is no  longer whether or not there is inflation because it has gone  beyond the limit of mild inflation. If inflation is high for a  short time, the people can bear it but this is not the case if  inflation is persistently high. Last year, residents'  anticipation of changes in prices precisely reflected this  problem. We must understand that inflation affects various  strata in different ways. That is, low-income groups and retired  workers and staff, particularly those from plants which have  fully or partially halted production, are most affected by  inflation and their livlihood cannot be guaranteed.    This year, the inflation situation is grim. Therefore, when  taking into account the rate of economic growth, we must have an  overall viewpoint. The economic growth rate cannot be too low  and neither can inflation be further exacerbated. This year,  price raises are determined by several factors: The first is  the aftereffects of last year's price raises; the second is  rising costs; and the third is the newly-introduced price  reform, particularly raises in petroleum, coal, grain, and  transportation and communications. This year, it will be quite  difficult to keep the national retail price index below 10  percent and the raise is expected to exceed 10 percent.    According to relevant statistics, due to the aftereffects of  last year's price readjustment, the cost-of-living index will  rise 5.5 percent this year; new factors of price readjustment  this year can cause a two percent rise in retail prices; and the  fact that total demand is greater than total supply in society  will cause a four percent raise in retail prices. Merely  because of these few factors, retail prices this year will  increase 11.5 percent, whereas residents' expected effect of  inflation, which may exist, is not included in the calculation.  <H3>  Seeking Economic Growth As Well As Bringing Inflation Under  Control </H3>   As far as the current macroscopic regulation is concerned,  the government not only has to maintain rapid economic growth  but also bring inflation under control so that prices will not  soar. Confronted with this dilemma, the government is likely to  adopt a policy which alternately tightens and relaxes control on  the rate of economic growth. When the speed is too fast and  inflation is exacerbated, controls should be tightened. After a  certain period of time when the rate slows down and inflation  eases up, the controls should be relaxed.    This year, if we can keep the economic growth rate within,  or  slightly outside the limit of 10 percent, and maintain the  national retail price index within or slightly beyond the limit  of 10 percent, our economy this year will do quite well.  However, we cannot sustain it if either the rate of price  raises is as high as over 15 percent or the economic growth rate  drops dramatically. The government's art of regulation is  precisely to strike a balance between moderately rapid economic  growth and sustainable inflation. With last year's experience in  macroscopic regulation, we should do better this year in  gradually slowing down the excessively high- speed economic  growth, to alleviate inflation step by step and to realize a  "soft landing."</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in late trading A UK stock market depressed initially by weakness in the pharmaceutical sector was rallying steadily at the close as the dollar improved in the wake of the latest data on the US economy. Trading volume was thin for most of the session, although business in the blue chip internationals increased after Wall Street opened. Investment sentiment remained cautious ahead of the UK budget, due a week today. UK public opinion polls continued to overshadow the stock market, with the latest polls suggesting a weakening in public ratings of Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. London share prices fell sharply at first as traders took on board the implications of two unexpected fund raising operations in the equity market. Plans by the Wellcome Foundation to reduce its stake in the quoted drug company from 73.6 per cent to under 50 per cent had been widely foreshadowed in the UK press at the weekend. But confirmation by the trustees indicated an international share placing on a very substantial scale - a minimum of Pounds 2.5bn at current share prices. Also disclosed yesterday morning were plans by Bowater for a Pounds 333.5m rights issue in London. UK traders had been assuming that there would be no significant cash calls ahead of the UK budget which is due a week today. The stock market dipped by 20 FT-SE points in early trading but was then rescued by a firm opening in the stock index futures, which later, however, lost support. The first hour of market trading, traditionally the most active of the day, brought only miniscule business, however; the Seaq total did not reach 1m shares until mid-morning. In these slack conditions, a temporary widening in the premium on the FT-SE March futures contract and a trading programme involving stocks across the full market range reduced the loss in the Footsie. However, the market remained on the downside throughout the day and it was not until the US dollar responded favourably to the latest survey of opinion among US Purchasing Managers that London established a convincing rally. At its final reading of 2,554.3, the FT-SE Index was only 7.8 off. Boosted by demand for Reuters and some other international stocks after Wall Street opened with an early gain of six points on the Dow, volume in London improved in the second half of the session. The Seaq network finally recorded trading of 438.6m shares, against 449.7m on Friday, when retail business was worth Pounds 962.8m. However, traders said that there was little direction in the market as a whole. Wellcome's news brought a heavy fall in the shares which represented a fall of three points on the Footsie. Some other pharmaceutical issues, also significant constituents of leading market indices, were unsettled by the prospect that cash might be raised in order to meet the Wellcome placings. However, the sector rallied well at the close. Overall views of the stock market remained little changed. A relatively generous budget speech is expected, together with a cut in UK base rates. However, the market is held back by uncertainty over the outcome of the general election. This was again reflected yesterday in losses in the water industry stocks, considered to be at risk should a Labour government be elected.</p>

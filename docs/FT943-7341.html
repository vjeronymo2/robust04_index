			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Struggle over crime bill in Senate President Bill Clinton's crime bill ran into another brick wall yesterday, when the administration and the Democratic leadership in the Senate fell short in their efforts to muster enough votes to overcome a procedural obstacle raised by the opposition Republicans. Senator Joseph Biden, the crime bill's manager in the Senate, conceded in a long and bitter speech yesterday evening that he was at least one vote short of the 60 he would need to waive a budgetary point of order raised against the bill. Although debate will continue today while efforts continue behind the scenes to drum up more support, the failure to bring the bill to a vote yesterday was another devastating blow to Mr Clinton. Without the waiver, Mr Biden said, the crime bill would die until a new Congress could start afresh next year. A waiver is required because the bill sets up a trust fund, to be filled with money saved from cutting the federal government workforce, to pay for its law enforcement measures. The trust fund was not voted on by the budget committee, and so technically violates the Congressional Budget Act. If the point of order is not set aside, the legislation would once again be opened up for amendment. That would mean that sending it back once again to the House of Representatives, which only passed it on Sunday after the Democrats had made a series of concessions to overcome a similar procedural obstacle. When the crime bill passed the Senate for the first time late last year, the Republicans voted overwhelmingly for it, and agreed to waive the budgetary point of order. Scenting blood from a weakened president, the Republicans moved in for the kill to raise the point of order this time around. Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico claimed yesterday that the bill had been so altered in the conference to reconcile it with the House version that the waiver he and his colleagues had earlier supported was no longer justified.</p>

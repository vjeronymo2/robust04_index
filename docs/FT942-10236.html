			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices beat retreat - Market Report COPPER prices finished lower at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, with the market beating a retreat from new 13-month highs on expected technical selling and profit-taking. The high-water mark for three months delivery was Dollars 2,097 a tonne, but final business was at Dollars 2,073, down Dollars 4 from Monday's after hours close. Other metals were pulled back from artificially high levels by copper, although ALUMINIUM proved resilient, and continued its technical base-building above the Dollars 1,330-a-tonne level.

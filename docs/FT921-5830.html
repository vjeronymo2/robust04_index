			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (1): Growth, right kind only - Completion of the M40 has brought quiet market towns within reach of the motorway network. Ribbon development has been held back by recession, while the local authorities are trying to ensure that growth is not at the expense of the environment THE COMPLETION of the final 55-mile phase of M40 motorway from Oxford to Birmingham, just over a year ago, was meant to be the starting gun for a development spurt in North Oxfordshire. But with outline planning consent for this stretch given as long ago as 1969, plans for the area had been laid well in advance, and farmers and landowners had done their deals with property developers at meetings in the mid-1980s in the hotels of Banbury - the main town in the area. Planning consents were given for more than 300 acres of land along this newest corridor, enough, even if developed at a low density, for more than 1m sq ft of office, light industrial or warehousing space. Yet, the concern expressed that this part of the M40 might end up with the kind of ribbon development seen along sections of the M4, or that Banbury might be completely ringed by business parks, putting pressure on the social and transport infrastructure of the town centres has also proved unfounded. It has not turned out like that, so far at any rate, because of the recession. The take-up of land has been only a small percentage of that with permission. Roughly 300,000 sq ft of new industrial and commercial space has been developed, but only a quarter of this has been let or sold. Most of the new business parks and office space stand empty. The potential for development is definitely there. The completion of the M40 has meant that quiet market towns, such as Banbury, Bicester and Kidlington, are now plugged into the motorway network. They are close to two important airports, London's Heathrow and Birmingham International. They are also between two major universities, Oxford and Birmingham. In both cases there are research facilities for companies to lock into, as well as a supply of graduates, some of whom will want to look for work locally. When the economy improves, North Oxfordshire will have to compete with Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Northampton, and even Oxford for investment. Oxford is now beginning to emulate Cambridge by developing a science park for businesses. In terms of rent and wages, North Oxfordshire is competitive with these other locations. There is also a supply of labour and more is likely to come on to the market with the rundown of a US airbase in the area. It has good road and air communications, although the rail links with London could be improved. It also has the draw that other relocation towns seeking investment, such as Swindon, had in the early days of their expansion - an attractive countryside with pretty towns and villages where incoming executives and employees can live at reasonable cost. The recession has given Cherwell district council, the main local authority in the area, a respite to consider the kind of investment it wants and to make sure new developments are consistent with what can be comfortably absorbed. The case of Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages' proposed development in Banbury two and half years ago is still much on people's minds. Like an angler's one-that-got-away yarn, every businessman or local government official whom the visitor meets in the area has a slightly different variant of the story. Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages is a joint subsidiary of Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, which cans and distributes products from both companies. Two and a half years ago, it was interested in a 50-acre site on the outskirts of Banbury. It could have been a Pounds 100m investment, creating 1,000 jobs. In the end, the company decided to buy some land outside Northampton, the other location it examined. Mr Grahame Handley, the chief executive of Cherwell District Council, says: 'There were genuine environmental problems. There would have been 1,800 lorries a day. The plant would have used more water than all of Cherwell currently uses.' Villagers in Chacombe, to the north-east of Banbury, were worried that the prevailing winds might waft emissions from the plant. Planning permission was not given, and, while some business leaders feel that the episode showed an unwelcoming attitude to new investment, it has nevertheless concentrated minds locally on what kind of development is right for the area. Mr Handley says: 'Attitudes are changing. We have a marvellous opportunity to develop the area now that the M40 is open. But we want to develop it commensurate with what it can absorb. We are not looking for a 500,000 sq ft development employing thousands of people. The area is not structured like that. We want companies employing around a couple of hundred people and taking up 50,000 sq ft of office or factory space. He talks of developing a communications corridor, and says a start has already been made in attracting Talkland and Alcatel Network Systems. Talkland is involved in cellular communications and Alcatel sells telecommunications equipment. They plan to employ 240 and 80 workers respectively. Since he was appointed chief executive last April, he has set up an M40-Cherwell Investment partnership with local businesses to promote the area. He has involved the local North Oxfordshire college in training and has tried to move on other fronts to improve the infrastructure of Banbury, Bicester and Kidlington. His actions have won support from the local business community. 'North Oxfordshire now has an excellent opportunity of getting it right and developing. Otherwise, places like Banbury will remain quiet backwaters with ageing and increasingly dependent populations,' Mr John Bridgeman, managing director of British Alcan Enterprises, observes. He adds: 'Getting it right involves a more welcoming attitude to business and achieving a critical mass in the towns, in terms of transportation and housing and schools. I would like to see around 20 to 30 companies come into the area, employing between 200 and 300 people each.' This level of investment would mean about 10,000 new jobs. Banbury would grow to a population of 60-70,000 from its current 41,000, in line with Oxfordshire county's council structure plan, which has focused on Banbury and Bicester, along with Didcot and Witney, as growth points in the county. At this level the towns in North Oxfordshire would not become as large as Peterborough or Swindon. Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary and MP for Witney, has involved himself in the M40-Cherwell initiative. 'I don't think Banbury is going to become like the towns on the M4. It is not big enough. But it is important to take care over the kind of growth. It would be sad if Kidlington becomes absorbed by Oxford,' he says.</p>

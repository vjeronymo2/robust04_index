			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Isosceles may breach banking covenants ISOSCELES, the highly-indebted investment company which owns the Gateway supermarket group, is in negotiations with its banks because it expects to breach its banking covenants or clauses of its loan contracts. Bankers with a close knowledge of the group said yesterday that the company was planning to write to its banks next month outlining the breaches and explaining the group's long-term strategy, which is to prepare for a stock market flotation in 1994. It also emerged yesterday that Isosceles is not currently paying interest in cash on around Pounds 290m of mezzanine debt, which ranks behind the Pounds 760m of senior bank loans. Instead, this interest is being rolled up and will be paid in cash or shares, subject to negotiation, at a later date. However, bankers said that there had been no negotiations to obtain waivers of cash interest. Provision was made at the end of 1990 for mezzanine interest to be rolled up if the company were to perform worse than expected. There are two other reasons why Isosceles needs to amend its loan contracts: It wants to invest in its new store chains, Somerfield, Food Giant and some other experimental stores, in the hope that these will improve profitability and allow the company to be floated. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is already working on a flotation. Proceeds from the planned disposal of Herman's, the US chain of sports shops, are likely to be much less than the company hoped when its covenants were agreed three years ago. However, one banker stressed that Isosceles has to date made all interest and principal payments when they fell due. Nonetheless, the value of the company's equity may have fallen, according to some bankers, in view of the fact that the company has had to defer payment on the mezzanine interest. Nonetheless, in the latest accounts filed at Companies House by Newgateway, owner of 40 per cent of Isosceles's equity, no provision has been made for any fall in the value of the shares. Newgateway is owned by the US investment bank Wasserstein Perella and its investment clients. Isosceles does not need the consent of its banks - which include Industrial Bank of Japan, Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia, Chemical Bank of the US and Midland, Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered from the UK - to the covenant changes until later this year. Bankers said yesterday that discussions with the company would focus on its long term strategy. Badly-timed deal, Page 26</p>

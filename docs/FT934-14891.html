			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Capel team defects to Morgan Grenfell MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has recruited about 20 equity traders, analysts and sales staff from rival James Capel to beef up its developing country debt and bond operations. The mass hirings boost Morgan Grenfell's emerging markets headcount by roughly 20 per cent to about 120 and are a testimony to the growing importance of emerging market investments. The new team gives Morgan Grenfell an entree into the vibrant emerging market equity business. The departures, which started a couple of weeks ago, have cut a swathe through Capel's emerging markets operations in London and New York, more than halving the staff on the trading, sales and research side. Capel said 18 staff from offices in London, New York, Mexico, and Hong Kong - mostly covering Latin American equities - had formally quit. The company, which is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, has shifted staff from its international equities operations to plug the gaps and plans to 're-orient the focus of the team towards Asia' where it claims a competitive advantage through its parent. Morgan Grenfell expects the new recruits, who include Mr Jonathan Binder, head of emerging markets sales in New York and a former Morgan Grenfell employee, and Mr Mark Donegan, head of the sales force in London, to join by the beginning of December. The two are bringing most of their sales teams with them. Morgan Grenfell indicated that recruitment was still going on. Mr Rick Haller, head of Morgan Grenfell's emerging markets operations, said: 'We are one of the top three traders worldwide of emerging market debt.' According to one estimate, Morgan Grenfell turns over Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) of debt and bonds a month. But its operations have until now lacked muscle on the equity side. Increasingly, those international investors interested in emerging markets want to buy both debt and equities for their portfolios. 'What you are finding in the emerging markets is that if an institution likes the country story they buy everything,' said one specialist at Morgan Grenfell. The UK merchant bank, which trades on its own account as well as for clients in emerging market debt, said two Latin American funds had shot up in value since their launch last year.</p>

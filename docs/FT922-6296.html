			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Manila soars on renewal of confidence - The market has hit record levels following the peaceful elections The Philippines has been struck by a renewal of economic optimism following the recent, largely peaceful presidential election campaign. Hopes of economic recovery have boosted sentiment among investors and led to the stock market recording consecutive record levels over the past few days. Yesterday the composite index closed up 3.8 per cent at an all-time high of 1,432. Investor optimism was encouraged by the fact the election took place without scenes of violence or widespread electoral fraud which had characterised previous polls, some analysts said. Now, after several years of constant coup threats, the prospect of a peaceful transfer of power has encouraged the business community to dust off investment plans which had been shelved. The new president will be known in two or three weeks after an official counting of the votes by Congress. However, an unofficial tabulation shows Mr Fidel Ramos, the administration-backed candidate, leading by a margin of more than 1m votes. The general sentiment in the business community is that Mr Ramos, a former defence secretary, is capable to providing the firm leadership that will inject much-needed stability into government. He is expected to follow mainly pro-business policy directions. Independent economists are projecting that the economy could grow by up to 3 per cent this year, after zero growth last year. Interest rates, already down from early-1991 highs, are seen declining further, a result mainly of tight control on government spending during the election campaign period. Yields on Treasury bills now hover around 15 per cent, compared to 20 per cent in January. The exchange rate continues to be stable, in spite of calls from exporters for the monetary authorities to allow a slight drop. These factors have lured new money into the stock market. In the week following the election, turnover on the Manila and Makati exchanges averaged 310m pesos a day compared with an average daily turnover of 155m pesos a day throughout 1991. Brokers say that the bulk of the trading is accounted for by local investors. This is still in step with trends in previous years when foreign funds were only attracted after seeing turnover expand with local interest. Anscor Hagedorn Securities told its clients last week that the election could lead to 'some funds being shifted from the region and into the Philippines'. The brokerage house said that this was due to the recent political turmoil in Thailand and the 'political transition' in Indonesia where elections are due next month. The best performer among the most active issues since election day has been Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which has shown considerable strength in New York where it is also listed. PLDT is currently trading at an all-time high of 1,120 pesos, for a ratio of 10.2 times its projected 1992 earnings. Its prevailing price also represents an increase of 33 per cent from its level at the start of the year. Analysts forecast PLDT profits to rise by only about 5-6 per cent in the current year, compared to 48 per cent in 1991. The big capital requirements of its expansion programme could lead to the entry of foreign equity from American Telephone and Telegraph, which has been rumoured since last year. Some of the traditional market favourites, such as Ayala Corporation and its property subsidiary Ayala Land, San Miguel Corp, and Philippine National Bank, have posted 'modest' increases so far. This has prompted analysts to tick them off as top candidates for a new market takeoff. Meanwhile, the proposed merger of the Manila and Makati stock exchanges continues. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been trying to forge a merger of the two exchanges since 1990 but little progress has been made owing to differences in culture between the institutions. A merger, nonetheless, is widely viewed as a major step in promoting further development of the local capital market. Foreign financial assistance, particularly from the Asian Development Bank, is being made available for the unification if it goes ahead.</p>

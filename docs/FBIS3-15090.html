The report says that the prosecutor-general's office has not  investigated up to the end "circumstances connected with moral  damage which should be reimbursed at the expense of the guilty  parties according to operating legislation.    "it is also necessary to complete investigation against  people who, employing the situation in Moscow which developed  between September 21 and October 4, 1993, committed robberies,  violence, acts of aggravated hooliganism and other law-breaking  activities".    The prosecutor-general's office set up a commission to  organise investigation into the case of October disorders.  Results of its work will be reported later.    The prosecutor-general's office states at the same time that  if pardoned people will again commit law violations, the office  will use all its powers against law-breakers.</p>

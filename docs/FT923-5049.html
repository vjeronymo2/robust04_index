			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Analyst opts for room with a view THE woodland of the Scottish borders is the vista that greets City investment analyst Tessa Tennant at her desk. It is worlds away from London's Knightsbridge where, until January last year, Ms Tennant, 33, was based as head of environmental research at Jupiter Tyndall Merlin (JTM), the investment management arm of Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group. Today she does the same job but works three out of every four weeks from her home near Peebles. In her office, once the house library, antique furnishing rubs shoulders with modern equipment. Ms Tennant is a telecommuter. She said the trial arrangement, which ends this month, had benefited both herself and her employer. This year she was made a director. Ms Tennant has worked for JTM for more than four years. About three years ago she began managing Glen, the large estate and conference centre which is her home. She also needed to spend more time with her nine-year-old son, Euan. Ms Tennant said: 'Much of the JTM work I do is research and involves a lot of writing and reading. It is a job that can be done anywhere provided you have a personal computer, fax and telephone. 'At the office you are too available - people are always popping in for ad hoc meetings or chats. Many analysts find it quite difficult to sit down and do research.' Ms Tennant's working day starts when she takes her son to school. She then knuckles down to work either for JTM or the conference centre. The day ends in the late afternoon. She does not usually need to work until five. 'I can easily return to my desk late in the evening.' Mr Michael Heathcoat Amory, managing director of JTM, said: 'The arrangement has worked perfectly satisfactorily.' He stressed, however, the importance of Ms Tennant's monthly visits to London because of the need for personal contact. Ms Tennant said that the support of colleagues had been important to the experiment's success. 'I have a very close working relationship with the team in London. I have discovered that it is possible to function as a team even if you are not all in the same room. It is a question of not letting team-mates down.'</p>

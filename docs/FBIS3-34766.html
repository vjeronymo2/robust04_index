At the conclusion of meetings held resulting in a "joint  program" between them, Fatah and the PPP decided to form "field  coordination committees to pursue joint cooperation and act as  joint authorities working for the development of relations,  cooperation, and settlement of any problems which might arise."  The first such committee will be in Jerusalem, the second in  Gaza, and the third in Tunis.    The latest edition of the Fatah bulletin issued by Fatah's  Central Committee in Tunis said that the cooperation program  with the PPP is in the context of the "dialogue with the vital  and effective forces to consolidate national unity, contain  attempts to impose division and fragmentation, and close the  door in the face of the advocates of sedition and infighting."  It likened it to the agreement concluded "between the cadres of  Fatah and the Hamas fighters" which had a good effect in  preventing sedition and in providing more scope for dialogue and  democracy which respects the right to disagree.    The 11-point cooperation program, the text of which it  published, stressed that the Declaration of Principles "is an  instrument of struggle to which we respond to the degree it  helps in the implementation of all parts and provisions of  Security Council Resolution 242 in a manner that would ensure  full withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories."    Fatah and the PPP emphasized that the Palestinian National  Authority approved by the Palestine Central Council in its  session last October should be considered as the authority  "responsible for all aspects of the Palestinian people's life in  the areas from which the occupation forces withdraw...and its  powers should be extended to include the rest of the West Bank  including Jerusalem."    The two sides said that the criteria of the economic  negotiating plan should be based "on economic independence,  self-reliance, and Arab integration, and that progress in these  negotiations should be made conditional on progress in the  political negotiations."    Fatah and the PPP underscored the "democratic nature of the  Palestinian National Authority and its respect for human rights,  plurality, and the principle of free democratic elections as the  basis of legislative and executive authority resulting from  political and legislative general elections."</p>

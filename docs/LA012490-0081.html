			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO DESIGNATE L.A. AS MAJOR DRUG CENTER;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: BUSH TO NAME 5 HIGH-INTENSITY TRAFFICKING AREAS THURSDAY. THEY WILL  GET EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDS.  </P> <P> A new domestic drug control strategy to be announced by President Bush Thursday  will designate Los Angeles County, Houston, Miami, New York and the  U.S.-Mexican border as high-intensity drug trafficking centers eligible for  special aid, according to Administration and congressional officials.  </P> <P> The designation of high-intensity regions, including the border area from San  Diego to Brownsville, Tex., is one element of the Administration's drug control  plan.  </P> <P> Other elements of the plan, which Bush is expected to announce in a White House  ceremony, are likely to include a new call for widened death penalty provisions  for drug dealers and new rules that will allow Customs agents to assume the law  enforcement powers of Drug Enforcement Administration agents.  </P> <P> But the high-intensity designations are likely to attract the greatest  attention. Such designations have been under consideration within the  Administration since drug czar William J. Bennett took office last year.  </P> <P> However, actually picking the areas to be named has been difficult, in part  because of intense lobbying by local officials from around the country eager to  obtain the designation and the extra law enforcement funds they expect to come  with it.  </P> <P> Bennett and his aides have been trying to downplay the significance of the  designations. "It's not an honorarium or an award," Bennett has told officials  in meetings around the country.  </P> <P> And Administration officials point out that, at least for this year, the  designations will carry only limited amounts of additional money -- roughly $25  million spread among all five areas over the next nine months.  </P> <P> "We're trying to lower expectations," one official said. "There's not a lot  there. When you spread it over five areas, $25 million doesn't go too far."  </P> <P> By comparison, the official noted, various government entities in Los Angeles  County estimate that the drug problem costs the area roughly $2 billion  annually, increasing budgets for everything from police to prisons to treatment  centers and education programs.  </P> <P> However, in addition to the $25 million immediately available, the federal drug  control strategy envisions a substantial increase over the next two years in  the number of federal prosecutors and drug agents assigned to the five  designated regions. The result will be "a much higher percentage of federal  resources for these areas," said one source familiar with the strategy.  </P> <P> Because the jurisdiction of the federal agencies spills across local  boundaries, regions surrounding the designated areas are also likely to  benefit.  </P> <P> For example, when the government formally designates Los Angeles County as a  high-intensity drug area, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles will  receive additional prosecutors. But those prosecutors will be free to work on  drug cases from throughout the federal Central District of California, which  includes Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Santa  Luis Obispo counties in addition to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> San Diego and Imperial counties will be designated as part of the Southwest  border high-intensity region.  </P> <P> Last year, Congress directed the Administration to consider six criteria in  deciding which areas to designate. Included were the amount of local resources  spent on drug control, the seriousness of each area's drug problem and the  degree to which each area's drug problem has an impact on other parts of the  country.  </P> <P> Officials have not decided how to divide the money among the five areas.  Federal authorities plan to meet with state and local officials after the  designations are made to work out a plan for using the added resources.  </P> <P> The anti-drug strategy includes several elements designed to reduce  bureaucratic confusion in drug enforcement. One such provision involves the  powers of Customs agents. Originally, Customs officials had wanted all of their  roughly 2,600 agents to be given the full powers of a Drug Enforcement  Administration agent. After DEA objections, Bennett developed a compromise  under which 1,000 Customs agents will be "cross-designated." DEA will have some  supervisory authority, but not "heavy-handed DEA controls," the source said.  </P> <P> Currently, only about 190 Customs agents are cross-designated to handle the  drug laws.  </P> <P> The anti-drug strategy provides also for a national drug intelligence center to  be housed at the Justice Department -- to end what critics view as the  haphazard collection and ineffective processing of drug intelligence by various  federal agencies now.  </P> <P> Under the strategy, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, an arm of the Justice  Department that channels funds to state and local law enforcement agencies for  experimental and innovative programs, will receive a sharp budget increase to  fund such efforts in the drug field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPENDING ON DRUG CONTROL  </P> <P> Los Angeles County alone annually spends $1.4 billion on drug control efforts.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Frederick Winslow Taylor Engineer, inventor, consultant and tennis champion, Taylor gave his name to what was probably the first true international management movement. Many of the Philadelphia Quaker's ideas on productivity and the organisation of work have been discredited since his death in 1917. But the influence of Taylorism can still be felt in modern management theories, not least the currently fashionable business process re-engineering. Taylor was obsessed by efficiency and measurement and set out to prove scientifically that a machinist, for example, could produce a specific quantity of output in a given time. At Midvale Steel Works - where he became chief engineer in the 1880s - the jobs of foremen were redefined and a set of clear procedures established for certain jobs. Stop watches were distributed to the foremen as Taylor attempted to break down the work into its component parts (an essential feature of latter day BPR). In Principles of Scientific Management (1911) - a book based largely on his experiences at Midvale and later at Bethlehem Steel and the most quoted source of his ideas - Taylor argued that scientific methods should replace the old rule of thumb ways in which workers operated; that workers should be scientifically selected to be 'first class' at a particular task; and that work should be equally divided between workers and management. Taylor was also one of the first to develop the idea of payment by results, introducing differential piece rates and achieving significant cost reductions in the process. As John Mapes, senior lecturer in Operations Management at Cranfield School of Management, points out, however, this part of the legacy is less appreciated today. 'Taylor put the emphasis on output rather than quality.' Taylor's 'top down' thinking and tendency to think of employees mainly as pairs of hands are also out of favour. He was never flavour of the month with the trade unions, one of whose US leaders claimed that 'no tyrant or slave-driver in the ecstasy of his most delirious dream ever sought to place upon abject slaves a condition more repugnant'. Lyndall Urwick - an army officer who read Principles in the first world war trenches and was inspired to found a movement for scientific management  - remarked that the strength of the union movement prevented Taylorism from being fully implemented in Britain. Historians like Peter Drucker maintain Taylor started out with well-intentioned social rather than engineering or profit motives, and improving workers' living standards was one of his central aims. Taylor's talents were undeniable. He was a prolific inventor, taking out over 100 patents for ideas. He won the US tennis doubles championship in 1881 and succeeded in getting the rules of baseball changed by proving that over-arm bowling was more effective than under-arm. This is the first of a new series.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Toyo buys ICI inks business TOYO of Japan has bought ICI's France-based printing inks business, Francolor Pigments, writes Daniel Green. The size of the deal has not been revealed, but the turnover of the company is Pounds 30m (Dollars 45m) a year. Toyo is among the biggest seven ink makers in the world, with half the Japanese offset printing ink market. The move leaves ICI with no printing inks business in its portfolio and strengthens the presence of Japanese manufacturers in western Europe. The unit has 200 employees and was part of ICI's giant Francolor subsidiary, a French dyes specialist.</p>

The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which  set  the submission as a condition to start deliberations of the  fiscal 1994 state budget at the House of Representatives budget  committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the  budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet  sources said.    Chiefs of the Diet affairs committee from the coalition  parties and the LDP met in the afternoon in order to reach  agreement on the opening of debate on the 73.08 trillion yen  budget. The negotiations, however, broke off after Hosokawa  rejected the LDP demand, the sources said.    The LDP decided not to attend Wednesday's scheduled meeting  of senior members of the budget committee, which will discuss a  timetable to deliberate the national budget for fiscal 1994 that  starts April 1, LDP officials said.    The government last Friday submitted to the panel documents  relating to the loan but the LDP and the Japanese Communist  Party (JCP) were not satisfied, saying the submissions were  insufficient, and renewed their demands that the government  offer further detailed materials.    Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto  Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, and fully repaid the  money nine years later.    The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob  scandal which forced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign in  disgrace in 1992.    Hosokawa maintains he repaid the money by January 31, 1991,  using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor.  But the LDP argues that Hosokawa could not have received the  retirement allowance before finishing his second term as  governor in February 1991.</p>

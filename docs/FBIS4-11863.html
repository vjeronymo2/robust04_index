			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of telephone interview from Jericho with Sa'ib </F> 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks  with Israel and chairman of the Palestinian election committee,  by Radio Monte Carlo correspondent Salim Badawi, date not given;  from the weekly "The Event" program--recorded]    [Text] [Badawi] How do you view the Hebron agreement and  the importance of its achievements on the Palestinian question?    ['Urayqat] In fact the problem lies with the settler hotbeds  in the heart of Hebron. Therefore, and as you have noticed from  the beginning, the Palestinian side has always insisted that the  settlements be removed from the heart of the town. This did not  happen. Therefore, and regrettably, the problem will not be  solved, and protection for the Palestinian people cannot be  realized unless the settlers are evacuated from Hebron.    Yet, we will not try to belittle the fact that a paragraph  in  the UN resolution concerning the existence of an international  presence has been implemented. We do not want this  international presence to be a means of beautification, a means  of face-saving. What is required is real protection for the  Palestinian people.    As we notice in the agreement, the powers of these  [observer]  forces are really very limited and will leave things in one way  or another in the hands of the Israeli Army, which provides  protection for the settlers and which has been unable to protect  the Arabs. In fact, the Israeli Army has participated in  massacres of Palestinians. I am afraid that the real aim of the  UN Security Council Resolution No. 904 on protecting the  Palestinian people; the real aim of our call for the past 27  years to realize international presence, is not in fact  practically intended to realize the aim of providing real  protection for the Palestinian people.    [Badawi] Here we must point out that the agreement  stipulated  the presence of an international team only in the city of Hebron  whereas Resolution 904 stipulates international presence in all  parts of the occupied territories. Therefore, what you say is  in agreement with what the PLO has said; that the security  agreement is a first step toward implementing the resolution?  Do you expect other steps to follow?    ['Urayqat] As I said, the international protection is in  accordance with the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, especially  concerning civilians in times of war. The agreement did not  even allude to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel continues  to reject this convention. Therefore, naturally what is  required is protection for the Palestinian people all over the  Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.    The issue is not related to the presence and the size of  this  presence. It is related to the powers and substance of this  presence. As we have seen, the agreement is a step but will not  meet any requirements. For instance, let us take these settlers  in Hebron, the Kakh group. These people loudly claim that they  intend to force the Arab inhabitants off their land. They will  not stop at anything. I will not be surprised if a number of  these settlers attack these Norwegian, Italian, and Danish  forces and kill three or four. Then public opinion in Italy,  Denmark, and Norway will rise and demand that their forces  leave. Giving the power to the Israeli Government is in itself  stripping the international protection of any substantive power  to take practical measures.    We have never sought to safe face at any time. We are  seeking international protection for our people because there  are real dangers threatening the lives of 2 million Palestinians.    [Badawi] So, Dr. 'Urayqat, based on the agreement, how can  the international team's presence contribute to entrenching the  aspired stability as long as the observers' mission is neither  military nor one of security?    ['Urayqat] Frankly speaking, there will be no stability as  long as the roots of the problem still exist. The cause of this  problem is the existence of settlements. I believe that without  evacuating settlers from the heart of Hebron, as a first step,  and consequently putting the issue of settlements on the  negotiations agenda, we will not achieve the aspired objective.  Settlements are time bombs and mines that could explode at  anytime. We should wait and see when another bomb will explode  in a church, a mosque, a farm, or a university. What is really  required is to provide true protection of the Palestinian people  based on the Fourth Geneva Convention, and not procedural issues  through which these forces' mission will be emptied of any  meaning.    [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, before we continue talking about the  security agreement on Hebron, I would like you to listen with me  to the position of the Palestinian opposition inside the  occupied territories toward this agreement. This position was  expressed earlier to "The Event" program by Riyad al-Maliki,  official spokesman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP] in the occupied territories:    [Al-Maliki] Certainly, the agreement has come to abrogate UN  Security Council Resolution 904 on the Hebron massacre and the  need for the presence of international forces to protect the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories. The agreement  on dispatching international observers greatly undermines  Resolution 904. It seems that the PLO has contributed, together  with Israel, to dealing a blow to that resolution, and decided  not to comply with this resolution. The PLO is greatly  responsible for this. We are talking about 160 international  observers who cannot protect our people in Hebron. As Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today said that 60 of them will  be observers and 100 will help the municipality execute the  development and economic projects. This means that there will  be no international security presence. The issue of security in  Hebron does not exist at all. We know full well that the  agreement does not tackle the basic conditions the PLO has set,  following the Hebron massacre, for going back to the negotiating  table. Among these conditions are the evacuation of settlers  from Hebron, disarming settlers, and using a Palestinian police  force. What the PLO got is less than what is required. This  conflicts completely with our masses' needs in Hebron and the  rest of the occupied territories. We know that 'Arafat has  tried to exploit the massacre to arrange his affairs in Hebron  at the expense of the forces which reject the agreement. It is  clear that he has formed a council for the Hebron Governorate  instead of the emergency council on which all the functionaries  in the city agreed. He has also formed an investigation  committee in parallel with that formed by the awqaf committee in  Hebron. He also nominated Mustafa 'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah to  entrench his powers there, taking into consideration that the  Palestinian masses in Hebron call for honest and free democratic  elections to elect a municipal council after the last formation  which took place in 1976. In other words, 18 years after this  issue. We know that the negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho  agreement began yesterday after the signing of an agreement.  This is the pretext 'Arafat was looking for. It is an excuse  which is even worse than the offense for which it was offered.  'Arafat believes that he can convince our people in the  occupied territories on this issue. 'Arafat's credibility has  sunk to a new low. He has also lost his legitimacy. Neither  'Arafat, nor his policy has any credibility in the occupied  territories as a result of this latest agreement.    [Badawi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, we have just listened to the  opinion of Riyad al-Maliki, official PFLP spokesman in the  occupied territories. In his opinion, the agreement undermines  the UN resolution. So, you agree with him on this. According  to Riyad al-Maliki, the agreement does not tackle the basic  conditions the PLO has set following the Hebron massacre.  However, Dr. 'Urayqat, despite this, you have returned to the  negotiating table.    ['Urayqat] In the final analysis, I don't think we are  talking about who is for or against the agreement. Objectively  speaking, the agreement does not provide the required  protection. But to single out 'Arafat, or any other Palestinian  circle, for blame does not make sense. We should now direct all  our energies to securing protection for the Palestinian people.  As brother Riyad al-Maliki and others know, a committee was  formed by President 'Arafat months ago to prepare elections for  the Hebron municipal council and the local government. These  elections will take place. We are on the verge of signing an  accord with the European Union with the participation of another  22 countries to join this program. A town council will be  elected in accordance with the existing law, and that is the  Jordanian law, in line with the Geneva Convention.    The laws that were in force before 1967, before the  occupation, are supposed to apply. Municipal committees must be  named for a limited period of time ahead of these elections.  However, we must also bear in mind that, as a Palestinian side,  we are trying to bring about the best possible conditions for  the Palestinian people. As far as the other side is concerned,  we are coming up against Israeli intransigence and  procrastination. We are also dealing with a U.S. Administration  totally biased toward Israel. If we are to apportion blame, it  must be directed at the Israeli Government, which is responsible  for the massacres and the absence of security. Fundamentally,  negotiations must bring about an end to occupation. In every  step we take, we must act objectively and dispassionately. We  should not be distracted from the real problem, and that is  occupation, and as brother Riyad has indicated, we should not be  looking for scapegoats to explain away our problems.    [Badawi] But it remains the case that the PLO has  backtracked on two fundamental demands. First, the evacuation  of 400 settlers from the heart of Hebron. Second, the  deployment of a Palestinian police force in the city.    ['Urayqat] The stationing of Palestinian forces while Israel  still maintains a presence is absolutely rejected. This does  not amount to a retreat. To bring in Palestinian police or  security forces to take orders from Israeli forces is just  illogical. It was right that this issue was not brought up to  begin with. There is no retreat here. According to the Oslo  agreement, the Palestinian security forces will be responsible  for public order in any of the areas vacated by the Israeli  forces. To introduce Palestinian forces when the Israeli  military and occupation are still there is unacceptable. Our  rejection does not represent a retreat. As for the first point,  let me repeat with all objectivity, this accord insofar as  international protection is concerned, falls short of our  target. Only by the settlers pulling out from the heart of  Hebron will our target have been reached. This is because they  are at the root of the problem. A disease is cured not by  addressing its symptoms but rather by tackling its roots.    [Badawi] What about the disarming of the settlers?  Resolution 904 provided, among other things, for disarming the  settlers. But the agreement made no reference to that.    ['Urayqat] That was a point that we raised from the start.  But, in actual fact, every settler is a reservist in the Israeli  Army. If he is not disarmed as a settler, will he be disarmed  as a reservist in the Israeli military? When the criminal  Goldstein committed his terrorist act at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque,  he was wearing a military uniform of a reserve captain in the  Israeli military. Let us be honest. We are not just after  disarming the settlers while they remain in their places. They  are reserve soldiers as well. What is required is to evacuate  the settlers and disband the settlements in the hearts of such  cities as Hebron, Gaza, and Nabulus, and then place the  settlement issue at the top of the agenda of any negotiations.  Without the settlement issue being the first item on an agenda,  any negotiations will be pointless.    [Badawi] Why do you think Yitzhaq Rabin decided not to  evacuate the settlers even though eight out of 15 members of the  Israeli Government supported such a move?    ['Urayqat] I do not think Rabin is a decisive person. He  has failed to be bound by what he signed in Oslo or what Israeli  negotiators signed in other places. Therefore, I consider Rabin  to be wholly responsible for the way the peace process has  evolved. I think that the peace process is headed for collapse.  The U.S. Administration, which has conducted itself according  to a damage control and crisis management mentality with a view  to lifting Israel from crisis, and in the meantime brushing  aside the true requirements for making peace, must share the  responsibility.    [Badawi] According to the agreement, the negotiations  should be intensified to make up for the wasted time. How will  this be translated into actions?    ['Urayqat] The question is very realistic. The negotiations  are not an objective. Emphasis should be on the contents of the  negotiations. As I said, after the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, it became clear, practical, and logical that no  negotiations should take place unless the subject of settlements  is on top of their agenda, because the peace process, as the  letter of invitation to Madrid and the Oslo agreement stipulate,  call for ending the occupation, which means the principle of  land for peace in accordance with Resolution 242 and not  reorganizing occupation as Rabin is trying to do. Occupation is  a model that failed after 26.5 years. We have to be aware that  what Rabin is trying to do now is just an attempt to reorganize  the occupation, and not to end the occupation.    [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, the United States expects substantial  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho before the end of this  April. Is this in line with the call for respecting the date of  13 April? Is it possible to expect completing the Israeli  withdrawal before 13 April as the Declaration of Principles  agreement stipualtes?    ['Urayqat] As I said, the agreement is clear. Its points are  coherent although all its articles lack mechanisms for  implementation. Despite much talk about peace and withdrawal,  Rabin has never been committed to any date on which there had  been agreement. I do not think that he is going to be committed  to the date of withdrawals as decided by the agreement. Even if  we speak about withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, there are many  issues that should simultaneously take place.    [Badawi] For example?    ['Urayqat] Withdrawal should be withdrawal and not  redeployment. The agreement called for redeployment in the rest  of the West Bank and not in Gaza and Jericho. If the  settlements remain in these areas with Israeli presence, I  believe this will not be a withdrawal. I also believe that the  U.S. Administration, which failed to take a just stand due to  its intransigence, full bias, and blind policy in favor of  Israel, is using the peace process just for public relations  purposes, nothing more.    [Badawi] Then the subject of withdrawal is still unresolved  concerning some...    ['Urayqat interrupting] It is unresolved concerning many  points, especially security issues.    [Badawi] Between 100 and 120 officers of the Palestine  Liberation Army will arrive in Gaza Strip early next week as the  first unit of the Palestinian police. When will their mission  begin on the ground?    ['Urayqat] In fact, I do not know many details about this  subject. All I can say is that the entry of any forces should  be accompanied by a timetable and procedures that should be  taken. Until now, I do not have any information on how these  forces will enter or their tasks--whether these forces will be  the vanguards which will arrange the situation or which will  prepare for the entry of other forces. I cannot go into detail  on this subject because I lack complete information.    [Badawi] Dr. 'Urayqat, a question to you as head of the  Palestinian elections committee. According to the agreement  that was signed, negotiations are to be held soon on the  transfer of power from the Israelis to the Palestinian  authority, that in turn, will take care of elections expected in  the occupied territories next July. Can this subject be amended  or delayed?    ['Urayqat] In fact, there was a Palestinian and presidential  decision on 20 November concerning the formation of the  elections and local government committee which I chair. The  Israeli procrastination, and its failure to abide by the set  timetable signed in Washington means that it is practically  impossible to have the elections on 13 July. International  groups worked with us last month. A timetable was approved on  general elections, and it sets a 15 October 1993 date [as heard]  because the electoral process does not take place immediately  after a political agreement is signed by leaders. It is a  tiring and long process. It requires training, preparations, a  census. It also requires sending many people abroad for  training. These people then come back to train others.  Therefore, the realistic date for the general political  elections was set for next 15 October.    [Badawi] My final question is on the resumption of bilateral  negotiations in Washington. Will you head the Palestinian  delegation to the U.S. capital?    ['Urayqat] I do not know yet if my tasks within the  elections  committee will allow me to go or not.    [Badawi] Will the Palestinian delegation be present in the  bilateral negotiations hall?    ['Urayqat] The decision is left to the Palestinian  leadership  and not me.    [Badawi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat.</p>

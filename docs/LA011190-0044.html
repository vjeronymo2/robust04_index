			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: PANCAKES WITH A WHIFF OF GINGER  </P> <P> With the ending of the holidays, there are a few flavors we usually forsake  until the season rolls around again. Ginger, for one, having been liberally  tossed into treats, often goes the way of the stockings and the tree.  </P> <P> But not for me. Ginger is a flavor I will savor well into this next year. These  tasty pancakes are adapted from Linda Merinoff's cookbook "Gingerbread"  (Fireside). Mix the batter early, refrigerate it while you do other things and  it will be ready for the griddle by the time you are ready.  </P> <P> GINGER PANCAKES  </P> <P> 3/4 cup milk  </P> <P> 1 egg plus 1 egg white  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons molasses  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup sifted unbleached all-purpose flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, melted and slightly cooled  </P> <P> Butter or margarine  </P> <P> Maple syrup, jam or preserves  </P> <P> Whisk together milk, egg, egg white, molasses, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt and  baking powder. Fold in flour just until moistened, then stir in melted butter.  Refrigerate overnight.  </P> <P> Heat nonstick or lightly greased griddle or skillet over medium heat. For each  pancake, drop 2 tablespoons batter, 1 on top of other.  </P> <P> As soon as batter rises and small bubbles appear on surface, flip over with  spatula. Cook 1 to 2 minutes on other side, until lightly browned. Repeat with  remaining batter.  </P> <P> Serve buttered, with maple syrup, jam or preserves. Makes 8 pancakes.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT, A TIME TO GIVE OUR THANKS;  </P> <P> COLD WAR: WE HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED AS INEPT DIPLOMATS, ROGUES, IMPERIALISTS, BUT  U.S. STEADFASTNESS BROUGHT PEACE.  </P> <P> For more than 40 years the United States has waged the Cold War, despite  ceaseless deprecation from many who benefited from American sacrifices without  ever pausing to say thanks.  </P> <P> Sophisticated Europeans such as Gen. Charles de Gaulle made us out to be  reckless one minute and faithless the next. Through the decades we have been  portrayed as inept diplomats, trigger-happy rogues, imperialists and, in the  1980s, cowboys -- Hollywood cowboys, not even real cowboys! Now Chancellor  Helmut Kohl of West Germany has expressed his gratitude, a wondrously  appropriate sentiment. We who may now enjoy the benefits of peace should be  grateful to many veterans of the Cold War, many of whom were Europeans and even  Soviets.  </P> <P> There are the writers who braved abuse and poverty by exposing the brutal  nature of communism. When Malcolm Muggeridge returned to Britain from Russia in  the 1930s to refute such celebrated defenders of Stalin as the playwright  George Bernard Shaw, Muggeridge lost his job, leaving his wife and four  children on hard times.  </P> <P> George Orwell was not accorded a much friendlier reception for blowing the  whistle on the communists in the Spanish Civil War and for satirizing communist  totalitarianism. Let us also express thanks to Arthur Koestler, whose "Darkness  at Noon" exposed Stalin's show trials, and to Whittaker Chambers, who in  "Witness" exposed communism's versatile evil and who died in despair for the  West.  </P> <P> And let us give thanks for the Cold Warriors themselves, beginning with Winston  Churchill, who had the grit to notify the world in his March 5, 1946, speech in  Fulton, Mo., of the Iron Curtain drawn across Europe and of the dangers ahead.  </P> <P> Let us be grateful for America's greatest secretary of state, Dean Acheson,  whose diplomatic career was crucial to the establishment of the Truman  Doctrine, Point Four, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the end of the Berlin air lift  and the pursuit of the Korean War. Let us be grateful for Presidents Harry  Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, who kept the United States on an  internationalist course. The academic treatise of George Kennan gave the United  States a scheme for pursuing the East-West conflict, namely: "containment." And  a remarkable collection of American diplomats implemented the policy.  </P> <P> Through the years every President, from John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon, paid  an onerous price for waging the Cold War. In the 1980s Ronald Reagan faced the  renewed challenge of Leonid Brezhnev and his successors and demonstrated that  an arms race is a race the United States could and would win. If there was one  politician who brought the Cold War to an end, it was Reagan. And if there was  one writer to rouse the West to a final awareness of the horrors behind the  Iron Curtain, it was Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose pitiless "One Day in the  Life of Ivan Denisovich" began the tolling of the bell on Marxism.  </P> <P> But of course no one person can be cited for bringing to an end so epic a  conflict. Millions deserve gratitude. For instance: the voters who supported  the aforementioned leaders and paid the bills; the intelligence agents and  military personnel; the dissidents behind the Iron Curtain countries, many  still incarcerated; and even the Communist leaders who now seem to realize that  their opposites in the West only want peace and prosperity for all.  </P></p>

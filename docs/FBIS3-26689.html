			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 9 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Lu Ping,  director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, wishes Hong Kong and Macao compatriots a happy new year  on behalf of his office in a signed article carried here by  today's RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION.    Lu Ping says: The Chinese observe a very good tradition:  They always greet and give each other best wishes during the  spring festival. On the eve of this festive occasion, on behalf  of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, I would like  to say Happy New Year to all Hong Kong and Macao compatriots,  and may the new year bring joy and good fortune to you and your  families, and may everything come your way.    Lu Ping says: In the past year, to ensure a smooth  transition in 1997 for Hong Kong and to ensure its economic  prosperity, the Chinese Government showed deep sincerity in  important issues such as the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95  electoral arrangements and the financial arrangements for Hong  Kong's new airport, making enormous efforts to solve the  problems. Our objective was to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity  and stability through cooperation with Britain. Regrettably,  Britain disregarded the Chinese Government's sincerity, the  wishes of the Hong Kong compatriots, and Hong Kong's need for a  stable transition, by flagrantly and unilaterally halting the  negotiations, adopting a confrontational attitude toward China,  and creating obstacles to a smooth transition for Hong Kong,  thereby indicating the colonialists' reluctance to retreat from  the historical arena in peace.    Lu Ping says: To abide by the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, safeguard the long-term interests of Hong Kong  society, and ensure that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] will be implemented after 1 July  1997, the Chinese Government in 1993 increased the pace of  preparations for restoring China's sovereignty over Hong Kong,  set up a Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory  Committee for the Hong Kong SAR under the National People's  Congress, marshaled all forces from different quarters in Hong  Kong, and mobilized every positive factor, in a joint effort to  safeguard a smooth transition for Hong Kong. On the economic  front, meanwhile, deepening reforms on the mainland enabled Hong  Kong to escape the impact of economic recession in the West and  to continue its strong momentum of growth. There was  considerable growth in Hong Kong's economy, finance, trade, and  shipping in 1993. The Hong Kong and mainland economies promoted  and supplemented each other. The development of the mainland's  economy will be increasingly critical for Hong Kong's  prosperity. Hong Kong compatriots can be assured that whatever  happens, we will stand together through thick and thin, and will  be united in mind and heart with Hong Kong in upholding the  policy of "one country, two systems," implementing the Basic  Law, and achieving a smooth transition in Hong Kong.    Lu Ping said that the deliberation, adoption, and  promulgation in 1993 of the Basic Law of the Macao Special  Administrative Region by the National People's Congress provides  a fundamental guarantee for Macao's smooth transition and  political handover, and for long-term stability and development  after 1999. To implement the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration  and ensure Macao's smooth transition, China and Portugal will  continue friendly cooperation. In 1993, through the joint  efforts of people from various quarters, Macao enjoyed social  stability, as well as sustained and steady economic development.  Its large-scale projects, such as the international airport,  progressed well. Of course, work on Macao's transition still  requires further cooperation between China and Portugal. The  pace of work must be increased. Macao's economy also needs to  adopt appropriate measures to solve the problem of industrial  transformation and to promote growth. We believe that as long  as China and Portugal continue to strengthen friendly  cooperation on the basis of the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Declaration, and as long as people of all quarters are further  united in mind and action, there certainly will be a better  tomorrow for Macao!</p>

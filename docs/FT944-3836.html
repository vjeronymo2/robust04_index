			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: 'That's just what I've always wanted' - Gift ideas for the person with a special interest, here are a number of suggestions that you might not have thought of . . . / The Car Driver What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas. But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some suggestions . . . Modern cars have just about everything built-in. So the scope for buying car-related Christmas gifts is not what it used to be in the days when heaters and radios were extras. Think first of security. Devices to lock gear lever to clutch pedal or prevent the steering wheel from being turned full circle will not stop a professional thief but should make joy riders look elsewhere. From Pounds 20 at Halfords. Mobile telephones - the best gift for any woman who has to drive alone, especially at night - have become so spectacularly cheap that Ford now gives one away with every new car. But choose the tariff with care. Remember that the lower the monthly charge, the more the calls will cost. Motoring maps get out of date as by-passes are built and motorways extended. Philip's 1:100,000 atlas is the best there is of the British Isles. Michelin's spiral bound 1:200,000 atlas does the same for France. From booksellers, priced around Pounds 17 and Pounds 12, respectively. For a useful stocking filler, consider a map reading light that plugs into the cigarette lighter (Pounds 9.99 from Halfords). Prevention is better than cure. If you have a new car and a dog, call Over The Top Textiles (0608-676625) for details of its Quilties (from about Pounds 15 upwards). They keep mud and hairs off seats and estate car load spaces. Dogs like sitting on them, too. We may have a real winter this time. If so, a soft handbrush for snow removal plus a de-icer spray and scraper will be appreciated. If your partner has just been pinched for breaking the limit, you may be considering the gift of a radar detector to warn of speed traps. But forget it. In Britain, they are legal only so long as they are not switched on. On mainland Europe, the police are liable to confiscate them on sight and fine you heavily just for having one.</p>

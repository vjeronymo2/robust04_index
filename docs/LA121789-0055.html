			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPASSION APPRECIATED  </P> <P> On Friday I got the news of a death in the family, occurring in Des Moines. The  funeral was to be Monday. I called three airlines: American, United and America  West. They all serve Des Moines from Los Angeles. Of the three, only American  offered me a compassionate fare for flying on Sunday and returning on Tuesday.  This fare was less than half the regular (not weekend) fare. And when I picked  up my ticket at American, the clerk was very solicitous and expressed real  concern for me and the trip I was taking.  </P> <P> I can best express my appreciation by informing others of this courtesy.  </P> <P> DONN R. SCHOENMANN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

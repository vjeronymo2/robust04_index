			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Guojun (2799 0948 6874)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong  Yiren met with Dr. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state,  today. They discussed bilateral relations between China and the  United States and some international issues.    Rong first expressed his appreciation over the important  role  played by former U.S. President Nixon, who passed away recently,  in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and in pushing the  normalization of formal relations between the two countries.  Rong Yiren said: Dr. Kissinger, as an assistant to Nixon then,  has also made great contributions in this aspect.    Rong Yiren said that China hopes to see a peaceful and  stable  international environment and that differences between China and  the the United States should be solved through discussions and  consultations on an equal footing.    Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be  improved and developed in a constructive way, and the trade  between the two countries should also be separated from human  rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries  can cooperate in a friendly manner and in a still wider sphere.    The meeting proceeded in an extremely warm and friendly  atmosphere.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> TOUGH OPENER AHEAD FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley High will open the Southern Section 5-A Division baseball  playoffs at 3 p.m. on Friday when it travels to top-seeded Lakewood.  </P> <P> The Falcons (13-12), who struggled early in the season, have won seven of their  past nine games, including a 2-1 league tiebreaker victory over Hoover on  Saturday to earn the Pacific League's third and final playoff berth.  </P> <P> Lakewood (24-3), which won the Moore League title and is ranked No. 13 in the  nation by USA Today, is batting .379 as a team and has an earned-run average of  1.26. In addition, the Lancers won the Redondo Beach/Palos Verdes and Loara  tournament championships.  </P> <P> Still, Crescenta Valley Coach Tony Zarrillo is optimistic about his team's  chances.  </P> <P> "If it were a series of some kind, I'd say we were in a different situation,"  he said. "But in a one-game situation I'll take my chances against anybody.  They're the ones that should be on pins and needles.  </P> <P> "If we can pitch well and play good defense, we can be in the ballgame."  </P> <P> Senior Scott Gleason, who was hampered by a shoulder injury early in the  season, should start. Gleason (6-3) finished 6-0 in league play.  </P> <P> History warns that Gleason had better be tough -- the Falcons' don't have much  offensive punch.  </P> <P> Hyok Chang has a team-high .369 batting average, but only one other hitter --  Victor Ramirez at .333 -- is hitting better than .300. Shane Cowsill is next  best at .284.  </P> <P> Left-hander David Reeser (10-1), who has a 1.26 ERA, is scheduled to start for  Lakewood. The Lancers are paced on offense by Ricardo Guiterrez (.441, 32  RBIs), Chris Gomez (.416, 24 RBIs) and Shawn Hardy (.416, 17 RBIs, 21 steals).  </P> <P> In another 5-A game:  </P> <P> St. Francis (12-7-1) at Simi Valley (21-3), Friday, 3 p.m. -- St. Francis is in  the playoffs for the first time since 1985 -- and the Golden Knights had to win  10 of their last 13 games to make it.  </P> <P> For its effort, St. Francis will get to face Marmonte League champion Simi  Valley, the tournament's No. 3-seeded team.  </P> <P> "It's a challenge," said Tom Moran, St. Francis' first-year coach. "If we're  going to re-establish this program, we have to be able to beat the people who  are highly rated. I'm sure it will be a big upset if we're lucky enough to pull  it off."  </P> <P> Moran said he would decide on his starting pitcher -- either Mitch Bowen (3-2)  or Manny Fernandez (4-1) -- today.  </P> <P> The Golden Knights are led offensively by catcher Gregg Zaun (.467, eight  doubles, 19 RBIs), shortstop Mark Loretta (.420, 19 RBIs) and center fielder  Matt Jones (.367, 16 RBIs).  </P> <P> Zaun has signed to play college baseball at Texas, Loretta with Northwestern.  </P> <P> Simi Valley won the Marmonte League title for the fourth consecutive year and  sixth time in the decade. The Pioneers have been to the playoffs 10 times in  the past 11 years.  </P> <P> Right-hander Mike Jenkins (8-0, 2.03 ERA) will pitch for Simi Valley, which  also has five starters batting better than .300.  </P> <P> Andy Hodgins is batting .459 and Terry Hill is hitting .434.  </P> <P> La Canada (12-8) at Santa Clara (13-7), Friday, 3 p.m. -- The Spartans survived  two rounds of the 2-A Division playoffs last season before falling to eventual  champion Norte Vista. And La Canada might be more potent at the plate this  season, but it lacks the pitching depth of last season.  </P> <P> La Canada is batting .315 and has a 3.19 ERA.  </P> <P> Matt Whisenant (5-4), a senior left-hander, is scheduled to start. Whisenant,  an all-Rio Hondo League and Times All-Glendale selection last year, is batting  .389 and has 16 RBIs. Bill Koury, relegated to a designated-hitter role because  of a thigh injury, is batting .521.  </P> <P> Scott Giron (.418) leads the team with 20 RBIs and Andy Learner is hitting  .333.  </P> <P> Although Santa Clara Coach John Loranzana says, "We're just an average team"  the Saints have a knack for winning, having pulled out three league games in  extra innings. Santa Clara was second in the Frontier League with an 8-2  record.  </P> <P> Junior shortstop Kwinn Knight, with an average of .340, is the only Saint  batting better than .300. Junior catcher Augie Maciel is batting .288 with 16  RBIs and sophomore center fielder Garth Teron leads the team with 22 RBIs.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Rod Garza (5-1), who has a 1.32 ERA, will probably start  for Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Christian Church (16-5) at Ribet Academy (13-4), Friday, 3 p.m. -- The Fighting  Frogs have no depth. Literally.  </P> <P> Because of the duration of the basketball season, baseball Coach Patrick Moyal  says, the team fielded just nine players. Shortstop Darren Hill recently broke  his hand, so Moyal brought up Todd Trail from a physical education class.  </P> <P> "He's not a player," Moyal said of Trail, who will play right field. "He's just  a guy we'll put out there. We're definitely makeshift."  </P> <P> The loss of Hill is significant to Ribet's bid for a Small School Division  title -- he was batting .330.  </P> <P> Tony Lee (9-6), an All-Heritage League right-hander, should start for Ribet.  Lee also leads the team with a .419 batting average. Other offensive threats  include Maurice Johnson (.369), Tony's brother, Mike Lee (.290), and Robert  Harting (.280).  </P> <P> Right-handed senior John Boardman (9-3), who has a 1.90 ERA, is scheduled to  start for Christian Church.  </P></p>

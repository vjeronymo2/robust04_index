			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE RUNS CITRUS DEFENSE INTO GROUND, 23-16  </P> <P> Glendale College took a run at the state's top-ranked defense Saturday.  Literally. Keeping the ball on the ground for 58 of their 70 offensive plays --  including all nine on the winning drive -- the Vaqueros ground out a 23-16  victory over Citrus College in the Southern California Bowl at Citrus on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Glendale gained 437 yards against the Fighting Owls (227 yards allowed per  game), including 306 on the ground. But the last 59 were the most important.  </P> <P> Glendale (9-2) started its decisive drive on the Citrus 41 with 6 minutes 23  seconds to play. Fullback Rafik Thorossian keyed the march, carrying four times  for 30 yards. Bobby Webster capped the drive, going over from the three with  1:11 left.  </P> <P> "There wasn't much to it," said Thorossian, a redshirt freshman who gained 70  yards in 12 carries. "The offensive line just did a great job opening some  holes for us. All Bobby and I had to do was run through them."  </P> <P> Webster, a freshman who rushed for a school-record 1,360 yards during the  regular season, finished with 150 yards in 30 carries Saturday, and sophomore  fullback Wes Bender added 87 yards in 12 carries.  </P> <P> Thorossian, whose 20-yard touchdown run narrowed Glendale's deficit to 10-7  midway through the second quarter, rumbled 12 yards to the Citrus three-yard  line to set up Webster's game-winning score.  </P> <P> But even then, Glendale wasn't safe until Frank Solchaga's fourth-down pass  fell incomplete with 16 seconds left.  </P> <P> Solchaga (14 of 27 for 199 yards, one interception) completed three consecutive  passes to give the Owls (8-3) a first down at the Glendale 28 with 39 seconds  remaining. But he was sacked twice and threw two incomplete passes on the next  four plays.  </P> <P> Both teams entered the game riding eight-game winning streaks. Glendale, the  Western State Conference Northern Division champion, gave up 284 yards to  Foothill Conference champion Citrus but only 92 in the second half.  </P> <P> Trailing, 13-10, early in the third quarter, Glendale tied the score on a  23-yard field goal by Martin Boskovich with 4:36 left in the quarter, then took  a 16-13 lead on Boskovich's 47-yard kick with 13:54 left in the game.  </P> <P> Ervie Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff 66 yards to the Glendale 30, however,  and Mike Reyes kicked a 24-yard field goal six plays later to tie the score,  16-16.  </P></p>

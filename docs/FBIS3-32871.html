			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Against a backdrop of ongoing tripartite  labor-management-government negotiations on labor reform, a  "secret memo" on labor "flexibility," giving employers more  freedom to determine work schedules and more control over hiring  and firing, is reportedly being circulated among prominent  leaders of industry and a handful of labor leaders. According to  a report by Marcelo Bonelli in the column Business Panorama  published in the 14 January Buenos Aires daily CLARIN, the  points detailed in the memo are soon to be promoted by the Menem  administration.    Bonelli notes that although many of these points "irritate"  the unions, what really makes them "scream bloody murder" is the  insistence throughout the memo that these changes could be  agreed upon either through collective bargaining or through  shop-level negotiations. This would, he explains, "categorically  end the unions' hegemonic control over labor negotiations."    The unions are questioning whether yielding on these "labor  conquests" would actually increase employment as promised by the  government, writes Bonelli. He adds that labor leaders plan to  offer the government a counterproposal, which would move toward  a pact not restricted solely to labor issues. "Large businesses  are waiting for (labor) flexibility in order to lay off  personnel, not to create more jobs," asserts Peronist economist  Eduardo Curia, advisor to labor leaders Armando Cavalieri of the  Commercial Workers Union and Health Workers leader Carlos West  Ocampo. According to West Ocampo, the unions are willing to  discuss labor "flexibility," but only in exchange for guarantees  of more jobs and other cost-cutting measures.    Some of the 18 points detailed in the memo are as follows:     -  Shift changes, determined by either labor unions or  employers, would be set for periods no longer than one year.    -  The  average eight-hour workday could be "extended to 12 hours,"  depending upon the needs of each employer. Employees would not  be paid overtime, but would be given compensatory time during  periods of slack production.    -  Weekly time off could be  "postponed" for as long as one month.    -  The existing vacation  system--specifically regulations on qualifying requirements,  restrictions on timing and duration, advance notice to  employers, and remuneration for time off--could be changed in  any way.    -  A special set of rules governing temporary employment  would "totally deregulate" current labor relations and be used  by employers in hiring.    -  This special system would be applied for  a period of six months, but could be renewed every six  months.    -  Employers would benefit from a 50-percent exemption from  labor taxes for temporary workers and from the elimination of  severance pay.</p>

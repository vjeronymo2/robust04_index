			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Gap shrinks between Serbs and Moslems BOSNIAN Serbs and Moslems appeared to be inching closer towards a settlement yesterday after officials announced that Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, had agreed to a ceasefire and an early prisoner exchange. The moves are part of a five-point plan agreed by the two yesterday, including establishment of a communications hot-line between Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold 10 miles to the east. The announcement came after the leaders of the three warring parties held separate sessions as the Geneva peace talks resumed after an 11-day break. Earlier in the day Mr Izetbegovic had criticised the proposed map for a peace settlement as 'unfair'. But, after meeting his Bosnian Serb adversaries, they agreed to order a ceasefire, according to Mr Nikola Koljevic, a Bosnian Serb official. The five-point plan was hailed as a positive sign for the future of wider negotiations on an overall Bosnia peace accord. In an attempt to increase pressure on the Moslem delegation, Lord Owen, the EC's peace envoy, warned Mr Izetbegovic yesterday that renewed fighting between Serb and Moslem forces would pose 'real dangers that the Serb forces will cut the country in two'. Bosnian Serbs have accepted the 'peace package' but refuse to make any more concessions to the mainly Moslem republic which, under the plan, will form a 'union' along with the Croat and Serb republics. But wedged between the two ethnic states, the Moslems fear that they will be at the mercy of their foes. Mr Izetbegovic's delegation wants restoration of key territory in eastern Bosnia and the town of Prijedor, north-western Bosnia, which were mainly Moslem before the war, when Serb forces seized control. They want access roads to Neum, a fishing village on the Adriatic as well as connecting the isolated eastern enclaves. The Bosnian delegation has also demanded stronger international guarantees that the plan will be enforced. Serb forces used the 1992 Vance peace plan in Croatia to consolidate their territorial gains. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, today in Geneva amid signs that the allies are stepping up their military plans for a deployment. The international mediators had originally indicated that 40,000 extra troops would be needed to police a partition. But Nato officials in Brussels warned that the alliance was a long way from making a firm commitment on troop numbers. Meanwhile, in Mostar a UN protection force yesterday finally succeeded in leaving the city, after it had been trapped there for several days by Moslem demonstrators. The Moslems had refused to let the troops leave, fearing their departure would trigger a fresh assault by the Croat forces, who have been besieging the city for more than two months.</p>

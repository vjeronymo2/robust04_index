			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AISSA WAYNE'S ATTACKER GETS 8-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> Jerrel Lee Hintergardt, who stunned even his own lawyer by admitting his  involvement in the 1988 assault on John Wayne's daughter and her boyfriend at  the time, was sentenced today to eight years in state prison, the maximum  possible term.  </P> <P> Hintergardt's attorney told jurors last month that his client was at a Los  Angeles hospital for an adjustment on his artificial foot when Aissa Wayne and  financier Roger W. Luby were attacked the morning of Oct. 3, 1988, in the  garage of Luby's Newport Beach estate. But moments before he was scheduled to  testify, Hintergardt, 38, told his attorney, Todd A. Landgren, that he had been  lying to him; he was at the Luby estate that day.  </P> <P> At today's sentencing, Luby made a victim impact statement to the court, but  turned his comments directly to Hintergardt: "I was seriously injured; you will  never know how much you have injured me."  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, had ordered  the attack during a bitter custody dispute over their 2-year-old daughter.  Gionis, whose trial in the assault is scheduled for Aug. 28, is accused of  hiring Los Angeles private investigator O. Daniel Gal, who in turn allegedly  hired Hintergardt and another man, Jeffrey K. Bouey, to carry out the doctor's  wishes.  </P> <P> Wayne and Luby had just returned from a health club workout when two gunmen  approached them as they got out of their car in Luby's garage.  </P> <P> Wayne and Luby both testified that it was Hintergardt who beat up Luby and  slashed his Achilles' tendon with a knife, then smashed Wayne's face several  times into the concrete garage floor. Hintergardt admitted the Luby assault but  blamed Wayne's injuries on Bouey.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans asked Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan  for the maximum sentence, telling the court that the "purely gratuitous"  cutting on Luby's heel was a vicious act that deserved the stiffest punishment.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Landgren had asked the judge to sentence Hintergardt to the  mid-term of six years, based on Hintergardt's lack of prior criminal record.  </P> <P> Landgren said later, however, Ryan's decision was no surprise.  </P> <P> "With the extent of the injuries to Mr. Luby, it's certainly understandable how  a judge could see this as an aggravated case," Landgren said.  </P></p>

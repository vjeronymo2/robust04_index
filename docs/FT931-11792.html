			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Yields fall as investors gamble on rate cuts YIELDS fell as investors gambled that the UK government would cut interest rates over the next few weeks in a further effort to strengthen signs of economic recovery. With the Treasury last week reducing base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent in a surprise move, all the signs are that government ministers think credit policy is still too tight to support a full upturn. The stage seems to be set for a moderate tightening in fiscal policy in the March 16 Budget, accompanied around that time by a further cut in interest rates to 5 per cent or even less. In spite of the relative success of last week's gilt auction, in which the Bank of England sold Pounds 2.5bn worth of medium-dated bonds, concern about the large volume of funding due over the next two years continued to exert a dampening influence on price rises. During the week, most classes of gilts showed a price rise of up to 1 point, with the 8.75 per cent Treasury bond due in 1997 being quoted on Friday night at 104 3/16 . Its yield fell during the week by about 25 basis points, slightly more than that seen for gilts at the longer end of the yield curve. The chief cause for the decline was the cut in short-term interest rates on Tuesday, which took these to their lowest level for more than 17 years. The move came after a series of gloomy statistics about the economy since Christmas, and on the back of warnings that, unless growth picks up soon, Britain will face extremely high government deficits stretching into the late 1990s. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, seems to have taken to heart theories that without reasonably rapid growth over the next two years the public sector borrowing requirement will be stuck at around Pounds 60bn or more in the three financial years from 1993-94. The plan for the Treasury could now be to tackle the deficit with tax rises to be phased in during 1993-94 and the following year. At the same time, it could attempt to boost overall economic demand by a looser monetary policy, while not losing too much sleep over any falls in the exchange rate. Backing for this view came with the lack of any apparent unease at the Treasury during last week as, prompted by the base rate cut, sterling fell by nearly 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark to a London close on Friday at DM2.3925. At the end of the week the pound also tumbled through the Dollars 1.50 barrier against the dollar, to a six-year low. Meanwhile, the Bank said it was satisfied with the outcome of Wednesday's auction of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock due 2007. On the same day it issued a further Pounds 550m of gilts which by the end of the week was virtually sold out. Demand was widespread, with overseas investors well represented, even though the bonds were over-subscribed by a relatively low factor of only 1.18. One reason for the small 'cover ratio' was probably that many gilt marketmakers bought bonds the day before the auction as prices rose in the aftermath of the cut in interest rates. That sudden burst reduced the volume of bonds which they needed to buy at the auction to fulfil demand from customers such as pension funds. News that the M0 measure of money supply rose during January by a year-on-year seasonally-adjusted 4.2 per cent - above its Treasury target range - came as a jolt to those in the gilt market who surmise that inflationary pressures are relatively low, a factor strengthening the case for further interest rate cuts. Mr Ian Blance, an economist at Nikko Securities, thinks yields will be forced up during the rest of 1993 to accommodate the funding pressures. 'The government will need the support of a great many investors, particularly those from outside Britain, if it is to sell the desired volume of gilts,' he says. 'The only way this can happen is for the yield curve to steepen, with the general rise in yields especially marked at the long end.' With yields for 10-year bonds likely to see a rise of about 1 percentage point by the end of 1993, Mr Blance reckons the yield difference between 10-year gilts and the equivalent German government bonds will climb from the relatively low 116 basis points now to around 200 basis points by the end of December.</p>

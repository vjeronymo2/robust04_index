			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUS PROBLEM FORCES REDS TO MISS GAME  </P> <P> Transportation problems in Montreal kept the Cincinnati Reds from playing the  annual Hall of Fame game Monday against the Boston Red Sox at Doubleday Field.  </P> <P> The game was scheduled to start at 2 p.m. (EDT), but at that time the Reds were  still in Montreal, where they lost four consecutive games to the Expos over the  weekend to extend their losing streak to eight games.  </P> <P> A Hall of Fame official said the Reds had bus problems and then difficulty  chartering a plane for the trip to central New York.  </P> <P> Commissioner Bart Giamatti made the announcement to a crowd of about 9,000, who  didn't appear too disappointed.  </P> <P> The Red Sox arrived on time and took batting practice and played an intrasquad  game, also using players from Elmira of the New York State-Penn League.  </P> <P> Even if the Reds made it, Manager Pete Rose planned to stay away.  </P> <P> Rose, who is facing allegations that he bet on baseball games, didn't want to  take any of the spotlight away from former teammate Johnny Bench, who was  inducted Sunday.  </P> <P> The Reds play the San Diego Padres at home tonight at 7:30.  </P></p>

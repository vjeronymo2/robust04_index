			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Home Capital Development Group's planned Rancho San Diego project may adversely affect critical habitat in the Sweetwater River area. The Service estimates that up to 3 acres of habitat may need to be replaced prior to project initiation at an additional cost of $225,000. The annualized equivalent of the $225,000 one-time cost is $16,000 per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corps of Engineers authorizes a number of activities in the Prado Basin of the Santa Ana River critical habitat area. Future changes in some of these existing activities could affect critical habitat, and proponents may incur additional costs as a result. However, because project proposals were not identified during the public comment period of the proposed rule, the Service is unable to provide an estimate of any economic impact due to critical habitat considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sand and gravel mining activities that are regulated under the Clean Water Act could affect critical habitat, especially along the San Luis Rey River. Although there are no specific project proposals, the Service anticipates that the maximum additional cost would be $75,000 per acre of habitat destroyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SANDAG is coordinating the development of HCPs under section 10 of the Endangered Species Act for the San Diego River and Sweetwater River critical habitat areas. This effort also included the development of draft plans for the Santa Ana River and San Luis Rey River critical habitat areas but these sites are no longer under consideration. The habitat conservation planning process is being used to address land use conflicts and to conserve the least Bell's vireo. The Service will issue section 10(a) permits if these plans are acceptable. Based on Service review of drafts of these plans, it is anticipated that they will be compatible with the designation of critical habitat, and no additional economic costs are expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost attributable to the designation of critical habitat for projects with supporting data is approximately $74,000 per year. Projects expected to be affected by critical habitat designation for which adequate cost data are not available would not add substantially to that total. Impacts on regional employment, household income, and tax revenues are expected to be insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule published May 3, 1985, the revised proposed rule published on August 7, 1992, and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule for the vireo or its critical habitat. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A correction to some of the legal descriptions of the proposed critical habitat was published in the June 4, 1985,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (50 FR 23458). Newspaper notices were published by June 7, 1985, in the Blade Tribune, Enterprise, Los Angeles Times, News Press, Riverside Press, San Bernardino Sun, San Diego Transcript, San Diego Tribune, and San Diego Union, all of which invited general public comment. Notification of public hearings and an extension of the comment period to August 30, 1985, was published on July 9, 1985 (50 FR 27992). Public hearings were conducted in San Diego on July 30, 1985, in Oxnard on July 31, 1985, and in Anaheim, California, on August 1, 1985.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

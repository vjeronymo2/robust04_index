Governor Chen Shineng maintained: In 1994, we will  concentrate on fulfilling the following five major tasks:    1. To profoundly implement the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee;    2. To comprehensively accomplish tasks set out at the  Seventh Guizhou Provincial CPC Congress;    3. To rapidly build a socialist market economy by vigorously  deepening reform, expanding opening up to the outside world,  furthering structural readjustment, improving management, and  increasing efficiency, and building a diligent and clean  government;    4. To raise the province's total gross national product by  8-9 percent, primary industrial output value by 2.2-3.2 percent,  total agricultural output value by 3-4 percent, secondary  industrial output value by 9.5-10.8 percent, total industrial  output value by 12.5-13.5 percent, tertiary industrial output  value by 14-15 percent, and local revenue through existing  channels by 9.1 percent over last year;    5. To energetically develop all types of social  undertakings.    Governor Chen Shineng noted: We are bound to confront  numerous favorable conditions but a host of difficulties as well  in accomplishing the above mentioned tasks. First and foremost,  reform aimed at instituting a diversified revenue system will  place a significant strain on the province's revenue growth.  After instituting a unified income tax system, enterprises are  bound to come across more challenges in respect to market  competition and find it more difficult to control price hikes  and raise funds due to a series of restrictions caused by  "bottlenecks" and more painstaking to effect structural  readjustment. In view of this situation, Chen Shineng stressed  that enterprises should take the initiative to improve all sorts  of work and adapt themselves to a new economic environment.  Besides, governments at all levels in Guizhou should also make  intensive efforts to emancipate minds, seek truth from facts,  deepen reform, expand opening up to the outside world, boost  morale, carry out practical work in a down-to-earth manner,  secure sustained economic growth, tackle contradictions, and  safeguard political and social stability.    Governor Chen Shineng held: In 1994, in accordance with "The  CPC Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building  a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we must make redoubled  efforts to expedite the pace of reform by making clear-cut  emphases and proceeding in a planned way. We should make  vigorous efforts to intensify reform in the following six areas:    1. To conscientiously organize and effect financial,  revenue, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade  systems reforms;    2. To speed up property rights system reform with an eye to  gradually establishing a modern enterprise system;    3. To foster and develop a market system and continually  push ahead with circulation structural reform;    4. To further deepen rural reform and establish and perfect  a socialized rural service system;    5. To deepen distribution system reform and rapidly build a  social security system;    6. To make a success of personnel system reform and  practically transform government functions.</p>

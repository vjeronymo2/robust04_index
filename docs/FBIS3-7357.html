			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Overt Incitement of </F> Reunification by Advancing to the North"]    [Text] While tension on the Korean peninsula is  aggravating day after day, South Korean puppets' war maneuvers  of northward aggression are becoming more obvious.    According to reports, the puppet defense minister Yi  Pyong-tae talked about someone's nonexistent provocation at the  puppet Defense Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March  and raved that strong retaliation will be taken and a strategic  concept of making this occasion as an opportunity to achieve  reunification is being studied.    By "retaliation," the rascal [nom] meant to provoke a war  against us, and by "making this occasion as an opportunity to  achieve reunification," he meant to "achieve reunification by  advancing to the North with the help of the United States."    This bellicose remark, which cannot be overlooked, was an  overt incitement of reunification by advancing to the North and  a declaration of a war of aggression toward the North.    As everyone knows, it is the puppets' constant aggressive  ambition to provoke a war of northward aggression by joining the  outside forces and to crush [apsal] popular masses-centered  socialism of our own style.    Veiled with a civilian mask, the puppets, who have  accelerated war preparations more pertinaciously than the  previous military gangsters, recently broke up dialogue with  fellow countrymen deliberately, and taking the opportunity, they  decided to resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military  exercise and introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea while  recklessly running wild in order to achieve an alliance system  with outside forces. These are all aimed at achieving the  aggression.    War maneuvers are multiplying in a phased manner in South  Korea: puppet armed forces are banned from leave or sleeping  out, the entire puppet armed forces are in a security posture,  and a U.S. naval fleet, including an aircraft carrier mobile  unit, is running about the sea near our country. The Korean  peninsula is in an acute situation being driven to the brink of  war.    The coinciding puppet defense minister's provoking words  clearly show that the rascals take the provocation of northward  aggression and reunification by advancing to the North as an  established fact, and that, to this end, they are trying to  light the fuse of war by all means.    Following the tracks of the traitor Syngman Rhee, the Kim  Yong-sam ring is trying to launch a second Korean war while  playing the role of a shock brigade for the imperialists'  provocative maneuvers of war of aggression against fellow  countrymen.    Under the condition that over a thousand nuclear weapons are  placed in South Korea, if a war erupts on the Korean peninsula,  it will lead to a nuclear war, and our nation will suffer an  irrevocable nuclear disaster. That is why not only all the  Korean people but also peace-loving people all over the world  are outraged at and strongly oppose the puppet clique's  provocative maneuvers for a new war.    The Council of Clergymen for Justice and Peace of South  Korea, a South Korean Christian group, issued a statement on 24  March strongly opposing the resumption of the Team Spirit war  exercise and the introduction of Patriot missiles and warned  that this would only increase the danger of war on the Korean  peninsula. It is not coincident that South Korean people from  all walks of life are rising to wage an antiwar, antinuclear  struggle.    Furthermore, at such a time when voices advocating  reunification through the confederal system are swelling in the  North and the South, the Kim Yong-sam ring's criminal maneuver  of attempting the reunification through armed advancement to the  North can never be tolerated.    The problem cannot be solved by the method of war. If the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique dares to covet the northern half of  the Republic and shake our socialist system, our People's Army,  which has both offensive and defensive means, will pay back the  provokers hundreds and thousands times more.    We never make empty talk. History shows one who enjoys fire  will eventually be burned to death. The Kim Yong-sam ring must  abandon its wild fancy which will never be realized and must not  rashly run amok.    The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique should clearly recognize  that  if it insists on following the course to provoke a war despite  our repeated warning, it would only face a tragic destiny of  destruction.</p>

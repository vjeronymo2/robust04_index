			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts buoyed by further batch of bad economic data UK GOVERNMENT bonds rose in busy trading as a further batch of bad economic data fanned hopes of an early cut in interest rates, in spite of sterling's weakness. The pound fell by more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday. Some dealers said that yesterday's figures, combined with Wednesday's disappointing December retail sales, might force the government to reduce the base rate further before the budget on March 16. The 60,800 jump in unemployment last month topped market forecasts of between 25,000 to 60,000, while the 0.5 per cent monthly fall in manufacturing output in November fell short of expectations of a flat result. There was demand at both the short and long end of the market. The market's firm tone enabled the Bank of England to sell its remaining holding in the Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent gilts due 1998, issued on December 30 last year. As a result of the extra supply at the shorter end, long-dated gilts outperformed the rest of the market, resulting in a flattening in the yield curve which had steepened recently on concerns about the forthcoming auction. The Liffe March long gilt futures contract closed at 100.20, up  25/32 on the day in good volume of just over 47,000 lots. The benchmark 9 per cent gilt due 2008 closed at 102 5/32 , up  3/4 on the day, to yield 8.73 per cent, down from 8.82 per cent. GERMAN government bond prices rose slightly in subdued trading, as the Bundesbank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged was in line with expectations. The Liffe March bund futures contract rose to 92.98 from Wednesday's closing of 92.94, in volume of just over 42,000 contracts. The benchmark 7 1/8 per cent December 2002 bund was at 100.32 after Wednesday's final price of 100.28. Dealers said that the forthcoming German money supply data for December and the preliminary inflation data for January, both due out in the next few days, might have prevented the central bank from easing. Dr Richard Reid, chief economist at UBS in Frankfurt, forecasts an annualised rate of 9.2 per cent for M3 in December, only marginally down on November's 9.3 per cent. Furthermore, he points out that this year's rise in VAT is likely to lift inflation by 1.2 per cent month-on-month in January. This would give a year-on-year rise of 4.5 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent in December. VOLUME in the new German medium-term bond (Bobl) future launched yesterday on Liffe reached an estimated 8,700 contracts on its first day of trading. According to Liffe, this represents a 40 per cent share of the market, which Liffe shares with the Deutsche Terminborse, the German exchange. SPANISH debt held by non-residents rose to Pta1,870bn at the end of last year from a Pta1,600bn low in mid-November, a clear swing from the net sales by foreigners of government paper that set in during mid-1992. Factors rallying the Spanish bond market include ERM improvement, together with the stability of the peseta, and a recent easing of the interbank market. Rates for three-month Treasury bills fell at the mid-week auction by 0.5 points to 13.995 per cent and the 10-year bond price rose by a point to 91.10 per cent. For the first time since July last year, the 10-year yield dropped below 12 per cent. US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as retail buyers moved into the market after the announcement of the latest Treasury auction passed peaceably. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond rose  5/16 to 103 27/32 , yielding 7.300 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 9/16 , to yield 4.301 per cent. Prices eased in early trading, due to nervousness about the size of next week's two-year and five-year note auctions, and concern about the implications for the market of the next refunding round. However, once the Treasury announced that it would sell Dollars 11.5bn of five-year notes and Dollars 15.25bn of two-year notes, prices picked up as corporates and fund managers began buying.</p>

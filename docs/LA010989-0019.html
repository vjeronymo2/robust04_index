			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Fox Network, which long has been talking about expanding its prime-time  programming from two nights to three, has made it official and will add Monday  to its lineup come fall. "Fox has come a long way in two years," Michael  Fisher, chairman of the network's Board of Governors, told network affiliates  here over the weekend. "We are undeniably a force to be reckoned with in the  industry." The network now programs prime time on Saturday and Sunday nights.  The new Monday lineup has a start date of Sept. 11 and will be chosen from 25  pending projects. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

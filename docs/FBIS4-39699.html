			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Chistov] </F>   [Text] Brasilia June 9 TASS -- The text of a speech made by  Georgiy Mamedov, leader of the Russian delegation and deputy  foreign minister, at the 24th session of the General Assembly of  the Organisation of American States (OAS) in the Brazilian city  of Belem, was circulated as an official document on Wednesday.    Russia, which was granted the status of permanent observer  at  the OAS in 1992, comes out in favour of "in-depth dialogue with  American states sharing common democratic values and the  striving for security and peace", the document emphasised.    The economic reforms experience gained in Latin American  countries can be of much benefit to Russia. There are real  prerequisites for broader trade, economic, scientific and  technical cooperation between Russia and countries in the  region. The establishment of contacts in the field of advanced  technology, in space research and the uses of nuclear energy, in  particular, can be of great importance, the document pointed out.    In his speech Mamedov also stressed the importance of  cooperative action in combating drug trafficking.    The OAS, which brings together the United States, Canada,  and  32 Latin American countries, was founded in 1948 and is the most  widely-representative and authoritative hemispheric organisation.</p>

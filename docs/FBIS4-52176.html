			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh 9 May (AKP) -- His Majesty Norodom  Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, on 7 May made a clarification on the  two solutions he had proposed to put an end to the civil war in  Cambodia. Following is the text of the clarification:    "Yesterday, 6 May, I said among other things that one of the  following two solutions might be brought to the tragic problem  of the very harmful civil war between the Cambodian Royal Army  [CRA] and the NADK [National Army of Democratic Kampuchea] --  the Khmer Rouge:    Solution A: New elections with the participation of the PDK  [Party of Democratic Kampuchea] as a political party --  following a total and lasting cease-fire, with "standstill".    At the end of these elections -- which I, Norodom Sihanouk,  would be responsible for organizing and supervising -- the PDK  would probably win seats within our National Assembly, besides  the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], the CPP [Cambodian  People's Party], the BLDP [Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party],  and so on. The PDK would thereby be reintegrated into the  national community within the framework of our pluralist liberal  democracy.    Solution B: The PDK transfers to the government all its  "autonomous" zones and dissolves the NADK.    The government and National Assembly modify a small part of  our present Constitution to allow "acceptable" PDK personalities  to join the government and royal administration while  "acceptable" NADK elements are integrated into the Army.    "Of course, there is no question of me imposing either  solution on the government and National Assembly. These are  merely "ideas" to be considered or not by either warring party."</p>

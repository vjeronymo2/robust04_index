			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Nice, neat nighties DAMASK SELLS finest white cotton voile nighties, delicately hand-embroidered or hand-smocked. It sells old-fashioned tablecloths, white cotton embroidered ones with matching napkins or patchwork cloths in Provencal-style prints or soft chintzy prints. There are plain, white, hand-embroidered sheet sets and a host of white-on-white embroidered pillowcases to choose from. Then there are all those old-fashioned accessories that one seldom buys for oneself but make lovely presents - padded hangers, nightdress and handkerchief cases, shoebags, all delicately made and beautifully embroidered. The pure cotton bedlinen is possibly of greatest interest - a refreshing change from the boldly coloured and violently patterned bedlinen that has been in vogue for so long. Hand-embroidered sheet sets are Pounds 99 for a single, Pounds 122 for a double. Duvet covers vary from Pounds 64 to Pounds 115 for a single size, depending on the amount of embroidery. Pairs of pillowcases can be bought for Pounds 30, continental square pillowcases for Pounds 35. For those who like their bedlinen simple, there are two charming bedspreads  -Arlette, which is in woven cotton with a medallion centre design (Pounds 92 for a single size) while Amaryllis, in white and cream, starts at Pounds 105 for a single. The embroidered cushion covers, mostly in boudoir mode, are also charming and range between Pounds 26 and Pounds 30 while nightdress cases are Pounds 23.50. There are many different nightdress and nightshirt designs - some with sleeves, some without, some in very fine cotton, some in heavier, some with matching negligees, some without. All either hand embroidered or with fine pintuck detail which gives them a delicate old-fashioned air. Although almost all the Damask range is stocked by shops all over the country (from The General Trading Company in London and Bath to Chintz and China in Thornhill, Dumfries) Damask also runs an efficient mail order service. For a brochure write to Damask Furnishings &amp; Finery, Unit 10, Sulivan Enterprise Centre, Sulivan Road, London SW6 3DJ (tel: 071-731-3470) enclosing Pounds 2.50. The Pounds 2.50 is refunded on purchases over Pounds 25.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Continental in new legal bid to balk Pirelli CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday launched a fresh legal initiative to prevent Pirelli exercising its votes on more than the 5 per cent stake which it holds in the German company. The appeal to the Hanover court marks a further deterioration in relations between the two companies ahead of Continental's annual meeting today in Hanover at which Pirelli will seek to have Continental's voting rights restrictions lifted. Apart from the 5 per cent stake, Pirelli has options to buy a further 34 per cent. Today it will launch a second attempt to overturn the rule limiting shareholder voting rights to 5 per cent, whatever the stake. In its latest move, Continental wants the court to give a definitive ruling that Pirelli should not be allowed to exercise more than 5 per cent of its votes. This follows shortly after a demand from Continental that Pirelli should pay back the dividend it received on its Continental shares last year. The companies abandoned merger talks in December last year. Pirelli maintains that there is nothing sinister in its challenge today and that it simply wants to maximise the value of its stake by having the restriction lifted. Continental, however, is treating today's vote as a barely disguised assault on its independence. It and Morgan Grenfell, its merchant banking advisers, have in recent weeks mounted an intensive lobbying campaign to persuade shareholders to vote against the Pirelli motion. The outcome of today's meeting is likely to turn on the question of whether Pirelli is allowed to vote its entire stake, or whether its votes will be limited to 5 per cent. The decision on this lies with Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the Continental supervisory board and a main board director of Deutsche Bank. Continental would not comment yesterday on the likely outcome of today's meeting, except to say that proceedings would be 'exciting'. It is thought likely that Mr Weiss will exercise his discretion and limit Pirelli's voting rights. Such a move would probably provoke legal action as Pirelli has maintained - and reiterated yesterday - that its option rights over 34 per cent of the German company's shares in no way violated Continental's voting rights restrictions. At special meeting last March, Pirelli won a motion to overturn the voting right restriction, but the decision was not implemented pending an appeal to the Hanover court. At the end of May, the court annulled the vote, ruling that Pirelli failed to disclose last March that it spoke for more than 25 per cent of Continental. Pirelli's stress on 'maximising the value' of its stake, presumably with a view to its future sale, is understandable. Having taken a huge loss on its Continental shares and the indemnities offered to the other Italian companies in its shareholder pool, Pirelli's focus is on regaining some of the money ploughed into the venture. However, relations with Continental remain extraordinarily ambivalent. The two companies are still discussing the sale of some of Pirelli's car components operations put on the block as part of the Italian group's restructuring programme. Also on today's agenda is a motion allowing Continental to raise its nominal share capital by DM150m.</p>

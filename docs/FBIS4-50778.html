			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Khieu Samphan,  president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP) has been  invited to attend a dinner hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in  Beijing on May 25. A representative of the DKP's president said  here today.    The representative said that Khieu Samphan, who will be  accompanied by a 6-member delegation, will go to the king's  residence in Beijing immediately after his arrival in China's  capital on May 25 on the way to attend a round-table meeting on  peace and national reconciliation in Pyongyang.    The 71-year-old king proposed the convening of the  round-table talks from May 27-30 at the royal residence of Chang  So-on in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  without any condition before he returned Beijing from Cambodia  on May 18 for medical treatment.    The representative said that DKP supported the king's peace  efforts and respected the people's hope on peace and rebuilding  the country after 20-year-old war. It is a good thing to start  talks on the peace between the royal government and the Khmer  Rouge.</p>

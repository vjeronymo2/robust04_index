			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henlys to resist Cowie bid saying price is too low T COWIE, the motor trader, yesterday posted the offer document in its Pounds 27.3m all paper bid for rival Henlys Group. The document forecast interim profits from Cowie of not less than Pounds 11.5m, a 48 per cent increase over the previous year. It said current trading was 'encouraging'. Henlys said it would continue to resist the bid after seeing the offer document. It said the price was too low compared with Henlys net asset value of Pounds 47.7m at the end of 1991. The 1-for-2 offer values Henlys' shares at 72p with Cowie's share price closing at 144p, up 2p, yesterday. Henlys closed unchanged at 75p. There is no cash alternative. In the letter to Henlys shareholders, Sir Tom Cowie, chairman of Cowie, said: 'Henlys has lost its way.' He contrasted Henlys performance with that of Cowie. While Cowie increased profits in 1991 from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 18.2m before tax, Henlys dropped into a loss of Pounds 6.8m. Henlys has also forecast an interim loss for the current year. Mr Michael Doherty, chairman of Henlys, said that Cowie's suggestion that Henlys lacked financial strength was 'a bit rich'. He said Cowie, which has a large leasing business, had gearing of 350 per cent while Henlys' stood at 60 per cent. Cowie also said that its management could increase the return on Henlys assets. Mr Doherty said that Henlys' only problem was its bus and coach manufacturing business, and Cowie's management had no experience of manufacturing.</p>

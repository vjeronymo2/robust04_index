			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of </F> staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the Cairo security  talks, by Itay Engel in Cairo, Egypt on 24 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Engel] We initially asked Maj. Gen. Shahaq whether  he could at this point give us an estimated timetable for the  signing of the agreement.    [Shahaq] I do not think I can give you an exact timetable.  I can only tell you that the talks in the last two weeks have  been more businesslike and that if they continue at this pace  and in the same businesslike manner, there is a chance that we  may soon wrap them up.    [Engel] Would you describe the issues still in dispute as  being mainly technical and marginal -- as other members of the  delegation described them this morning -- or are they matters of  substance which may only be concluded after a summit meeting  between Rabin and 'Arafat?    [Shahaq] I would say that they are both. What we consider  matters of substance may be perceived by the other side as being  less important or vice versa. In my opinion, some of the  pending issues may be termed matters of substance, while others  are technical issues. Therefore, I think quite a lot of work  remains before we reach an agreement.    [Engel] We understand that one of the disputed issues is the  release of security prisoners. Is there a timetable for their  release and is it an inevitable phase? Will it include members  of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and other rejectionist  organizations?    [Shahaq] There is as yet no timetable for the release of  prisoners, which is part of a broader issue known as  confidence-building measures. In this context, we will have to  deal with other issues, and not just the question of the  Palestinian prisoners. There is no doubt that the issue of the  prisoners is an important and painful matter to the Palestinian  side which would like to reach an agreement on the matter. We  will try to reach an agreement on this matter, too.    There is as yet no agreement about a timetable or the number  of prisoners to be released. For example, we set several  criteria which we will have to discuss. According to this  criteria, anybody who engaged in terror after 13 September 1993,  the day the agreement was signed in Washington, will not be  included in such an agreement. Members of Hamas will not be  included either, because they are opposed to the peace process  and constitute an opposition to the Palestinians we are sitting  with, and because they continue to murder people and to declare  that they will go on doing so. Therefore, as long as there is no  change in this issue, the entire question of the prisoners will  not be concluded.    [Engel] Will we, at least in the first stage, make a  one-sided gesture of releasing prisoners?    [Shahaq] Even if such a gesture is made, it will have  nothing to do with the negotiations. The negotiations about the  release of prisoners are not yet over. To repeat, I believe the  moment an understanding is reached it will be publicized.    [Engel] Could you point to any progress with regard to the  whereabouts of Israel's MIA's?    [Shahaq] We do not directly deal with this issue in the  negotiations, but the fate of Israel's MIA's has come up and the  matter is being dealt with. On this issue, too, I cannot point  to any spectacular news. However, we will not let go of it,  either within or outside the negotiations until we attain some  results.    [Engel] Sir, thank you very much and have a nice day.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] An official EC spokesperson has said  that European Commission President Jacques Delors understands  the Spanish stance regarding the fishing issue linked to the  enlargement of the EC to Norway, but he does not agree with  maintaining a blockade of a minority of votes because this would  complicate decisionmaking.    The EC enlargement negotiations with Norway are postponed  until 15 March because of Spain's firm stance regarding fishing  rights, as well as the issue of voting at the Council of  Ministers.    Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister for agriculture and  fisheries, in statements to our station said that regarding the  fishing issue, we can not be deemed selfish. On the contrary,  we are trying to uphold important Community principles.    For his part, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao  Barroso has repeated his support for the Spanish stance  regarding fishing in Norway, and he added that Portugal also  claims its right to fish in Norwegian waters.    Today, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso arrived in Madrid to close  the two-day seminar held by the Spanish and Portuguese  ambassadors stationed in Maghreb countries.    Regarding the meeting Jose Manuel Durao Barroso is scheduled  to have with his Spanish counterpart, Javier Solana, he said his  country, as well as Spain, is very interested in strengthening  relations with North African countries, and both countries are  putting their case to the European Union [EU].    Jose Manuel Durao Barroso underlined that Spain and Portugal  have similar stances regarding this issue because Europe does  not only have a frontier with East and Central European  countries. Europe's southern frontier with the North African  countries is also very important.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (5): Ambitious schemes / Review of the industry in Asia IN THE drive to win new orders for nuclear power equipment in Asia, it is the old customers - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - who will dominate the order books into the next century. The three are united on common problems: extensive reliance on imported fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil); the need to ensure better security of energy supply through nuclear power, and the requirement to pile on new power output to fuel their already substantial industrial infrastructure. Despite growing public opposition, each of the Far Eastern countries is pushing nuclear power. All have ambitious plans to increase substantially nuclear power's share of the overall energy picture well into the next century. Easily the biggest is Japan's, which now stands at 30,385 MW, or 26 per cent, of installed capacity, spread out through 40 reactor units. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has called for an additional 40,000 MW to be added by 2010, of which 10,719 MW is now under construction. The environmental lobby, combined with the downturn in economic growth, has caused delays in the pro-gramme. Japanese energy authorities are also in talks with Russia for access to Sakhalin Island gas and oil reserves. If a deal is struck, then access to huge regional gas supplies could substantially alter the long-range nuclear programme. Nevertheless, near-term plans should benefit such western companies as General Electric and Westinghouse, which control the licences for nuclear technology. GE's Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) design is implemented through Hitachi, and Toshiba, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses Westinghouse's Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR). The recent big news comes from South Korea, which last month placed a Dollars 950m order for two 700 MW Canadian Deuteurium Uranium (Candu) reactors to be supplied by Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL) and other Canadian and Korean companies. Korea's installed nuclear capacity is 7,232 MW from nine units, with two more under construction and 24 planned by early next century. At 40m people, it is one third the size of Japan, but its nuclear capacity share is 49 per cent, highest in the developing world. Taiwan's Taipower, the state utility, recently decided to go ahead with its long-delayed fourth reactor, a two-unit complex of 2,500 MW, which has been subjected to violent Continued on next page Ambitious schemesContinued from previous page protest in recent years. It is now soliciting bids from western companies, one of which is Britain's Nuclear Electric, which would design the reactor as part of a consortium bid. Taiwan's capacity of 4,924 MW is supplied by six units, and 38 per cent of all electricity comes from nuclear power. A new player is China, which recently synchronised its largely in-house 300 MW reactor outside Shanghai. The cornerstone of its programme is the 2 x 950 MW complex nearing completion in Guangdong Province. The first unit of the GEC- Alsthom-Electricite de France project is to go on line next year with the second to follow a year later. China is committed to adding five more units, at least two around Guangdong and others elsewhere in the country. The potential for orders in south-east Asia has improved. Indonesia expects to put to tender orders for its first reactor later this decade, for start-up by 2995-2007, to be part of a large complex initially located in central Java. Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the partly privatised state utility, may have its first nuclear station in 10 years, according to H. Samy Vellu, the energy minister, in a statement last month. Thailand energy officials predict it will have its first nuclear plant, with a capacity of 2,000 MW, operating by 2006 under the Electricity Generating Authority (EGAT). The plan is expected to prompt intense national debate. The Philippines, which has had a moth-balled 620 MW reactor, supplied by Westinghouse, standing idle since 1986, is now finalising an agreement with the US company to commission the reactor by 1995-96. The reactor was suspended as a result of the post-Marcos anti- corruption clean-up by the Corazon Aquino government. India's outlook is grim. As a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), its seven reactors have just 1,374 MW capacity. Western technology is not available to it, and the collapse of the Soviet Union means that a promised 2,000 MW complex in Tamil Nadu state is now cancelled. Its long-range programme to add 10,000 MW of capacity has been scaled back to 6,000 MW, and many believe that even this target is unachievable. Pakistan, also a non-NPT nation, has an obsolescent 130 MW reactor in Karachi. China is preparing to build a 300 MW reactor, and talks are under way for a further 300 MW reactor. However, the future of these plants is uncertain because of political objections and lack of capital. The author is editor of Power in Asia, a Financial Times energy newsletter.</p>

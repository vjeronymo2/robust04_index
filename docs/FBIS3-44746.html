Sung] </F>   [Text] China has moved to allay fears that up to 400,000  Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports will not be able to  resettle in Hong Kong after 1997. The State Council's Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said yesterday that  while it was likely they would retain the right of abode, they  would lose their Chinese citizenship under China's long-standing  policy of opposing dual-citizenship.    Lu said the issue needed further study in the Sino-British  Joint Liaison Group (JLG) to protect the residence rights of  Hong Kong Chinese. "If those people cannot keep their right of  abode in Hong Kong after obtaining foreign passports, we have to  study under which circumstances their right of abode can be  retained," Lu said. "Generally speaking, our policy on this  issue is flexible and we will try to deal with it flexibly."    The Hong Kong government warned yesterday that up to 400,000  Hong Kong Chinese would not be able to retain their permanent  residence status under the Basic Law. It also said between  10,000 and 20,000 non-Chinese, mainly Indians and Pakistanis  holding British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports,  would also be denied the right to live here under the Basic Law.    Lu said China would try to ensure Chinese citizens born in  Hong Kong would not need to re-apply for residence if they  returned. "Such people, when they return to Hong Kong, do not  need go through any procedure," he said. Non-Chinese who had  lived in Hong Kong for at least seven years and regarded the  territory as their permanent residential place would also be  granted right of abode after 1997, Lu said. But he warned their  right of abode would be "examined" if they returned to live in  their mother country. "Such a move means that they do not  consider Hong Kong their permanent residential place and  therefore there is no point for them to continue to enjoy the  right of abode," Lu said.    However, it is not yet known whether the seven-year  criterion  should apply to Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports. Rita  Fan, leader of the Social Order Group of the Preliminary Working  Committee, also said Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports  would retain the right of abode after China took over. She said  the important thing was to define the conditions listed under  Article 24 of the Basic Law.    The PWC Social Order Group will meet in Beijing next week to  study this issue.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Questions remain over Pounds 61m Hualon grant Ever since the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board made a Pounds 61m grant to Hualon of Taiwan to build a Belfast textiles plant, it has been coy about publishing details of the controversial project. According to Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, who resigned as an outside director of the board yesterday in protest at the deal, the development board's own executives have been almost as parsimonious in supplying hard facts to the directors to whom they are supposedly accountable. 'I have scrabbled for information. I have spent a great deal of time trying to get answers. I resigned because I cannot get to the bottom of this thing,' she said yesterday. 'We cannot commit Pounds 61m of taxpayers' money to something as nebulous as this.' Mrs d'Abo, who made a fortune in the 1980s by turning around the Rymans stationery chain and selling it for Pounds 20m to Pentos, the bookshops group, said she had queried the Hualon project since it first went to the IDB board in September 1992. Her suspicions were aroused by the fact that Mr Oung Ta-ming, Hualon's effective head, and his brother Mr Oung You-ming, had shortly before been charged in connection with a stock trading scandal. The former received a three-and-a-half year jail sentence, later overturned, while the latter fled to Malaysia, where he still lives. She became even more worried by uncertainties about the legal and financial arrangements for the project. It was unclear, she said, which part of the sprawling Hualon group would be responsible for it, what financial guarantees it would put up and who stood behind them. 'One of the key reasons I am resigning is that I still don't know who the IDB is doing this deal with,' she said. In June last year she wrote to Mr Tim Smith, then Northern Ireland minister, saying she was so concerned that she did not wish to be reappointed when her three-year term at the development board expired at the end of this year. At a lunch last August, she said, Mr Smith said he also wanted more information, notably about the legal position of the Oung brothers. He arranged a meeting with Mr John McGuckian, IDB chairman, and senior staff later in the month. Mrs d'Abo was dissatisfied with the answers she received at the later meeting and pressed for further information. Though she had been given more documents, including the agreement under which Hualon accepted the IDB's Pounds 61m in aid, she said they raised still more questions. Among the points which Mrs d'Abo said remained unclear were: Whether the development board was dealing with the Hualon Corporation in Taiwan, its Malaysian subsidiary headed by Mr Oung You-ming, or Textonnia, a Northern Ireland shell company set up by Hualon in connection with the project. On October 11, Mr Frank Hewitt, IDB deputy chief executive, told Mrs d'Abo that Hualon had not decided on the vehicle for funding the project. But two days later Mr George Foster, IDB executive director, told her the IDB was dealing with the Taiwanese Hualon group. The status of financial guarantees. When Hualon accepted the IDB's aid offer last May, she said, it undertook to inject at least Pounds 2.5m in cash into Textonnia two months after the deal was signed. But by the time she resigned, Mrs d'Abo said, none of the money had been paid. Mr Philip Chu, one of two directors of Hualon Malaysia who signed the undertaking, was not mentioned as a director of Textonnia. She was also unsure who Textonnia's shareholders were. The legal status of the IDB's deal with Hualon. Mrs d'Abo doubted that the funding contract for the project was still valid because of Hualon's apparent failure to put up the promised funds and because of delays caused by the possibility that the European Commission's approval of the aid this year might face a legal challenge from the UK textile industry. The IDB said yesterday the vehicle for the investment was Textonnia, which it said had paid up share capital of Pounds 100,000 and was owned by a company called Texton. Mrs d'Abo did not recall the project being put to a formal vote by the board. Instead, she said, Mr McGuckian, as chairman, simply noted in his summing up at a board meeting that all directors had agreed to it. In spite of her doubts, she did not oppose the project outright at the time. 'I did not have the guts or all the information I needed,' she said. However, after another Taiwanese stock market scandal last month - allegedly involving Mr Oung Ta-ming, several senior Hualon executives and two brokerage houses linked to the group - she asked Mr McGuckian to hold a special board meeting to review the project. He turned down her request. The last straw, she said, was when she asked a fellow IDB director to raise questions about the stock trading affair at a board meeting last week which she could not attend. She said the inquiries were simply brushed aside. 'I suddenly decided enough was enough. I was being stonewalled, and nobody was listening to me,' she said yesterday. She hoped her resignation would prompt a full public inquiry into the project. 'I'm all for creating new jobs but only if we have got the right partner,' she said. That lesson, she added, had been learned at huge cost from the collapse in the late 1970s of the De Lorean car venture.</p>

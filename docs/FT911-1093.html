			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / New car sales show lowest April total since 1982 NEW CAR sales plunged by 24.2 per cent to 126,588 in April compared with the same month last year. It was the lowest April total since 1982. Sales fell sharply again after a slight respite in March, when sales reached 168,854, stimulated late in the month by the imminent increase in value added tax. New car sales in the first four months of the year, at 583,318, were 22.2 per cent lower than a year ago. April was the 18th consecutive month that new car sales have been lower than in the corresponding month a year earlier. Most leading car makers are now forecasting that sales for the full year will drop below 1.7m, compared with sales of 2m in 1990. That would represent a 26 per cent fall in new car sales since 1989, the steepest decline in any two-year period since 1974-75. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that imported cars captured 56.3 per cent of the market in April, compared with 57.6 per cent a year ago, while in the first four months the share of imported cars fell to 54.6 per cent from 57.6 per cent a year ago. The recession in the commercial vehicles market continued, with a 27.6 per cent fall to 19,406 in April. In the first four months, new commercial vehicle sales dropped by 31.6 per cent to 79,457. The top-selling car in the first four months was the Ford Escort/Orion range at 49,775, followed by the Ford Fiesta at 44,194, the Vauxhall Cavalier at 43,683, the Ford Sierra at 33,245 and the Rover 200/400 at 33,068. Ford remains the dominant UK new car market leader, but its car sales volume fell by 31 per cent in April compared with the overall fall in the market of 24.2 per cent and its share of the market in April dropped to 23.5 per cent from 25.8 per cent a year ago. The Fiat group of Italy, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, traditionally the weakest of the big six European volume car makers in the UK market, saw group car sales fall 38.9 per cent in the first four months.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By David Wallen, Doreen Cheung, and So Lai-Fun] </F>   [Text] Sir Percy Cradock last night joined the barrage of  denials by British and Hong Kong officials of any secret  diplomatic understanding with China that borrowings for the  airport and railway projects would be lumped together as  government debts. Instead, Sir Percy specifically stated from  London: "There was no secret undertaking in the Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU), no protocol in which we agreed on public  debt. I did not sign any secret deal nor enter into agreements  on such issues."    Britain's denial enflamed a dispute with Lu Ping China's top  Hong Kong man, who claimed the existence of such an  understanding in setting a $5 billion limit on airport-related  debt to run beyond 1997. Mr Lu, the director of Chinese State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on Thursday [27 January]  that he and Sir Percy, former foreign affairs adviser to Prime  Minister John Major, had struck a deal in June last year.    Yesterday, Mr Lu stood firm behind China's position and  criticised the British remarks, which he said amounted to  opening new issues and violated the MOU. Mr Lu challenged the  British side to go ahead now to borrow money for building the  Chek Lap Kok airport and the railway project in the absence of  China's consent. "If the British side thinks...the loans raised  by the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and the MTRC [Mass  Transit Railway Corporation] are not covered by $5 billion  ceiling on Government debt, then there is really no need for  them to discuss with the Chinese side.    "They can simply go ahead to borrow money. But we will thank  God if they can raise the funds," said Mr Lu.    The British Foreign Office and Hong Kong Government issued  separate statements, denying China's claim that there was an  understanding on what borrowings were included in the Government  debt written into the MOU. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish  Macleod said the Government was "astonished" by Mr Lu's  statement. The Foreign Office statement said: "There is no  truth in these allegations."    The renewed bickering comes as top Hong Kong officials  offered to put forward a fourth financing package addressing  China's concerns when the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee  meets again. Chief Secretary Mrs Anson Chan Fang On-sang would  not say what the package contained, but it was expected to be a  further substantial increase in the Government's capital  injection.    The previous offer was to pump $45.3 billion into the  Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway  Corporation (MTRC). Recalling details of the airport talks on  the MOU. Mr Lu said Britain had never mentioned the size of  debts to be borne by the PAA and the MTRC. "If they had touched  upon that (the size of PAA and MTRC debts), it would certainly  had been clearly stated in the MOU," he said after a meeting of  the PWC political sub-group.    The Foreign Office statement said: "The text of the MOU  makes clear that the Hong Kong Government will be free to borrow  as necessary, while informing the Chinese Government of  borrowings up to HK$5 billion.    "This clause refers only to borrowings by the Hong Kong  Government, not borrowings by the MTRC or the PAA.    "During Sir Percy Cradock's negotiations with the Chinese  Government which led to the MOU there was no discussion about  extending the reference to the Hong Kong Government in this  clause to cover also the MTRC and the PAA.    "We and the Hong Kong Government continue to attach  importance to reaching agreement with the Chinese on airport  financing including borrowing by the PAA and MTRC."    Expressing astonishment of the report Mr Macleod questioned  why such an understanding should suddenly come out from a  Chinese official. "It seems strange that this reported secret  understanding has not been mentioned before, neither in public  nor in private, during the two-and-a-half years that have  elapsed since the MOU was published."    He cited the former Governor Sir David Wilson's words on the  document: "I mean all has been agreed is here on that piece of  paper (the MOU) in front of you, nothing in addition to that at  all."    Sir Hamish said the $5 billion debt ceiling was agreed at  the  same time China requested an assurance that the reserves to be  left for the future Special Administrative Region would not be  less than $25 billion.    "Both sides realised that, without a limit on Hong Kong  Government borrowing, this would be meaningless because it would  leave the Hong Kong Government free to borrow enough to make the  reserves up to $25 billion.

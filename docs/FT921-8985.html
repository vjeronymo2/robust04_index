			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Jack Eckerd gives way on plan for Revco A REORGANISATION plan put forward by Revco, the US drugstore retailer which has been in bankruptcy since 1988, looks set to go forward without opposition from Jack Eckerd, the rival chain that had wanted to acquire Revco. The two companies announced yesterday that Eckerd has agreed to 'postpone indefinitely' its own plan of reorganisation for Revco, which would essentially have involved Eckerd in taking over the bankrupt chain. As part of the deal, Revco is paying Eckerd Dollars 7.5m for its plan-related expenses. Mr Boake Sells, Revco's chairman, claimed the agreement should result in 'an uncontested Revco plan' and allow it to emerge from bankruptcy 'at an early date'.</p>

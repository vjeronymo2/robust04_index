According to our correspondent, at the time of the United  States' military attack on Iraq, the number of immigrants and  refugees seeking asylum in Iran reached 5.5 million. However,  more than three million of them have gradually returned to their  countries and at present there are about 2.5 million foreign  nationals and refugees in Iran. Of this figure, 1,850,000 are  Afghans, 645,000 are Iraqis, and 65,000 are from other countries.    At today's session of the seminar the interior minister said  in his speech that refugees will continue coming to Iran until  political and economic stability returns to our neighboring  countries.</p>

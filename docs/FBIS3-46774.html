			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun: </F> "War of Nerves on `Juridical Viewpoint' of Nuclear Inspection of  North Korea"]    [Text] It has been learned that there is a delicate  difference in views between the United States and North Korea on  the legal nature of the inspection, which is a principled and  essential issue for the solution to the nuclear problem. Thus,  people are paying great attention to how the difference will be  settled in the future.    The difference in views between the United States and North  Korea originated with the issue concerning the position North  Korea is holding regarding the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT]. In other words, North Korea claims that since it is still  in a state of "withholding the withdrawal from the NPT," it has  no responsibility to fulfill its obligations as an NPT member.  Based on this theory, the North Korean side says it is not in  the position to accept regular and non-regular inspections  prescribed in the accords of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] but would only cooperate with the United States  for ensuring nuclear safeguards and its continuity.    Therefore, experts believe that such a claim made by North  Korea is a pitfall that would be used as an excuse for North  Korea to refuse the IAEA inspection whenever it wants or to  restrict the scope of the inspection.    It has been learned, however, that North Korea is not  opposed  to accepting the IAEA inspection at the present stage and that  North Korea has agreed in principle to include seven nuclear  facilities in the IAEA inspection.    During the 29 December contact, North Korea proposed to hold  nuclear negotiations with the IAEA in Pyongyang. The U.S. side,  however, conveyed its position to discuss a detailed procedure  in Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located.    Therefore, the issue of whether North Korea will accept the  entire contents of ordinary inspections demanded by the IAEA or  accept only a limited inspection or an inspection with possible  future limitations in order to ensure nuclear safeguards and its  continuity, as North Korea openly claimed, will be a key to  working out a compromised plan between North Korea and the  United States. Concerning this, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee  Myers stressed that the United States will continue demanding  overall inspections and revealed the position that the United  States will not accept the proposal for a limited inspection or  inspections that have the possibility of future limitations.    The New York working-level contact between North Korea and  the United States is aimed at reaching an agreement only on the  general direction, and the agreement on detailed issues  including the inspection method will be made at the forthcoming  negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA. Experts believe  that North Korea and the IAEA will reach an agreement when the  New York working-level contact between North Korea and the  United States conclude.    Therefore, in the event that North Korea insists, in  actuality, on a limited inspection or an inspection with the  possibility of limits in the future, instead of a nominal  acceptance of an inspection, only to justify its position, the  U.S.-North Korea working-level negotiation can hardly be about  to reach its conclusion.</p>

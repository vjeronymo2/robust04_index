			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food retailers say they expect to increase prices FOOD retailers warned yesterday that, while they had been able to absorb much of the effect of sterling's devaluation so far, consumers could see the cost of their grocery baskets rise in the next few months. They said the effect of devaluation had taken time to have an impact on food prices, and a number of special factors had helped offset it. As the full impact starts to be felt, however, food prices are bound to rise. Much will depend on the intensity of competition. While retailers might expect to be cushioned somewhat from the recession, they have seen sales volumes falling. This has made it imperative for them to keep prices down. This has meant absorbing price rises within their own margins to some extent, as well as sharing the load through tough negotiations with manufacturers and suppliers. Many retailers already source much of their food from the UK, lessening the impact of devaluation. J Sainsbury, the UK's largest food retailer, said 90 per cent by value of goods that it could buy from the UK - excluding specifically non-indigenous goods - are sourced from the UK. Safeway, the third largest food retailer, said it had raised the proportion of UK-produced food in its stores to 82 per cent. The Food and Drink Federation added that, while the 'green pound' had been devalued by 22 per cent since sterling left the ERM on September 16, it had taken some time for this readjustment to occur, and its full impact was still not being felt. But there will be pressure on a number of food categories, such as sugar, dairy produce, cereals and beef. There is evidence that manufacturers have been absorbing some costs. One retailer said its research had shown that, while the input cost of raw materials to manufacturers and processors had risen by 8 per cent, their output prices had risen by only 2 per cent. This was put down to the ability to keep other costs down, thanks to lower interest rates and lack of wage inflation. Other factors included the unusual phenomenon of several important commodity markets - such as some meats and dairy produce - all moving into a surplus phase at the same time, putting downward pressure on prices.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (12): 'Big Bang' is a damp squib - The privatisation programme has been bogged down POLAND may insist that it wants 'big bang' privatisation, but all it has produced thus far is a protracted whimper. The country's much-heralded Mass Privatisation Programme (MPP), conceived as an effort to kick-start the transfer of large state enterprises into private hands, was supposed to be well advanced by now. Instead, it has been bogged down for months in legalistic quibbling and political disagreement. And while the government is trying to get the process moving by issuing invitations to western companies it wants to involve, it could still be knocked off course by an adverse vote in parliament. The MPP - an ingeniously complex scheme under which up to 400 of the more attractive state-owned companies are to be parcelled up and transferred to investment funds managed by western banks and finance houses - admittedly represents only part of the government's privatisation efforts. But it was designed to be the showcase. Western economists, private Polish businessmen and government officials all worry that with the loss of momentum in its mass scheme, Poland is in danger of squandering a key opportunity to transform its economy. 'Although efforts at liberalising and stabilising the Polish economy have been largely successful, privatisation, especially of the large enterprises, lags dangerously,' wrote Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor who has advised Poland and a number of other eastern European countries on their reforms, in a recent article in Scientific American. 'This is the nation's key problem: unremedied, it could lead to the return of profound economic instability.' Poland's present difficulties should be seen in perspective. Its original plans to sell off half of all state-owned assets within three years always seemed over-optimistic. But it did make remarkable progress early on - particularly in rapidly selling off about 100,000 small- and medium-sized retail and wholesale stores previously owned by local authorities. Around 80 per cent of Poland's shops have been privatised over the past two years, and well over 40 per cent of Polish imports are now handled by private traders. And the government is still disposing of a steady trickle of industrial companies, either through public share offerings, through direct sales to foreign 'trade' investors, or by liquidation and sale of their assets to workforces or other buyers. Nevertheless, the sums being raised by these means are still rather small. Last year for example, according to the Ministry of Ownership Changes, trade sales raised an estimated Dollars 150m; and while the hope is to treble the total or more this year, nobody is predicting a quantum leap. Around 30 more sales to foreign investors - including cement factories, paper and pulp manufacturers, breweries and food processors - are under discussion. The ministry is talking of making 50 to 60 trade sales this year, out of a total of 209 companies on offer, as well as selling stakes in three Polish banks. Recently, there has also been progress in bringing foreign investors into Poland's heavier industries such as car manufacturing - with the memorandum of understanding between the Polish government and General Motors providing for assembly of Opel cars in Warsaw - and power generation. Still, the privatisation process has not yet made great inroads into the state assets that really matter. There are several reasons for this. One is that large parts of the Polish state sector are simply not profitable. Another explanation lies in the extraordinarily complex procedures involved. To prepare a state enterprise for privatisation through a trade sale, public offering or participation in the mass programme, it first has to be transformed into a corporation with stock controlled by the Ministry of Ownership Changes. This process, known in Poland as 'commercialisation', requires the consent of workers' representatives, and such consent is not always given because restructuring and job cuts are often a prelude to privatisation. Even when 'commercialisation' takes place, there is no guarantee that the management of a state corporation will improve sufficiently to make it attractive to investors. The idea is that in a state-owned joint stock company, workers' councils should not have such a decisive influence over management. But in practice, that form of constraint tends to be replaced by another. As one privatisation official put it: 'The change of status doesn't seem to mean much. In fact the management of a commercialised corporation tends to be more constrained by a politicised board of directors and by ministry clerks.' In effect, the government is trying to satisfy a number of disparate objectives with its privatisation effort, and it shows. According to ministry documents, it wants to use privatisation to: inject market forces into the economy; improve the performance of enterprises; prevent the sale of state assets to foreign investors at unduly low prices; generate funds from the sale of enterprises; ensure a wide diffusion of ownership; provide an effective system of corporate governance; start exchanging Poland's foreign debt into equity in privatised enterprises; and meet the needs of social justice. Arguably, these aims cannot all be met at once. This is where the Mass Privatisation Programme was supposed to come in. It was dreamed up as a mechanism for squaring the circle: for drawing in western management expertise without provoking accusations that the government was selling its family silver to foreigners. The trouble is twofold: it is proving complicated to implement, and the politicians are showing signs of dragging their feet. The scheme - prepared by the ministry with the assistance of S G Warburg, the London merchant bank, and formally unveiled in December - is eventually expected to involve up to 400 state factories, accounting for some 25 per cent of the country's industrial sales and 12 per cent of total employment. The government wants to transfer 60 per cent of the equity of these companies to a number of closed-end investment funds known as National Wealth Management Funds; of the remainder, 30 per cent would continue to be held by the Polish government and up to 10 per cent given to employees. These groups, the first of which, running up to 200 enterprises, are supposed to be set up in the autumn - would have Polish chairmen and partly Polish boards, but would be managed by western banks and other financial institutions for a fee. They would subsequently be privatised, with shares in them distributed for a nominal sum to every Polish citizen over 18. Over time, the authorities would have initiated a Polish version of popular capitalism, with a batch of well-managed companies traded on an active Warsaw stock exchange and enriching the portfolios of a new breed of local institutional investors. 'This is really very innovative, it hasn't been tested anywhere in the world,' enthuses an adviser to the privatisation ministry. 'It's a logical combination of local possibilities with ideas from western capital markets.' So much for the theory. In practice, the process has yet to get off the ground. Although the initial announcement attracted lively interest from some 50 potential fund managers, the launch date has repeatedly slipped as the government has hesitated to put it to parliament. At the end of March, Warburg's contract with the government to assist with the scheme expired, and the UK's Knowhow Fund, which was funding the project, refused to provide another injection of cash unless it received a letter from Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister, formally restating his government's commitment to the MPP. As a result, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, the privatisation minister, has had to write what amounts to a holding letter to his potential western partners, inviting them to tender but warning them that at a later stage the government or the parliament might change the terms. It remains to be seen how many western banks and fund managers are bold enough to wade into such shifting sands. To some exasperated Polish businessmen, and to outside observers, it looks as if the mass privatisation programme, far from eliminating red tape, could continue to tie the government in great knots of it for some time to come.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> ON THE TOWN: How hot were tickets for Janet Jackson's recent quartet of  concerts at the Forum? So hot that in a daring early evening robbery two  Sundays ago, an unidentified thief stole $300 worth of tickets from the main  gate at A&amp;M Records. According to staffers at A&amp;M, the robber told a  security guard that he was a list for Jackson tickets.  </P> <P> When the guard left his post to look for a different list, the thief grabbed a  handful of ticket envelopes and dashed away. A&amp;M has still failed to locate  the tickets. . . . Meanwhile, you could've put together a serious pick-up game  with the contingent of Jackson fans who were on hand for the pop darling's  opening-night show. Hoops royalty in attendance included Magic Johnson (who was  a promoter of the concerts), Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, James Worthy, Vlade  Divac and Larry Drew. Other celebs making appearances included Michael Jackson,  Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger (with wife Maria Shriver), Bill Murray,  Dennis Hopper, Jimmy Smits, Matthew Modine, Jennifer Grey and Christian Slater.  </P></p>

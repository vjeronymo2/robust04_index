			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAR IN HIS EYE  </P> <P> Considering Michael Wilmington's many fine and sensitive observations about  Western movies (Dec. 16) I'm surprised by his use -- twice -- of the term  half-breed.  </P> <P> Unlike cattle, dogs, and cats, we human beings aren't categorized into  different breeds. To describe a mixed-race person as a half-breed is not only  incorrect but demeaning, as it implies a sort of bestial-human union.  Half-breed deserves to be dropped from usage like other racist terms have been.  </P> <P> SUZANNE McKAY  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

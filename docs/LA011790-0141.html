			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HUNTS PUT MANSION UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> A 68-year-old mansion in fashionable Highland Park has been listed for sale by  Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy  proceedings earlier this month.  </P> <P> The asking price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion overlooking Turtle Creek  is $2.8 million.  </P> <P> The house has marble fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor.  </P> <P> Caroline Hunt said in a recent interview that her family intends to move into a  smaller home.  </P> <P> Because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts were forced to turn over  holdings valued at more than $220 million. Hunt also had to give up his annual  salary of $300,000 and income from widespread holdings, the Dallas Times Herald  said.  </P> <P> Because Texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption for a homestead in  bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts won't have to give any proceeds from the sale  to creditors.  </P></p>

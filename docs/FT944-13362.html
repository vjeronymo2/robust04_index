			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Burns criticised on Treasury cuts Sir Terry Burns, the perma-nent secretary of the Treasury, was last night attacked for failing to consult opposition parties over cuts in his department's manpower. Mr Peter Mandelson, the Labour MP for Hartlepool who was this week tipped for a key job in the Labour whips' office, accused Sir Terry of 'a dereliction of duty' by not informing the Labour party about drastic reductions in the number of Treasury civil servants. In an adjournment debate on the civil service, Mr Mandelson said Sir Terry needed to ensure that the Treasury machine remained fully operative for subsequent administrations. He insisted that Sir Terry should hold talks with Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, well before the next general election to be fully briefed on the party's economic plans. 'Upon a change of government, the Treasury will need to shift radically and quickly to new priorities and ways of working,' he said. 'There wouldn't be time to waste.' Earlier this month Sir Terry announced a shake up of its structure, which will involve the loss of about one in four senior staff. Seventeen Labour MPs yesterday submitted an early-day motion calling for the government to carry out a fundamental review of the beleaguered Child Support Agency. As concern grows about the agency's record in its first year in operation, the MPs claimed that the organisation aimed to 'support the Treasury rather than the child'.</p>

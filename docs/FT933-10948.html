			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Could amber be the choice for you? IF YOU prefer your jewellery chunky, bold and ethnic amber may well be the choice for you. Back in May I reported that amber was the stone of the summer with Cobra &amp; Bellamy kicking the amber season off with a spectacular selection of rich, raw and brutal pieces culled from the ancient fossilised forests around the Baltic Sea. Since then the choices have proliferated and you can buy amber jewellery in many moods and at many prices. You can buy a small selection by mail order from Muftec Consultancy, 27 Coval Road, London SW14 7RW. There are amber rings (Pounds 28) and a good selection of ear-rings (ranging from Pounds 35 to Pounds 65) as well as bracelets (Pounds 85), brooches (Pounds 45 to Pounds 65) and an amber and fancy silver collar (Pounds 95). All the pieces uses silver for the setting and all are made from amber found on the Baltic coast of Poland or Lithuania, each piece is hand-cut and hand-made. Write to Muftec for a brochure. Next and most branches of John Lewis are selling well-priced pieces from the Goldmajor collection of amber jewellery - ear-rings start at Pounds 16.45 and for around Pounds 30 there is plenty of choice. At the top end of the range the mosaic necklaces are quite spectacular. At Manguette, 20a Kensington Church Walk, London W8, a small but charming jewellery shop, there will be an exhibition of contemporary amber jewellery, September 15-29, with contemporary designers such as John Bowman, Gatto Bianco, Ashley Wheeler and Eileen Coyne. Prices range from Pounds 50 to Pounds 2,500. If you want something to wear with your summer wardrobe you do not have to wait until September - Manguette always has a marvellous selection of amber pieces. Available now is the stunning necklace, above, designed by Eileen Coyne, made from Baltic amber, and selling for Pounds 795.</p>

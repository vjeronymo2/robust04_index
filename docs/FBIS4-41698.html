			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kravchenko] </F>   [Text] Mexico City June 28 TASS -- The National Bank for  Foreign Trade of Mexico and the Russian foreign trade  amalgamation "Energomasheksport" here on Monday signed an  agreement on opening a credit line for Russian enterprises and  companies for acquiring goods in this Latin American country.    The document envisages the possibility of receiving credits  for exports to Russia goods worth 2 million U.S. dollars. The  sides can increase the financial support up to 10 million  dollars, according to their mutual understanding. Now Russian  firms, which wish to make use of credit lines for imports of  Mexican agricultural, consumer and industrial goods, will have  to approach the "Energomasheksport".    This agreement creates an important precedent in bilateral  ties, Anatoliy Yevdakomov, adviser to the Russian trade  representation, told ITAR-TASS. Earlier this practice was used  exclusively by state establishments of the former Soviet Union.  Now the Mexican side is for the first time using this mutually  beneficial financial mechanism for the development of economic  exchange with Russia, he said.</p>

"We have reached agreement on further joint efforts to turn  Sarajevo into a peaceful city. This is the most important task  today," Churkin stated.    The possibility of perpetuating the tranquility in Sarajevo,  achieved in recent days, was stressed during the Russian  diplomat's meetings with Yasushi Akashi, representative of the  U.N. secretary- general in former Yugoslavia, and General  Michael Rose, commander- in-chief of the U.N. forces in Bosnia  and Herzegovina.    On the same day, Churkin told Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of  the presidium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the Russian  battalion, which arrived in Sarajevo on february 20, would  honestly and objectively discharge its duties in accordance with  the U.N. mandate. He urged the Bosnian leader to do everything  possible to rule out any unfriendly actions against Russian  servicemen.    Churkin stated that the situation in Sarajevo was calm and  that there were no reasons for its escalation.    In the meantime, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told  local journalists in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serb intelligence  possessed information about a new spate of provocations that is  now being hatched by the Muslim side.    He said that some Muslim combatants, clad in Serbian  uniforms, were planning to attack the "Blue Helmets". Several  bodies, dressed like Serbs, are to be left on the spot of the  clash so that responsibility for the attack could be blamed on  the Serb side.    "We can expect a series of terroristic acts in the near  future, like the ones we have witnessed in the Lebanon,"  Karadzic noted.    The Bosnian Serb government also noted in its statement the  possibility of provocations "from the Muslim or some other third  side". It urged foreign journalists "to avoid premature  conclusions and instigatory calls against the Serbian side."</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): National Westminster - Other Companies NatWest becomes the second large high street bank to disclose its 1993 figures, and is expected on Wednesday to report a pre-tax profit of between Pounds 950m and just over Pounds 1bn, compared with Pounds 398m in 1992. Bad debt provisions are expected to fall substantially, but operating profits are not thought to have grown strongly. The dividend rise is likely to be smaller than those at Lloyds and TSB Group.</p>

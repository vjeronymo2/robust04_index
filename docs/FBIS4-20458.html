			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Weimin] </F>   [Text] China's fledgling information service sector, after  years of probing for business openings, is turning to long-term  commitments to help bolster the market.    Latest reports say competition is growing to build up data  banks for use by businesses, which have come closer to the  recognition that a good corporate image helps their long-term  interests in the information market.    Latest statistics show that some 800 data banks have been  established nationwide, compared with only a few score a decade  ago.    However, the information contained in most data bases is far  from enough. On average, the 800 data banks each have 50,000  pieces of information, compared with 1.04 million pieces in 1989  in the United States.    Li Yefu, president of Beijing-based MLS Information, a  subsidiary of MLS Advertising and Planning Co, believes things  are looking up.    In an interview with Business Weekly last week, Li pledged  to  contribute to China's information sector and expressed  confidence that it will build up its profile within a few years.    Li said MLS Information completed a large data base early  this month and is now making major efforts to promote it.    The data base, containing information on more than 600,000  enterprises and institutions, is a rarity in the country.    Basic information on all large and medium-size State  enterprises and institutions and 3,000 foreign firms and  organizations has been gathered.    MLS Information spent two years gathering and processing the  information with the help of a computerized system.    To commercialize information in the data base, the company  decided to open a telephone hot line on the 18th of every month  to answer questions about enterprises and institutions in China.    You Zhihai, a manager for MLS Information, said that on  March  18, the first day of service, scores of phone calls were  received.    Li called the hot line a success, and said his firm plans to  open several additional phone lines.    ``We, like our customers, also need new information from  feedback. And we need a good corporate image for our long-term  interest,'' he said.    The data base is to be updated every six months, You said.    Li said that his firm will soon begin a market investigation  called Business Cycle Survey of China.    Li said he expects the survey, which is to be finished  within  a year, will help central government departments and State  national industrial corporations to make policies and decisions.    The firm will compile and publish pamphlets three times a  month to provide information from the survey to enterprises and  government departments.    Questionnaires will be sent to some 30,000 enterprises.    ``We expect 70 per cent of them to fill in the forms and  send  them back to us,'' Li said.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Flagging spirits Guinness's first-half results were another case of pleasure deferred. The Spanish beer market has at least stabilised. In the spirits market, the product mix has improved, with single malt and de luxe brands ahead of last year. Overall, though, volume sales of spirits fell 5 per cent in the first half and profits from this division were down 9 per cent after adjustment for exchange rate changes. Guinness again alluded to special factors like the bad weather in the US and de-stocking in the UK during the first quarter, but there is still no evidence of demand strong enough for the company to make much headway with premium prices. Indeed, the relaunch of Bell's whisky in the UK seems simply to have prompted rivals to cut their own prices. Like BTR after its margin disappointment, Guinness now stresses that it is a late cycle business. The new head of its spirits division will not be asked for a new strategy because the company remains convinced that only patience is required till Guinness can again exploit its undoubted brand strength. Yet with interest rates now on the way back up in both the US and the UK, one wonders whether the 'feel-good' factor which encourages consumers to move upmarket will ever show through strongly in this cycle. If not, much time has been wasted. Profits are unlikely to be much higher this year than they were in 1991. Obviously, a company as wedded to brand values as Guinness cannot easily switch to a tactic of sacrificing price for volume. But it makes little sense for Guinness to sit on its hands while gearing continues to fall. If its business really has matured, it would be better to buy back shares sooner rather than later. Earnings would be enhanced with the share price below 450p. The recovery would then simply be all the more sweet if, by contrast, market conditions did eventually turn decisively in the company's favour.</p>

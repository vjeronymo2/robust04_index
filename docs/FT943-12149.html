			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Greece to alter tendering rules Greece's public works minister, Mr Costas Geitonas, yesterday presented to parliament new legislation reforming tender procedures for road and port construction. The proposed law aims at defusing a dispute with the European Commission that could delay disbursement of more than Dr250bn (Dollars 1.1bn) in European Union aid to Greece for infrastructure improvements, due to be transferred later this year. The public works ministry has already postponed tenders worth more than Dr100bn because of the Commission's objections to the way bidding is carried out. Several Greek contractors recently offered discounts of up to 80 per cent on EU-backed motorway and harbour projects, with the aim of recouping costs later by renegotiating the contract terms. The new law calls for tighter conditions on tendering, including examinations of companies' recent financial results, and stiff fines for contractors who fail to meet project deadlines.</p>

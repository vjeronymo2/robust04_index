			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Case for increased public-sector borrowing and pump priming Sir, Although the government has re-stated its determination to keep public spending in cash terms at or below the planned ceiling of Pounds 244.5bn in 1993-94 in order to contain the public-sector borrowing requirement, there is a good case to be made for allowing this ceiling to be raised - by up to Pounds 5bn or so. Every person made redundant creates at least a triple drain on the economy - less tax receivable by the exchequer, greater social cost and reduced purchasing power. This in turn makes it less likely that desirable expenditures on health and education can be maintained. It follows that the first imperative for the government must be, not to 'kick start' the economy (an absurd and unrealistic notion), but to make sure that expenditures are directed to the twin and related goals of improving the infrastructure and creating jobs. I question the desirability of any cuts in public spending in the current situation. It looks as though the recession will be the longest this century. For the sake of the future we should maintain expenditure on education and health, and increase that on transport and inner cities. Investment spending is likely to have fallen 1.5 per cent this year compared with 1991. The outlook for 1993 based on intentions surveys is bleak. There are no signs of pick-up in the housing market and consumer spending continues to be held back by high levels of debt and uncertainty over the future. The boost to exports from devaluation may well be muted by difficulties in our overseas markets. What is needed is an increase in capital spending programmes to stimulate economic activity, particularly in the hard-pressed construction sector. The effects on employment and consumer confidence would be positive and would offset any negative impact on the PSBR. Why is pump priming an acceptable way out of recession in Japan but not here? If the objection is that the Japanese can afford it and we cannot, the answer is to fund pump priming by increasing income tax. That would also answer the inflationary objections to public spending by reducing the possibility of inflationary pressure from personal sector spending - not that there is much danger of that at present. The result of higher taxation is more likely to be lower savings. To increase income tax would, of course, be a U-turn, but what is one more change of direction after so many?

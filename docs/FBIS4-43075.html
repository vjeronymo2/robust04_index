			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to a REUTER report, in his letters to  U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John  Major, President Glavkos Kliridhis expressed his intention to  resign and declare elections in October if the UN Security  Council decides to continue pursuing the confidence-building  measures [CBM's]. In an exclusive statement to the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Kliridhis refused to reveal the  contents of the letters, but stressed that no talks should be  held either on the CBM's or the substance of the issue because  of Turkish intransigence.    Commenting on the REUTER report, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas mentioned that Kliridhis is using blackmail and bluffing  in order to get Varosha.    Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou reports:    [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis was at the  Larnaca marina today. Will he reveal the contents of the  letters he sent to Clinton and Major?    [Kliridhis] I have sent letters to President Clinton and the  British Prime Minister. Of course, these letters are related to  the CBM's. The contents of the letters are confidential for  now, but when the time is right they will be published.    [Andreou] Kliridhis said that there can be no further  discussion on the CBM's or the substance of the Cyprus issue  now. He stressed that measures must first be taken to convince  us that the other side has political will. The National Council  agreed unanimously that talks on the CBM's must not continue and  that the substance of the issue must not be discussed now  because the Turkish side has no political will.    [Kliridhis] In light of these events, our position is that  if  there is no significant change so that we can say that the other  side has the political will for a solution, there is no space  for further talks either on the CBM's or the substance of the  issue.    [Andreou] Kliridhis finally said that the Government and the  Greek Cypriot side support the UN secretary general's positions  on intense and detailed negotiations among the UN Security  Council permanent members, the guarantor powers, the two  communities, and Europe. [passage omitted]    A REUTER bulletin from Nicosia dated 10 June mentions that  it  has copies of Kliridhis' letter to Major and Clinton and quotes:  Having examined the situation carefully, I have reached the  conclusion that if the UN Security Council decides that talks  must continue on the CBM's, I would find it necessary to resign  and declare presidential elections in October 1994. The new  president will be free of the commitments that I have undertaken  and will have to decide on new measures.    The previous day, the Athens newspaper ETHNOS carried a  similar report and CyBC asked government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis to comment on it.    [Kasoulidhis] I don't know of anything.    [Andreou] But in any case there is something....    [Kasoulidhis, interrupting] I have no knowledge of the  report  or what you are saying.    [Andreou] Has the president not expressed any thoughts about  resigning?    [Kasoulidhis] I have answered that I know nothing about this  issue.    [Andreou] The spokesman avoided making any comment today  either, stressing that Kliridhis' letters are confidential. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (8): Minimalist role of the state - Privatisation GIVEN THE depth of the economic crisis which faced Argentina in 1989, any incoming president would have had to begin reform of the state wrought by Juan Peron. But perhaps only a Peronist, such as President Carlos Menem, could have begun to dismantle it with such vigour. By the time the privatisation programme is complete - and the greater part of it should be concluded this year - enterprises responsible for 30 per cent of the country's gross national product will have been transferred from the government to the private sector. The airline and state telephone businesses have already been privatised. They will be followed by gas, electricity, railroads, water and sewerage systems, part of the banking system, steel mills, petrochemical plants and more. Even the state oil company, sacrosanct in other privatising countries such as Mexico, is going up for sale. Since the federal government is also transferring some health and education responsibilities to the provinces, central government will have a minimalist role, accounting for less than 10 per cent of economic activity. If the plan is carried through, the state will have responsibility for public security, defence, health, education and not much more. The government now admits that its early privatisations were not well managed, and that the companies were privatised into an under-regulated environment. This has meant, for example, that the buyer of Aerolineas Argentinas - Iberia of Spain - has an effective monopoly on domestic air routes since it also controls Austral, the other Argentine airline. In a country such as Argentina, a giant privatisation programme is a dangerous thing on which to embark in haste. So, when Mr Domingo Cavallo took office as economy minister at the start of last year, he put the privatisation programme on hold. Mr Cavallo recognised that in a country where corruption had become almost institutionalised, privatisation offered an opportunity for corruption on a grand scale. A discredited privatisation programme would risk credibility of the whole economic reform programme. His ministry set about developing new procedures to make the bidding process more transparent and to work on the regulatory regimes into which the companies would be privatised. The concept of separating the functions of policy-setting and regulation is not highly developed or widely understood in Argentina. However, using models mainly from the US and UK, the establishment of the regulatory regimes for gas, electricity and water is well-advanced. Mr Cavallo, seeking to get the telephone regulatory authority to enforce its regulations more aggressively, replaced the entire board. In this time, the government has also moved more aggressively to knock companies into better shape before they are sold. They raised tariffs as subsidies were slashed: in mid-1989 the income of public companies was 37 per cent lower than their spending. Large numbers of employees were also made redundant. According to Mr Juan Sanchez Arnau, assistant privatisation secretary, the total 230,000 workforce in state enterprises was cut by 25,000 last year. By the end of 1992, the job cuts will have grown to 55,000  -at a cost in redundancy payments of Dollars 1.2bn. The ministry is now calling for bids for two or three companies a month, under different procedures for each company. Controlling stakes of utilities will be sold to operators, with the government retaining the rest to be sold later on the domestic and international equity markets. Also to be privatised, although the timing and methods of sale are less clear, are 30-odd companies owned by the defence ministry. Some of these are manufacturing companies in poor shape. For the sake of the credibility of the privatisation programme, bankers in Buenos Aires say they hope the defence ministry privatisations are carried out with the same transparency as later ones in the economy ministry's programme. The delay ordered by Mr Cavallo will probably mean higher prices for the sales, as illustrated by the two telephone companies, Telefonica and Telecom. When the initial 60 per cent of these companies were sold at the end of 1990, the government obtained Dollars 214m in cash and Dollars 5bn in debt paper, at that time valued at 17-18 per cent of face value. When the remaining 30 per cent was sold to the local and international market (employees hold 10 per cent), last November and in February, it raised Dollars 2.057bn. The most ambitious privatisation is probably of YPF - Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, the state oil company. The state's parlous finances were such that the company was unable to explore for and develop fields. The first move to break YPF's monopoly was announced early in the Menem presidency. Concessions were offered to other companies in secondary fields. In the company's central fields, joint ventures were offered to foreign companies in return for an equity share in the oil produced. The deregulation of oil production and prices was announced, to come into effect at the start of 1991, a deadline which was kept in spite of the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Even though the monopoly was in effect broken, YPF remains the largest oil company in the country. Having already changed its legal status to that of a corporation which can suffer bankruptcy, it is now seeking congressional approval to get rid of non-strategic assets such as its shipping fleet, 50 drilling rigs and its seismic crews, and to open its capital up to outsiders. It has already reduced its workforce from around 52,000 in August 1990 to a current 21,000. By the end of this year, the number of employees will have fallen to 12,000, still regarded as above the optimum number. The Dollars 350m bill for termination of employment is being paid from cash flow. The company's balance sheet is also being cleaned up, with the writing off of significant debts. A complete overhaul of the company's operating and accounting systems is under way. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, said the aim is to transform YPF into an 'integrated, well-balanced oil company'. The plan is to sell over three years 50 per cent of the company on the domestic and international markets. A further 10 per cent will go to employees. According to Mr Estenssoro, the initial offering will be of at least 20 per cent of the company, which has been valued at about Dollars 8bn once the restructuring is complete. The shares will be sold in the US markets in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs) and listed in London and Buenos Aires. Since the New York market requires three years of internationally audited results, a sale there would not be possible before the 1992 figures have been published. (1991 profit was about Dollars 300m after tax, compared with Dollars 70m in 1990, on revenues of about Dollars 5bn.) Another element in the plan is to transfer ownership of the oil properties (once the concessions have run out) to the provinces, and a settlement of a legal battle between the state and the provinces over royalties for past oil production. This debt over about Dollars 3bn may be paid in bonds convertible into the remaining 39 per cent of the shares of YPF, shares which could in time find their way on to the market.</p>

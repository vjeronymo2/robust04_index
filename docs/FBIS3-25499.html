			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Gather Strength to Preserve Peace -- "As South Africa enters  the last, nailbiting phase of its transition to democracy, it  may be wise to assume that the election will go ahead in the  teeth of opposition from elements of the Freedom Alliance.  Almost certainly that opposition will employ violent methods,"  an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 20  February on page 24 notes. "The horrific murder of 14 ANC  [African National Congress] canvassers in Natal serves notice of  what lies ahead." However, "talk of `civil war' is both  exaggerated and premature." "Stress fractures are beginning to  show in the ranks" of the Freedom Alliance. In Natal Chief  Buthelezi's moderates are "falling away" and "among the white  right-wingers there are two clearly defined factions led by  General Constand Viljoen and by Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg (with the  raving Eugene Terreblanche usurping leadership as the posturing  becomes more extreme)." "The murder of the ANC canvassers (and  the continuing assassination of Inkatha leaders, for that  matter) suggests that intervention cannot be far off." It would  be "unconscionable" for any "opponent of the election" to use  "the resources of the state, whether Bantustan police or rural  police and military reservists, to conduct a campaign of  violence against the state. The first step is to ensure that  such resources are under proper control."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   Business Responsibliity -- An editorial in Johannesburg  SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 February on page 6 notes that  "major business giants have been generating colossal profits  under the protection of an apartheid system." "Business must  realise that the buzz-word `free market economy' makes little or  no sense sense to more than half of the economically active  population which remains unemployed, to hundreds of thousands of  kids without schools, to millions of people without clean water  or access to health care facilities to name a few." "The main  protection of our new democracy will be in ensuring that the  majority of the population, tha main victims of apartheid's  injustices, end with a new more meaningful life with values that  underpin commitment and positive faith in a new society."  <H6>  SATURDAY STAR </H6>   Old South Africa -- "Standerton displayed the worst of the  old South Africa this week -- adamant refusal by a magistrate to  allow a protest march, police firing shotguns and teargas at a  massed crowd, trucks burning in the township. It was a sobering  reminder that processes that have taken hold in some places --  negotiated agreements to allow protest, minimum force by the  police, active monitoring and marshalling -- are not in place in  others," an editorial in the Johannesburg SATURDAY STAR in  English on 19 February on page 10 notes. "The powerful men in  plattleland [rural areas] towns say they don't want their towns  torn apart. But they don't seem to have learnt one of the main  lessons of the old South Africa -- that stifling protest is the  surest way to guarantee conflict."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Optimism Over Settlement Not Unfounded -- "The finer details  on the concessions which the government and the African National  Congress made this week are still unknown," says a page-22  editorial on the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20  February. "But in the main the package sounds like an important  step in the right direction of the creation of a true federation  in South Africa, with important powers to the provinces." "But  the unhappiness in the Freedom Alliance over the manner in which  the package was presented points to a deep-seated mistrust of  the parties that made the proposals. This suspicion will  hopefully be removed this week if the alliance can be convinced  of the honest intention that provinces must enjoy greater  autonomy in the new dispensation. It is also in the interests  of the members of the alliance that they in turn convince the  country of their honest intention to reach a settlement in order  to remove suspicion towards them." "A true federation is  essential if an inclusive solution is desired by all parties,"  warns RAPPORT. "No party with confederal ambitions should  disguise its goal behind pseudo federalism." "Initial  indications are that the latest proposals, `self-determination'  and all, still have not resolved the homeland issue. And it is  not easy. In the absence of concrete proposals in this regard,  the most sensible option of moderate right-wingers would be to  follow an evolutionary path towards the establishment of an own  territory. Clear demands must be presented, which can then be  entrenched in a new constitution. It is in this that people like  General Constand Viljoen and others need to take the lead.  Optimism over an historic constitutional agreement is there  thus not unfounded. But time is marching relentlessly on."    Choice for Freedom Alliance is Simple -- In an article on  page 23 of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "By the end of  the week the government and the African National Congress [ANC]  were able to heave a sigh of relief. They believe they are once  again on that very hallowed piece of earth, the moral high  ground, where every South African politician has for the past  few years been trying to get a foothold. To gain this moral  high ground, a politician or a party must be able to say to the  world, look, I did the right thing; whatever happens, my hands  are clean. So the government and the ANC feel they have arrived  there this week, with their package of concessions." "There was  much sympathy for the problems facing the two parties, given  their unbending negotiating partners who contunually moved the  goalposts." "The choice facing the Freedom Alliance is actually  simple: Do they want to go ahead with their all-or-nothing  attitude, or to they want to accept the concessions and use them  after the election for further bargaining? It is the latter  strategy which General Constand Viljoen was holding up to the  Afrikaner National Front when he was shouted down two weeks ago.  The new constitutional principle on self-determination as well  as a mechanism for the further consideration of a homeland after  the election provide the basis for this strategy. The alliance  does, however, not have too much time to decide what they are  going to do." "The government and the ANC insitst that the  election date is final and untouchable. We all know that in  politics nothing is final and untouchable -- but in the minds of  the government and the ANC that date is certainly written in  stone for now."</p>

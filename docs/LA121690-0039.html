			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW LEAR  </P> <P> So Norman Lear has decided to do his own brand of evangelism ("Divining the New  Lear" by Judith Michaelson, Dec. 2), sort of a cosmic mix of comedy and God.  </P> <P> We're all waiting to see whose "god" Lear will choose to ridicule. I think we  Bible-believing Christians have a good idea which one it will be.  </P> <P> DEBRA PEEPLEZ  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

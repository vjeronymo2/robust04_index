			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AFTER-TAX PROFIT DROPS 4.9% IN FIRST QUARTER  </P> <P> Manufacturers' after-tax profits totaled $28.6 billion in the first quarter of  the year, down $1.5 billion, or 4.9%, from the final quarter of 1989, the  Commerce Department said today.  </P> <P> After-tax profits averaged 4.2 cents on the dollar of sales in the first three  months of the year, a decline of 0.2 cents from the previous three months, the  department's Census Bureau said.  </P> <P> Sales in January, February and March totaled $683.5 billion, a gain of $2.9  billion or 0.4% from October, November and December, the department said in its  quarterly report.  </P> <P> The figures were adjusted to reflect seasonal factors.  </P> <P> Food and printing businesses contributed to a significant decline in  first-quarter profits for the makers of non-durable goods, the Commerce  Department said. Textiles declined too.  </P> <P> "Petroleum was also down," the government report said. "Fourth-quarter profits  benefited from downward adjustments to federal tax provisions not applicable to  this quarter."  </P> <P> But quarterly after-tax profits were on the rise for the makers of rubber  products, paper and chemicals, the department said.  </P> <P> In the category of durable goods -- expensive items made to last three or more  years, from aircraft to washing machines -- there were large increases in the  profits of manufacturers of transportation equipment, primary metals and  fabricated metals.  </P> <P> But quarterly after-tax profits for stone, clay and glass businesses declined  sharply, as did profits for makers of electrical machinery and non-electrical  machinery, the Commerce Department said.  </P></p>

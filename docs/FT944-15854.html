			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / US defence chief on China visit Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, got an enthusiastic welcome in Beijing yesterday at the start of a brief visit to discuss increased Sino-US defence co-operation. He is the first US defence chief to visit China since before the Tiananmen killings of June 1989, when China's military turned its guns on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's central square. Mr Perry was greeted by General Chi Haotian, China's defence minister, and other senior officers, including the deputy chief of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army and the commander-in-chief of the navy. The visit follows that of other senior US officials, including most recently Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, who headed an investment mission. These exchanges indicate a desire on both sides to upgrade a sometimes fractious relationship. Among issues to be discussed are regional security, arms control, defence conversion and peacekeeping activities. US officials say there are no plans to lift sanctions on military sales to China imposed after June 1989.</p>

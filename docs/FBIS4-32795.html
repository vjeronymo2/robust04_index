			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- The second council of the  Cuban Tourism Ministry is meeting today at the Convention Palace  in this capital to examine projects for this summer, Tourism  Minister Osmany Cienfuegos told PRENSA LATINA.    All activities of this recently created ministry are under  discussion, added Cienfuegos, who is also deputy chief of  government. He underscored the holding of this meeting days  after the conclusion of Cuba '94, the 15th International Tourism  Convention, at the Varadero Beach Resort.    Cuba wants to boost the so-called smokeless industry and  plans to attract 1 million visitors in 1995.    The names of new Cuban tourism businesses were presented  only  a week ago at Varadero. These businesses include three hotel  chains, namely the Gran Caribe, Horizonte Hotels, and Islazul,  and also the Marina Puertosol.    The meeting of the tourism ministry council involved  managers  and presidents of the main tourism institutions and companies  that are preparing to assume the challenge of competing in a  world market, in which Cuba has a strong appeal, in the opinion  of the meeting participants.</p>

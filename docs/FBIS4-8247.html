			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 12 (BTA) -- The dailies lead on  yesterday's NATO air strike, the second in two days, on Bosnian  Serb artillery positions in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde. The  dailies of the two major political forces frontpage stories  headlined: "NATO Planes Bomb Eastern Herzegovina on Two  Consecutive Days" (DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist  Party) and "Russia Wants No More Air Strikes on Bosnia"  (DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces).    "NATO's air strikes showed that the Serbs had obviously  misjudged the patience of the international community. After  what happened, there is hope that they will rethink their  position and will return to serious negotiations," says  ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential  extraparliamentary Agrarian Party. A signed commentary in the  trade union TRUD daily says: "Clearly, the bombs came too late  and no one will rise from the 250,000 dead lying in graves  across the former Yugoslav Republic." The author asks whether  there is an international conspiracy against the former  Yugoslavia, the Balkans and European unification and whether it  was pure chance that Washington and Moscow actually gave  Belgrade the signal to start the war with their declarations  that they "are firmly in favour of Yugoslavia's unity." "If we  survive, we will come to the age-old truth that it is all a  matter of division of labour: the big ones make a mess and the  small ones do the clean- up," the author of the TRUD commentary  says in conclusion.    A signed article in 24 CHASA, headlined "NATO Brings Us  Closer to New Balkan War," says: "Three rockets won't scare the  Serbs who fought Islam for centuries." According to STANDART  NEWS, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in "an angry telephone  conversation" with U.S. President Bill Clinton protested that  the United States had not consulted Russia before the attack;  "this was another way of saying that Russia dreams of being a  factor in the Balkans but that's all it was." "Recent  references to Malta and Yalta are not a coincidence," says a  signed commentary in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. The author says the  outcome of the latest developments is "likely to be reached  through secret diplomacy, as it has always been." A story in  KONTINENT headlined "Bomb-happy Love of Peace" recalls that  there have been dozens of cases when the Serbs were much more  deserving of air strikes. The author asks "whether (the reason  for the air strikes is that) the time had come to show the world  that NATO exists and works, that it still is under Washington's  command, that NATO commands the United Nations and involves the  world organization in a civil war?" "What are the Balkans  supposed to become in the future: a new Vietnam or a new  Afghanistan?" The KONTINENT commentary says in conclusion.</p>

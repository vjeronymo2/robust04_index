			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Adia reveals 43% fall in profits for year ADIA, the Swiss-based international employment and services group, yesterday disclosed a 43 per cent fall to SFr115m (Dollars 78m) in net consolidated earnings in 1990. Group turnover, including computer leasing operations, declined by 3.2 per cent to SFr5.8bn. Revenues from the core employment, security and inspection services rose 3 per cent to SFr4.1bn. Adia SA, the Lausanne-based holding company which operates to a fiscal year ending June 30, will announce its dividend in September. Adia said it would be lower than the SFr27.5 per bearer share and SFr5.50 per participation certificate paid on the previous account. Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailing group, and Swiss businessman Mr Klaus Jacobs acquired a 53 per cent stake in Adia last month. This followed efforts by Omni Holding, Adia's ultimate parent and the linchpin of entrepreneur Mr Werner Rey's financial empire, to resolve its debt problems. At the same time, Adia secured the reimbursement of an outstanding SFr192m loan to Omni. Mr Rey's company is under court protection while its assets are being realised. In 1990, Adia said, the operating environment had worsened in most of the countries in which it operates. Worst affected were the US and UK. Also, the dollar, in which Adia realises half its profits, depreciated throughout the year against the Swiss franc. Group operating earnings, excluding computer leasing, fell 26 per cent to SFr204m. Operating profit from temporary help and personnel services dropped 27 per cent to SFr149m. The 1990 figure includes SFr28m in provisions which, says Adia, would cover its remaining exposure to Omni.</p>

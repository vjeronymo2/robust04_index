			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Tearing a strip off the firm Joseph Jett, according to Kidder Peabody, exploited a loophole in the firm's accounting system to pull off his coup, writes Richard Waters. He traded what are known as 'stripped bonds' (or 'strips'). These are created by buying regular bonds (usually ones issued by the US government) and splitting them up into their component parts. The parts  - the coupons which give the right to interest payments at some time in the future, and the portion which represents the principal repayment when a bond matures - are then sold separately. Under some market conditions, these parts are worth more than the whole. Strange as it may sound, many traders on Wall Street make a good living by 'stripping' bonds in this way. Under different market conditions, they can also make money by buying up the pieces and turning them back into whole bonds again. For procedural purposes, only the US Federal Reserve, the central bank, can strip or reconstitute government bonds. So traders sell whole bonds to the Fed, and buy back 'strips' in their place - or vice versa. Jett's scheme enabled him to report a profit from the recreation of whole bonds out of the component pieces. In reality, Kidder says, the wholes he was creating were not worth more than the sum of the parts, and the profit was only an illusion. The scheme worked like this: Jett would enter what is known as a forward sale in Kidder's books. This showed that he was going to sell strips to the Fed at some date in the future. At the same time, he would enter a forward purchase, showing that on the same date he would buy back a whole bond from the Fed. The process allowed him to book an immediate profit. The loophole Jett had found lay in the way stripped bonds were valued in Kidder's accounts. The components of a stripped bond are traded at less than their face value. For instance, a coupon which gives the right to a payment of Dollars 100 in six months might only be worth Dollars 96 now. The other Dollars 4 is effectively an interest payment, compensating the holder for lending the US government Dollars 96 for six months. As the payment date approaches, the stripped bond rises in value, until it reaches Dollars 100 - the amount of cash that the coupon holder is guaranteed to receive at the end of the six months. Jett's forward trades showed what he was going to receive from selling the component parts in the future. In the example above, the trade might show that he would receive Dollars 98 in three months. Since this was higher than the Dollars 96 at which the coupon currently traded, Kidder's accounting system allowed him to book an immediate profit of Dollars 2. As the trade date drew closer, of course, the profit shown in Kidder's books gradually evaporated. So Jett entered more (and bigger) trades. He had to sustain the book profits he had already reported, and create new 'profits' as well. In the end, says Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive, there were 'tens of thousands of trades . . . the actual amounts were in the billions of dollars at that point'. As Kidder's staff struggled to reconcile these large volumes of transactions, the penny finally dropped.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: EC tries to step back from confrontation THE European Community yesterday stepped back from confrontation with the Clinton administration over the US Commerce Department's decision on Wednesday to impose stiff anti-dumping penalties on carbon steel producers from 19 countries. In remarks which tempered earlier condemnation of the decision to impose preliminary duties, the EC made clear that it did not wish to paint the new administration in Washington as protectionist. 'We do not believe there has been an ideological change,' said a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner. He guardedly welcomed a statement from Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, that the anti-dumping decision was based on mandated legal procedures, and was not a new policy statement from the Clinton administration. The Commission effort to calm the firestorm of criticism appeared aimed at leaving Sir Leon plenty of room for manoeuvre when he meets Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, in Washington on February 11. It may also have been aimed at averting unnecessary public attacks which could jeopardise already-fragile prospects for an agreement in the Gatt global trade talks. However, Eurofer, the European confederation of iron and steel industry, condemned the duties as 'extremely serious' for the future of international trade, as well as being unjust, unacceptable and arbitrary. In Paris, an angry government threatened to push for a EC complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the US duties. The move would block all French and German steel exports to the US, claimed Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group which is the world's second largest producer. That represented a loss of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) annual exports for European steel makers, including FFr1.5bn (Pounds 182.3m) of sales from Sollac, Usinor Sacilor's flat products division. If confirmed, the duties would also force Usinor Sacilor to shed more jobs, on top of the 7,000 people who left the group last year. In Germany, Mr Rupert Vondran, head of the German Steel Federation, denounced the US decision as blatantly protectionist and called on the German government and the EC to confront it with firm action. He said the US measures would affect 600,000 tonnes of German steel exports worth just under DM500m (Pounds 205.7m). A further 6m tonnes of products from other steel producers barred from the US would increase pressure on European markets and exacerbate the problems which have thrown the European steel industry into recession, he said. He said German steel companies had already curbed their deliveries to the US last year. They remained 40 per cent below quotas allocated to them by the US administration. The US was trying 'to settle domestic problems at the expense of foreign trade partners'. He said price leaders on the US markets were not foreign steel importers but the local mini-mills, which enjoyed favourable costs and had lifted market share from 14 to 24 per cent in the last few years. In London, the department of Trade and Industry described the US measures as 'protectionist' and 'an outrageous harassment'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had written to Mr Brown saying the move was unjustified and disproportionate. Privately, senior EC officials were seething yesterday at the US decision, which comes as Europe's steel producers are suffering from falling prices and cheap imports from eastern Europe. They expressed most irritation at the way EC producers had been penalised during a period including the 10 years to March 1992, when a 'voluntary' restraint agreement for steel between the US, the EC and other leading steel exporters was in force.</p>

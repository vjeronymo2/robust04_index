			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Last will and testament of Robert Maxwell I, IAN ROBERT MAXWELL of Headington Hill Hall, Oxford, England, publisher, hereby revoke all Wills and Testamentary Dispositions heretofore made by me and declare this to be my last Will. I appoint my wife, Elisabeth Jeanne Maxwell; Ellis Freedman, attorney-at-law of the State of New York; my sons, Ian and Kevin Maxwell; my daughter, Christine Malina; and each of my other children who shall be actively engaged in the executive senior management (ie being a Director) of any of the group of companies owned or controlled by the Pergamon Holding Foundation (PHF), or any other companies in publishing, printing, communications or related fields that are associated with any of the said companies (collectively hereinafter referred to as the Pergamon Group (PG)) at the time of my death, to be the Executors of this my Will; provided, however, that upon Mr Freedman's attaining the age of 70 or ceasing to be actively engaged in the practice of law, whichever shall first occur, he may be removed by a written instrument signed by a majority of the other Executors then serving. The term 'actively engaged' as used in the preceding sentence shall be construed to mean full time employment and hold the position of Director in at least one of the operating companies in the Pergamon Group. If at any time neither my said wife nor Mr Freedman are serving as Executors, a majority of the remaining Executors may appoint one or more persons to serve as successor Executors in their place. If at any time there shall be less than four Executors serving, they or a majority of them shall have the right to appoint one or more successor Executors. I direct my Executors to arrange for my burial in an orthodox Jewish cemetery in accordance with orthodox Jewish rites in Jerusalem. I direct that the cash legacies to individuals hereinbelow provided shall be paid as soon after my death as may be practicable and free of all duties and taxes payable on my death. I give to my dear wife, Elisabeth Jeanne Maxwell, all my personal chattels as defined in form two of the Statutory Will Forms 1925, not otherwise hereby or by any Codicil hereto specifically disposed of, and the sum of Pounds 500,000, if she shall survive me. I give to each of my children who shall survive me the sum of Pounds 200,000. In the event that any of my children shall not survive me the legacy given to that child shall be paid in equal shares to his or her issue surviving me, per stirpes. I give the sum of Pounds 150,000 to my sister, Sylvia Rosen. In the 'Fund C to encourage and assist capable young people in the setting up of their own businesses in the fields of media, communications and information' event that my sister, Sylvia Rosen, shall not survive me, the legacy of Pounds 150,000 given to her shall be paid in equal shares to her issue surviving me, per stirpes. I give the sum of USDollars 100,000 each to my niece, Helene Atkin, and my nephew, Michael Atkin, if they shall survive me. I give to Jean Baddeley, in recognition of her many years of loyal service and hard work, the sum of Pounds 100,000 if she shall survive me. If any beneficiary under my Will shall be bankrupt at the date of my death any amount that he or she would otherwise have received under my Will shall be held on protective trusts for such beneficiary under Section 33 of the Trustee Act 1925 instead of absolutely for such beneficiary. If any beneficiary under my Will shall contest its validity or the validity of any of its provisions such beneficiary shall if the Will or such provisions are upheld be entitled to one thousand pounds only instead of the gift the beneficiary would otherwise have had. All gifts to any beneficiary who is an individual are conditional upon a majority (including my wife if then living) of the Executors of this my Will stating in writing not later than two years after my death that in their opinion the beneficiary in question has not been guilty of conduct tending to bring my family or the Pergamon Group into disrepute or otherwise harmful to my family and failing such instrument such gift shall fall into my residuary estate. I give to an orthodox synagogue or Beth Midrash in Israel to be selected by the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, as an endowment to ensure that prayers be said in perpetuity for my parents, my sisters and brother and myself on the anniversaries of our deaths, or any other date chosen by the said Chief Rabbi such amount as may be needed for that purpose. In the case of a gift to a person under the age of 18 years the receipt of their parent or guardian shall be a good discharge. I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate after payment of all liabilities of my estate and any duties or taxes payable on my death to the trustees of a new trust to be called 'The Maxwell Family Charitable Trust' intended at the date of this my Will to be set up in the near future if the same shall be constituted at the date of my death (failing which I give devise and bequeath the same to my Executors) in each case upon trust to divide the same in four equal parts (funds A, B, C and D respectively) and to hold such funds and to apply the income of each of such Funds to the following uses and purposes: 1 Fund A to provide financial assistance to the people of Israel in the defence to the State of Israel. 2 Fund B in support of primary scientific and medical research in the following areas: (a) Assisting in the eradication of cancer, especially to favour those researchers who are attempting to alter the behaviour of cancer cells to become benign or to convert themselves into the defenders, rather than the attackers, of the biological system; (b) The eradication of heart disease; (c) Research on the human brain, looking to a better understanding of the brain as a way of curing and controlling dementia and Alzheimer's disease and the restoration of brain functions to persons suffering severe head injuries. 3 Fund C to encourage and assist capable young people in the setting up of their own businesses in the fields of media, communications and information, on the understanding that they will contribute 10 per cent of the equity of their businesses to Fund C on receipt of the grant and will ultimately refund to Fund C the monies advanced if they are successful. The Trust shall be required to use the income received from such equity participation or the sale thereof for the further expansion of this programme. The Trust shall hold an annual prize-giving symposium at a place to be designated by the Trust and to be organised in connection with a world young entrepreneurs' forum which will be held under the auspices of 12 to 20 of the world's leading businessmen invited to serve by the Chairman of the Pergamon Group (or if there is no such Chairman, the Chairman of the principal operating company in the Group). 4 Fund D to fund the efforts of such individuals in the social and behavioural sciences, including politics, whose ideas in the opinion of a panel of distinguished advisers in those fields to be selected by the Chairman of the Pergamon Group (or if there is no such Chairman, the Chairman of the principal operating company in the Group), would contribute to the avoidance of war and conflicts between nations, the elimination of racial hatred, and making the primary, secondary and tertiary educational systems more practical in the preparation of children and students for a life of change that will better enable them to contribute both to the creation of wealth and the enjoyment of leisure. The Trust shall use its best endeavours to link together the two groups of young people to be benefited under the provisions of this paragraph 4 and the preceding paragraph 3, by bringing them together in the annual conference mentioned above. If in any year the entire income of any of the Funds is not used for the purposes aforesaid, the surplus shall be transferred to the reserve of the Fund in question and become part of its principal. It is my hope that the Pergamon Holding Foundation, whose assets I have helped to build up to their present massive capacity, will commit themselves to support all of the foregoing purposes. The Trust shall maintain a small professional staff responsible for encouraging and supporting these programmes and ensuring their worldwide dissemination. I direct that all my shares of stock of any companies in which I may own a controlling interest and of all companies in the Pergamon Group that my said Executors may receive shall continue to be held by my said Executors and shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of by them except as part of the distribution of my estate; provided that the foregoing direction shall not preclude the sale or other disposal of individual companies, when compelling business or political considerations so dictate. The provisions of Clauses 4, 8 and 10 of a Declaration of Trust dated 21 December 1986 constituting the Maxwell Charitable Trust shall, so far as capable of so applying, apply to the Trusts of this Will as if incorporated herein in extenso. 'Fund D to fund the efforts of individuals whose ideas . . . contribute to the avoidance of conflicts between nations, the elimination of racial hatred' In the event of any dispute or difference amongst my Executors, the decision of a majority shall control; any deadlock shall be resolved by lot. I desire and declare that Jean Baddeley shall continue to be employed in and about the management of my estate and that such engagement be upon the most generous terms of compensation that may be deemed appropriate. No Executor may be liable for any loss or breach of trust not attributable to his own dishonesty and no Executor shall be bound to take any proceedings against a co-Executor or former Executor or his personal representatives for any breach or alleged breach of trust committed or suffered by any such co-Executor. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand to this and the six (6) preceding pages this 12th day of July, nineteen hundred and eighty-seven.

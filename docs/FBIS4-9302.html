			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference given in Prishtina today,  Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, said that  the Kosovar-Albanian border, where the concentration of the  Serbian Army forces continues, is becoming more and more  dangerous for the Albanians and expressed his regret over the  murder of the two unarmed Albanian nationals. For more, Ramadan  Mucolli from Prishtina:    [Mucolli] Speaking about the international community's  stance toward the Kosova issue, President Rugova said that in  face of the situation prevailing in Gorazde, Kosova was  mentioned as a possible target of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia, which requires a solution. He mentioned the  viewpoints of the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher on the  danger of the explosion of war in Kosova and Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] if the efforts  for the realization of the project on Greater Serbia still  continue.    President Rugova hailed the commitment of President Clinton  for a broad intervention in Bosnia in order to defend security  areas. On this occasion, he drew the attention that if violence  and repression are legalized, there will be problems in the  Balkans and the whole of Europe and that the principles of the  international institutions and the United Nations not to reward  violence and aggression, but the efforts for peace, agreement,  and understanding will be devolved.    President Rugova said that if a top international summit is  held with the United States, the European Union, and Russia on  the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia, we will  persistently ask that Kosova unfailingly be part of this  solution, because it was a federal unit of former Yugoslavia  with equal status to other units and, being a nerve center of  the crisis, it will be a continuous danger if not solved on the  basis of the political will of the people and in the Balkan  context.    President Rugova reiterated his demand that Kosova be placed  under the protection of the international community and  expressed his hope that the peaceful policy of Albanians will be  rewarded.</p>

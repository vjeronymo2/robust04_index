			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Summer Festivals: A big year for Pesaro and major coups in Seville MUNICH July 6 - 31 Festspielkasse der Bayerischen Staatsoper, Maximillianstrasse 11, D-8000 Munich 22, Germany. Tel: (89) 221 316 The opera festival offers new productions of Carmen (by Lina Wertmuller, with Agnes Baltsa, conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli) and, in the small, delightful Cuvilies-Theater, a rare modern revival of Henze's Prinz von Homburg (conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, with Francois Le Roux, Helga Dernesch and Peter Schreier). Otherwise, it is the Munich formula as usual: end-of-season offerings performed by glossy names on little or no rehearsal to often scrappy, lacklustre effect. Among them are La forza del destino, Fidelio, Peter Grimes, Dvorak's Dimitrij, Der Rosenkavalier and Boris Godunov, and Strauss's Intermezzo in the Cuvilies. PESARO July 31 - August 18 Rossini Opera Festival, Via Rossini 37, 61100 Pesaro, Italy. Tel 721-30161 Fax 721-30979 This is Pesaro's big year - the bicentenary of its most famous son. Rossini will be celebrated in four opera productions: Il barbiere di Siviglia with Cecilia Bartoli as Rosina, Semiramide conducted by Rossini musicologist Alberto Zedda, La scala di seta with a cast of young Rossini specialists and Il viaggio a Reims in the celebrated Abbado-Ronconi production. There will also be a rare staging of the Cantate per I Borboni conducted by Riccardo Chailly. PRAGUE May 12 - June 1 Prague Spring Festival, Hellichova 18, 11800 Praha 1, Czechoslovakia. Tel 2-530293 Fax 2-536040 Despite being swamped with tourists, Prague at festival time is still an attractive prospect. Before the revolution, it was a showcase for Czech and east European culture. Now it gives local audiences a chance to hear western artists whose visits were strictly rationed under the Communists. Guests in the remaining two weeks of this year's festival include Maurizio Pollini, the Hilliard Ensemble, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and radio orchestras from Berlin and Copenhagen. But there is also some more exotic fare, such as Massenet's oratorio La Vierge at St Vitus Cathedral, the Prague Madrigalists singing sacred music by Zelenka, and the Suk Chamber Orchestra playing lesser-known Czech composers. Ulf Schirmer conducts the Czech Philharmonic in the world premiere of a new work by Jan Hanus, and Vaclav Neumann conducting Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No 5 at the final concert. RAVENNA June 22 - July 21 Ravenna Festival, Via Gordini 27, 48100 Ravenna, Italy. Tel 544-482494 Fax 544-36303 Riccardo Muti has hired the Vienna Philharmonic for the opening concert, and Georg Solti brings the Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra at the end. In between are concerts conducted by Chailly, Pretre and Berio, and two opera stagings: Donizetti's Poliuto (produced by Pizzi, with a cast led by Tiziana Fabbricini and Dennis O'Neill) and Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto. ST LOUIS May 22 - June 21 Opera Theater of St Louis, with its picnics on the lawn, intimate theatre conditions, performances all in English and general air of relaxed bonhomie, is such a pleasure to attend that its rigorous performance standards (many of America's best singers find their feet here) and adventurous repertory are a special bonus. This year's new work is Judith Weir's The Vanishing Bridegroom (US premiere), alongside Madame Butterfly, The Turk in Italy and Britten's Dream. SALZBURG July 27 - August 30 5010 Salzburg, PO Box 140. Tel 043 662 8045. This year the new festival director, Gerard Mortier, really begins to leave his mark on the festival schedule. A much sharper profile is given to the theatre offerings, with a new production of Julius Caesar by Peter Stein as particular coup; and the choice of operas reflects a diversity and boldness of choice unknown during the Karajan years. New productions of Janacek's House of the Dead (staged by Klaus Michael Gruber, conducted by Abbado, with Nicolai Ghiaurov, Barry McCauley and Philip Langridge) and Messiaen's St Francois d'Assise (staged by Peter Sellars, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, with Jose van Dam) stand out among the big-name revivals of La clemenza di Tito, Figaro, Die Frau ohne Schatten and Salome. Pierre Boulez leads a concert series with the Ensemble Intercontemporain; the Los Angeles Phil, St Petersburg Phil and CBSO (under Simon Rattle) are among the visiting orchestras; and recitals by Margaret Price, Dmitry Hvorostovsky, Felicity Lott and Fischer-Dieskauadd to the concert bounty. The theatre offering this year is small but classy: a new production of Julius Caesar by Peter Stein, the first German production of Stanislaw Wyspianski's Wesele (The Wedding), and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Jedermann (Everyman), starring Helmut Lohner, performed outdoors at the Domplatz. SANTA FE July 3 - August 29 PO Box 2408 Santa Fe, New Mexico 87504. Tel 0101 505 982 3855 There are new productions of Don Giovanni and The Beggar's Opera this year together with revivals of Fledermaus and Rosenkavalier; nothing about that fare to send opera fanatics hot foot to deepest New Mexico. But the American premiere of Von Bose's The Sorrows of Young Werther provides novelty and genuine interest, and then there is the place itself - the most spectacular setting for an opera house, surely, anywhere in the world. SAVONLINNA July 1 - 31 Olavinkatu 35, SF-57130 Savonlinna. Tel: 057 514 700 The main reason for a visit to the Finnish lakeside opera festival continues to be the great stone castle courtyard in which it takes place: a magnificent venue for opera. The programme itself - new Fidelio production, Aida and Magic Flute revivals, touring American Porgy and Bess - lacks the panache of the 1970s and early '80s; it is hoped the recent appointment as festival director of Jorma Hynninen, a great Finnish singer long associated with the venture, will do something to revive the pioneering spirit. SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN June 28 - August 23 Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Postfach 3840, D-2300 Kiel 1, Germany. Tel 431-567080 Fax 431-569152 This young festival, masterminded by pianist and impresario Justus Frantz, is like a musical mosaic, spread across some of the most attractive towns in north Germany, in venues which give a more intimate festival atmosphere than most. The North German Radio Symphony Orchestra opens the festival in Lubeck (under Gunter Wand), and gives the closing performances of Britten's War Requiem with John Eliot Gardiner. The festival orchestra will be conducted by Maazel and Solti, and visiting ensembles include the CBSO with Rattle, the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra with Jarvi, the Stockholm Sinfonietta and the Lithuanian and Norwegian Chamber Orchestras. Recitalists include Rudolf Buchbinder, the Labeque Sisters, Bruno Leonardo Gelber, Peter Schreier and Hermann Prey. SEVILLE to October 12 EXPO '92, Seville. Tel (34 5) 448 0404. This is a truly international festival with the major coups for Seville of an Ingmar Bergman-directed Peer Gynt and Giogio Strehler's production of Goldoni's Le Barruffe Chiozzotei. Seville's Central Theatre, specially built to play host to 'new theatre tendencies' from across Europe, promises several innovative blockbusters: the premiere of Steven Berkoff's Como los Griegos, Greek; Robert Wilson's The Black Rider, the heady Tom Waits/William Burroughs rock musical/cabaret that was the star of last year's Berlin festival, and Jerome Deschamp's Lapin Chausseur from Paris. Spanish theatre is well represented in both native and foreign offerings; the Georgian Rustavelli Theatre visits with Calderon's Life is a Dream and the Royal National theatre with Fuente Ovejuna SPOLETO June 24 to July 12 Associazione Festival Dei Due Mondi, Via Cesare Beccaria 18, 00196 Roma, Italy. Tel 6-3210 288 Fax 6-3200 747 Spoleto offers a hot, hectic round-the-clock collage of events, spearheaded this year by two opera productions - a rather odd attempt to revive Visconti's 1959 staging of Donizetti's Le duc d'Albe and a new staging of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg directed by Spoleto's ageless festival supremo Gian Carlo Menotti. The dance programme - in the atmospheric settings of a Roman amphitheatre and a medieval church - embraces the ultra-traditional Bolshoy Ballet, the contemporary Maguy Marin Company from France and a troupe led by black American choreographer Bill T Jones. The Italian-language drama programme, spread among Spoleto's cafe-style theatres, totals seven plays, including a world premiere by Carlo Repetti and Schnitzler's one-act Baccanale. THREE CHOIRS August 22-29 Festival Office, Community House, College Green, Gloucester GL1 2LX It is Gloucester's turn to stage what most be one of Britain's oldest festivals, and certainly the most hidebound: no prizes for predicting that the programmes will include Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Herbert Howells, with Lennox Berkeley and Gerald Finzi as strong probabilities too. But there is also Janacek's Glagolitic Mass and Durufle's Requiem this year as well as some commissions: from Hugh Wood for brass ensemble, and Philip Cannon for the massed choirs of the three cathedrals. VERONA July 1 - August 30 Arena di Verona, Piazza Bra 28, 37100 Verona, Italy. Tel 45-590966 Fax 45-590201 Verona, the home of spectacular,open-air opera, has three Verdi operas and one Puccini this summer. The first cast for Don Carlo includes Luis Lima, Aprile Millo and Renato Bruson. There are four Aidas to choose from, and Piero Cappuccilli sings the title role in Nabucco. Neil Shicoff and Cecilia Gasdia look the most attractive pairing in La boheme. VIENNA May 9 - June 14 Vienna Festival, Lehargasse 11, A-1060 Vienna. Tel 1-586 1676 Fax 1-586 167649 Muti, Berio, Giulini, Maazel, Ashkenazy and Previn will conduct concerts in the Musikvereinsaal over the next four weeks. Brendel, Studer, te Kanawa and Prey are among the soloists. Opera is limited to the Brussels production of Il barbiere di Siviglia and Harry Kupfer's Komische Oper staging of Carmen. The theatre programme looks better. Claus Peymann opened the festival with the world premiere of Peter Handke's Die Stunde da wir nichts voneinander wussten (The time when we knew nothing of each other); there is a Brechtian Macbeth from Katharina Thalbach, Romeo Castellucci's controversial Amleto about a vanishing Hamlet, and Gunter Kramer's directs feminist Frederike Roth's new play. Major productions continuing this year's European love-affair with Spanish theatre include: the musical Zarzuela], Lorca's Blood Wedding in a Romany version; a Thomas Langhoff Calderon premiere, and the Flemish Need company's drama about Hemingway and Spain, Invictos, which can play in four different languages. WARSAW September 18 - 27 Rynek Starego Miasta 27, 00272 Warsaw. Tel/Fax 22-310607 Despite Poland's acute economic and political problems, the Warsaw Autumn Festival remains one of Europe's premier contemporary music events. Stockhausen will be present this year to supervise three evenings of his own music. Henze, Kagel, Birtwistle, Donatoni and Penderecki are also represented. The Matrix Ensemble will perform Michael Finnissy's Vaudeville, and Elgar Howarth conducts a Ligeti orchestral concert. WEXFORD October 22 ' November 8 Theatre Royal, High Street, Exford, Ireland. Tel: 0353 53 22144 The world's most convivial and adventurous opera festival continues this year in classic form, with three well-contrasted choice from the favoured out-of-the-way repertory. The Comedy of Errors by Stephen Storace, Mozart's associate, plays in repertory with Mascagni's Piccolo Marat and Marschner's historically important 19th century rarity, Der Vampyr. Also dotted into the schedule: concerts by the cream of Wexford's young singers. ZURICH May 29 - July 7 International June Festival, Praesidialabteilung der Stadt Zurich, Postfach, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland. Tel 1-221 2283 Fax 1-212 1404 The focus is on Brazil, a theme better suited to photographic exhibitions, literary readings and film than music. There is a sprinkling of Villa-Lobos and some little-known 20th century Brazilian composers, but otherwise the music programme goes its own way, with a new staging of Capriccio at the Opera House, some starrily-cast repertory performances and a concert line-up including Anne-Sophie Mutter, Yuri Bashmet and Maurice Andre.</p>

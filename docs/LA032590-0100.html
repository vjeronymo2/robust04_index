			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: FIGHTING A RUN-DOWN FEELING  </P> <P> Several times since I have moved to La Quinta, I have left a car door open,  hence the interior light on, and gone out the next morning to a dead battery.  This is because the door from the garage into the house closes smartly against  the back of my Achilles' tendon, causing me to run to a chair and sit down and  grasp my ankle. This makes me forget that I have left the car door ajar. Thus,  the battery sinks slowly into silence.  </P> <P> But my friend Walt Wagner put one of those trip things at the bottom of the  door, which flops down and grips the floor, holding the door open. So I don't  know what happened to the battery yesterday morning except that it is basically  a Pasadena battery, and the sand and the heat have given it a poor attitude.  </P> <P> I called the Automobile Club of Southern California and asked if they'd send  someone to cope. I was all ready to go to a ladies' luncheon, which is  something I don't usually do.  </P> <P> This one, however, I wanted to attend because it was to include a daylong  seminar by the respected and entertaining antique authority Gwen Znerold, and  my hostess was a new friend.  </P> <P> I showered, dressed, went to the car and heard that terrible silence that means  the desert demons had struck again.  </P> <P> After half an hour or so, I heard the heartening sound of a repair truck and I  ran to greet its driver. He put those things that look like curling irons on my  battery and pushed the other end of the cord into a connection at the end of  his bumper. In a few minutes, he started the car.  </P> <P> He told me somberly that my destination was not far enough away to charge the  battery and that I should have it checked and maybe buy a new one as the  expired one was the original and had outlived its expected life.  </P> <P> Then, as he drove away, Jim, the handyman for Laguna de la Paz, appeared. A  visit from Jim is like Easter Bunny and Santa Claus arriving at the same time.  He can fix anything.  </P> <P> For a number of weeks, I have had several annoyances about the house. Neither  basin in the master bath would hold water. There was a furrow in the front lawn  where some fun-loving workman had driven and my front-porch light was smashed.  </P> <P> I certainly did not want to send Jim away, so I welcomed him and he fixed  everything but the porch light.  </P> <P> By now, two hours had gone by and the ladies were at the designated country  club learning about antique glass and I was just getting into the car.  </P> <P> I went to Indio, the hard-working town farther down the valley, and found the  service station from which the Auto Club man had been dispatched.  </P> <P> After several false starts, I managed to get a man who would listen to my  request to check my battery. He wheeled out a machine that looked like an  old-time radio. I kept expecting him to look at me with wonder like Uncle  Charlie, who used to say, "Shush. I think I got Denver."  </P> <P> I had known from that moment when the Auto Club man said I would have to have  the battery checked that I would be buying a new battery.  </P> <P> After half an hour in the heat, I said, "Why don't you just give me a new  battery?"  </P> <P> With that, he took the curling irons off and put a new battery in for the  customary $80.06.  </P> <P> I arrived at the lecture just as they broke for lunch. So I can't tell you  about the mysteries of antique glass. But I can tell you about dying and dead  batteries. The new one is no-maintenance. So was the other one.  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: First Option Bond returns - National Savings / The Budget and You THE First Option Bond returned from exile this week as chancellor Norman Lamont said that National Savings is expected to make an 'important contribution' to government funding. But the new rate on the bond, available from Monday, is just 4.75 per cent net, equivalent to 6.34 per cent gross for one year, on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. The rate payable on Pounds 20,000 and above will be 5.05 per cent net. This rate is well below the 7.75 per cent net given when National Savings launched the bond last July, provoking protests from building societies over what they regarded as unfair competition. It was withdrawn in November. The return on the new bond can be bettered by other fixed-rate products on the market. According to Moneyfacts, Cheshire's one-year Tempo bond is paying 5.25 per cent net on Pounds 5,000 and 5.8 per cent net on Pounds 25,000. The rate on Portman building society's one-year fixed-interest bond is 4.9 per cent net (minimum deposit Pounds 500)while Alliance &amp; Leicester pays 5 per cent net on its two-year fixed-rate bond, with a minimum deposit of Pounds 5,000. Savers have no access to their money when tied up in these bonds - but they do with National Savings, although the penalty is that they will get no interest. There are no signs yet of panic among the societies, although there is concern at the rise of the limits on National Savings purchases. 'We have for some time been concentrating our efforts on trying to maintain the returns available to our savers affected by falling interest rates, particularly those living off interest on savings,' said Jim Birrell, chief executive of Halifax. 'We shall do all we can to remain competitive, but the new range of NS changes will influence our views on future mortgage rates.' Nationwide added: 'At present, we can offer competitive products. But if they (NS) changed their products, we would have to look at our savings rates and, at the extreme, it would put pressure on mortgage rates.' Some rather better news is that the limit for the 40th-issue savings certificates, and for the sixth index-linked certificates, has been doubled to Pounds 10,000. The limit for income bonds has been raised five-fold to Pounds 250,000, and from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 for Capital bonds. The limit for premium bonds will double to Pounds 20,000 from April 13, and the maximum amount that can be held in the investment account will rise from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 100,000 from May 10.</p>

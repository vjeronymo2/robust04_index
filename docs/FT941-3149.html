			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Sheikh buys Nordic oil group The Nordic region's biggest oil refining group, OK Petroleum, was yesterday sold to Sheikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi, a Saudi Arabian businessman, for Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m) including debt. The deal illustrates a growing trend for state-owned oil companies from petroleum exporting countries to buy downstream assets in Europe, Asia and the US. But the OK sale is being carried out through a private company, Corral Petroleum Holdings. Equity proceeds of Dollars 750m will be split between OK's three owners: the Swedish state (24 per cent), the KF co-operative group (52 per cent) and Neste, the Finnish oil company (24 per cent). The sale furthers the Swedish government's privatisation programme and allows KF and Neste to concentrate on core and majority-owned businesses. Kleinwort Benson acted for all three sellers. The Saudi link should provide the group with strong financial backing for further investment. 'Our intention is that OK Petroleum should grow within its current area of operation,' said Mr Ghazi Habib, who will represent the sheikh on the OK board. Mr Habib is a former head of Samarec, the Saudi refining and crude marketing company which was merged with Saudi Aramco last year. OK, which will retain its Swedish base and management has two refineries on Sweden's west coast, with a combined refining capacity of 265,000 barrels a day. It accounts for 23 per cent of the Nordic refining capacity, and around 60 per cent of output is exported. The deal also includes storage facilities, ownership stakes in several hundred retailing outlets and some upstream operations. It excludes around 650 OK petrol stations which are owned independently. OK Petroleum was founded in 1986 by a consortium including Neste. Last year net profits rose to SKr552m (Pounds 47m) from SKr41m while sales increased to SKr19.5bn from SKr16.0bn. Sheik Al-Amoudi, a member of a merchant family from Jeddah, has not previously been involved in the oil industry, although he has had business dealings in Sweden for more than 20 years, including involvement with the construction company ABV. Mr Alan Marshall, oil analyst with Swiss Bank Corp in London, said he expected that the buyers would use OK Petroleum to build market share in Scandinavia and Europe. 'This will make life tougher for established players,' he predicted.</p>

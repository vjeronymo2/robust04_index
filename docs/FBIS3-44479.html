As a result of the timely and  powerful intervention, grain prices in these localities have  tended to decline, and people's sentiments have stabilized.  This newspaper's reporters stationed on the mainland yesterday  sent the following reports on the grain conditions and public  feelings from various localities.  <H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Kung Shuang-yin (7255 7175 0603)  From Beijing </H3>   The Beijing Municipal Government has adopted measures to  check grain prices and stabilize commodity prices over the last  few days. The municipal government called an emergency meeting  at which Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC  Committee, attended and made a speech. After the meeting, four  working groups led by Chen Xitong, Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing  Municipality, Zhang Jianmin, chairman of the Beijing Municipal  People's Congress Standing Committee, and other leaders  inspected local conditions on carrying out various measures to  curb the prices of grain, edible oil, vegetables, eggs, and pork.    There has been wide coverage in the mainland's newspapers,  television programs, and broadcasts over the last few days  concerning the conditions of curbing grain prices in various  localities across the country.    An authoritative source pointed out: It is necessary to  learn to regulate and control grain prices in markets with  market economic measures. When it is necessary to sell grain in  large quantities, the state must do it, and the same is the case  with purchases. The greater fluctuations the grain price is  undergoing, the more necessary it is to resolutely break through  regional blockades and guard against trade monopolies.    In accordance with economic experts' proposals, the state  has  adopted stringent measures to curb grain prices.    According to a source here, following the macroeconomic  regulation and control measures adopted by the state, the rising  tendency of grain prices has been controlled and even dropped to  a certain extent.  <H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Ho Sui-yi (0149 4482 1837) From  Guangzhou </H3>   The people in Guangzhou, where control over grain prices was  lifted long ago, faced the recent national situation of grain  price fluctuation with a collective presence of mind. After the  agitation of "rushing to buy rice for fear of its possible price  rise" in the latter half of last month, the public feelings have  stabilized now and the situation of grain markets has returned  to normal.    Explaining the reasons that caused the fluctuation in grain  purchasing, a relevant person responsible for Guangzhou's  Commercial Committee said: News has spread that the state will  raise the grain procurement price, which has been on the low  side, as of next March -- the beginning of a new fiscal year for  grain. As a result, peasants have been reluctant to sell their  grain in the current harvest season, hoping that they will be  able to sell it at a higher price after the state's  readjustment. Now is precisely the time for various localities  and cities to fulfill their tasks of procuring and storing  public grain, thus causing some tension in supply and demand as  there were strong demands on one hand and reluctant sales on the  other.    Under the above circumstances, the overall grain price in  Guangzhou, where the practice of price fluctuation in line with  market conditions has been in effect for a long time, increased  by 30 percent over the first half of this year, and the price of  quality rice rose by a larger margin, though the price of  standard rice maintained the level of 1 to 1.20 yuan per jin.  But the Guangzhou people, who are accustomed to eating quality  rice, still wanted to store a few bags of quality rice at home,  as prompted by the mentality of "storing up grain against  famine." As a consequence, the agitation of rushing to buy rice  occurred a short time ago.    The Guangzhou Grain Bureau has taken measures to ensure a  sufficient stock of rice and edible oil in various grain shops  throughout the city and to increase the supply of rice in  greater varieties. Grain shops are prohibited from taking  advantage of market demands to raise grain prices. Besides, the  city's Administration for Industry and Commerce has been  requested to exercise supervision over private rice stalls.    When asked whether or not the method of rationing grain and  edible oil will be employed, the source from the Commercial  Committee indicated that "it would not consider reusing the  typical method of the planned economy," and that "it was  absolutely unnecessary to backtrack by practicing the old system  as there is sufficient grain in stock in Guangzhou, and numerous  and convenient supply centers."  <H5>  Report by Staff Reporter Kan Ku (1626 6253) From Shanghai </H5>   Like other cities on the mainland, the wind of  panic-purchasing and hoarding of rice also engulfed Shanghai  recently, so that long shopping queues with up to hundreds of  people, which have not been seen for years, were seen in front  of grain shops again. In some densely populated residential  areas, grain shops were unable to close their doors at the end  of business hours due to the small number of grain shops and  large number of buyers.    The government here has determined to resolve the problem by  informing the people that it is not necessary to buy and hoard  grain as there are adequate supplies, instructing the  state-owned grain shops to refuse to sell grain to big buyers  and peddlers, and turning on a green light to all the  grain-carrying trucks so that they can go freely through all  city districts even in daytime. In this way the wind of panic  purchasing and hoarding of rice in Shanghai has subsided.  <H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Yang Hsiao-yang (2799 1420 3152)  From Fuzhou </H3>   The State Council has decided to put 5 billion jin of grain  into markets in the near future, of which 100 million jin of  unprocessed grain will be transferred to Fujian. In this  regard, the Fujian Provincial Government has adopted appropriate  emergency measures to ensure the proper arrangements of grain in  Fujian's markets in light of the present market conditions.    It has been reported that the grain production in Fujian  this  year has been normal. Up to 20 December, the entire province  has fulfilled the annual task by 73 percent, with only 540  million jin unfulfilled. However, there is a considerably large  proportion of people who are still short of grain in quite a few  disaster-hit rural areas. It is anticipated that a population  of 4.46 million will be wanting in grain before the harvest next  year and the grain shortage will come to 800 million jin. Among  them, there is a "double shortage" population of 1.18 million  for whom 140 million jin of grain should be provided. The  provincial grain departments have indicated that they will  conscientiously shoulder the responsibility of dealing with  emergency rescue and providing disaster relief, make proper  arrangements for the people's lives in the disaster-stricken  areas before and after the Spring Festival, and stabilize the  rural markets while trying to be well-acquainted with the  disaster conditions.    Shi Xingmou, vice governor of Fujian Province, recently  called for relevant departments to transfer the exact volume of  100 million jin of unprocessed grain from Jiangxi to Fujian as  arranged, so as to replenish the stock and sell out at suitable  time.  <H5>  Report by Staff Reporter Shao Kan (6730 1626) From Changchun </H5>   Jilin Province, which has wrested the second highest grain  yield ever this year, has adopted various measures to accelerate  the progress of storing grain purchased by order so that 90  percent of such grain has been stored, and to check grain prices  in an effort to protect peasants' enthusiasm in selling grain so  that the grain price of the entire province has been relatively  stable with a slight increase.    According to the analysis of the provincial grain  department,  the situation in which the state has made funds available for  purchasing grain at negotiated prices and peasants have made  grain available for sales has emerged at present. The vast  number of peasants are reluctant to sell their grain because  they are optimistic about the quality of grain this year as its  moisture content is generally lower than previous years, and  they are not anxious to sell their grain for the easier handling  of the stock. Another reason is that peasants have more money  in hand due to their noticeable increase of revenue as a result  of the expanded area of cash crops in Jilin this year.    In a bid to curb grain prices, the Jilin Provincial  Government is taking effective measures to give positive  guidance to intensifying management of the grain market and  guarding against speculative acts in grain. Aiming at peasants'  reluctance to sell grain, the government has also done  meticulous work to protect their initiative and raise grain  prices appropriately.  <H3>  Report by Staff Reporter Liu Wen-yan (0491 2429 5333) From  Shenyang </H3>   As grain prices in various southern localities were rising  one after another, the price in northeast China was as stable as  usual. In Shenyang, a city and economic and cultural center in  northeast China, grain prices did not rise, the people were not  "panic- stricken," and their general mood was stable.    "When something happens, people will not be alarmed and  confused so long as they have grain in hand." This year, there  was an extraordinary bumper harvest in Liaoning, with the total  yield reaching 32 billion kg, the highest in history. The  Shenyang City Government has put in a lot of time and energy in  grasping the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects with very  satisfactory results. Now it has enough, and even surplus grain  and vegetables. This is an important factor of stabilizing  grain price in Shenyang.    However, pork prices rose in the last few days, as lean pork  and pork without skin and bone rose from 4.5 to six yuan and  three to four yuan per 500 grams respectively. An authoritative  person said: This is partly because the sales volume of pork has  increased owing to the peak consumption period now and partly  because some pig- raising households would not sell their pigs,  having anticipated a further price rise with the New Year and  Spring Festival drawing near.</p>

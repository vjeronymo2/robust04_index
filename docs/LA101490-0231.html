			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLEEK CHIC  </P> <P> To whom are you addressing this article? I myself am a physician and a working  woman, but your choice of clothes was insulting to the majority of the working  women out there.  </P> <P> Come on now, more than $1,000 for a jacket? It boggles the mind. Those prices  would be appropriate for a down payment for a car, not for working clothes.  </P> <P> Get with it. Most of us dress well, and we still have money to buy the  groceries.  </P> <P> DEBORAH R. ISHIDA  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Dortmund -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], has called for more  European Union funds for Germany. During his party's European  festival in Dortmund, the candidate for the chancellor's office  stated today that, in view of the economic situation, Germany is  paying too much for the European Union. "We have fallen back to  seventh place in the European prosperity scale. For this  reason, the return of European funds to Germany must increase,"  Scharping stressed on the sidelines of the SPD rally on the  occasion of the European elections, which was attended by  approximately 300,000 people, according to the police.    During his speech, Scharping advocated a stronger role of  the  European Parliament and rejected a "European central state with  excessive bureaucracy." The identity of the regions must be  preserved. With a view to European financial policies, the SPD  chairman pointed out that he prefers a stable German mark to an  unstable European currency that is introduced too early.  [passage omitted]</p>

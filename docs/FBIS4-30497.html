			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Burma Should Attend Meeting -- With Conditions"] </F>   [Text] It's a fait accompli. Like it or not, the  Government has made up its mind, perhaps a long time ago, to  invite Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council  representatives to next month's ASEAN Summit in Bangkok.    The invitation stands. The Government says it can't imagine  what the fuss is about -- Thailand's human rights groups and the  international community in general voicing their opposition to  the presence of an illegitimate government, notorious for its  blatant human rights abuses, at the prestigious annual regional  gathering. After all, says an Interior Ministry official:  "Slorc's participation (at the ASEAN meeting) is only  ceremonial."    But not everyone agrees. A panellist at a recent discussion  held by a group of human rights activists at Chulalongkon  University said: "The policy (constructive engagement) of  neighbouring countries, particularly Thailand, has partly  enabled the continuity of human rights abuses in Burma. "    Another said: "Human rights violations are a serious crime  since all mankind is created equally. We respect the rights of  Thai people, and we must respect those of Burmese."    They know what they are talking about. The latest rumblings  heard among Burmese expatriates in Bangkok is that their embassy  on Pan Road has recently been told (faxed) by Rangoon to  persuade Thai authorities to stop issuing work permits to its  nationals applying for jobs in Bangkok.    The gist of the seminar on "Human Rights Violation in Burma"  was that the Government ought to review its invitation to Burma,  and the subject of human rights in that country should be raised  for discussion at the ASEAN meeting. And if Slorc is to attend  the Bangkok session, then Burmese democratic representatives  should be extended the same privilege.    We believe the Government should give these suggestions some  serious thought. Unlike our unfortunate eastern neighbours, in  an open society like ours where we have a democratically elected  government and the freedom to express our opinions, it is only  fair we listen to both sides of the story.    Take up the challenge and invite the Burmese opposition as  well. If this country is to play host to a government not  recognised by its people, then it should also be willing to deal  with members of the National League for Democracy which were  elected by the Burmese people but ignored by a handful of  generals whose main concern is self-preservation.    This Government can no longer go on claiming -- nor can its  ASEAN partners, for that matter -- that it does not believe in  interfering in the "internal affairs" of a country. We are  involved. We became entangled with Burma's affairs the day the  "constructive engagement" policy was adopted.    Unlike most western and democratic governments which  advocate  isolation and sanctions to force the Burmese military regime to  honour the results of the 1990 elections in Burma, we instead  opted for the "gentle persuasion" approach to coax Slorc into  returning what they have stolen from the Burmese people. It has  been four years since Gen Saw Maung promised to honour Burma's  call for a democratic government.    If ASEAN is serious in wanting to see a democratic  government  in Burma, then it should seize the opportunity at next month's  meeting and invite the Burmese government-in-exile and members  of the Democratic Alliance of Burma to sit down together with  Slorc representatives to thrash out their differences.    Should Slorc agree to this meeting, we would know they are  sincere about ending the civil war in Burma which has gone on  for more than four decades. Striking ceasefire deals with the  ethnic minorities alone is not enough. Slorc must also learn to  come to terms with a government elected by the people. Making  meat of one and poison of another will not work.    As for protests from Burmese students and dissidents in  Thailand who oppose the ASEAN invitation, we don't think the  Government need worry about disruptions at the meeting. The  students have learned to live with whatever decisions the host  country has made. They know they are vulnerable to harassment  and arrest by the authorities if they step out of line. These  new generations of Burmese have learned to be patient and bide  their time if they are to win freedom for their country.    As a recent All Burma Students' Democratic Front statement  on  ASEAN's invitation to Slorc said: "The ABSDF respects the  sovereignty of all the ASEAN countries and does not want to  tarnish their image; and hereby declares that it will not commit  any violent act on the soil of any ASEAN country." These  children of the 1988 uprising have matured politically.</p>

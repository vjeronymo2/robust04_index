			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Argentina told to push patent protection law THE US has warned that Argentina must rapidly approve patent protection legislation which has lingered since 1991 if it is to avoid being targeted for trade sanctions. On April 30, the US Trade Representative's office reviews progress worldwide in intellectual property protection. US officials say the office could list Argentina for sanctions under the US Trade Act's Section 301 unless the Argentine congress approves the bill by the end of April. The UK, France, Germany and Japan are also seeking patent protection. Argentine pharmaceutical companies and their allies in the congress are successfully resisting the pressure. On Wednesday, a key congressional committee voted to postpone debate until Gatt's long-delayed Uruguay Round ends. Mr Pablo Challu, executive director of CILFA, a local laboratories' trade body, said: 'We are not opposed to paying an adequate royalty.' He suggests one tied to Argentina's share of pharmaceutical world trade, a sum he estimates at Dollars 22m (Pounds 15.4m) a year, or 0.9 per cent of annual sales of Dollars 2.6bn. CILFA also demands that patent holders be denied a legal monopoly over products they have developed, claiming that higher drug prices would cost Argentina Dollars 500m a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Orders obtained by 50 major  Japanese construction firms in fiscal 1993 ended March 31 posted  a 17.4 percent fall from the previous year to 18.91 trillion yen  -- the third consecutive yearly decline, the Construction  Ministry announced Thursday [28 April].    Reflecting the continued recession, private-sector orders  declined 22.7 percent to 11.2 trillion yen -- also the third  straight yearly fall.    Public-sector orders also went down 10.7 percent to 6.41  trillion yen -- the first year-on-year fall in eight years.    Ministry officials said public-sector orders fell because  central and local governments barred the major construction  companies involved in bribery scandals from making bids for some  months by way of penalty.    Orders obtained in March, the last month of the fiscal year,  by the 50 companies declined by 15 percent from the year before  to 3.05 trillion yen -- the 14th monthly year-on-year fall in a  row.    Private-sector orders plummeted 26.8 percent to 1.75  trillion  yen, while public-sector orders increased 10.2 percent to a  record 1.11 trillion yen.</p>

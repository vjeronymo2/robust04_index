			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] With the presidential elections barely  a year away, deputies and potential candidates are thinking only  of this "polluting" timetable, Philippe Reinhard writes in the 5  April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. A country that subordinates all  action to an election in spite of the urgency of existing  problems is not a "modern democracy," he comments, for its fate  depends "on a throw of the dice." While the government is  announcing a significant legislative program, parliamentarians  will instead devote their time to evaluating the chances of  various presidential candidates. According to whether they  follow Prime Minister Edouard Balladur or Rally for the Republic  (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, or whether they support French  Democratic Union (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing or Senate  President Rene Monory, their conduct will lead to the  fragmentation of the parliamentary majority, Reinhard contends.  He warns that parliamentarians ought to let the government  govern at least until the vote on the 1995 budget, as  "quarreling in public can only serve the interests of a Left  whose convalescence is distinctly faster than its adversaries  seem to think."    According to an article in the 6 April satirical Paris  weekly  LE CANARD ENCHAINE, Chirac supporters have launched an  "insidious" campaign by attacking Balladur's physical and  psychological state, which they contend has deteriorated "now  that everything is going badly." They are spreading the rumor  that the "increasingly tired and discouraged" prime minister  will not complete his term in office. The article cites Eric  Raoult, one of Balladur's harshest critics and vice president of  the RPR in the National Assembly, as saying that Balladur "can  resign on a moment's notice." Chirac supporters also contend  that were Balladur to leave, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain  Juppe would be his likeliest successor, since he maintains good  relations with President Francois Mitterrand and has no  presidential ambitions.    According to the article, after Alain Juppe's reelection as  secretary general of the RPR National Council, the defense  minister presented his activities report, in which he expressed  satisfaction that the party has become "the most important  French political force." He then turned to the 1995 presidential  elections, affirming that the RPR is "loyal to Edouard Balladur  and faithful to Jacques Chirac" and pointing out that "our party  possesses all the trump cards to win the presidential elections,  but the surest way to waste them is to compromise our unity by  giving in to the delights of clans." For his part, Chirac called  for "unfailing support" for the prime minister, stating that "I  would like to tell him in a friendly manner: Do not be alarmed,  dear Edouard, by the suggestions that members of your majority  may make to you, for they are dictated only by the desire to  succeed together."    In an interview with National Assembly President Philippe  Seguin by Frederic Gerschel published in the 14 April Paris  weekly PARIS MATCH, Seguin was asked whether the government  would not function more "serenely" if, "rightly or wrongly,"  presidential ambitions were not attributed to Balladur. Seguin  replied that Balladur himself stated in June 1990 that a prime  minister who renounces publicly from the outset to run for  president gains both efficiency and authority. When queried  whether his favorite candidate for president is still Chirac,  Seguin pointed out that the problem is less that of candidates,  of whom "there is a plethora," than of a presidential project,  of which there is still a distinct lack. The presidential  election, he added, must be the occasion for a renewed "elan,"  which can only be founded on a clear project. The French people  will thus base their choice on the quality of the candidate, but  also on his capability to bring new answers to the present great  challenges, Seguin concluded.</p>

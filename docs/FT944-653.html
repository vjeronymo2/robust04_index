			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US mutual funds US small shareholders have been looking at their investment returns for the year to date, and are disgruntled. Domestic equity investments have not risen at all, while bonds are down about 6 per cent. The poor performance has led to a marked decline in investment in mutual funds during the course of the year, combined with a gradual increase in redemptions. In the first 10 months of 1994, net inflows into domestic bond and equity funds ran at a monthly Dollars 10bn, half last year's level. Net domestic investment shrunk to Dollars 3.1bn in October. Data due next week for the month of November are likely to show a further acceleration of this trend, although the full impact of the 75 basis point increase in US short-term rates in late November will be seen only later. Higher rates encourage a switch into cash. The impact of outflows will be felt not just in US financial markets but also elsewhere in the world: approximately one eighth of mutual funds' assets is held overseas.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW UP 11.38; INDEX TRADING SWELLS VOLUME  </P> <P> The stock market moved ahead Friday in the heaviest trading volume in about  five months as buyers braved the "triple witching hour."  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,486.38 but lost 27.04  points from a week earlier.  </P> <P> Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 244.51 million shares, up from  179.48 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> The unusually heavy volume on Wall Street reflected trades associated with the  expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual  stocks. The set of expirations occurs once each quarter in something commonly  called the triple witching hour.  </P> <P> Most of the trading was concentrated around the opening and closing of the  session.  </P> <P> Traders paid little attention to two government economic reports.  </P> <P> Warner Communications dominated the list of actively traded NYSE-listed stocks  on news that Time intends to launch a $70-a-share tender offer for Warner  instead of merging with Warner in a stock swap.  </P> <P> More than 8.2 million Warner shares changed hands in NYSE-composite trading,  and the stock wound up with a gain of 3 5/8 at 59 1/4.  </P> <P> Time, which also said it has rejected a $175-a-share takeover bid from  Paramount Communications, tumbled 9 to 162 1/2. Paramount pulled back by 1 3/8  to 58 1/8.  </P> <P> Another media stock, MCA, gained 1 1/4 to 60 in response to a Business Week  magazine report that the company may be a takeover candidate.  </P> <P> Apple Computer tumbled in heavy trading on news that the personal computer  group has had difficulty producing enough of its popular new Macintosh IICX  computers to meet demand.  </P> <P> Apple finished down 3 at 44 1/2 after recovering from a session low of 43 1/2.  It was the second most active over-the-counter stock Friday, with more than 4.8  million shares changing hands.  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak shed 1/8 to 48 5/8. The company said it is consolidating some  operations that would cause hundreds of job cutbacks.  </P> <P> A. H. Robins rose 3 1/8 to 29 7/8. A federal court approved Robins' bankruptcy  reorganization plan, which includes $2.5 billion for women who claim they were  injured by the company's Dalkon Shield birth control device sold widely in the  1970s.  </P> <P> Tokyo stock prices gained moderately to end the week on an up note after  Thursday's huge drop. The Nikkei 225-share index gained 142.08 points to close  at 33,055.17.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> A rally in the dollar fizzled one day after a sharp selloff, leaving it higher  against the British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc but lower against  other major currencies.  </P> <P> The dollar rose from late Thursday levels in Asian and early European trading  despite central banks' dollar sales, but it failed to hold ground after a U.S.  report showed inflation in May at the high end of expectations.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5340 to buy  one pound, more than $1.5195 late Thursday. In New York, the pound fell to  $1.5410 from $1.5510 late Thursday.  </P> <P> The dollar fell 6.25 Japanese yen to a closing 145.05 yen in Tokyo. Later, in  London, it was quoted at 145.50 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 144.70 yen  from 145.40.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices edged lower following the government's report that consumer prices  rose sharply in May.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped 3/16 point, or $1.87 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction  from price, was unchanged from late Thursday at 8.30%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term  loans, was quoted late Friday at 9.438%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Venture capitalists urge capital gains tax reform The British Venture Capital Association has called for a fundamental change in capital gains tax, which it says is higher than in any leading competitor country and discourages investment in growth businesses. In a submission to the chancellor ahead of the November Budget the association calls for 'tapering relief'. The proposals call for gains on assets to be taxed at a rate that would fall the longer assets were held. The top marginal tax rate for assets sold within three years of acquisition would be 40 per cent and the rate would decline to 20 per cent if the assets were held for more than six years. The association says that if this relief were applied retrospectively it would not increase the government's revenues as investors began to realise capital gains. It would also encourage investment and make the distribution of company profits as income relatively less attractive, the association says. Mr Gilbert Chalk, chairman of the association's taxation committee, said: 'It would encourage capital formation and accumulation. It would also encourage people to come out of salaried employment and go into growth situations.' The association has also suggested that UK pension funds should be encouraged to invest more in unquoted investments. It adds that US pension funds invest more in UK venture capital than UK pension funds. The British Chambers of Commerce in its Budget submission yesterday called on the government to cut public spending rather than raise taxes to reduce the public sector deficit. It said: 'Any increase in the burden of taxation on individuals and businesses will further inhibit enterprise and distort decision-making, and should be strenuously avoided.'</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Vitra's vision in glass and stone - Why the office furniture group sees the architecture of its buildings as part of corporate culture An anxious American hovers outside a bizarre, but beautiful building in an otherwise unexceptional suburb of Basle. He is an architect on business in Switzerland, he explains, has come specially to see the building and wants to look inside. The object of his obsession was designed by Frank Gehry, the North American architect, for Vitra, the office furniture group which is one of the finalists in the 1994 European Union Design Prize due to be awarded tomorrow in Amsterdam. The building opened last month as Vitra's corporate headquarters and is the latest addition to the stunning collection of contemporary architecture it has built at its main manufacturing site in Weil-am-Rhein, just over the border in Germany. The American's fascination with the new headquarters building is as intense as the interest generated by the Weil complex, which attracts 40,000 visitors each year: many of whom are architects or students who might eventually buy Vitra's products. The complex contains the work of some of the world's most influential architects. There are two factories by Britain's Nicholas Grimshaw, a conference centre by Tadao Ando of Japan and a Frank Gehry museum to house the company's 20th century chair collection. Even the fire station is an architectural gem - a spectacular composition of abstract concrete planes devised by Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi architect working in London. Rolf Fehlbaum, chairman of Vitra, is a self-confessed architecture buff yet says the Weil site is not a self-indulgent exercise but an integral part of Vitra's strategy of establishing itself as a leader in the office furniture market. 'This isn't a folly or a fantasy,' he says. 'It's part of the company's culture. It's a financially feasible project which sends out a clear message to our customers about what the company stands for.' Vitra's building binge began in 1981 when part of the original Weil site was destroyed by fire. The company, founded in 1934 by Fehlbaum's father, was then the European manufacturer for Hermann Miller, the US furniture group. It had already commissioned a few office chairs from contemporary designers and in the early 1980s was preparing to end the agreement with Miller to concentrate on developing its own designs. The new Vitra needed to carve out an independent identity. The Fehlbaums, impressed by Miller's long liaison with influential designers such as Charles and Ray Eames, were determined to place Vitra at the forefront of technical and aesthetic innovation and needed to convince contemporary designers of the same calibre as the Eameses to work with them. The reconstruction of the Weil site became a central element in that strategy. Rolf Fehlbaum deliberately commissioned a special set of buildings. The Vitra complex includes the first European buildings of Frank Gehry and Tadao Ando. It also houses the first permanent buildings by Zaha Hadid and Nicholas Grimshaw. Fehlbaum says the total cost of the factories (including architect's fees) was roughly the same as standard buildings of that type: but admits the Hadid fire station and Ando conference centre were more expensive at DM2.6m (Pounds 1.04m) and DM2.5m respectively. Vitra has already recouped some of its investment. The museum, which cost DM2.5m to build in 1989, now earns two thirds of its running costs. Vitra also attracts a steady stream of publicity in the architectural press from the opening of new buildings or museum events. 'It's impossible to assess the impact of our cultural project, although we know it has made a difference,' says Fehlbaum. He is convinced that it has played a critical part in enabling Vitra to quadruple its turnover since the break with Hermann Miller to SFr210m last year from SFr56m (Pounds 26m) in 1984. 'The project has smoothed the way by helping us establish our name,' he adds. 'Our customers know exactly where we stand and how to relate to us. Other companies spend lots of money on advertising. We think this is a more effective way of communicating our message.' In this respect Vitra's iconoclastic architecture plays a similar role to the conventional arts sponsorship schemes aimed at developing brands. Cartier, the French jeweller, has pursued the same aims as Vitra by becoming an active sponsor of contemporary art, culminating in this spring's opening of Fondation Cartier, a Paris arts centre designed by Jean Nouvel, the futuristic French architect. Whereas Cartier tends to treat its arts schemes as an image-building initiative, Vitra has gone further by fusing its cultural activities with its day-to-day operations. The elan of its architecture has helped it to attract sought-after furniture designers such as Philippe Starck, Jasper Morrison and Ettore Sottsass. 'If Rolf Fehlbaum wants a new factory or a fire station he goes to the best people in the world,' says Starck. 'Everything about Vitra is done to the highest possible standard. That's why I work for it.' Fehlbaum also believes that the company's product development skills have been enhanced by the experience of collaborating with different architects. 'Designing an office chair is a complex process of trial and error that requires a great deal of fine-tuning,' he says. 'It's good for us to work with different people.' Similarly Vitra has benefited from the museum, which has not only encouraged employees to learn more about their industry's history but has acted as a catalyst for long-term research. Vitra last year asked Sottsass and two other Italian designers, Andrea Branzi and Michele de Lucchi, to analyse how technology would affect the offices of the future for a Citizen Office exhibition. 'Vitra is a company with vision,' says Starck. 'It's never satisfied with the present and is always looking to the future.'</p>

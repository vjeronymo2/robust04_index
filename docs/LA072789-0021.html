			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A;  </P> <P> A CELEBRATED FLORIST'S STYLE  </P> <P> Clifford Miller of the Flower Shop has had a busy seven years as florist to the  stars (his clients include Brandon and Lilly Tartikoff, Kirk Douglas and Johnny  Carson). From his Los Angeles studio, Miller talked about entertaining styles  and floral trends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question: What is the process of doing floral arrangements for a large party or  charity event?  </P> <P> Answer: It depends; sometimes the (planning) committee makes a decision before  I'm brought in, and sometimes I'm brought in immediately. With the American  Film Institute tribute to Gregory Peck, I actually sat in on the menu  consultations. We discussed colors, down to what food was going to go with the  flowers, and how that was going to interpret Gregory Peck.  </P> <P> Q: What flowers did you end up doing for that?  </P> <P> A: Because it was being filmed for TV, we had to keep in mind that certain  flowers photograph better than others and the flowers had to be kept low on the  table. We picked a sort of silvery gray tone, with sterling silver roses and  deep lavender tulips, which showed up as white on TV. It had a nice sheen.  </P> <P> Q: Is there always so much to consider when doing an arrangement?  </P> <P> A: Yes, especially now that so many things are taped. I did a beach-themed  party for the Beach Boys at the Beverly Hilton and did tall palm trees on the  tables. The first thing the lighting people said when they got there was, "This  can't happen." So we had to strike half of the palm trees and within four to  five hours redo the tables.  </P> <P> Q: What kinds of materials do you prefer to work with?  </P> <P> A: I love natural materials and I'm glad to see in home decorating magazines  that things are turning back to a traditional look. L.A.'s been stuck in this  mold for a while of having to be bigger and flashier.  </P> <P> Q: When doing a centerpiece, are there rules that you follow?  </P> <P> A: To some extent. There's nothing worse than not being able to see across the  table. I either like something above eye level or something below. If I'm doing  a flower tree I'll do something at the base, then flowers at the top. I think  you get enough when you look past the person you're talking to to the rest of  the room and can see the flowers on the other tables. And I don't really use  fragrant flowers unless it's requested. JEANNINE STEIN  </P></p>

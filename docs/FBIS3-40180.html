During this period, township industries  grew at a rate faster than the industrial growth of the entire  municipality by nearly 27 percentage points. If township  industries continue to grow at this rate, in about two years,  its production is expected to reach one-third of the total  industrial output value in Shanghai, a city where big  state-owned industries are concentrated.    Since last year, a remarkable feature of Shanghai's new  township enterprises is that there are more joint ventures. In  1992, Shanghai township enterprises established 1,100 new joint  ventures. The number of such enterprises that appeared between  January and October 1993 surpassed the 1992 record, bringing the  total number of joint ventures in suburban Shanghai to upwards  of 3,000, or 47 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises in the  municipality. That is, in terms of number, they took up almost  "one half of the world of foreign-funded industry." Now,  Shanghai's townships, and even some villages, are focusing on  the promotion of joint ventures as a way to make breakthroughs  in developing their economies. Yutang Village in suburban  Shanghai had had no foreign-funded enterprise before May 1992.  In August 1993, only a little more than one year had  elapsed--the village had eight enterprises with foreign  investment. The total investment of these enterprises was $39.22  million, of which $29.18 million came from foreign investors.  Now, most of them have begun production. In developing suburban  enterprises with foreign investment, Shanghai has kept to "three  principal methods": setting up joint ventures, transforming old  enterprises by "grafting" new foreign-funded ventures on them,  and developing new and high technology. Setting up joint  ventures, and using foreign capital has solved township  enterprises' acute shortage of funds. The "grafting" method has  improved old enterprises and upgraded their products, and as a  result, some loss-making enterprises have regained vitality and  are making profits. By introducing advanced foreign technology  and developing new products, township enterprises are able to  gear their production to the international as well as domestic  market instead of the domestic market alone. Statistics show  that the value of exports by Shanghai's township enterprises was  11.934 billion yuan between January and October 1993. Of this,  exports of joint ventures amounted to 3.239 billion yuan, up 118  percent compared with the same period in 1992. Foreign-funded  enterprises have become a reinforcement force in Shanghai's  suburbs in earning foreign exchange.    Starting points, large-scale operations, and high efficiency  are other features of the new township enterprises that have  emerged in Shanghai's suburbs. Many of the township enterprises  established in the last two years are characterized by their  large-scale investments, high product quality, advanced  technology, and bright market prospects. Meanwhile, some new  township enterprises are developing toward enterprise groups.  The Jiabao Industrial Corporation, which was originally formed  by four township enterprises, now has seven sub-companies, and  its operations have been expanded to include real estate,  domestic and international trade, as well as hotel business. Its  assets have soared from 63 million yuan to 690 million yuan.  Both its output value and profits have increased sharply, and  export foreign exchange earnings have doubled year after year.  Now, this corporation is one of the top 10 large-scale township  enterprises in China.    Compared with old enterprises, Shanghai's new township  enterprises are in a better condition, have more remarkable  strong points, and more shining prospects for further  development. But they are not completely without problems. Some  major problems in their operations are: First, shortage of funds  is still a rather striking problem. Due to an acute shortage of  funds, some projects have been started, but cannot be completed  and put into operation on time. A few foreign-funded enterprises  exist in name only because their foreign capital has not been  paid. Others are not running at full capacity due to  insufficient revolving funds. Second, they lack professionals.  To enter the overseas market, and hook up their operations with  the international business community, township enterprises are  in need of specially trained personnel in such fields as  international trade, foreign languages, financial management,  and accounting. For this reason, some enterprises have expressed  the hope that the authorities concerned will make arrangements  for training such professionals and will cooperate with  institutions of higher learning in this regard to improve the  quality of training. Third, there is insufficient labor. As most  young and middle-aged laborers in Shanghai's rural areas are  employed by either township enterprises or village-run  enterprises, it is difficult for new enterprises to recruit  workers. Some of the new township enterprises have to hire  workers from other parts of the country. In some enterprises,  child laborers hired from other places account for 80 percent of  the labor force. This has brought about a series of new  questions such as the workers' board and lodging, love and  marriage, and even some public security problems. Fourth, with  the development of the export-oriented economy, more and more  township enterprise products are for export, and such products  take up an increasing share of the township industry's total  output. These township enterprises earnestly wish to do export  business themselves. Right now, however, very few of them have  obtained approval in this respect. For newly established  enterprises, it is even harder to get such approval.    The large number of new township enterprises in Shanghai  have  unique strong points, but the challenges confronting them are  grim.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Carter claims ceasefire deal in Bosnia Former US president Jimmy Carter claimed yesterday that the Bosnian Serbs were willing to begin an immediate ceasefire and to discuss the international peace plan for the former Yugoslavian republic. Mr Carter, with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic during their talks at the Serbian stronghold of Pale, said: 'The Bosnian Serb side agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to negotiate a lasting cessation of hostilities.' However, Mr Karadzic denied that his side had agreed to any ceasefire, though he said he was willing to explore such a possibility. Mr Carter is visiting Bosnia at Mr Karadzic's invitation in an effort to break the deadlock in the peace negotiations. The US administration has been sceptical of Mr Carter's latest peace foray and has emphasised it is not an official mission. Report, Page 2</p>

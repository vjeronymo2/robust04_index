Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PTL NETWORK SALE IS APPROVED  </P> <P> A federal bankruptcy judge today approved the sale of PTL's lucrative satellite  network for $52 million to a Jewish-born evangelist from San Diego who became a  born-again Christian.  </P> <P> Evangelist Morris Cerullo, once a guest on imprisoned television preacher Jim  Bakker's PTL show, did not appear at a 3 1/2-hour hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy  Court, but his lawyer threatened to drop an offer to buy all PTL assets unless  the sale was approved immediately.  </P> <P> "It is our hope as a Christian organization to come back and achieve what the  Bakkers failed to do," attorney Timothy Treadwell told Judge Thurmond Bishop.  </P></p>

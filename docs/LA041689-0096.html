			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Union's new parliamentary body,  will go into session for the first time May 25, the Tass news agency said. The  date was announced in a decree of the Supreme Soviet that was signed by  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The congress must meet within two months of  being elected. Nationwide multi-candidate balloting for 1,500 seats in the  congress was held March 26, and runoff elections were conducted April 9. But  199 of those seats remain unfilled. In those undecided districts, only one or  two candidates ran March 26, but voters refused to give any of them a majority.  New elections are being organized and balloting will take place in those  districts May 14.  </P></p>

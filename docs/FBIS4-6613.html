			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan's most probable next  prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, on Friday [22 April] pledged his  coalition government will overcome one of its major internal  policy differences to introduce by June a bill reforming the  nation's taxation system.    In an interview on the National Television Network Japan  Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) news program, Hata said the current tax  system is "totally out of balance" with 70 percent of revenue  coming from direct taxes and the remaining 30 percent coming  from indirect ones.    "This is a ratio that must be corrected," Hata said. "We  have to have measures to meet the aging society. How are we  going to get the necessary funds? Are we going to be relying on  the younger workers to support the aged people in the society?    "This is a basic contradiction in the society. This will be  the core of the debate.    "The tax system is totally out of balance and we will decide  on a direction by June of this year. We will try to achieve a  consensus and we will try to pass this bill by the end of the  year. We have reached a certain level of agreement and I am  sure that this will be realized," he said.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the  coalition's largest party, had insisted during debate over a new  coalition policy platform, that any attempt to implement an  indirect tax increase should be done after "gaining a national  consensus." But in further negotiations, the coalition members  later agreed to a proposal that an indirect tax increase be  implemented "while trying to gain public support."    SDP intransigence over the indirect tax issue was one of the  main reasons for the delay in final agreement among the parties  over their platform.    On Friday, the coalition formally chose Hata as its  candidate  for prime minister. The Diet will elect Hata as Japan's 51st  prime minister Monday afternoon, with the coalition parties  occupying a majority of seats in both chambers of the  legislature.    In the interview, Hata downplayed the central role in the  coalition of two key strategists, Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito [Clean  Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa.    "People talk about control by these two people, but if we  look back over the past eight months of the coalition government  and take a historical perspective I do not think you can say it  has been controlled by these two people," said Hata, who is head  of Shinseito.    "When you have a coalition like that you really need someone  like that who can pull the parties together, somebody has to  take the lead.    "Mr. Ozawa has been at the core of politics and he knows  more  about politics than anybody else. "He has always been in  situations of power and of course it was natural for him to  assume a powerful position.    "And I feel sorry for him because he has always been in a  position of being the person everybody loves to hate."    Hata refused to divulge his thoughts on the makeup of the  new  cabinet. "We really have to give this a little more thought,"  he said.</p>

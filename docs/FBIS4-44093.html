			<p>BFN     [Text] At last the international community has accepted its  involvement in UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], the UN  force in Rwanda, which is being rebuilt. More details from  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] Our initiative is already reaping  very substantial diplomatic benefits, since it is accelerating  the setting up of UNAMIR. Canada has just announced its  readiness to offer UNAMIR 350 soldiers and a communication unit.  Tunisia has offered 500 soldiers, Pakistan has stressed its  readiness to transfer some of its contingents from UNOSOM [UN  Operation in Somalia] to Rwanda, and, at last, the United States  has already transported equipment for UNAMIR to Uganda.    We suggested that the UN secretary general coordinate the  operations to ease the arrival of UNAMIR. More precisely, we  suggested setting up a contact group of the main contributing  countries under the aegis of the Secretariat General. [end  recording]</p>

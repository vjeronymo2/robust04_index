			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed procedures, EPA shall summarily dismiss without prejudice a &sect;61.226(a) petition to reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T on a programmatic basis, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it provided written notice of the alleged failure to NRC or an affected Agreement State at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA. This notice to NRC must include a statement of the grounds for such a petition. This notice requirement may be satisfied, among other ways, by submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by NRC. The purpose of this advance notice requirement is to provide NRC or an affected Agreement State with an opportunity to address the concerns raised by the potential petitioner. Additionally, EPA shall summarily dismiss without prejudice a section 61.226(a) petition to reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T on a site-specific basis, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it provided, at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA, a written request to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pC1/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;s flux standard. This provision is intended to provide NRC or an Agreement State with an opportunity to address the concerns raised by the potential petitioner through its standard enforcement mechanisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator may also initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA believes it is appropriate to do so. For example, EPA may initiate such reconsideration if it has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;s flux standard. Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of subpart T, EPA shall consult with NRC prior to initiating a rulemaking to address EPA's concerns. If the consultation does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to reinstate this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

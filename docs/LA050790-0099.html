			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY ENJOYED BEING LEFT IN LIMBO  </P> <P> When the Spinsters started doing the limbo, their 64th annual ball became a  very, very good party.  </P> <P> It was just past midnight Friday at the Beverly Hilton when the calypso-themed  gala shifted into high gear.  </P> <P> The steel band was blasting, twentysomething men in white-tie and dexterous,  intrepid women in strapless gowns were navigating their way under the limbo  pol. Then the party let loose with the energy expected on a Caribbean cruise  where passengers hijack the Love Boat.  </P> <P> The night began in leisurely fashion with cocktails at 8, dinner at 10-ish. It  picked up steam at 11 when two male Caribbean dancer-acrobats bounced across  the floor.  </P> <P> They were followed by a fire-eater/juggler who left in his wake a cloud reeking  of lighter fluid; maybe it was this haze of petroleum distillates that  enlivened the crowd.  </P> <P> By the time the three, feather-plumed female dancers had brought the mood of  Brazilian (via Las Vegas) Mardigras to the room, the 600-strong crowd was  primed to dance.  </P> <P> "We wanted something lively," said understated Betsy Ross, who with Victoria  Eastus and Melinda Pfenning had put together the ball. (Angelica Kusar is the  group's president.)  </P> <P> Why was the event's liveliness so remarkable? The Spinsters are old-line,  traditional group. They're young, working, single women who could be called  Debs Who Don't Marry . . . Yet. Or in the words of committee member Kimberly  Wilder, "It's like a sorority after college. Call us 'Debs With Careers.' "  </P> <P> But they managed the difficult task of keeping a party begun in 1926 in tune  with both tradition and the times. And as the dancing went on until 2 a.m., one  wondered why they would ever want to marry and stop being Spinsters.  </P></p>

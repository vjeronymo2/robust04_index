			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / National Power application to build new Didcot plant approved Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday approved National Power's application to build a 1,500MW gas-fired power station beside its existing coal-fired plant (above) at Didcot in Oxfordshire, David Lascelles writes. The approval brings to 25 the number of new gas-fired power stations authorised by the Department of Trade and Industry. Their total capacity is 17,900MW, equivalent to about 25 per cent of total capacity in England and Wales. National Power welcomed the Didcot decision, and said it would now decide whether to proceed with construction at that site or at Staythorpe in Nottinghamshire, where it received permission to build a similar power station last May. More than two years have passed since National Power first placed its application. Consent at Didcot is subject to 58 conditions covering issues raised at a public inquiry early last year. National Power is also required to monitor emissions and set up a local liaison committee and complaints procedure. The rapid growth of gas has been blamed for causing the shrinkage of the coal industry with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. However the government has been keen to encourage the switch to gas because of the fuel's cleaner environmental record.</p>

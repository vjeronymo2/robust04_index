			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu met with FRY Deputy  Prime Minister Nicola Sainovicat at Victoria Palace today.  According to information released by the Romanian executive,  the guest noted that the holding of the Crans Montana Forum in  Bucharest is not only an important event for Romania but for all  the countries in the Balkans. The participants reiterated the  positions of the two countries regarding the crisis in the  former Yugoslavia and noted that the only way to solve the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is through dialogue, which should  be attended by all interested sides.    The two sides assessed that bilateral relations could once  again become as intensive and ample, if not stronger, as they  were before the embargo and that this is why they have to be  prepared in advance.</p>

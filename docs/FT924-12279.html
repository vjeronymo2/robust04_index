			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (8): Job hunters line up - Executive search is becoming more difficult THE past two years have been tough for the executive search industry particularly those operating in the recession-hit US and UK markets. According to Mr Ed Kelly, chief executive of Korn/Ferry International's London office, 1991 was 'like a cold shower for the head hunting business', and there has been little improvement since then. Across the US and the UK, two of the most developed markets for executive search, companies have been laying off middle and senior managers, sometimes by the thousands, in an effort to cut costs and improve competitiveness. 'Historically, recessions have not affected middle management, but for the first time an enormous number of middle and and even some top managers have been put out of work,' says Mr Chuck Sweet, President of Chicago-based A T Kearney Executive Search. Many employment consultants both sides of the Atlantic believe this marks more than a cyclical 'cull'. In many cases companies, including those in the service sector, appear to have decided to remove whole layers of management. If this is indeed the case, there are many implications, not just for the executive search firms, but for educationists, management training organisations and others. However, the most immediate effect has been on the volume of out-of-work executives seeking new positions. Almost all the large executive search firms report a surge in 'fan mail' - write-in applications from job hunters. Unfortunately the headhunters also confirm that employers' 'prejudice' against unemployed job candidates has, if anything, hardened. As a result they report that the quality of unemployed managers has improved dramatically. Nevertheless the executive search firms say they still cannot risk providing a client with a panel of candidates, all of whom are unemployed. The recessionary climate has also forced other marked changes in the business. In good times clients use headhunters to find candidates for what Mr Gary Gibbons, a director in A T Kearney's London office calls 'positive reasons' - perhaps an expansion programme or a new marketing initiative. But in recessions most clients are looking at their cost base, and sometimes that means they are looking for a 'stronger' candidate to replace an existing executive who is 'not up to snuff'. As Mr Paul Buchanan-Barrow, managing partner of Korn/Ferry says, 'any competent executive can make money for his company in a rising market. Recession needs and has bred a different type of manager'. He adds: 'Companies are looking for individuals who can help turn the fortunes of a company around in the midst of an economic downturn. Candidates with a track record of this nature are much in demand.' But for search firms, finding this ideal candidate has probably never been more difficult. Not only will they often have to keep the client's name secret, but a far higher proportion of those they approach who are still in employment will weigh the risks of switching jobs and decide against a move. 'Those who are in work are much more circumspect and cautious about moving,' says Mr Buchanan-Barrow. 'They take a lot of persuading and are less confident in the health of the job market as a whole.' Ironically the downturn in the UK executive search market appears to have come just as the headhunters were winning wider acknowledgement of their skills. Most large UK organisations have now used executive search firms to help fill senior or specialist positions. In its year end report Korn/Ferry said 70 per cent of human resource directors in leading UK enterprises said they had used search firms for senior management appointments. However, usage in the past two years was down by 40 per cent, and only 7 per cent of respondents said they planned to make more use of search. Employers who have replaced headhunting with internal promotion and job advertising to cut their recruitment costs said they were well satisfied with the results and had no immediate plans to return to the headhunters. As a result Korn/Ferry concluded that 'UK search firms will be fighting for a small share of a smaller cake and some will not survive'. According to Mr Stephen Fletcher, head of KPMG Executive Selection and Search, the executive recruitment market is now at its lowest point since 1959. He says the search market has reduced, but not at the same rate as the drop in advertised vacancies, mainly as a result of good quality candidates writing directly to prospective employers. He adds that there is growing evidence of search firms trading down market and taking on projects at salaries 'well below Pounds 60,000', and predicts that competitors' aggressive market tactics will continue and that price discounting will become more widespread while pressure on costs remain. Not surprisingly with the UK search market in the doldrums many of the big US/UK search firms have looked increasingly overseas for their growth. Most, such as Mr Fletcher of KPMG, expect demand for UK executives from overseas clients to increase significantly. Indeed, the executive search business is increasingly international and firms without a network of European offices are at a serious disadvantage. So most headhunters, including market leaders in London, such as Russell Reynolds, have been rushing to open offices abroad, or at least to establish links with firms in other countries. As companies have built up transnational operations, cross-border searches have also grown and continue to grow in spite of the recession. What is more clients will often pay up to a 20 per cent premium for a cross-border search. A T Kearney is one of the firms that has been actively building up a string of European offices. Mr Gibbons says the majority of the work in the London office this year 'has had at least one international element to the job'. In one case that meant finding a managing director for an overseas client setting up a UK subsidiary, and in another case finding an English-speaking candidate to work in Denmark as the European marketing director for a Denver-based high technology medical company. (In the last case the successful candidate was actually living in Switzerland.) The changes in eastern Europe have also highlighted the growing international dimension to executive search. A T Kearney's Mr Gibbons says that with a growing number of western companies now beginning to set up operations in eastern Europe, many of them are looking for east European emigres, preferably with some experience of western management, to return to their native countries. Most of the big firms have found other ways to bolster flagging search fee income. For example, many have branched out to provide 'selection services', where advertisements are used to draw up shortlists. Among those firms which now have selection groups are Whitehead Mann which has Whitehead Selection, Korn/Ferry with K/F Associates and GKR which has St James Associates. In addition Korn/Ferry owns Strategic Compensation Associates, a consultancy which specialises in advice on executive pay, while several other firms including GKR, offer clients a management 'audit', an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of an existing management team - in competition with mainstream management consultancies. Providing interim management is another diversification which has helped some search firms weather the recession. High level Interim managers are often hired by companies undergoing a change or a crisis, and it is a growing business. Often they are employed for a matter of months, perhaps until permanent staff are found, or until a particular problem is resolved. Several of the leading search firms have established specialist interim management arms including Egon Zehnder, which is a joint venture partner in Executive Interim Management (EIM), Heidrick Struggles with Protem, and Spencer Stuart with Stream Resources. A review of the market for interim managers conducted by EIM earlier this year revealed a 25 per cent increase in the number of interim manager assignments carried out across Europe between 1990 and 1991 and forecast a similar rise this year. Experienced chief executives and finance directors are particularly in demand, especially in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Mr Derek Mortimer, managing partner of Triple A, a UK-based interim management specialist, says that in spite of interim management's high added value, there is little doubt that the sector is more buoyant in an expanding market. 'Nevertheless there have been a number of potentially powerful new entrants this year, more than replacing departures.' He says the demand for interim managers usually stems from a sense of urgency. 'The urgency is in getting from point A to point B more speedily and efficiently than internal resources will allow. At present, companies are experiencing indecision and a lack of confidence brought about by uncertainty - a type of introspection which creates its own vicious circle. 'While understandable, for survival's sake the circle needs to be broken and positive movement forward made. This is exactly the situation where the extra momentum and objectivity of the interim manager can be used to kick start and deliver the required result in record time.'</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOSPEL MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WINANS HERALD A RETURN TO BASIC NOTIONS OF RELIGION  </P> <P> As the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker story oozed out of TV sets Sunday night, the  Winans were at the Celebrity Theatre offering a thoroughly different take on  the workings of religion.  </P> <P> With all the cynicism earned by televangelists in recent years and the concerns  for liberty engendered by the political agendas of some religious groups, some  might feel a touch of dread when an influential crossover gospel/R&amp;B group  proselytizes for a "return to what made us a great nation," as the Winans do in  the liner notes to their current "Return" album.  </P> <P> But what the four Winans were selling in their two-hour concert wasn't  political dictums but such basic notions as hope, trust, giving and a shared  humanity. And their music, similarly to that of the best black gospel groups  that have gone before them, wasn't just a lyrical expression of those concerns  but a working example.  </P> <P> Brothers Marvin, Carvin, Michael and Ronald Winans don't quite reach the  trancelike abandon or gritty fervor of some of their traditional forebears.  Instead, they cool that old-time gospel heat with a mixture of supple modern  soul. Sunday, that combination often brought to mind Van Morrison's recent  Universal Amphitheatre shows: There was a beautiful, controlled blaze to the  entire performance, which spilled over into pure epiphany at key moments.  </P> <P> One such moment came during "Right, Left in a Wrong World," a 1987 song that  depicts a world gone awry, where "The government seems to be cheating / Selling  arms to the enemy / And those who are supposed to be preaching / Are now  warring on my TV." In concert, that turmoil was expressed musically with a riot  of rhythm and textures pushing against each other, but with the Winans' four  emphatic voices soaring above it.  </P> <P> The brothers harmonize as it seems only brothers can. (The four come from a  brood of 10 children, and lately it seems that practically everyone in the  Winans family is staking out a vocal career. Vickie Winans, a Winans by  marriage, opened the show.) The lead vocal duties were passed around, with  Marvin and his twin brother Carvin taking the majority of them.  </P> <P> Marvin's voice at times recalled the late Marvin Gaye, never more so than on  "He's My Friend," where he slipped from a fragile, broken falsetto into joyous  shouts and show-stopping displays of emotion-led technique. Carvin had  opportunity to equal that with "When You Cry," a ballad about shared suffering  and hope that he concluded with some stunning scat vocals.  </P> <P> If there wasn't a call for an encore at show's end, it was only because the  Winans had achieved a sense of completeness with their closing songs. Leading  from the recent hit "It's Time" to the soulful ballad "Wherever I Go" to a  final church hymn, the group had the audience clasping hands, hugging and  singing along, as if it were the end of a church service.  </P></p>

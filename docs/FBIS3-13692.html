			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Balfour Declaration, The American Way!"] </F>   [Text] Since the start of the Arab-Israeli conflict, not a  single U.S. administration has dared to publicly recognize  Jerusalem as Israel's unified and eternal capital. The official  position of all the U.S. administrations in all written  documents has left the future of Jerusalem up to all parties to  decide as part of a just and comprehensive settlement in the  Middle East.    But unfortunately, it seems that U.S. President Bill Clinton  has a different view that conflicts with the firm position of  all the past U.S. administrations. The U.S. President has  surprised us by making this serious shift in position in remarks  that were carried by Israeli radio. He made the remarks during  a meeting with leaders of the Zionist-U.S. lobby at the White  House on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit  to Washington. Clinton has found in himself the courage to  explicitly say that he considers Jerusalem to be Israel's  eternal and unified capital of Israel and to pledge to obstruct  the issuance of a Security Council resolution condemning the  massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque if it referred, even  indirectly, to Jerusalem as part of the occupied Arab  territories.    It is Clinton's right to appease the Jews and to give them  any U.S. concessions that he wants in terms of weapons or money,  but he has no right, under any circumstances or with any  justification, to pay for these concessions out of the Arabs'  pockets and at the expense of their sacred sites and their  inalienable historical rights in Jerusalem. Clinton has picked  the worst time ever to go public with his real position, because  it looks like a reward to Israel for committing the massacre at  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    We have a right to question the credibility and the  seriousness of the U.S. efforts to promote peace. So far, these  efforts have resulted in nothing but a series of concessions  that the United States makes to Israel at the expense of the  Arabs, whether they like it or not.</p>

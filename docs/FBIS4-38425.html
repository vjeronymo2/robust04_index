			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Zhilyakov] </F>   [Text] Krasnodar May 29 TASS -- There is no threat of an  immediate economic catastrophe in Russia, Russia's Choice leader  Yegor Gaydar said.    Speaking at a conference of the regional section of his  party  in the Krasnodar region, southern Russia, on Saturday, Gaydar  said that the major problem is that the government's economic  programme offers little hope for the future.    He stressed that the government's course provides for the  preservation of the status quo which excludes any prospects for  economic growth.    Gaydar presented the delegates with a 33-page programme of  the Russia's Choice bloc.</p>

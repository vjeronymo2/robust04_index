			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Democratic Left [ID] has reiterated its  rejection of the way the constitutional reforms were [word  indistinct]. Members of ID said there is clear evidence that the  goal was to approve an extension of the deputies' term and their  immediate reelection.    [Begin ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo recording] We want to  reiterate, on behalf of the ID bloc, that we reject the approval  of constitutional reforms and the way the issue was handled. It  was obvious yesterday that deputies still have plans to extend  their term even though they did not get the necessary 52 votes  -- for the third time -- to establish clearly that there will be  no extension of terms or immediate reelection [sentence as  heard]. It is obvious that they intend to prevent the approval  of the temporary provision that would implement constitutional  reforms effective 1996. That is another reason why we insisted  on the need to close the Congress sessions. It cannot continue  to function to approve reforms under these circumstances and  with an electoral process under way. [end recording]    ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo said he endorses the closure  of  the special congress period, because then the reforms will fail  and they will be discussed on another occasion, free from  political considerations.</p>

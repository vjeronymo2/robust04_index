			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Wine: A new-wave French vigneron / A look at why growers must change to survive THIRTY-ONE-year-old Jean-Philippe Fichet is typical of a new breed of Burgundian. He was brought up in the village of Meursault, a name that spells gold, glory and expense to white wine lovers. Like most of his contemporaries, he comes from a family of vignerons. His father has 5.5 hectares (14 acres) of vines in Meursault and the neighbouring villages of Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet. Like most of the older generation, Fichet Pere has always sold his wine in bulk to the negociants, the big wine merchants of Beaune. Thus the name Fichet is not known to the wide wine-buying public, only to the brokers or courtiers who have until recently trawled the region for wine to pour into the negociant blends carrying the famous village and vineyard names of Burgundy. Until very recently Fichet was a name on sample bottles rather than wine labels. But Jean-Philippe realised, or perhaps sensed more intuitively, his roots being so deep in the poor soils of Burgundy, that his father's way would not be his way forward towards the next millennium of Burgundian history. He wants, simply, to make great wine, and to see it enjoyed with his own name on it. He has seen what his cousin Jean-Francois Coche-Dury has achieved by establishing his Domaine. By doing everything possible to maximise quality at the expense of quantity, Coche-Dury can sell every bottle he makes three times over. And yet he still sells the less successful wine he makes in bulk to the negociants. Such dedication can hardly fail to inspire. Young Fichet's motivation is far from financial. He is heavily in debt and reckons it will be at least 10 years before Domaine Jean-Philippe Fichet does anything more than cover its costs, but his ambition makes even more sense now that the negociants' warehouses are full and their prices have tumbled. (In 1989 they were paying FFr5,000 for a barrel of Bourgogne Blanc and FFr15,000 for Meursault; today they may pay only FFr1,000 and FFr6,000 respectively.) He has been making wine for 11 years now, since he was 20, but happily admits that it has been only for the last four years, from the 1989 vintage, that he has been making good wine (although even his 1987 and 1988 vintages were praised in the influential American Robert Parker's book Burgundy). Jean-Philippe, who exports 60 per cent of his small production, realises he needs to expand his horizons outside the village of Meursault. Accordingly, he made his first trip to England last month to show his wines at the annual Burgundy tasting of his UK importers Morris &amp; Verdin.* Jasper Morris delightedly told him about a blind tasting championship held recently for Winecellars customers in London to assess the relative merits of France, Italy and Australia at various price levels. It was apparently entirely due to the overwhelming enthusiasm for Jean-Philippe Fichet's Bourgogne Rouge 1990 (Pounds 7.50 a bottle) from Morris &amp; Verdin that France 'won' overall, but the young Frenchman was unimpressed. 'Wait till you see my 1992,' he said with a smile. Fichet admits that he is a terrible taster, in the sense that, like any passionate winemaker, no matter what the wine, he is always looking for its faults. He says he has learnt by hanging around those whose wines he admires, such as cousin Coche, Francois Jobard and Dominique Lafon of Meursault's famous Domaine Comte Lafon ('although someone like Dominique isn't going to tell me all his secrets,' he says with due modesty). Although his passionate dedication to quality is shared by an increasing number of young vignerons all over Europe, people who, a generation ago, might have left the countryside rather than inherited an agricultural way of life, surely many of his contemporaries are just coasting along on the endangered reputation of yesterday's Burgundy? Isn't it difficult to maintain friendships when at such professional variance? Strange that the French do not have a word for the shrug they employ so usefully. Dissatisfied with the temperature and humidity in his rented cave he set about finding the sort of 'silent, secret place' he thinks great wine needs. He is now renting a deeper, larger cellar from the Commune of Meursault where he can boast of a fairly constant, natural 16'C and nice, damp conditions to keep the oak barrels supple. He is wary of new wood and uses it sparingly only for his very best wines. But he understands the importance of establishing a rapport with his cooper, Damy, in Meursault. 'You can't just ring up 10 days before harvest and expect to get the best barrels,' he says. In little plots around Meursault, Chassagne, Monthelie and Volnay, Fichet now owns just 2 ha of red and white vines and is renting a further 5 as a sharecropper, which means he cannot reduce yields as much as he would like. When his father retires, his three siblings will leave him free to take over the family vines and practice the ultra-strict pruning he believes necessary to squeeze extra concentration into the resulting wines. But what does his father think of his son's quite different working philosophy? 'Ah,' smiles Jean-Philippe ruefully. 'It is the job of a father not to say anything. But what I think he thinks is that what I am doing is sensible for today's conditions.' Fichet wines, of which the mealy Meursault 1990 is a Pounds 16 star, are available from Morris &amp; Verdin, London SW1. (Tel: 071-630-8888). Coche-Dury wines are (sometimes) available from Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester (0206-764446) and Winecellars are based in Wandsworth, London SW18 (081-871-2668).</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEANING OF 'DON'T WALK'  </P> <P> Regarding Kerry Lotts' complaint that students are getting jaywalking tickets  for crossing the street against "don't walk" signs.  </P> <P> "Don't walk" doesn't mean "walk." It's a red light.  </P> <P> Whenever I touch my scalp, I feel a large numb area from where I fell and the  nerves of my forehead were severed when my glasses cut my eyebrow open. How did  this happen? I was struck by a car while jaywalking at Sherman Way near Topanga  on Nov. 4, 1986, at 7:14 p.m. I had a $700 hospital bill from the emergency  ward plus much therapy. Not only is jaywalking against the law, it's dangerous.  The police are there "to protect and to serve."  </P> <P> RICK ROFMAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

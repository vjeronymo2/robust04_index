			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Seoul daily HANGUK ILBO on 4 April  publishes on page 23 a report on North Korean investment in  recreational facilities. The report claimed that in order to  ease the rising social tension, the Pyongyang government has  invested in leisure facilities such as karaoke music rooms and  sports centers including a huge bowling center in Pyongyang.    On 25 February, Kim Il-song personally visited the newly  opened Pyongyang Bowling Center and expressed his pleasure with  the facilities. The bowling center, 40 lanes in a 14,300 square  meter space, was built with the help of the Chochongyon  [Association of pro-North Korean residents in Japan] Chamber of  Commerce. It is a complete recreation center with a large  restaurant, saunas and various activity rooms.    Since opening its first karaoke music room in Pyongyang in  1992, a large number of music rooms have been opened and are  being opened throughout North Korea.    Recreation and sports complexes are under going major  renovations. A sports, culture and rest center in Nungnado in  Pyongyang will have eight tennis courts, a roller rink, an  archery center, a golf practice area and badminton courts, and  so on when renovation is completed. A sports center in  Panwoldo, also in Pyongyang, is adding water sports facilities;  a water play area for kindergarden children, a swimming pool for  children and a swimming pool for students.    A new facility called "The All-Around Leisure Center,"  located in the Munsu area of eastern Pyongyang, is nearly ready.  This center has been heavily advertised in the North Korean  media as a new type of recreation center with all kinds of  recreation facilities. It is expected to have sky rides,  high-tech swings and other advanced amusement rides, and a  summer land with various water recreation facilities.    Additionally, 26 huge theaters were built since early 1993,  adding to the already existing 1,000 or so theaters. According  to the North Korean media, most of these were built in the North  Hwanghae Province and North Pyongan Province. These theaters  can be used for movies, plays, operas, musicals and circuses.    North Korea has only one golf course and it is located in  Nampo city. The greens fee is very high; 3,000 Japanese yen for  members and 10,000 yen for non-members. It appears that North  Korea has no plan to build new golf courses.    It is the Seoul government's view that North Korea is  sensing  social tension which could lead to major unrest. Thus,  Pyongyang has to do something for the people and it is spending  money, of which it has very little to spare, to build leisure  facilities for them.</p>

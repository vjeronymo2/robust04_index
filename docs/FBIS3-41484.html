			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: ``Inquiry To Polish Our </F> Forestry Reputation'']    [Text] The Environment Ministry has appointed a one-man  board of inquiry to prepare a strategy that will guarantee  biodiversity in Finnish forests. The strategy will be ready by  the end of February and will also be aimed at improving  Finland's reputation in forestry circles, according to  Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen. The strategy will be  adapted to the environmental program for forestry that the  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is currently drafting.    The forest strategy will be the Environment Ministry's  position on how Finnish forests should be managed and protected  and as such, according to Pietikainen, it will provide  guidelines for both state and private forestry. She does not  think a decision in principle at the government level is needed  on this issue.    ``The Environment Ministry is the authority that is  responsible for forest management and biodiversity, therefore  the ministry's position is the same as Finland's position,''  Pietikainen said.    Behind the need to draw up an integrated strategy on  forestry  and the protection of old forests in our country lie both the  principles Finland is committed to in accordance with the UN's  Rio conference on the environment and development and the  reorganization that is currently under way at both the forestry  and environmental administrations. In addition the recent  discussion of forest policy both in this country and abroad  revealed a lack of knowledge that could damage Finland's  reputation on forestry issue, the environment minister said.    Some 727 of the endangered species in this country, 43  percent of the total, live in forests. To preserve the abundance  of species it is important to also preserve the old primeval  forests, and the working group that has reviewed the need to  protect old forests has proposed protecting 23,000 hectares of  forestland in all. Last Friday the first specific areas were  protected in accordance with the group's proposal, a unified  area in Talaskangas and scattered areas in western Finland.    Next year a supplemental proposal will also be presented on  the protection of old forests south of Uleaborg on both state  and private lands. By the end of October 1995 another proposal  on protecting forests north of Uleaborg will be ready.    Currently there is a shortage of protected areas in southern  sections of Lapland, according to the Environment Ministry.  Kajanaland and northern Lapland have more protected forests.  Some 30,000 hectares of old forest in southern Lapland and  Kajanaland are protected and less than 10,000 hectares of this  kind of forest are protected in southern Finland. Finland has  41,500 hectares of protected forests in all, representing 2.3  percent of the country's forest area.    However, the Environment Ministry points out that it is not  enough to protect forests; scattered protection areas do not  guarantee the survival of species. Forest management also plays  a central role and education in sound forest management that is  more compatible with nature is included in training programs in  forest districts.</p>

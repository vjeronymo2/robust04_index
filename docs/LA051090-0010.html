			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> A THISTLE GETS UNDER DEMOCRAT SKIN;  </P> <P> SILBER, RUNNING IN MASSACHUSETTS PRIMARY, IS THE PARTY SCOLD -- AND MAYBE  SAVIOR.  </P> <P> Most politicians aspire to be petunias, pleasant commonplace flowers in the  public garden. Then there is John Silber, the candidate as thistle.  </P> <P> If you are looking for kinder and gentler, look elsewhere. Silber, 63, a former  professor of philosophy, is on leave from the presidency of Boston University  where he frequently fought with the faculty. He is seeking the Democratic  gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts. "I don't speak plastic," he says.  Indeed.  </P> <P> On his salary, the highest among university presidents: "I'm not embarrassed to  get one-quarter of what a mindless anchorman on TV gets. I'm not average." Any  pledge not to raise taxes "borders on insanity." Jesse Jackson (Silber can't  endure "the mindless, rhyming pieces of nonsense on which he has built a  career") might be Cabinet material because every President's Cabinet "needs  someone to write bumper stickers."  </P> <P> His tongue has always been tart. When the young Bill Bennett, now drug czar,  was Silber's student, Silber compared his doctoral dissertation to Texas chili:  "Mostly beans and mush with the occasional meat."  </P> <P> A lifelong educator who has taught at Yale and Texas, his words on schools are  especially unminced. Many schools are "institutionalized programs of child  neglect." The curriculum of the typical school of education ("certifying the  ineducable to be educators") amounts to "a two- or three-year negative  intelligence test." A voucher system would mean "the end of public education"  unless teachers' unions allowed outside evaluations of teachers and ensured  that they are "worthy mentors and available to pupils as needed."  </P> <P> He favors a state examination for all high-school seniors. A school in which  fewer than 80% pass would be on probation. Two consecutive such years and the  school would be decertified and denied public funds.  </P> <P> When Silber says back to basics, he means basics: We should begin by teaching  children something that, in earlier times, reality taught them through the  deaths of siblings and elders: "They are going to die." Sound education depends  on this contact with reality. The Bush campaign theme was "Don't worry, be  happy." Silber's is: Life is real, life is earnest, life is short.  </P> <P> In a time of cloying national triumphalism, Silber's is the voice of a scold.  He believes America has become self-indulgent, enervated by wealth and  demoralized by bad philosophy.  </P> <P> Self-indulgent? Educational standards "are derisory by standards that were  operative in ordinary little country schools a hundred years ago." Enervated?  The affluence that capitalism produces is dissolving the virtues --  industriousness, deferral of gratification -- that capitalism requires. Bad  philosophy? The transformation of whims into "needs," then into "rights,"  proceeds on the assumption that "sincerity" creates "values" and a no-fault  life.  </P> <P> Although Silber, like a lot of Democrats, voted for Ronald Reagan and George  Bush, he calls himself "a traditional liberal Democrat." He led a Texas  campaign against capital punishment, helped found the Head Start program, and  says that without preschool programs for children aged 3, 4 and 5 who lack  adequate adult care at home, "we can only talk emptily about equality of  opportunity."  </P> <P> If Democrats can find the nerve to nominate him, he should win in a state where  only 14% of voters are Republicans and Republican candidates must attract  disaffected Democrats who think liberalism has become woolly-headed. However,  his party may be unnerved by the accusation that he is "insensitive." He says  charges of "insensitivity" are used to make many sensitive subjects, such as  sex and race, undiscussable.  </P> <P> Recently he was denounced for saying that a woman has an opportunity to be a  pretty girl between, say, ages 15 and 25. Critics called him insensitive to  women over 25. But Silber said what he said while discussing a Yeats poem  (specifically, the line "What shall I do for pretty girls now my old bawd is  dead?") in a high-school class that Silber says included "exceedingly scruffy,  dirty, ill-kempt young girls." He told them they were in a wonderful window of  life and instead of luxuriating in their loveliness "they were throwing it away  with the assiduous effort to be repulsive."  </P> <P> Is Silber impolitic? Perhaps. If so, so much the worse for Massachusetts'  polity. But if this, the only state that George McGovern carried in 1972, can  elect the nation's most interesting candidate in 1990, the Democratic Party may  find many Democrats coming home to it.  </P></p>

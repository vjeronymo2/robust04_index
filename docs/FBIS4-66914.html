			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Kazakhstan wants to invite  U.S. experts to dismantle Russian-made nuclear missiles which it  had inherited from the former Soviet Union and the decision  causes concern among the Russian military.    "The access of experts of third countries to Russian missile  complexes for their dismantling contradicts the Russian-Kazakh  agreement on strategic nuclear forces and the treaty on military  cooperation", Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander-in-chief  of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, told TASS on Tuesday.    Russian experts are currently removing nuclear warheads from  the missiles, extracting them from silos and preparing for  transportation, according to Volkov who added that Russia had  pledged to transfer to its territory all nuclear components for  elimination by May 1, 1995. He stressed that financial aspects  of dismantling and elimination have been fixed in a separate  Russian- Kazakh agreement.    In the meantime, three U.S. companies want to eliminate the  SS-18 missiles in Kazakhstan and are planning to request the  U.S. Congress to appropriate 75 million dollars for that,  according to Kazakh mass media which reported that the main bulk  of the missiles is to be destroyed, while ten of them are to be  used as spacecraft carriers. The Kazakh-U.S. cooperation idea in  the sphere has emerged after the visit of President Nursultan  Nazarbayev to the United States.    The invitation to U.S. experts to dismantle Russian missiles  affects not only the Russian interests, but also of missile  constructors in other CIS countries. According to Aleksandr  Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on  defence, the Kazakh decision ignores the right to intellectual  property and thus contradicts international norms.</p>

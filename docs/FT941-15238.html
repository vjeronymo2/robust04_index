			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: New look at an auld aquaintance - As Burns Night approaches, Michael Glover considers the legacy of Scotland's greatest poet As we raise our glasses once again on January 25 to the memory of the poet and iconoclast Rabbie Burns, the questions arise: who was he? why do we do it? and, perhaps most pertinent of all, is he still worth reading? Burns the man and Burns the myth were inextricably linked from the beginning  -largely thanks to the cunning and enterprise of Burns himself. He was born in 1759, the son of a poor Ayrshire tenant farmer who nevertheless employed a pedantic itinerant schoolmaster to teach young Rab the best in English literature and grammar. From his illiterate mother, Burns imbibed an even more precious heritage - that of Scottish songs and ballads. He was published early, and was quickly lionised in Edinburgh as a young prodigy - but not a learned prodigy. According to the earliest critics, he breathed the sublime air of the 'Heavenly ploughman' and was an example of untutored genius. He went along with all this but was, in fact, extremely well read. He was a great enthusiast for the empiricism of John Locke, he read fellow Scot Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations with approval; and he gave considerable support to the French revolution before that great movement turned into an unseemly parody of its own ideals. Burns later recanted, denying that he had ever called himself a republican. But one aspect of his view of politics remained unchanged: that it was a game played by the rich at the expense of the poor. The belief that the long-suffering common man remains the repository of honest values is evident everywhere in his poetry. Was he really the drunken fornicator that his early Calvinistically-inclined biographers castigated him for being? As always with Burns, the answer is both yes and no. Yes, he drank heavily. But perpetual drunkards do not produce poetry of the quality that Burns produced. His appetite for other women was regarded with tolerance by his wife Jean Armour, who once said 'Our Robbie should have had twa wives'. He wrote some poetry in English, the language of his tutor, but it was nothing beside the extraordinary vitality of his work in Scots, from the best of the songs to the great satires on the Kirk, whose pricks he was forever kicking against. He lived out the identity crisis that Scotland was suffering so acutely in the late 18th century, as the gradual process of anglicisation denied the Scots tongue its rightful place as one of Scotland's native literary languages, along with Gaelic. By the end of the 18th century, fashionable literature had to be written in English and Burns's 'dialect' poems were regarded as whimsical affairs at best. In his heart, Burns was in fierce revolt against all this; but he knew the power of the patron and made the necessary compromises. The worst, perhaps, was his decision - as symbolic an act of treachery as can be imagined - to seek office as an Exciseman, that enemy of every self-respecting Scots drinker. The great satires aside, are his songs - of which he thought very little and for which he refused payment - his most enduring legacy? Anyone who listens to Jean Redpath's definitive versions of them -all available on cassette (Greentrax, Pounds 7), and gradually becoming available on CD (Greentrax, Pounds 11) - might well think so. The best and most approachable new anthology is Rhymer Rab, edited by Alan Bold (Black Swan, Pounds 6.99), which offers a chronological survey of Burns in poetry, letters and miscellaneous prose. A good, though academically more severe, edition of the Selected Poems (Penguin Classics, Pounds 6.99) has just been edited by Carol McGuirk; Catherine Carswell's excellent Life of Robert Burns (Canongate, Pounds 5.95), first published in the 1930s to a storm of indignation, destroyed many of the myths fondly held by misty-eyed Burnsians. Burns Now, edited by Kenneth Simpson, (Canongate, Pounds 12.50), is a new collection of essays that reassesses Burns as poet, thinker and songwriter.</p>

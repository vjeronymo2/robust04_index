			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Five step up in reshuffled management It is not only processes and systems which have gone into Ford's cocktail-shaker to create the new 'global' Ford - involved, too, is a far-reaching management shake-up. Under the restructuring a new post is created of president of the global operating body, Ford Automotive Operations (FAO). It is being filled by Mr Ed Hagenlocker, until now in charge of Ford's North American automotive operations, who will report directly to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman. Below Mr Hagenlocker is a tier of four key managers, three heading up the main operating activities of FAO and the fourth Mr Albert Caspers, the new chairman of Ford of Europe. Australian Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe for the past 16 months, becomes FAO's group vice president for product development. Its marketing and sales operations are to be headed by Mr Robert Rewey, who currently has a similar role in North American operations. Manufacturing operations are to be overseen by Mr Robert Transou, a 32-year veteran of Ford who for the past three years has been general manager of powertrain operations. Mr Caspers becomes the fourth manager of the group, as Mr Nasser's successor at Ford of Europe. The five vehicle programme centres (VPCs) are to be headed by vice-presidents Mr Richard Parry-Jones, who will head up the Europe-based small front wheel drive programme; Mr James Donaldson (large front wheel drive cars), Mr Kenneth Kohrs (rear wheel drive cars), Mr James Englehart (personal use trucks) and Mr William Clay Ford Jr (commercial use trucks). Of the five VPCs, four are located in North America. However, Mr Trotman and his colleagues insist that this does not imply an emasculation of Ford's engineering and research and development presence in Europe. Mr Parry-Jones's VPC, although described as 'small' cars, in fact embraces vehicles up to and including cars like the Mondeo - seen as medium-sized almost everywhere outside North America - and likely to account for about one half of Ford's global sales. The appointment of the 36-year-old Mr William Clay Ford Jr, to head the commercial trucks VPC gives a strong career boost to one of only two Ford family members still playing a substantive operating role within the group. Ford's financial services operations are being run by Mr Edsel Ford II. Both are great grandsons of Henry Ford.</p>

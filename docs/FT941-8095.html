			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Beef mountain is down but not out - More curbs are on the Brussels agenda Racks of frozen beef stacked in a cold store in east London bear witness to one of the European Union's more costly and complex schemes to support farmers. It will spend about Ecu1.38bn (Pounds 1.08) on buying up surplus beef from farmers this year as part of the common agricultural policy's intervention system. Stocks of beef in cold stores across the EU hit a record level of 1.1m tonnes a year ago, leading to calls for cuts in the beef mountain. The amount of beef in intervention stores has since more than halved to 430,000 tonnes as a result of CAP reform and increased export opportunities. But the European Commission believes this is only a short-term respite and is urging farm ministers to agree further production curbs this year. Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, recently warned that the drop in beef stocks has not so much been caused by reform, 'but has to be explained by the cyclical movement of production'. He fears that the market will not remain so positive but will move into imbalance caused by over-production in one to two years. Mr Steichen is calling for prompt action to make adjustments to the beef regime in a 'calm' environment 'rather than in an emergency situation as has all too often been the case in the past'. His calls are backed by the UK government which wants to trim spending on beef - the second most expensive support system in the agricultural budget, beaten only by cereals. The commission is proposing adjustments to beef premium payments and is hoping that reforms already in place will reduce the role played by intervention. 'It's days are numbered as a real outlet and we hope it will end up as what it was always intended to be: a last resort,' a commission official explains. Instead of acting as a safety net to keep farmers producing beef, the intervention system encouraged over-production and the EU still raises far more beef than it needs. Ireland, for example, produces seven times its own beef consumption, with about 75 per cent usually going straight to intervention stores. 'Some farmers were producing heavyweight carcasses that had no commercial market and were going straight into intervention,' a UK farming official says. The irony about the support system is that the beef is often sold years after it is bought at a price that is not high enough to cover the costs of keeping it in cold storage - about Pounds 2.30 a tonne each week. Intervention beef hit the headlines in the UK last year when six-year old meat turned up at a butcher's shop in Devon. Sensitivity still runs high over frozen meat and the manager of an east London cold store demands anonymity for himself and his store even though his beef is a mere 18 months' old. Outside, 'Meat is Murder,' is scrawled on a wall. CAP reforms are starting to bite into the intervention system and will have an effect on overall beef production. Intervention prices have been cut by 5 per cent and will be come down by another 10 per cent over the next 2 years. On top of this, boards cannot buy until the market price falls to 80 per cent of the intervention price (which is set each year). This level will be cut to 60 per cent. At the same time, the EU has set gradually falling ceilings for the amount of meat that can be bought by intervention boards each year. This year 650,000 tonnes can be put into store, falling to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. It has also restricted the size of carcasses that can be bought. The commission can take action on its own to limit further the size of animals that can be bought by intervention as a way of reducing stocks. But if the EU's beef regime is to fit in with the requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, farm ministers will have to consider further reforms such as reducing beef premium payments, cutting export refunds or further restrictions to intervention as a way of trimming output.</p>

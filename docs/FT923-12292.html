			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, is expected to report tomorrow a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 187m for the six months to June 30. Most interest will focus on the group's two most recently launched financial products. The second phase of Dealing 2000, the group's automated foreign exchange trading system, finally started in April, while last month saw the launch of Globex, its long-delayed international after-hours screen trading system for futures and options. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, reports second-quarter results tomorrow. After weeks of focusing on Wellcome and its share offer, analysts have been dusting off their SB files. Estimates for pre-tax profits range from Pounds 246m to Pounds 258m, compared with Pounds 230m for the period last year. They will looking particularly at the rate of growth of Relafen, SB's arthritis drug, and how Kytril, its anti-nausea medicine is competing with Glaxo's Zofran. Few signs of growth in the consumer businesses are expected. John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retailer and newspaper wholesaler, is expected to report today pre-tax profits of about Pounds 23m for the year-ended April, little changed from last year's Pounds 21.5m after Pounds 4m of exceptional charges. Wholesaling has held up well but retailing has failed to show concrete improvement. Problems persist with its Early Learning Centre business in the US. Further provisions are expected and its sale is likely. Greycoat,the property developer, is likely to report on Thursday a full-year loss of about Pounds 7m, a big improvement on the previous year's Pounds 38.5m after Pounds 64m of provisions. First Technology, the maker of sensors and crash dummies, appears to have survived a nasty financial mishap. From a loss of Pounds 3m, it is likely to have done better than break even for the latest year when it reports on Thursday.

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISE ORDERED  </P> <P> A federal judge Tuesday ordered attorneys for the Immigration and  Naturalization Service and advocates for farm-worker amnesty applicants to work  out a compromise on a lawsuit filed against Border Patrol agents who have  illegally seized documents from dozens of migrant workers. U.S. District Judge  J. Lawrence Irving ordered INS attorney Charles Hamilton and Stephen Rosenbaum,  a lawyer with the California Rural Legal Assistance, to reach a compromise by  April 24. CRLA lawyers teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue  the INS in December to stop the border agents from seizing the documents.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AMERICAN MILITARY ACTION IN PANAMA  </P> <P> The widespread international castigation of the American intervention in  Panama, particularly by Libya, the Soviet Union, and neighboring Central and  South American countries, is unadulterated hogwash.  </P> <P> It is analogous to condemning the police for storming a house wherein a  drug-crazed criminal is holding a helpless child hostage.  </P> <P> The republic of Panama is a Frankenstein's monster that the United States  created in 1903 by aiding in its secession from Colombia, and the Canal is our  "baby" -- a product of American ingenuity and determination. Far from  interfering in the internal affairs of another nation, we are merely  safeguarding our own crucial interests, and assuring that the Panama Canal will  remain open to inter-ocean traffic from all the countries of the world.  </P> <P> MARVIN H.

"So far, not too many people have expressed such a  desire," remarked Tolstoshein. He and his aides began at their  desks early Saturday morning.    "We are restoring contacts with the kray administration, the  rift with which has brought nothing but harm to the city," the  head of the new administration told us about his first actions.  "First and foremost, we intend to take care of low-income city  residents, open stores for war veterans and disabled Afghan war  veterans, and take care of the elderly and children."    "For over nine months the former head of the administration,  Viktor Cherepkov, and his team seriously ran down the city  facilities, including the building from which they managed the  city," remarked Konstantin Tolstoshein. "Not to mention the  documentation, which the procuracy will sort out--that is how  much everything is messed up there. There were no books kept on  revenue and expenditures; no proper record keeping. As a result,  finances were expended irrationally."    Tolstoshein contends the newspaper BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK  "expressed Cherepkov's interests and received at his personal  directive several hundred million rubles. And this at a time of  catastrophic shortage of money for social needs, and the city's  municipal services are run down. Looking at their wasteful  masters, lower-rank officials also did not treat taxpayers'  money with respect."    "When I was asked to assume the job of head of city  administration, I thought hard about it," Konstantin Tolstoshein  said. "I knew it would be difficult: City residents have been  deceived by Cherepkov's populist slogans and his promises. I am  a native Maritime Kray resident. I began as a construction site  foreman, became head of rayon administration, and then headed  the kray administration's defense industry committee. I am used  to tackling difficult tasks."</p>

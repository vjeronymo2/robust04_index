			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Draft deal rallies aluminium - Market Report London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices continued to benefit yesterday from the positive sentiment fostered by the draft agreement on cutting global production. Speculative investment fund buying lifted the three-months price to Dollars 1,265 a tonne, a Dollars 33 gain from Monday, with the rise also fuelled by fresh buying of March and April Dollars 1,300 call options. The COPPER market, although remaining nervous about the implications of huge losses in futures trading suffered by Codelco, the Chilean state producer, was some Dollars 20 higher in the three months position and trying to erode chart-based resistance around Dollars 1,890 a tonne. The London GOLD was again led higher by SILVER, which gained 17 cents to Dollars 5.21 1/2 cents a troy ounce and looked like testing resistance at Dollars 5.25, traders said. The yellow metal closed at Dollars 384.75 an ounce, up Dollars 6.50 on the day. Compiled from Reuter</p>

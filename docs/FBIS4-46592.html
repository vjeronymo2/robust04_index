			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Grigoryev, engineer, under rubric "You </F> Ask, We Answer"]    [Text] "In VOYENNYYE ZNANIYA, No 10, 1991, you  included a photograph of an artillery piece on the back cover  without supplying its explanatory caption. What kind of gun is  this?    "N. Mekhrengin (Kirov Oblast)"    We are correcting our error, albeit belatedly.    Powerful reinforcing mortars were required during the Great  Patriotic War, and designing of 240-mm mortars along with 160-mm  mortars began in 1942. Several design bureaus were doing this at  the same time. Thus, the ZIS-27 (1942) and S-16 (1943) 240-mm  mortars were designed under V. Grabin. In 1943 OKB-172 (where  convicts worked) began working on the OB-29 240-mm mortar  project. The OB-29 weighed 3,500 kg deployed, the mortar round  weighed 125 kg, and the range of fire was 250-7,000 m.    During 1944-1945 B. Shavyrin's SKB [special design bureau]  developed the most powerful model of a 240-mm mortar. Plant  testing began back before the end of the war. Design  deficiencies were found in the course of testing, and after they  were remedied tests were renewed in 1947 and ended in 1949.  Shavyrin's 240-mm mortar, designated M-240, became operational  in 1950, at which time its range of fire was 8 km. In 1953 a  special, more powerful propelling charge was developed for the  M-240 which supported a range of fire of 9.7 km.    The M-240 240-mm mortar represents a rigid (without recoil  mechanisms), breech-loaded, smoothbore system on a wheeled  carriage, which fires a fin-stabilized projectile (mortar  round). It consists of the following basic parts: barrel with  breech mechanism, breech piece, frame with shock absorber, mount  with laying mechanisms and equilibrator, road wheels with  suspension, trail with mechanism for transferring the mortar to  a deployed and travelling position, base plate, and sights.    The barrel is a smoothbore tube secured in a trunnion band,  which has the capability of tipping on trunnions to position the  barrel for loading. The breech end is closed by an upward  swinging breech mechanism.    The mount consist of two frames (upper and lower) hinged  together. The lower is assembled on a two-wheeled axle.  Elevating gear and an equilibrator accommodated between brackets  of the axle and mount upper frame serve to lay the mortar for  elevation. There is a spring suspension, and wheels are  trolleybus type with foam rubber filling. The sight is a  panoramic MP-46.    The mortar is loaded from the breech end, for which the  barrel is placed in a horizontal position. A loading tray is  mounted after the breech mechanism is opened. Five team members  manually lift the mortar round, place it on the tray and ram it  into the bore. Then it is lowered into the breech piece for  firing.    The time for converting the M-240 from a travelling to a  deployed position at a previously prepared firing position is  20-25 minutes, and the reverse takes 15-20 minutes. The mortar  is moved by an ATL [light artillery prime mover] or other  artillery prime mover at a speed up to 40 km/hr. Ammunition for  it is in the body of the prime mover or in a motor vehicle.    In the late 1960's the gun part (model 2B8) of the 2S4  Tyulpan self-propelled mortar was designed on the basis of the  M-240, for which the 2B8 240-mm mortar was mounted on a special  chassis (Object 305). The barrel and ballistics were left  unchanged in the 2B8 tipping part of the 2S4 Tyulpan  self-propelled mortar. In contrast to the M-240, where all  operations were manual, the 2B8 has a hydraulic system which  completely replaces the team's difficult work of loading and  laying the mortar. Only laying for deflection remained manual.    In contrast to the M-240, the loading angle for the 2B8 is  around +63. Mortar rounds are fed automatically onto the  rammer guides from mechanical ammunition stowage in the chassis  body. Two ammunition stowage areas hold 40 high-explosive or 20  rocket-assisted mortar rounds. In addition, loading can be done  from the ground using a crane.    The V-59 diesel installed in the Tyulpan permitted  developing  a speed up to 62.8 km/hr on the highway and 25-30 km/hr on dirt  roads.    Both mortars fire the F-864 high-explosive steel round  weighing 130.7 kg, with explosives weighing 31.9 kg. The GVMZ-7  fuze has settings for instantaneous and delayed action. The  F-864 round has five charges giving it a muzzle velocity of from  158 to 362 m/sec and a corresponding range from 800 to 9,650 m.  The primer charge is in the round's central tube and the other  charges are contained in ring-shaped bags fastened to the  central tube with silk cords. In addition to the F-864, it is  possible to fire a rocket-assisted and a guided mortar round  from the 2B8. According to western press information, "special  charges" also were created for the M-240 and 2B8.    The following are the primary missions of 240-mm mortars:     -  destroy sturdy field stone-wood-earth structures;    -  destroy enemy personnel and equipment inaccessible to flat  trajectory fire of artillery pieces.        The latter quality makes the 240-mm mortar irreplaceable  when  operating, for example, in a city with high stone structures.  Using the 1st and 2nd charges, the steepness of fall of the  rounds becomes almost vertical, which ensures destruction of  practically any target. The rocket-assisted round increases the  range of fire, and the guided round selects and destroys point  targets, including armored equipment.    Not one country in the world has adopted such powerful  mortars in the postwar period. The present caliber of mortars of  the United States, England, France and Germany does not exceed  120 mm.

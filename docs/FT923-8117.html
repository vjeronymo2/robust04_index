			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Keppel raises first-half profits by 6.8% KEPPEL Corp, which runs Singapore's largest shiprepair yard plus banking, engineering and property activities, has announced pre-tax profits of SDollars 131.2m (USDollars 81.8m) for the six months to the end of June, a 6.8 per cent rise over the same period last year. Group turnover was down slightly to SDollars 746.6m. Keppel said performance had improved in shiprepairing, banking, financial services and engineering. The group's property sector had also benefited from continued growth in the Singapore property market. Analysts say Singapore's shiprepair yards are now among the world's most competitive, with charges up to 15 per cent lower than in South Korea. In recent months Keppel and other Singapore yards have increased shiprepair work on US navy vessels. Keppel is one of a number of groups involved in discussions with the Philippine authorities about leasing Subic Bay base, the former US naval base north of Manila. Keppel wants to convert Subic Bay into a commercial shiprepair yard and will soon put a formal proposal to the Philippines. The US is due to complete its move out of Subic Bay by the end of the year.</p>

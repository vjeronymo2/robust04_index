			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Researcher finds Gazza better than Godzilla NAMES that workers give their machines could provide factory managers with clues about boosting productivity, say occupational psychologists. Workers who give their machines menacing nicknames such as Frankenstein, Godzilla or Big Brother are likely to feel controlled by the technology, express lower job satisfaction and be less productive, the researchers say. Those who give their machines more friendly names, such as Winston, R2D2, Bob or Mildred, are likely to feel greater job satisfaction and be more productive workers. The study, on psychology and work, is being presented today to the annual conference of the British Psychological Society. It was carried out among skilled manufacturing workers in engineering and electronics plants. All those studied were using advanced computer-based technology and almost all personalised their machines with pet names. The less scope the machines left workers to set their own pace or decide their own working methods, the more likely it was that negative or authoritarian-sounding names would be given. The more affectionate names were reserved for machines that allowed greater room for initiative and which perhaps sometimes performed less than perfectly. One worker said he called his machine Gazza because it 'sometimes breaks down and leaks cooling fluid'. Dr Martin Corbett of Warwick University Business School, who wrote the report, said workers with the least job satisfaction felt the machines in their factories were treated more humanely than the people. When the machines performed well the credit went to the technology; when machines went wrong workers were blamed. His study concludes that supervisors need to make a conscious effort to praise work done well by humans. Dr Corbett said managers who found their workers were giving negative names to their machines should examine job design, otherwise they risked losing out on productivity as well as experiencing unnecessary turnover of skilled staff. 'Managers over-emphasise the importance of getting the technology right at the expense of the people issues,' he added.</p>

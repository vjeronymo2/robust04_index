			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- A total of 145 amendments to  the law against corruption have been discussed today by the  State Duma deputies.    The second reading of the law has brought no results, as the  deputies failed to agree on categories of responsibility of  officials. In the opinion of Deputy Artem Tarasov, "One cannot  compare the responsibility of the Central Bank head and the  minister of education". He also thinks that the prime minister  should not resign without giving an account of his work.  Tarasov gained no support of deputies.    The deputies want to prohibit high-ranking officials to  deliver lectures for payment. They also want state secret  information submitted to the tax inspection to remain  undisclosed. Some suggested to demand that all officials  produce their income declarations.    After a break the deputies will continue to discuss the  draft  law against corruption.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafslund pays NKr127m for Hydro Pharma HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian pharmaceuticals and shipping group, yesterday finalised its acquisition of Hydro Pharma, the drugs company, for NKr127.6m (Dollars 20.28m). Hydro Pharma, which has a turnover of about NKr180m, is one of the largest suppliers of pharmaceuticals to the Norwegian market. The company has about 200 employees. Following the acquisition of Hydro, Hafslund Nycomed's pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nycomed Pharma, will become the largest drugs group in Norway. The move is part of Hafslund Nycomed's drive to become a pure healthcare group and strengthen its non-imaging pharmaceutical portfolio which is considered weak. Earlier this year Hafslund said it would spin off its shipping interests, probably in June. Hydro Pharma specialises in rheumatic remedies, pain relief, skin care products and over the counter, non-prescription medicines. Hafslund Nycomed's expertise is in non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents and cardiovascular drugs. It is also developing a proton pump inhibitor, as well as anti-hypertensive and anti-thrombotic medicines. However, most of these products are still in the development stage. The acquisition should also strengthen Hafslund Nycomed's pharmaceutical marketing network in Scandinavia. The company has announced its intention to market its own products rather than licence them to third parties.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / De Klerk ready for KwaZulu showdown South African President F W de Klerk last night appeared ready to impose emergency measures in the KwaZulu black 'homeland'. The KwaZulu government vowed to resist any crackdown with force. Amid fears of further violent confrontation, the South African cabinet met for several hours to consider whether to impose a full state of emergency in Natal/KwaZulu province or more limited emergency measures. These would be aimed at halting political violence which has left a record 266 dead this month in Natal/KwaZulu and allow next month's all-race elections to take place. Mr de Klerk is expected to announce the government's next step at a press conference today after pressure from the African National Congress to declare an immediate state of emergency. KwaZulu is run by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom party wants the April polls delayed. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said yesterday: 'We would want the state of emergency to be declared right away. It is quite clear that the chief minister and Inkatha are determined to drown the country in blood in their determination to stop the election from taking place.' In the latest of a series of atrocities in Natal, five ANC members were executed when they were sent as peace envoys to a migrant workers' hostel controlled by Inkatha. A survivor of the attack said the killers had told him they were avenging the deaths of Inkatha members in shootings in Johannesburg on Monday. In a separate incident, a busload of Inkatha self-defence unit members was ambushed by ANC supporters near Eshowe, in northern Natal. No deaths were reported. Comments from Inkatha officials including Chief Buthelezi have added to the mood of impending confrontation. Mr Ziba Jiyane, an Inkatha spokesman, yesterday responded to rumours of an imminent declaration of a state of emergency by warning that 'we have not made a secret about the fact that we will resist' while Chief Buthelezi said Monday's violence was the beginning of 'a final struggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation'. What took place in Johannesburg was 'only the precursor of what will yet come', he said, warning ominously: 'There is no saying what the people will do in taking the law into their own hands.' ANC officials are confident that imposition of a state of emergency will dramatically reduce violence in Natal and leave Chief Buthelezi isolated, but emergency measures could backfire, infuriating Inkatha members and Zulu royalists and provoking more atrocities. Even the intervention of the security forces with emergency powers may not be enough to restore stability. KwaZulu's fragmented and mountainous geography makes it difficult to fight a guerrilla force like Inkatha's, however badly armed; and it is not clear whether the security forces will pursue the fight with vigour against a party which many of its members still consider to be the government's natural ally. Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, yesterday insisted that the crisis in Natal could not be allowed to delay the elections. 'Any attempt to postpone the elections or drown them in blood cannot be countenanced,' he said in a speech read on his behalf at a business meeting in Johannesburg. Business mood: Section II</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Learnt from the lord and master - A look at the success of the Hanson old boy network IF 1992 was a disappointing year for Lord Hanson, the chairman of Britain's biggest conglomerate, it was something of a vintage year for the group's former acquisition chiefs who have gone on to run their own companies. One after another, the Hanson alumni took to the takeover trail in a manner reminiscent of their former mentor. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins (who 'graduated' from Hanson in 1983) outbid Hanson to buy Ranks Hovis McDougall. Mr John Newman, chief executive of TT Group, (class of 77) acquired Magnetic Materials and made an agreed bid for AB Electronics. Mr Chris Miller and Mr Philip Turner, chief executive and strategy director respectively of Wassall, (class of 87) launched their biggest bid to date for Evode, the chemicals and plastic group. Lord Hanson, whose year was conspicuous for not pulling off a big deal, is delighted with the success of his former employees. 'We like to think we are spreading our philosophy around' he said. All members of the Hanson old boys club extol the virtues of working for their old boss. 'It's the can-do, will-do attitude which is so laudable' says Mr Hutchings. 'Hanson teaches you that you can get things done; there is no red tape'. Mr Miller says Hanson fosters an entrepreneurial culture which is infectious. Yet is there anything particularly unusual in Hanson's grooming of future chief executives? As Mr Hutchings puts it: 'When you think that thousands of people have been through Hanson it is not that exceptional that some have done well'. If that is the case, argues one conglomerate analyst, why are there no chief executives of new companies who worked at Imperial Chemical Industries? Lord Hanson likes to think that the difference between his group and other FT-SE 100 top companies is that he allows his executives at head office greater autonomy. In giving them that freedom he believes he helped clarify their own ambitions. If you are expected to come up with new ideas and initiatives it is not that surprising, argues Lord Hanson, that some decide to take a risk and do their own thing. If there is a leitmotiv that runs through the three conglomerates headed by former Hanson executives it is in their choice of targets. These tend to be lowish technology manufacturing businesses, which are not capital intensive. However, all three, with varying degrees of emphasis, would take umbrage at being called copy-cats. TT Group and Tomkins, believe they are more focused than Hanson. TT, which developed a reputation as an acquisitive industrial mini-conglomerate, has effectively transformed itself into an electronics product group through the purchase of Crystalate in 1990, the electronic components maker, and last year's takeover of Magnetic Materials, a USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, and now AB Electronics. Tomkins, notwithstanding its decision to go into bread making, argues that its mixtures of businesses, from guns to lawnmowers, is less diverse than those acquired by Hanson. Furthermore, both TT and Tomkins are generally not sellers of businesses. TT has only ever sold two divisions of companies it acquired and then only because it was offered 'large sums of money' for them. While Mr Hutchings says he is not in the business of selling and buying companies since he is not as good at it as Hanson. Wassall believes its decision to earmark Dollars 20m of capital expenditure at DAP, a US supplier of construction products and filling compounds, to replace old machinery over the next two years underlines its commitment to expanding and growing businesses - which is not what Hanson was best known for in the past. Wassall's senior managers are closest to Lord Hanson, not least because Hanson backed them from the beginning by taking a stake in their company. Mr Hutchings believes there are both pros and cons to having Hanson as a shareholder. 'It is great to have it but then they have an influence. You have to consider both the upside and the downside.' Mr Miller strongly disagrees. 'They do not have any influence at all, we benefit from the relationship. We are able to ring up Lord Hanson from time to time and receive free advice.' Lord Hanson says his conglomerate took a stake in Wassall because it was asked to do so. 'If Greg Hutchings had asked us we would have done it.' Mr Hutchings says it was not in his nature to do so. While Mr Newman, believing the cost of shell companies to be prohibitively high, was not in a position to ask Lord Hanson to invest in a public company. Instead, he ran private companies for 10 years after leaving Hanson, before reversing one of them into Tyzack Turner, later renamed TT. Wassall's ex-Hanson men are, however, aware of one possible downside of their close relationship with their former boss. They fear that they could face a public relations problem if Hanson was to sell his stake. It has already been diluted from 15 to 8 per cent. And, although Hanson has decided to take up its rights in Wassall's cash call to pay for Evode, Mr Miller believes that it may be in the best interests of both companies if Hanson slowly dilutes its stake further. All of Hanson's former executives are aware that the bigger they get the greater the problem in finding the next target. Size maybe less of a concern to TT, the smallest and most lowly rated of the conglomerates run by former Hanson executives. But all three share Hanson's need to continue to make further acquisitions, to maintain their momentum. Mr Hutchings received a nasty shock when Tomkins' shares fell sharply on news of his recommended bid for RHM, although they have recently recovered. Since Hanson's paper is less rated than Tomkins, it could not top Tomkins' Pounds 935m agreed bid for RHM without dipping deep into its cash reserves. Lord Hanson says it was of no concern to him that he lost RHM since he was happy to let Tomkins take 'the greater risk at a higher price'. He remains confident that this year he will break out of the shadow of his former colleagues by going back on to the acquisition trail.</p>

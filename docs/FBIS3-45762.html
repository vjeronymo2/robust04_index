Guided by the state development strategy for northwest  China,  large numbers of scientists and technicians have given up their  better working and living environments in coastal areas to work  in this remote province.    Thanks to their hard work over the past dozens of years,  Gansu has laid a solid foundation for the application of science  and technology.    The province now boosts China's first nuclear reactor, the  first satellite launching pad, the only state laboratory housing  a heavy- ion accelerator, as well as a number of state key  laboratories specializing in research into geochemistry and  tundra.    In addition, it now has a total of 768 scientific  institutions with over 330,000 scientists and technicians.    Sine 1987 the province has registered over 4,400 major  scientific achievements. Over 260 of these have won state  awards and nearly 700 projects have won province-level awards.    The scientific achievements have helped the province make an  additional 400 million yuan (50 million U.S. dollars) in  production value.    According to a special survey conducted by the State Science  and Technology Commission, the comprehensive scientific and  technological capacity of Gansu now ranks ninth in China.    Meanwhile, the province has given priority to applying  scientific achievements to farm production to upgrade  agricultural productivity.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Customs admits exceeding powers on VAT THE commissioners of Customs and Excise have admitted exceeding their powers in introducing regulations on the administration of valued added tax from January 26 1993. In a memorandum to the Commons committee on statutory instruments, the commissioners accept that they erred in introducing rules before the enabling statutory instrument was laid before parliament. The regulations were intended to remedy an inadvertent striking out of vital rules concerning input tax deduction. The committee found that the VAT (general) (amendment) regulations were ultra vires - beyond the commissioners' powers - to the extent that the rules purported to have a limited retrospective effect. The error would have been avoided if the regulations had not specified January 26 1993 - the day they were made - as the date for commencement or had specified commencement 'forthwith', the Commons committee said. The committee rebuked the commissioners for not notifying Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker of the Commons, and Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, that the instrument came into operation before it was laid before parliament. Dismissing the commissioners' claim that no 'useful purpose' would have been served by giving such notification, the Commons committee insisted that it could accept that a government department 'can give itself a dispensation from the need to explain the reasons'. The committee also criticised the commissioners for failing to issue the regulations free to people known to have purchased a copy of the defective instrument. The commissioners, explaining why they felt the need for urgency in giving effect to the regulations, said the whole of the system under which input tax deduction is made by taxable persons would have been jeopardised without the re-introduction of provisions which had been 'inadvertently revoked'.</p>

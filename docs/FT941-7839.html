			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Recruitment: It's all changing in the Footsie shuffle - Jobs / Putting finance directors in their place is no longer as straightforward as before Job shuffling among finance directors in Footsie 100 companies appears to be establishing a discernible pattern. As Caradon, Redland and Prudential all seek to fill finance director vacancies, what might have seemed straightforward musical chairs is developing more complex characteristics as companies and individuals embrace fundamental considerations about the general role of the finance director. City headhunters are reporting an increasing desire among large employers for more rounded career profiles among potential finance directors. They want strategists as much as they want accountants. The days of the boardroom number cruncher whose main concern is a polished set of accounts now seem to be on the wane. Gerald Corbett, the outgoing director of finance at Redland, about to move to Grand Metropolitan in April, and Archie Norman, who was finance director of Kingfisher before becoming chief executive of Asda in October 1991, are cited as the new role models for a changing breed. The moves appear to support evidence collected by Sir Geoffrey Owen, Professor Peter Abell and Mike Cranna at the London School of Economics. Their recent report, The Changing Role of the Finance Director, carried out for the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business, identified a desire for finance directors to have broader business responsibilities. Most of those surveyed said that the job would become more entrepreneurial. At the same time the report found that the role was becoming increasingly demanding with more complicated functions. This is not to say that traditional qualifications are no longer valued. An accountancy background and a degree would be considered essential by most leading companies. According to Carolyn Eadie of Spencer Stuart, the ideal CV for a financial director in a top public limited company might show combinations of accountancy, an MBA, treasury qualifications and experience as a strategy consultant. 'They could have a grounding in any of these four areas but qualifications in two of them might be expected,' she said. She added: 'There are still lots of people running big companies with few or no qualifications but it's a dwindling group.' The corporate finance route is still there but it appears to be becoming less fashionable. Philip Hampton, who joined British Steel from Lazards in 1991 and Patrick Dayton, who went to English China Clays from Schroders in 1992 are two examples of younger men who made the transition. John Hignett, whose retirement from the main board of Glaxo was announced this month, was in his mid 50s when he made the move a few years earlier. Hignett's corporate finance background as a managing director at Lazard Brothers merchant bank and a former head of the City's Takeover Panel was considered by some as an atypical preparation for such a post even then. Glaxo took a year of soul-searching, including advertising the post in newspapers, before falling back on the old boys' network. Hignett relinquished the finance director job more than a year ago while remaining on the Glaxo board, allowing John Coombe to slot into the role. Coombe now absorbs the rest of Hignett's duties, covering management and investment of corporate funds. Not all transitions are achieved so smoothly. Reports by recruiters of more boardroom shuffles in the pipeline may lead to some discomfort for insecure executives unaware that headhunters, operating in secrecy, are looking for replacements. In practice the unfortunate incumbent is often alerted, either intentionally to soften the blow or by a tip off on the boardroom grape-vine. Headhunters Norman Broadbent say that filling the post of finance director is the most sought-after requirement for top professional recruiters at present. As companies seek to refocus themselves some finance directors such as Daniel Cohen at Caradon and Michael Pragnell at Courtaulds have changed roles to adopt other board responsibilities. Movement inevitably creates a knock-on effect in the market for leading executives and the emergence from recession is increasing confidence not only in companies preparing for growth but in individuals who have been positioning themselves for a career leap over years of inactivity. Playing Footsie with finance directors may have only just begun. City Screen, the on-line magazine available to users of the Reuters service in the financial markets, has started a job advertise- ment section. The company believes that its rates - Pounds 400 for a single insertion running a week, discounted for longer runs - will compare favourably with newspaper advertising. Details of the service from City Screen UK, 146-148 Cromwell Road, London SW7 4EF. Tel: 071-835 1616. The table (left) shows a selection of findings from Day Associates' latest quarterly survey of pay and benefits in City of London banks.

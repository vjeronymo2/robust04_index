			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Small is beautiful in Spain The recent turbulence in European markets has brought some benefit to at least one investment sector - Spanish smaller stocks. They have achieved markedly better performances than shares of larger capitalised companies and enjoyed a boost in investor interest in a trend that some analysts forecast will continue. The James Capel Smaller Spanish index has tended to outperform the Madrid stock exchange index by 20 per cent, while some stocks have shown performances of over 30 per cent above the index over the past few months. As the economy begins to stir there has also been a significant movement into second line construction and building materials stocks. The shine has gone off the larger sectors for reasons apart from general market uncertainty with utilities, one of the major sectors in Madrid, having fallen off despite many analysts remaining positive on its fundamentals. Similarly the popularity of banks has slipped, largely in the wake of the Banesto affair. Ms Alexandra Perricone, a Spanish analyst with James Capel in London, said that the fortunes of smaller capitalised stocks were likely to continue, fuelled by general factors as well as their own potential. The lack of liquidity generally associated with small stocks has also been an important influence in squeezing up prices in Spain. Ms Nicola Mann at Smith New Court points to quite a strong degree of anticipation surrounding the performance of second line stocks. 'There was a great expectancy that the smaller stocks would outperform the larger ones and I think that will continue on the grounds of earnings growth as the reporting season in September moves closer,' she says. Along with low liquidity, Ms Mann also cites a lack of visibility as a factor in the swift movement of Spanish smaller stocks.</p>

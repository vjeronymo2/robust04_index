			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: Warning on failure of arms trade curbs ATTEMPTS TO control trade in weapons solely through agreements between supplier countries will fail in the long run to prevent proliferation and excessive arms build-ups. This warning is one of the conclusions of a report published today based on soundings among a wide range of arms experts and decision-makers, including government officials from 16 countries in Nato, the former Warsaw pact and the Third World. It also questions the extent to which 'selective embargoes' such as those against Iraq and Libya can be effectively enforced. The report by the Oxford Research Group. an independent study organisation devoted to security issues, says that 'supplier regimes' - on the lines of the current Missile Technology Control Regime - were regarded as no more than holding operations that would slow down proliferation. Negotiations should aim instead at a 'participatory regime' involving voluntary co-operation among all producers and buyers, on either a regional or a global basis, according to the report. Independent inspectorates could be set up to monitor compliance, with sanctions imposed on countries failing to agree to inspections or violating the rules. 'At no time has the political will world-wide been more favourable towards the negotiation of international controls,' the report says. It highlights widespread scepticism about the effectiveness of the UN arms register due to be set up in the aftermath of the Gulf war. The first data for the register, referring to 1992 arms transfers, is due to be supplied by April 30 next year.

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Labour may continue with full fleet of Trident subs A CLEAR hint that a Labour government might consider going ahead, after all, with a full fleet of four Trident nuclear missile submarines was given yesterday as the first of the vessels was ceremonially rolled out of its construction hall. The 16,000-ton Vanguard submarine was built at VSEL's shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, said Labour's decision on the fourth submarine would be based on whether it would cost more to cancel it or to complete construction. Speaking on BBC radio he said that only as a government would Labour have access to confidential analyses on the number of submarines required. 'Until we are persuaded that a fourth Trident is needed we will operate on the basis of not having a fourth Trident, unless cancellation costs are greater than completion costs,' said Mr Kaufman. He added that the party had so far seen 'no convincing clear defence argument' that a fourth submarine was needed. He accused the government of having 'absolutely no idea' what it wanted to do with the Trident force. The contract for the fourth submarine is still under negotiation and is not expected to be placed before the general election. But the vessel is already a quarter built, with more than Pounds 140m already spent on it. VSEL yesterday challenged estimates that Pounds 450m would be saved by cancelling the submarine, putting the potential savings at less than Pounds 250m. Observer, Page 16</p>

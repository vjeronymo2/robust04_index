			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Bundesbank bows to external pressures THE Bundesbank's agreement to cut its official interest rates today to support the realignment within the European Monetary System was seen in Germany last night as sensational and unprecedented. It would appear to be the biggest concession made in the history of the bank  - admitting the limitations of its independence, a legal position guaranteed by the German constitution. No commentators or official spokesmen were prepared to admit that the interest rate cut would be automatic, and it seems likely to be fiercely debated within the central bank's governing council. Yet it also seems impossible to believe that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president, could agree to an interest rate cut without being sure they could gain a majority in the council. The Bundesbank last night would only confirm that an extraordinary meeting of the council would be held at 9am today. Spokesmen refused to speculate on how big the expected cut in discount and Lombard rates would be. The move reveals the quite extraordinary pressure, from within and outside Germany, which the central bank has been under to relax its harsh monetary policy  - because of implications for German economic growth, economic recovery in Europe, and the wider international economy. Hitherto, the Bundesbank directors have been adamant that their policy was dictated solely by the need to curb monetary expansion in Germany, stabilise inflation, and ensure the stability of the D-Mark. Only last Thursday, Mr Otmar Issing, a leading member of the executive council, insisted the bank would not be deflected by outside criticism from its policy of pursuing firm monetary targets. The strategy was 'without any convincing alternative'. And yet the bank has been unable to ignore the turmoil in the currency markets  - leading last night to the devaluation of the lira  - as, in part, a consequence of its own high interest rate policy. The differential, above all, with US interest rates has been a key element driving currency speculation, aggravated by perceived differences in strength between EMS members. Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank, said the central bank's move was a 'real sensation'. There was no previous example of such a move, although there had been both political pressure, and great currency turbulence, in the past. 'It is a 180 degree turn, very hard to understand,' he said. 'It is incredible that the Bundesbank is ready to call an emergency meeting.' The argument in recent days, however, was that the central bank could no longer conduct its policies as if in isolation from the rest of the European and world economy  - and the currency markets have forced the point home. Pressure for a realignment of the currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS had become well-nigh irresistible. On the other hand, the German government had been against a revaluation on the grounds that a stronger D-Mark would make any recovery of German exports even more difficult. Thus the bank must have come under concerted pressure in recent weeks not just from other banks and finance ministers in Europe, but from the government in Bonn. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, made his relief perfectly clear last night when he said an interest rate cut would 'improve the preconditions for a strengthening of economic growth in both Germany and Europe. Positive pulses will also go out to the world economy.' 'The reason for lower interest rates would be better inflation prospects and a weakening west German economy,' said Mr James Cornish, an economist at County NatWest of the UK, who visited the Bundesbank last week. It was not possible to say yet whether the economy was in a temporary dip or sliding into recession, he added. The apparent willingness of the Bundesbank to compromise its reputation for absolute and often bloody-minded independence will also worry those in Germany who fear for the future political influence on a single European central bank. Germany has hitherto been adamant that such a successor to the Bundesbank must, if anything, be more independent of political considerations; for example, coming from ministers of finance in the EC Council of Ministers. France, on the other hand, and President Francois Mitterrand in particular, has made it clear that the final word on European monetary policy must lie with the Council of Ministers. Now it may be argued that the German central bank has already proved unable to resist the pressures from the European governments. Its defenders may reply that all it is doing is responding to the irresistible pressures of the currency markets, which threatened to undo its own good work in seeking to curb German monetary growth.  -------------------------------------        NEW ECU CENTRAL RATES  ------------------------------------- Bfr                    42.0639 DM                      2.03942 DKr                     7.77921 Pta                   132.562 FFr                     6.83992 pounds                  0.691328 Dr                    251.202 I pounds                0.761276 LFr                    42.0639 L                    1636.61 Fl                      2.29789 Esc                   177.305  -------------------------------------</p>

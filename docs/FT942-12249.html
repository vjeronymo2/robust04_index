			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A difference that is more than just semantics Sir, I read with interest Lucy Kellaway's excellent article, 'Game rules in black and white' (April 25). However, her assertion that competencies 'may include skills, knowledge, understanding and will-power' is fundamentally flawed. Our latest research at Ashridge indicates that it is necessary to separate competence, identified as qualities or attributes, from competencies which are management behaviours in a role. The failure to identify these two distinct yet complementary elements lies at the root of much of the confusion surrounding the successful implementation of competencies for top managers. It is not just a question of semantics. Christopher Conway, senior researcher, Ashridge Management Research Group, Ashridge Management College, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire HP4 1NS</p>

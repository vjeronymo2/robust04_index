			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Adviser to Kohl will step down MR HORST KOHLER, state secretary responsible for international relations in Germany's Finance Ministry and a close adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is planning to quit next year to become president of Germany's influential association of savings banks. The move means Mr Kohl will lose an important confidant at a sensitive time for Germany and the world economy. Mr Kohler is said to want more time with his family. He was Germany's chief negotiator for the economic aspects of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Kohl's sherpa for world economic summits, and leader of western negotiations with Russia on an international aid package.

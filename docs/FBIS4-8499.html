			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jamil Rufa'il: "Albanian Leader of Kosovo </F> Province Tells AL-HAYAH: Our Goal, Independence; We Call on  Americans to Intervene to Resolve Our Issue"]    [Text] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Province's  Albanians, who are striving for independence from the Serbian  Republic, declared that he rejects any solution to the Kosovo  problem that takes into consideration the plan being followed in  the Krajina region, with its Serbian majority, which is aimed at  keeping it within a federation with Croatia. Rugova called on  the Americans to intervene in Kosovo, "because that would be a  natural thing to do, after the biased Russian intervention."    Rugova talked with AL-HAYAH by telephone from the  headquarters of the Albanian Democratic Alliance [Democratic  Alliance of Kosovo], which he heads in Pristina. In his capacity  as president of the Kosovo republic, elected by the Albanian  majority in accordance with a popular plebiscite held in the  region two years ago, Rugova said: "Kosovo is an independent  neutral country. I cannot bow to pressures and agree to  self-government within the Serbian Republic, even if it were to  a maximum extent."    Albanians, who constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's population,  consider Rugova president of the republic, which they  unilaterally proclaimed. Rugova went on to say that  "independence is the best solution for our problem. We shall not  retreat from this position, after the experience we have had  with the Serbs for more than 80 years, during which they  practiced every form of arbitrary behavior, persecution, and  ethnic cleansing against us."    The Albanian leader considers the situation in Kosovo as  different from Krajina during the previous Yugoslav regime,  "because Krajina was a autonomous unit within the Yugoslav  Federal Union, which gave it the right to self-determination,  just like parts of the other federation."    Rugova would not object to studying general ties within the  scope of the Balkan region, "on condition that this were to come  about after Kosovo is freed from direct Serbian domination and  can determine its own fate."  <H5>  Violence and Terror </H5>   Rugova described the current conditions in Kosovo as  distressing. "There is no open warfare, but there is violence  and terrorism toward Albanian citizens. This makes it necessary  to prevent a tragic catastrophe as occurred in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially since we lack any internal or  external protection, including even the presence of  international observers, after the Serbian Republic demanded  their withdrawal at the end of last year."    Rugova considers the heavy Serbian military presence in  Kosovo, especially the internal security force that implements  the state of emergency, as most dangerous, an ominous indicator  that an eruption or outbreak of real war could happen at any  moment, "despite the fact that we are still trying not to react  to provocations and violence, in order to avoid conflict or even  worse consequences."    Rugova revealed a plan he had submitted to the United States  and several European Community nations to resolve this very  sensitive issue in stages, "beginning with temporarily placing  Kosovo under international protection. We would prefer U.S.  forces under UN supervision. During this period, Kosovo's future  can be studied with the parties involved in this issue."    He stressed that during his meetings with American and  European officials, he called for "linking the present  international embargo against Yugoslavia (Republics of Serbia  and Montenegro) with a settlement of the issue of Albanians in  Kosovo."  <H5>  Partition of Kosovo </H5>   Rugova has rejected all plans aimed at partitioning Kosovo  into Serbian and Albanian states, especially since this idea was  first presented by the Serbian opposition. It was then endorsed  by the previous Yugoslav (Republics of Serbia and Montenegro)  president, Dobrica Cosic, and repeated by many others at other  times. "However, it is unacceptable, because there is no clear  ethnic Serbian part of Kosovo, with the exception of certain  villages. The other parts are Albanian. One should note that  Serbian plans are to gain mastery over those areas that are rich  in resources." He added that partition would not solve the  problem, "because a million Albanians would remain in Serbian  areas, which would result in a continuation of the present  situation and the absence of a permanent solution."    Regarding negotiations with authorities in the Serbian  Republic, Rugova emphasized that they stopped when contacts  failed a year ago concerning studies in Albanian schools. "We  want to resume them and continue the dialogue, but the Serbs  present crippling conditions that have previously been  submitted, in order to get us to relinquish our goal of  independence and recognize Serbian authority over Kosovo in all  political areas in the region."  <H5>  Russians Are Biased </H5>   Rugova criticized Russia's totally biased position vis-a-vis  the Serbs. He considered the Russian delegations' visits to  Kosovo as a kind of direct provocation against the Albanians,  since the Russian parliamentary (Duma) delegation, which came to  Kosovo last week, showed outright extremism, to such a degree  that it tried to spread fear and panic among the Albanians.  "However, we made it clear to them that we no longer feared  anyone, after we dhqna al-amrin [words as  transliterated] from the Serbs."    Rugova explained that American intervention in the Albanian  issue in Kosovo would be natural after the Russian activities.  "We made our position clear to both sides. We call for direct  American intervention in this issue." He indicated that the  Kosovo Albanians would welcome any agreement in the Balkans that  would contribute to relieving the tension in the region. "At  this point, we salute the federation between Bosnian Muslims and  Croats."</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> VOLCKER BACKS BUSH PLAN TO SALVAGE S&amp;LS;  </P> <P> RIEGLE, GARN VOW QUICK, NONPARTISAN ACTION ON PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker today gave a general  endorsement to the Bush Administration's effort to rescue the savings and loan  industry, as members of Congress said they intend to act on a bailout package  as quickly as possible.  </P> <P> Volcker, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, said that while he had  not had a chance to review the Bush proposal in detail he believed that it  addressed all of the major problems facing the S&amp;L industry.  </P> <P> "I welcome the Administration's initiative this early in the (congressional)  session," Volcker said. "The President's program provides a very good base for  your consideration of legislation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Competitive Danger  </P> <P> Volcker said he was concerned that the deposit insurance premiums on savings  and loans and the nation's commercial 13,000 banks not be raised so high that  it put the institutions at a competitive disadvantage with other financial  entities.  </P> <P> "My sense is that the increased insurance premiums goes to the edge of  viability in terms of not undermining the health of the financial industry,  which is under heavy competition," he said.  </P> <P> Volcker also said he disagreed with the Administration's proposal to abolish  the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as an independent regulatory agency. President  Bush's plan would retain only the chairman of the bank board, making him the  head of an S&amp;L regulatory agency that would be placed under the  jurisdiction of the Treasury Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Keep Bank Board  </P> <P> Volcker said that instead of abolishing the three-member bank board he would  prefer leaving it as an independent regulatory agency but split off its  oversight of the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) said he and Sen. Jake Garn of  Utah, the panel's ranking Republican, plan to introduce the Administration's  package as soon as it is submitted and schedule early hearings in an effort to  vote the measure out in as short a time as possible.  </P> <P> "I am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match the speed of  the Administration," Riegle said at the beginning of the hearing. Both Riegle  and Garn called on the other committee members to set aside partisan  differences and work with dispatch to report a bill to the full Senate.  </P> <P> "This problem is serious enough that we don't have time to be partisan about  it," Garn said. "I hope we can get together in the next few months to pass  legislation."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist  People's Army (EPS), said yesterday that no deadlines are being  imposed on the 3-80 Northern Front for the disarmament of its  members.    "We are not putting them against the wall or imposing  deadlines, but we hope it does not take too long because  everything could fall apart," General Ortega said in a  conciliatory tone after turning over a former military  installation to the Nicaraguan Ecologist Brigades.    Ortega said, however, that the disarmament process of the  rebels from the 3-80 Northern Front could begin in the next few  days.    The 3-80 Northern Front staff sent the government a list  with  10 demands, including "the post of police chief in Jinotega and  Nueva Segovia Departments, as well as in the Municipalities of  Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, San Juan de Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma,  Ciudad Antigua, Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal,  and Bocay."    According to the rebel leader's letter, the Army could  continue to keep garrisons of up to 60 men in those  municipalities, except Quilali.  <H5>  No One Has Been Defeated </H5>   The rebel leader Chacal also demands that the EPS return to  its barracks and a subsequent demilitarization of northern  Nicaragua.    The list of demands is signed by Esteban, Piloto, Franklin,  Musun, Chele Gringo, and Rafael. The document also includes the  creation of new settlements for development in Quilali and road  repairs in the area.    The EPS chief said that once the rebel groups have disarmed,  the only remaining troublesome groups will be the criminal  bands, therefore there will be no reason to have EPS combat  units in the area.    "We are willing to decrease the Army's military presence as  long as they return to civilian life," Ortega said.    The EPS chief said: "Just as I told Talavera -- Chacal -- in  the letter I sent him, no one is being defeated here. They will  be returning to civilian life with dignity, and Nicaragua will  be the winner."    According to Ortega, total peace will only be achieved by  resolving the economic and social crisis. "If unemployment and  poverty continue, peace will remain threatened," the military  chief said.  <H5>  Meeting Next Monday </H5>   A meeting between the chiefs of staff and the government, in  which Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command of the EPS,  could participate, will be held next Monday in Ciudad Antigua, a  government source told BARRICADA.    As for the controversial Military Organization Law, the Army  chief said the draft bill is almost finished and will soon be  turned over to the government for review.</p>

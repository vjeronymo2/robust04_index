			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Mining groups to lift Ivernia stakes TWO BIG mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, are to increase their interests in Ivernia West, the junior Irish exploration company which owns 48 per cent of Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen, County Tipperary. Ivernia is to raise IPounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.15m), before expenses, by a conditional placing of 11.6m shares at I39p each compared with an unchanged closing price yesterday of I37p. Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is to subscribe for enough shares to take its present 16.9 per cent stake to 24.5 per cent while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish resources group, will raise its shareholding slightly from 24.3 per cent to 24.5 per cent. The balance of the Ivernia shares have been conditionally placed. Proceeds will be mainly spent at Lisheen where Ivernia expects to contribute IPounds 3.75m to the joint venture during the coming year.</p>

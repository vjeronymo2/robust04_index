			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Chinese buy 10% stake in Cathay Pacific TWO CHINESE companies yesterday said they would buy a 10 per cent holding in Cathay Pacific from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for HKDollars 3.39bn (Pounds 227m). China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), and China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong Kong (CTS), will each take a 5 per cent share in the airline and a seat on the company's board. The sale ends Hongkong Bank's direct financial involvement in Cathay. It was an early supporter of the airline, which was founded soon after the Second World War. By 1983, the bank owned 30 per cent of Cathay but has since reduced its interest. The Chinese holding, together with that owned by Beijingcontrolled CITIC Pacific, takes China's disclosed interest in Cathay to 22.5 per cent. In Hong Kong, the purchase was seen as a further safeguard of Cathay's business interests. It may also help mitigate the tension between Cathay and China's civil aviation administration. Mr Peter Sutch, Cathay's chairman, said the company was pleased to have CNAC and CTS as shareholders. 'Their involvement . . . reflects the increasing co-operation between airlines in Hong Kong and aviation and tourism interests in the People's Republic of China,' Mr Sutch said. The bank said it made an exceptional profit of HKDollars 3.16bn on the transaction. It sold its 143.4m shares in Cathay for HKDollars 11.80 - HK10 cents lower than Friday's closing price. Mr William Purves, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank chairman, said the bank had intended to retain a long-term investment in Cathay. But aviation was not one of the bank's core activities and it responded positively to an approach to sell its holding. Cathay approached the bank about four months ago on behalf of the two companies. The bank was initially reluctant to sell, but, according to one executive close to the deal, assessed that an increase of the Chinese stake in Cathay was in the airline's best interest. The bank's share price rose strongly on the announcement, closing HKDollars 3 higher at HKDollars 52. Cathay's share price ended HK70 cents higher at HKDollars 12.60. Lex, Page 18</p>

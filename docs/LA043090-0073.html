			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSTANG'S MAYHEM A WILD RIDE FOR POLICE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: NOW THAT MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZITELLO 'IS OUT OF THE WAY,'  AUTHORITIES SAY THEY CAN CONCENTRATE ON TWO STILL UNSOLVED MURDERS AND THE  ARSON FIRE THAT BROUGHT THE CLUB DOWN.  </P> <P> The cavernous Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard was once a bar owner's dream.  </P> <P> Every night, a mix of coat-and-tie yuppies, beer-bellied bikers and off-duty  soldiers crowded around a horseshoe-shaped bar, attracted by the loud rock  music and the topless dancers.  </P> <P> "The money was just pouring in," said one law enforcement official.  </P> <P> But with success came violence. The club's profits may have been the catalyst  for a 15-month period in which the Mustang's first manager and one of its  bouncers were murdered, its major investor blinded and left for dead, and the  club itself torched and burned to the ground.  </P> <P> But despite the sentencing of a major Los Angeles organized crime figure two  weeks ago for his role in the violence, still unsolved are the two murders and  the arson, and law enforcement officials are still searching for answers.  </P> <P> Los Angeles racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello, 62, considered by organized  crime experts the most violent member of the Milano crime family, was sentenced  to 33 years in prison for the near-fatal shooting of C. William Carroll, the  Mustang's chief financial backer. Rizzitello "gopher" Joseph Angelo Grosso, 46,  is serving a 26-year-to-life prison term for helping him in the Carroll hit.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended that Rizzitello wanted to muscle in on the Mustang's  profits and tried to remove Carroll, who he believed would resist those plans.  But still unsolved are:  </P> <P> * The murder of Jimmy Lee Casino, 48, the club's originator and first manager,  shot three times in the head at his Buena Park home on New Year's Day, 1987.  </P> <P> * Two arson fires, the last one demolishing the club on Jan. 16, 1988. One man  has been convicted in the arson cases. But investigators believe he was a hired  hand, and while they have an unnamed suspect as the mastermind, no other  arrests have been made.  </P> <P> * The murder of George (Big George) Yudzevich, 46, the club's liaison with  organized crime, found shot to death March 3, 1988, in an Irvine industrial  park.  </P> <P> "Now that Rizzitello is out of the way, we can concentrate our manpower on  these other cases," one law enforcement official said. "We're going to take a  harder look than ever at what was going on at that club."  </P> <P> The Mustang began when Casino convinced investors that a topless bar in Orange  County would be a moneymaker, according to testimony and evidence presented at  the Rizzitello and Grosso trials.  </P> <P> Carroll, a real estate investor and financier who once served a prison term for  fraud, became Casino's major benefactor, eventually providing about $200,000,  court records show.  </P> <P> Casino was as flamboyant as he was quick to make enemies. But he knew how to  run a nightclub.  </P> <P> The Mustang thrived, even as Casino outmaneuvered the Santa Ana officials who  tried repeatedly to shut the club. The club officially became a theater after  Casino persuaded a judge that it was more than just a topless bar.  </P> <P> But despite the profits, Casino was beset by money troubles. He somehow could  not pay off all of his loans. And his troubles mounted when federal officials  claimed in 1986 that he owed unpaid taxes.  </P> <P> He secured a five-figure loan from Carroll, who demanded that should Casino  default, Carroll would essentially gain control of the club's operation. And  Casino defaulted.  </P> <P> He returned to his Buena Park home with his girlfriend after a New Year's Eve  party in 1987 to find two gunmen waiting. They escorted the couple into the  house. The woman was raped. Casino was shot three times in the head, and died.  </P> <P> Soon after the shooting, Rizzitello sought out Carroll, who had assumed a more  active role at the club. Rizzitello proposed several business ventures, which  Carroll resisted, according to testimony at both the Rizzitello and Grosso  trials. Carroll said he did eventually loan Rizzitello $10,000.  </P> <P> At the time, Carroll was not happy about the club's operation. Grosso and  Yudzevich, who both had ties to Rizzitello and were regular visitors to the  club, upset him the most. Carroll testified that he learned they were selling  cocaine at the club to some of the dancers, and he tried to get the new  manager, Gene Lesher, to throw them out. Yudzevich, at 6 feet, 7 inches and  more than 350 pounds, eventually became a club bouncer, and Grosso an  occasional driver for Carroll. Grosso also sold lingerie to the dancers in the  $10,000 business arrangement between Carroll and Rizzitello.  </P> <P> In April of 1987, someone took a shot at Carroll on Harbor Boulevard after he  left the club. Several weeks later, on April 30, Carroll and Rizzitello met at  Emilia's restaurant in Santa Ana. Carroll wanted to talk about the lack of  return on his $10,000 loan, and Rizzitello had said he would help find out who  had shot at Carroll. Grosso was present.  </P> <P> Carroll testified that the two used a ruse to persuade him to accompany them to  a vacant parking garage near the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where  Rizzitello shot him three times in the head while Grosso held him down.  </P> <P> "We never discussed anything at the dinner that would lead me to believe I was  heading for trouble," Carroll said in an interview last week. "It was strictly  an ambush."  </P> <P> According to Carroll's testimony, Rizzitello told him before firing the  .38-caliber handgun: "This is for not letting us eat."  </P> <P> Carroll was shot three times in the head. He was saved after emergency surgery,  but was left permanently blind. For 18 months, he refused to say who fired the  shots.  </P> <P> During those 18 months, Carroll has since testified, he was repeatedly  threatened by Rizzitello, through other agents who told him he would be killed  if he told who had shot him.  </P> <P> One of the calls came from Yudzevich, who admitted to Carroll that he had  gotten rid of the gun and the bloody clothes for Rizzitello and Grosso. Carroll  said Yudzevich apologized for having anything to do with the attack.  </P> <P> But to others, Yudzevich boasted about his role.  </P> <P> "Big George wanted people to know he was a stand-up guy; look what he had done  for Rizzitello," one law enforcement official said.  </P> <P> With Carroll out of the picture, Mustang manager Lesher became an easy target  for Rizzitello, according to prosecutors. Lesher, fearful for his life,  testified that he caved in to the veiled threats of Rizzitello, who he said  wanted to take over the club. Yudzevich was the man Rizzitello put there to  collect his share -- $5,000 a week in money skimmed from profits which was  never accounted for to the government for tax purposes, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Yudzevich continued to act as collector, despite the fact that he had testified  against former organized crime associates in a New York investigation.  Yudzevich had spent time in the federal witness protection program.  </P> <P> Fires closed the Mustang at the end of 1987. Three months later, on March 12,  1988, Yudzevich's huge frame was found sprawled on the pavement near the trunk  of his Cadillac in the parking lot of a linen factory on Mitchell Street in  Irvine. Late at night, he had been shot three times in the head while sitting  in the driver's seat of his car, but managed to get out before dying.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, Carroll finally agreed to cooperate with authorities. He had  waited, he said, until a bank fraud case pending against him was resolved as a  misdemeanor with no jail sentence. Carroll said he feared Rizzitello would have  had him killed in the Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> Casino, Yudzevich and Carroll were all shot in a similar fashion.  </P> <P> But were they all shot by the same person? The police aren't so sure.  </P> <P> Police say there is only one primary suspect in the Yudzevich shooting --  Rizzitello.  </P> <P> At the time of his death, Yudzevich was hiding from the former organized crime  associates he had testified against. He lived in a motel but stayed primarily  in his car, where he kept most of his clothes.  </P> <P> Meir J. Westreich, Carroll's attorney, said at a news conference last week that  what most law enforcement officials involved are privately convinced of is  true.  </P> <P> "There is only one man who could have convinced Big George to drive down to a  place like that at night," Westreich said.  </P> <P> That was his former roommate and his best friend, Joey Grosso, law enforcement  officials believe. And Grosso, authorities theorize, only did what Rizzitello  directed.  </P> <P> After the Yudzevich shooting, Grosso was interviewed by The Times about his  friend's death.  </P> <P> "When you testify in court against known killers, it's crazy, mind-boggling  that he did not stay in that protection program," Grosso said.  </P> <P> But Grosso's logic has not impressed authorities.  </P> <P> "Big George and Joey were just like those two characters (Lennie and George) in  'Of Mice and Men,' " one official said. "Nobody, but nobody, could have set up  Big George except Joey."  </P> <P> Authorities are convinced that Rizzitello was upset that Yudzevich was telling  too many people about the Carroll shooting.  </P> <P> Before Grosso's sentencing last December for his role in the Carroll shooting,  Grosso tried to negotiate a deal. News reports speculated then that prosecutors  wanted Grosso to testify against Rizzitello. But prosecutors wanted Grosso to  talk about the Yudzevich murder. He refused, and the Yudzevich case is still  under investigation.  </P> <P> As sure as some of the authorities are about who killed Yudzevich, that's how  unsure they are who killed Casino.  </P> <P> "Right now there is no one single suspect in the Casino killing," one law  enforcement official said. "Rizzitello may have decided to use Casino to make  his mark, to say, 'I'm here; you have to deal with me.' But there are others  too who could have done it. You have to untangle that whole thing about the  Mustang's operation."  </P> <P> One police report early in the Casino murder investigation named Carroll as a  "prime suspect," evidence stressed by the Rizzitello defense.  </P> <P> But prosecutors have pointed out that everyone involved with Casino at that  time was considered a suspect.  </P> <P> Carroll has steadfastly denied any involvement in the Casino killing. And  prosecutors have publicly stated Carroll is not a suspect in that case.  </P> <P> Carroll acknowledged during his testimony that the Mustang was a success. But  in a news conference after the Rizzitello sentencing, Carroll said he regrets  the day he heard the club's name. He lost about $90,000 in the Mustang, and  nearly lost his life.  </P> <P> The hardest part, Carroll said, was coping with his blindness.  </P> <P> "For a long time I kept saying: 'Why me? Why me?' Then finally I woke up one  morning and said to myself, 'It is you. And that's the way it's always going to  be.' "  </P></p>

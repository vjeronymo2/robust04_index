			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "MFN Hangs in Balance"] </F>   [Text] A top Chinese trade official said last week that  Sino- U.S. economic relations will remain buoyant this year, but  she warned of the dangers of political interference.    Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi  recognized the very complimentary nature of the Chinese and  American economies and the fact that bilateral trade had surged  in recent years.    Trade between the two hit $23.2 billion in the first 11  months of last year, well ahead of 1992's total of $17.5 billion.    However the U.S.'s annual review of China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) status remains a problem.    "It is unwise to add political conditions to the MFN as a  means of pressure," she said. "It will only damage our  bilateral economic and trade relations."    She described as "unacceptable" the recent remarks by the  U.S. Government that "China's human rights and arms sales will  be part of the MFN."    The U.S. has until June to decide whether to extend China's  status for another year.    Analysts said the review mechanism has thrown a cloud of  uncertainty over Sino-U.S. relations and the both business  communities.    "We hope to get rid of the shadow haunting the MFN issue so  that bilateral economic relations can make greater progress," Wu  said.    She is scheduled to preside over an important meeting in  Washington this April along with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron  Brown.    The eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on  Commerce and Trade aims to shed light on a wide range of issues  concerning bilateral trade and investment.    "I believe this session will be positive for our bilateral  relations," Wu said.    During the meeting, China will stage two large-scale trade  and investment fairs.    High-profile business people from the two countries will be  present and seek co-operation in a series of major projects, Wu  said.    But she did not mention the specific fields to which these  projects belong.    Wu said China attaches great importance to developing  Sino-U.S. economic relations, but she maintained that trade  conflicts "should be tackled through consultation rather than  unilateral retaliation."    She revealed that she would discuss with Brown the  discrepancies in trade statistics between the two countries.    Meanwhile, Wu expressed optimism about China's re-entry into  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the Gatt's  Uruguay agreement takes effect.    "China is now qualified to resume its contracting party  status in Gatt," she said.    And she added that issues raised by other Gatt contracting  parties "are liable to be solved through earnest consultation."    Gatt has decided to convene the 16th session of its working  party on China in Geneva in March, which Wu said will be a  strong stimulus to China's bid to rejoin the world trade body.    She said a uniform foreign exchange rate, adopted since  January 1, will further mesh China's trade regime with Gatt  rules.</p>

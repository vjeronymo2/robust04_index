If insufficient candidates have been proposed for any seat, the election committee shall select additional candidates as required. The slates shall be prepared not later than 5 days after the date for receiving names of candidates by the election committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) After all candidates have been listed on the slates of candidates, the slates shall be supplied to an independent certified public accounting (CPA) firm contracted by the election committee.

Ballots that are not returned to the CPA firm within 20 days shall be declared invalid.

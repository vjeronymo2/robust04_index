			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Omens for Zeneca investors - The Bottom Line SO THERE it is: Britain's industrial bellwether has split itself in two. From Tuesday investors will be able choose between ICI chemicals and Zeneca, the bioscience company hewn from the industrial giant which is starting life with a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. ICI shareholders should get their Zeneca share certificates the week after next, and have until June 21 to decide whether to take up their rights. If the demerger opens a new chapter in Britain's industrial history, the story so far has not been a happy one. As the chart shows, ICI peaked against the All-Share index in 1975, since when it has consistently failed to perform. That might explain shareholders overwhelming willingness to back the split at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting. Whether radical surgery can reverse ICI's long history of underperformance remains an open question. At first sight there is little reason for optimism: both ICI chemicals and Zeneca will arguably lack critical mass as independent companies. The chemicals side has relied on pharmaceuticals to provide cash for investment in new plant and equipment. It will have to stand alone. The rights issue will virtually clear the decks of debt on both sides of the business, but that could equally have been achieved by a unified ICI. The company - or rather companies - respond that the split will give them a clearer management focus. Their argument is that ICI was simply too big and bureaucratic to manage. The demerger will give both sides the chance to sacrifice some sacred cows. That might sound a rather vague justification for an exercise which has cost Pounds 75m in advisers fees and new stationery. Not to mention the thousands of hours of management time which could have been productively spent running the business. But there are happy precedents, notably the demerger of Courtaulds' textile business in 1990. In both cases an established chemicals company spun-off a whole line of business in the interests of 'management focus'. If ICI and Zeneca shares perform as well as Courtaulds since demerger, investors might yet conclude that their money has been well spent. The chemicals side of Courtaulds has decisively outperformed the market since 1990, in spite the cyclical effects on its sector of the deepest industrial recession for 50 years. The demerged Courtaulds Textiles has done even better. There are crucial differences. The Courtaulds split was on a smaller scale: the two sides of the old company now have a market capitalisation of only Pounds 2.5bn, against almost Pounds 9bn for a unified ICI. ICI is also in a more capital-intensive end of the chemical business than Courtaulds. Without the cash generated by pharmaceuticals, it is far from clear that ICI has an independent future in bulk petrochemicals, for example. The counter-argument is that ICI would be well out of this crowded end of the chemicals business, and the demerger might give Ronnie Hampel, its chief executive, an opportunity to make such a break with the past. Besides, ICI shorn of Zeneca is hardly a minnow, being the world's sixth largest chemical company ranked by sales. With a recovery in the world economy just around the corner and management prepared to wage war on costs, the optimists expect ICI chemicals to flourish. If the shares start official trading on Tuesday at around 610p, though, a large part of the anticipated earnings recovery will already be in the price. Zeneca, meanwhile, starts life as an independent company at a time of deep uncertainty for the pharmaceuticals industry. Governments' efforts to get to grips with healthcare costs are resulting in new controls on drugs prices, notably in the US. The rights issue price of 600p - far lower than ICI envisaged when the demerger plan was hatched last year - should take such risks into account. A safe gross yield of 5.7 per cent is certainly comforting. With the drugs industry so out of favour with institutional investors, though, a windfall profit looks unlikely.</p>

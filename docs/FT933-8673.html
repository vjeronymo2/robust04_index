			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Yeltsin urges new 'organ of power' PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, in an attempt to break the impasse with the Russian parliament over elections in the autumn, yesterday suggested an alternative decision-making body should be created, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. He told leaders of Russia's 20 republics a new Federation Council, with two representatives from each of Russia's 89 regions and republics, could 'legitimately solve many questions'. 'Then nobody could reproach it for being another conference - it would be an organ of power,' he said, referring to the Constitutional Conference he set up to process a new constitution after the Russian parliament refused to abandon the existing Soviet-era constitution. Although he did not elaborate, one of the tasks of the new body, which Mr Yeltsin offered to create by presidential decree if the regions and republics agreed to it, could be to clear the way for elections.</p>

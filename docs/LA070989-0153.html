			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Army has temporarily grounded more than 3,400 troop carrier and medical  evacuation Huey helicopters so that a defective part installed in some of the  choppers can be replaced. Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman, said the  part, known as a universal control lever, is a component of the system in  UH-1H, UH-1V and UH-1D series helicopters that enables the pilot to control the  aircraft. The spokesman said the U.S. Army has about 3,000 UH-1H helicopters  and 400 to 500 UH-1V helicopters specially equipped for medical evacuation.  </P></p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (4): Truly global mobile network - Satellite-based services BY the end of the decade it is likely that satellites will have added another dimension to mobile communications and provided the first truly global mobile telecommunications network. Satellite-based systems already provide a number of key telecommunications services, particularly maritime and aeronautical communications services where land-based systems are not an option. The market for these systems is dominated by Inmarsat, the London-based Inmarsat International Maritime Satellite Organisation. According to Mr Justin Jameson, an analyst with Datamonitor, the number of Inmarsat terminals in use is expected to grow from 28,357 last year to 73,258 in 1997, a compound annual growth rate of 20.9 per cent. Mr Jameson believes that the highest growth will take place in the aeronautical market 'where both commercial and private aircraft are increasingly being fitted with Inmarsat terminals allowing the crew and passenger to make calls and send faxes.' Meanwhile the land and maritime markets will continue to grow as a result of the introduction of lower-cost Inmarsat-C and Inmarsat-M terminals including the lightweight briefcase-sized portable systems used by geologists and others who need to send or receive private and secure information from inaccessible or remote places. However, some time before the end of the century Inmarsat will probably face competition from a new generation of low earth orbit satellites (Leos). Unlike geostationary satellites (Geos) which orbit at a height of about 12,000 miles, Leos orbit much lower at 550 to 6,000 miles. Because they are closer to the earth, Leos should suffer less from the characteristic voice delay or echo heard on some satellite voice services. In addition, Leo-based systems will allow the use of lighter and cheaper portable equipment. However, Leos do have some disadvantages. They are solar powered and since they spend more time in shadow they have a much shorter lifespan than Geos - about five years compared with 10-12 - and they are much less powerful so more of them are needed although that may generate economies of scale in satellite production. Currently there are five US groups proposing Leo-based telecommunications systems. The best known, and probably the most ambitious, is the proposed Dollars 3.4bn Iridium system, lead by Motorola. The others are Constellation Communications with Aries, Ellipsat (Ellipso), Loral Qualcomm Satellite Services (Global star), and TRW Space and Electronics (Odyssey). A sixth group, American Mobile Satellite (AMS), a joint venture between McCaw, Hughes and MTEL, already has a geostationary satellite system in operation. However, it only has a few hundred subscribers and just covers North America. The other companies, with more ambitious plans for worldwide service, hope to begin operations in 1996 or 1997. The number of satellites in each system or 'constellation' varies. Motorola's Iridium would have 66, Aries 48, Ellipso 24, Globalstar 48 and Odyssey 12. The cost estimates also vary dramatically from a minimum of Dollars 200m to more than Dollars 3bn. All except Ellipso would use circular orbits but Ellipso's satellites, as its name suggests, would use elliptical orbits which the group claims will provide significant advantages including longer coverage of key markets using fewer satellites. The targeted subscriber base also varies considerably. Motorola predicts about 2m customers for Iridium by the turn of the century including about 700,000 subscribers for data alone. Motorola expects to charge between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 3,000 for handsets and about Dollars 3 a minute for calls. Some systems such as Odessey could handle up to 16m subscribers, but most of the groups are basing their costings on much more conservative estimates. Even so, some analysts such as Mr Dean Eyers of Dataquest, question whether they can make economic sense as a mass market voice telecommunications delivery system. However, most of the Leo systems would also be used to provide other high value services including data communications and radio tracking. Even then their backers face some formidable cost and other problems. One unresolved issue is about how to regulate Leo operators - an issue which is exercising the European Commission. Other issues, such as deciding which frequencies to allocate to Leos, have already been agreed in principle. But perhaps the biggest problem is the apparent potential oversupply of satellite system operators, a problem which is not eased by Inmarsat's own plans for a new Dollars 2bn satellite-based global mobile telecommunications service designated Project 21. Most analysts believe there is probably only room for two new Leo-based services. What does seem certain, however, is that the dream of a universal mobile telecommunications service will move a step closer with the launch of new satellite-based global mobile systems.</p>

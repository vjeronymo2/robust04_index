			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEFENDER  </P> <P> When Abramson's client herds people into a freezer and shoots them to death,  he's the one I can see wearing a swastika -- not the state who sentenced him.  These "adorable," "sweet," "tragic" and "pathetic" guys she's defending are the  inhumane, the unjust, the dehumanizers.  </P> <P> VALERIE A. CAMPBELL  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

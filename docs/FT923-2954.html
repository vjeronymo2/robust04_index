			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Inchcape advances 28% as sales grow INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, yesterday showed resilience in the face of tough economic conditions in many of its markets by reporting a 28 per cent increase in interim profits. Sir David Orr, Inchcape chairman until today when Sir David Plastow takes over, said the group had benefited from its wide geographical spread, sound finances and prudent acquisition policy in difficult times. The acquisition last March of TKM, which controls one of the largest UK retailing networks, meant that in spite of the gloom in the domestic motor industry, profits from the division rose 41 per cent. Group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 117.1m from Pounds 91.3m on sales up 33 per cent at Pounds 2.33bn in the six months to end-June. Earnings per share rose 7.4 per cent to 14.6p and the group is to increase its dividend from 5p to 5.4p. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said that without last December's Pounds 370m rights issue and the TKM acquisition, earnings per share would have grown 5.5 per cent. The group achieved a 20 per cent sales growth before the acquisition. The motor division, which had sales of Pounds 1.54bn, was supported by strong performance in Asia even though it had to bear the start-up costs of operations in Korea and Japan. In the UK, Mr Mackay said the group was not looking for much improvement next year. UK motor sales account for only 26 per cent of Inchcape's global motor sales and only 15 per cent of group sales. Marketing services boosted profits, from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 32.8m, in spite of a cyclical downturn in the brewing business in Japan and some weakness in Thailand. The black spots in the group performance included shipping, which suffered from the break-up of the Scandutch consortium hitting profits in Japan and the US. Profits fell from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.7m. Operating profits from insurance fell from Pounds 16m to Pounds 12m with three quarters of the decline due to a collapse in the reinsurance market. Gearing at the half-year was 40 per cent, up from 30 per cent last year after including borrowings within TKM. However, interest cover increased from 8.5 times to an underlying 10 times.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (3): Volumes need to rise - The Stock Exchange THE TINY Luxembourg stock exchange hopes to evolve into a real centre for the trading of securities, building on its success as a centre for their listing. The exchange, located in unprepossessing premises above a shopping arcade in the Grand Duchy's capital, has already proved that it is a listing centre to be reckoned with: the bourse is 'home' to more than 10,000 securities, most of them international and many denominated in some 20 currencies other than the Luxembourg franc. Eighty-eight per cent of the world's outstanding Eurobonds are listed in Luxembourg, with the exception of Euro-Mark bonds, which tend to be listed in Germany. The bourse also lists up to 95 per cent of all the bonds denominated in Ecus, barring the big British and French sovereign issues which were made partly to press their own countries' case for capturing more Ecu trading. Luxembourg has also capitalised quickly on the trend towards investment funds, listing 1,680 domestic and foreign funds. Having put itself on the map as a listing centre, Luxembourg now wants to boost the modest volume of trading that takes place on its floor. In fact, one important strategy - new computer-assisted trading - will mean that traders no longer have to be physically present on the trading floor itself. The new system, which is being introduced in phases for some types of securities and which has met with some delays since its introduction in April 1991, means that there is no difference between trades done from a trading station on the floor itself and those executed from the premises of a bourse member's offices elsewhere in Luxembourg. The bourse has also reformed the fee structure, in an attempt to attract newcomers to the exchange's current list of 84 members and thereby boost liquidity. Instead of taking a percentage of the commission income generated by members, as before, the stock exchange has started to charge flat fees, which means that members will pay relatively less the more they use the exchange as a trading vehicle. At the same time, the previously mandatory schedule of fees which banks and brokers charged clients has now become a 'recommended' table, enabling market parties to decide among themselves what the fee level should be. Another plan is for the lengthening of trading hours for the most actively traded categories of securities. At present, trading is limited to between 10.45 am and 1.15 pm. A decision on which securities will fall under the expanded hours has not yet been taken, but the most likely candidates are the most active Luxembourg franc and Ecu bonds, as well as the more international companies' shares, such as Arbed, the Luxembourg steel group; Shell; and Philips, the Dutch electronics company. Eventually, Luxembourg hopes to be able to offer continuous trading in key listed securities. At the moment, it operates a 'rotated' market, in which each security is called in succession, with trading taking place only when the bond or share has actually been called. Together, the bourse's various initiatives are designed to lure 'off-exchange' transactions between banks and brokers back on to the Luxembourg exchange. 'We realise that quite of lot of transactions will still continue off the exchange,' says Mr Edmond Israel, the stock exchange's chairman. 'But the bourse is meant to be a marketplace, and that means that we need to increase our trading volume.' Trading volume in 1991 totalled LFr 34.85bn (Pounds 700m), a rise of 32.5 per cent on 1990, mainly reflecting a higher level of trading in fixed-interest securities. Volume in the 1992 first half rose by a more modest 5.5 per cent to LFr19.1bn, compared with LFr18.1bn a year earlier. Despite these increases, Luxembourg's is still one of Europe's smallest bourses when measured by turnover alone. Unlike many other exchanges, its turnover is heavily weighted towards bond trading, reflecting the country's small pool of listed corporations. Of the 1991 turnover figure, just one-seventh was generated by stocks and shares. And of the top 10 traded shares, two are foreign - Philips and Royal Dutch / Shell. All told, the bourse numbers only 70 domestic shares - the biggest of which are Arbed and the country's banks - and 196 foreign shares. Mr Israel says that the bourse hopes to increase the number of stocks and shares, both domestic and foreign. But he adds that every European stock exchange should identify and emphasise its strengths and areas of specialisation, which, in the case of Luxembourg, are bonds and investment funds. 'I don't believe that it is wise, or even possible, to do everything,' he says. 'We have to be realistic,' Mr Israel explains. 'The size of the country is such that the international part of the bourse, particularly the international bonds, naturally far exceeds the Luxembourg part, particularly the domestic stocks and shares sector.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- OFFICIAL PRICE LIST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       1989    1990    1991    1991    1992                                     1st half        1st half  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds                6,972   7,424   7,504   7,488   7,249 National                94     104     107     113     124 International        6,878   7,320   7,397   7,375   7,125 Stocks and shares      252     260     269     264     266 National                62      61      65      70      70 Foreign                190     199     204     194     196 Investment funds     1,010   1,369   1,483   1,589   1,680 National               963   1,339   1,455   1,565   1,657* Foreign                 47      30      28      24      23 Total                8,234   9,053   9,256   9,341   9,195 Warrants &amp; others      906   1,078   1,143   1,163   1,090  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * issued by 552 various legal entities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Luxembourg Stock Exchange  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

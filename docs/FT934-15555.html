			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The FT Interview: Sober after the feast - Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, speaks to Peter Bruce, David Marsh and Tom Burns The march to European union has always been more than a question of mere politics and economics for Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister. In the past, it has been a hobby, a spectacle, a feast - as pleasurable as the cured Spanish hams he still regularly sends his friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Now, however, as the Madrid autumn descends around his red-brick Moncloa Palace residence, Mr Gonzalez shows a touch of wistfulness about the European Community and Spain's place in it. In his first newspaper interview since his fourth consecutive election victory on June 6, Mr Gonzalez puts on a convincing display of realism - a product of constraints on his freedom of manoeuvre, stemming from setbacks both at home and in the rest of Europe. As Mr Gonzalez speaks, in a salon strewn with white sofas, his deputy prime minister, Mr Narcis Serra, is negotiating with executives from Germany's Volkswagen in another part of the Moncloa Palace. They are discussing the possible closure of the Barcelona factory owned by VW's Seat subsidiary, the likely consequence both of heavy losses at Seat and VW's general troubles in Germany. Mr Gonzalez faces a struggle on several fronts. As he attempts to persuade his Socialist party of the benefits of a more rigorous economic policy, he is seeking agreement from recalcitrant trade unions for deregulation of wage bargaining to increase Spain's industrial competitiveness. Asked whether large threatened job cuts in Barcelona could help his efforts to end some of the notorious rigidities in the Spanish economy, Mr Gonzalez confirms the sighting of a modest silver lining. 'It's difficult to be a masochist. But sometimes a crisis can act as a purge. It can make people sit up and take notice.' Certainly, Spaniards are now taking notice that times are tougher. Infected by the European recession, Spain this year will register its first year of economic contraction since 1981. Its hopes that the peseta could become part of the 'hard core' of European currencies closely linked to the D-Mark were shattered by three devaluations between September 1992 and May 1993. After the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in August, Mr Gonzalez admits there is a 'tremendous question mark' over whether the EC can achieve its aim of economic and monetary union by 1997 or 1999. Referring to the targets set down in the Maastricht treaty for bringing EC budget deficits and government debt under greater control, Mr Gonz-alez admits: 'We have div-erged from the convergence criteria.' Spain's public sector budget deficit will be over 6 per cent of gross domestic product this year, double the 3 per cent target set by the Maastricht treaty. Even though the government has tacitly abandoned its original plan to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996, he says the EC has no alternative but to press on with the Maastricht convergence plans. His hopes for improved European economic co-operation are somewhat slender. He is pinning them on the new European Monetary Institute to be set up next year, probably in Germany, as the forerunner to the planned EC central bank. On the home front, his Socialists in June lost their previous absolute majority in the Cortes (parliament). This requires Mr Gonzalez to make deals with two small regional parties, the Basque PNV and the bigger Catalan CiU, to push through parliament an austere budget presented at the end of last month. The budget proposes a civil service wage freeze next year as well as less generous pay-outs of social benefits and pensions. He says he would have preferred a formal coalition with the Basque and Catalan parties, but will make the best of ruling with a minority government. 'This is something completely new in our country,' says Mr Gonzalez. 'People are not accustomed to the central government doing deals with parliamentary minorities. It makes for an extraordinary commotion. 'My idea, and it seemed to me the best way to guarantee stability, was a coalition (but) with this excluded we have to make pacts to govern . . . If we have to go on negotiating, then we'll just do it.' The need to improve competitiveness seems to have infused the ever-didactic Mr Gonzalez with additional zeal for lecturing his Socialist party on the facts of economic life. He has started making a number of keynote speeches to take forward his campaign. The first - to a congress of young socialists - came last night. He is also scheduled to address a large meeting of supporters in his Andalucian homeland. These will be the opening shots of a campaign to reshape the Socialist party's policies. Noisy arguments among leftwing and liberal factions, strongly influenced by Byzantine power struggles in the provinces, will reach a head when the party holds a congress next March, its first in more than three years. 'I am provoking a debate because what I want to do is to have the problems defined. I myself will defining my own position and making it clear.' Mr Gonzalez says parties of 'democratic socialism', now in a small minority among EC governments, have to face up to their new tasks unflinchingly, but without undue defensiveness. 'We defended liberty against the communists and we stressed social welfare against the conservatives,' he says. Now, however, after the collapse of communism in Europe and the end of the EC's late-1980s economic buoyancy, the position has changed. 'We can't keep saying: 'We want what we had in the 1960s'. This is a whole new debate,' Mr Gonzalez says. A central focus is the role of the state as a provider of welfare. 'What we have to do is to relate the capacity of the welfare state to increases in the country's productivity.' Sounding almost like Mr Peter Lilley, the UK social security secretary, Mr Gonzalez says: 'We have to define (as priorities) certain types of welfare benefits and I am worried above all about certain elements of fraud and abuse in the welfare state.' Spain's 21 per cent unemployment rate, the highest in the EC, is directly linked to the inflexibility of the Spanish labour market, he says. Wage inflation, at more than 7 per cent, has remained around 2 percentage points above the inflation rate in spite of the recession. The prime minister is adamant that the trade unions must undergo a 'cultural change. They have to stop seeing everything in terms of wages and profits and think instead about how a company can compete in an open market'. Setting out an agenda for plant-by-plant wage bargaining, and less onerous hire-and-fire regulations, he says: 'We have to remove and eliminate all the obstacles to the creation of employment.' Commenting on labour reform talks that started last week with unions and employers on a three-year 'social pact', Mr Gonzalez says he will force through the measures whether he gets agreement or not. 'I hope there will be agreement,' he says. But he points to the unions' difficulty in reaching a compromise. 'The big problem is that the government has nothing to give (the unions) in exchange.' Frequently during the past few years, Mr Gonzalez has espoused tough-talking free market rhetoric without producing results. Now, in his latest and most serious campaign to tackle Spain's problems, Mr Gonzalez is throwing into the breach his authority as Europe's best-respected Socialist prime minister. The environment, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe, has become a lot harsher; if he fails this time, that authority will start to crumble.

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Radicalism on the wane Is the tide of radical policymaking in the English-speaking world on the turn? The departure of New Zealand's finance minister Ruth Richardson at the weekend in a post-election cabinet reshuffle could well be an early warning signal of a wider trend. Ms Richardson was a key member of the so-called razor gang, a group of ministers committed to reducing the welfare state. After an election earlier this month in which the parliamentary majority of the National party was cut from 34 to one, some weakening of radical resolve was on the cards. New Zealand has admittedly been the most extreme of the developed countries that participated in the renaissance of liberal economic policy since the early 1980s. As well as a package of wholesale privatisation, labour market liberalisation and financial market deregulation, the country pushed through the most comprehensive tax reform of recent years. The head of the central bank's tenure depends on inflation performance: civil servants too are on fixed-term performance contracts. Under both Labour and National party governments, New Zealand has been the most exciting political and economic laboratory of the OECD area. In less than 10 years the most regulated, distorted and protected economy in the 24-nation club has become the least regulated, least distorted and least protected. Yet there have been losers, notably among recipients of social security, where unemployment benefit and pensions have been cut, and universal family support abolished. The snag is that radicalism has taken time to work: growth has been sluggish and unemployment has risen. Slow-burn Ms Richardson's departure no doubt reflects the slow-burn nature of the radical cure. Comparable backlashes are weakening governments elsewhere. Yet the need for continuing radical action remains overwhelming. One reason is the growth of structural budget deficits and the narrowing of national tax bases, as increased capital mobility forces governments into open fiscal competition. Public spending cuts and higher taxes will thus remain on the agenda for a long time. Electorates' demand for more transparent tax systems will become more clamorous. If present high levels of unemployment in the OECD are to fall, the assault on labour market rigidities must go on. Inefficiencies in public services need to be addressed and the process of trade liberalisation must not be allowed to stall. Perpetual revolution Yet the strains inherent in this perpetual revolution in micro-economic management, with huge shifts in the geographical location of jobs and industries across national boundaries, make the need for social security all the more pressing. People are being subjected to greater upheavals, and to greater uncertainty about jobs and retirement prospects, than at any time since 1945. The hostility in the US to the North American Free Trade Agreement was symptomatic of this sense of insecurity. Election results in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, as well as New Zealand, have confirmed that the public will not vote for those who promise higher taxes and reduced public spending. Yet the appetite for services such as health, education and pensions remains insatiable. Radicalism offers an obvious resolution of this dilemma. But when the constituency for radicalism is weakened in recession and public sector debt is increasing, damage limitation is the order of the day. The question is whether this second-best alternative results in a loss of political impetus that causes the radical bandwagon not merely to slow down, but to go into reverse. The Gatt deadline on December 15 provides an early test. In the longer run the question is whether the combination of weak governments and structural budget deficits will produce a retreat from the policies that brought inflation down. What the New Zealand cabinet reshuffle underlines is that ministerial razor gangs across the OECD area are working with blunter weapons. A first-world fiscal crisis before the end of the decade cannot be ruled out.</p>

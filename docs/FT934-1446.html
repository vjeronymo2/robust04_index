			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / The Long View: Profits of gloom In the London stock market, 1993 is positively roaring towards its close. Since the Budget on November 30, the All-Share index has added 6 per cent and the total return for the full year (capital gain plus gross dividend income) is now 25 per cent. But the star turn in the UK securities markets has been provided by gilts. The yields on long-dated UK government securities have tumbled from 8.75 to 6.5 per cent and, in the extreme case of the irredeemables (such as War Loan) the total return has been 41 per cent. Looking back at what I was saying in this column at the beginning of 1993, it is clear that I was too cautious. Surveying the equity market, I judged that large capitalisation stocks such as those in the FTSE-100 index would find it hard to make progress in 1993, although there would be money to be made in recovery stocks and second-liners. Certainly, the smaller stocks did their stuff - the new SmallCap index has achieved a return of 36 per cent - but even the market leaders managed a decent turn of speed in the second half-year. Nevertheless, I got some things right. I was correct to believe that the prevailing economic consensus - which, a year ago, suggested no more than 1 per cent growth for the UK in 1993 - was overdoing the pessimism. Growth will certainly turn out to be 2 per cent, and perhaps 2.5 per cent or more when the final numbers are added up. I also resisted the common tendency to be too pessimistic about gilts: at least two of the big securities houses (tactfully, I won't name them) were forecasting that gilt yields would have to go to 10 per cent before the government would be able to finance its Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. The gilts problem could be solved, I said in January, so long as short-term interest rates were cut; the government were to embrace so-called underfunding (finance through banks); and, most importantly, if the government were to raise taxes so as be able to to promise a lower borrowing requirement in 1994-95. Eventually, the government got all of this right, although the faltering approach of Norman Lamont, then the chancellor of the exchequer, in the spring meant that the main positive response came only in the second half of the year. Indeed, by the middle of it, the market leaders in the Footsie index were showing scarcely any progress. By then, however, I was changing my forecasts, recognising the possibility of a liquidity-driven surge in the market. The second half of the year, I said at the beginning of July, would prove more exciting, at least until US interest rates were raised late in the year. Of course, the tightening by the Federal Reserve has not yet happened so the background has remained serene. Two factors, global and local, have given new impetus to London's markets in the past few months. First, money flooding out of the US at the rate of Dollars 100bn a year from international mutual funds and diversifying pension funds has sent nearly all the bond and stock markets around the globe much higher (the exception being the Tokyo equity market). This surplus of international liquidity has rendered positively laughable all those concerns early in the year that the British goverment, through its excessive demands for finance, might place the domestic capital market under undue pressure. Domestic and foreign investors have not only lapped up all the gilts - they have eagerly swallowed Pounds 12bn of UK equity issues as well. Secondly, the positive domestic factor has been the adoption of a tough fiscal policy by the government. It was in April that I first began to dwell on the possibility of a gilt-edged bonanza as yields tumbled from the then ruling 8.4 per cent to perhaps 6 per cent. Unfortunately I could not really believe it. When Kenneth Clarke became chancellor at the end of May, however, I argued that he had a great opportunity to get a grip on the budget and turn the tables on the markets: investors, instead of sitting back comfortably in the knowledge that they could deal on a take-it-or-leave-it basis with the endless supplies of high coupon paper heading their way, might be panicked into chasing a declining supply of gilts on rapidly falling yields. It seemed a fantasy at the time, but it is now happening. Against this background of tumbling bond yields, the equity market has been pulled higher, although the fundamental valuations are stretched. Company profits are showing reasonable growth this year, and earnings per share could be 15-20 per cent higher for 1993, although the picture is very patchy as various recent individual company profits warnings have shown; dividend growth has been predictably poor and was damaged further by the unexpected tax hit on pension fund dividend income in the spring, as a consequence of which dividends on the All-Share index have actually fallen by 2 1/2 per cent this year. In international terms, the UK equity market, despite its recent acceleration, has not performed very well this year. The global pattern has confirmed once again the old rule that you should buy shares in recessions, not in conditions of decent economic growth. It looks as though 1993 will have turned out to be the most depressed year for the industrialised global economy (excluding the US) ever recorded by the OECD, which is estimating zero growth. But the FT-Actuaries World ex-US index is showing a gain of 28 per cent (in dollars); even the wobbly Tokyo market has provided good returns for unhedged foreigners, thanks to the super-strong yen. On the other hand, Wall Street has lagged. The US economy, with nearly 3 per cent growth, might have glittered in a dismal global environment but American equities are up only about 6 per cent on the year (the narrowly-based Dow Jones Average glamourises the general trend). Buy the recovery story, sell the fact.</p>

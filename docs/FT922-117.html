			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond test encouraging A CANADIAN-AUSTRALIAN joint venture has confirmed the scope of last November's diamond find 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories' capital. The kimberlite find by Dia Met/BHP Minerals started the biggest Canadian staking rush since the Hemlo gold discoveries in northern Ontario in the 1970s. Dia Met said further US tests of a bulk sample of Point Lake kimberlite showed the weight of the tiny diamonds recovered was 101 carats, compared with 90 carats reported on May 20, and that about a quarter were gem quality. Dia Met emphasised that the 160-tonne rock sample was small and much more exploration was needed. BHP, the Australian mining group, is the operator of the Point Lake exploration programme.</p>

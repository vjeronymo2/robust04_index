			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ONLY COWBOYS KEEP JETS FROM BEING NFL'S BIGGEST JOKE IN '89  </P> <P> The New York Jets (2-7) entered this season bubbling with optimism, but a  hopeless offense and inconsistent defense has left Coach Joe Walton's team in  disarray. To wit:  </P> <P> </P> <P> QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Ken O'Brien deserves high marks for valor. He's getting pounded more than any  QB in the league (33 sacks), but somehow he keeps plugging. His performance  hasn't been O'Brien-like. He has thrown 10 interceptions, three more than last  season's total. He's averaging one interception per 27.5 attempts, compared  with last season's 60.6. Incredibly, he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in five  games, the longest drought of his career. And the offense hasn't scored a TD in  13 quarters. O'Brien's 72.7 rating is a career low. A weak and injury-ridden  supporting cast -- including his best receivers -- has contributed to his  troubles, but O'Brien has hurt himself at times, throwing into double-coverage  and overthrowing. The major knock is his lack of mobility, but that's nothing  new. If he doesn't get better protection, O'Brien won't last to the end of the  season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RUNNING BACKS  </P> <P> The plight of Freeman McNeil symbolizes the entire season. McNeil had his best  game in Miami, as did the Jets, but he has been in a funk ever since, as have  the Jets. In the first five games after that win, McNeil rushed for only 143  yards. Curiously, McNeil's decline coincided with the Colts game Oct. 1, when  he admittedly lost his composure after putting linebacker O'Brien Alston out  for the season with a severe knee injury. McNeil (284 yards) is being phased  out in favor of Johnny Hector (206), who is starting to hit stride after  missing the first game because of a contract dispute. Fullback Roger Vick has  been a major disappointment. Vick, who showed promise last season, has gained  only 27 yards in his past 21 carries. Take away his 39-yard TD run against the  Browns and he's averaging 2.4 a carry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> By far the most disappointing aspect of the season. The same line that played  so well late in 1988 requires a total overhaul. The Jets have allowed a  league-high 35 sacks, including 19 in the past three games. Fourteen sacks have  occurred on first down, which makes the situation even more alarming. Not only  is the line committing mental errors, but it's getting physically whipped.  Center Jim Sweeney, who appeared to be on the verge of Pro Bowl status, has  been ordinary. Tackles Reggie McElroy and Jeff Criswell have the size coveted  by the Jets, but they're struggling against speed rushers. Right guard Dan  Alexander, 34, and left guard Mike Haight aren't playing well, but they've  suffered from minor injuries. The shame is that right guard Dave Cadigan, last  season's No. 1 pick, isn't good enough to crack the lineup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECEIVERS  </P> <P> Injuries, injuries, injuries. Al Toon and Wesley Walker haven't played  together. They've missed a combined 10 games. Tight end Mickey Shuler, the  leader with 29 receptions, might be finished for the season because of a  sprained knee. Backups Billy Griggs and Michael Harper also have suffered  serious injuries. JoJo Townsell (25 catches) is a decent backup, but he doesn't  have the speed to stretch a defense. Acquiring Chris Burkett was a good move,  but he's struggling to learn the offense. Talented second-year tight end Keith  Neubert has been a disappointment, with three drops and one fumble. It's tough  to grade a group that hasn't played, so the receivers escape with an  incomplete, which seems only fitting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> Same old story: no pass rush. You hate to say it, but Mark Gastineau probably  could help. The line has produced only seven sacks. The team has 11, two fewer  than Keith Millard of the Vikings. Defensive end Paul Frase (2) is the leader,  and he's not regarded as a pass rusher. The run defense, traditionally a  strength, also has declined. The past three opponents have rushed for an  average of 172 yards. Defensive end Marty Lyons, 32, is showing his age. Nose  tackle Scott Mersereau has the tools, but he's too inconsistent. Nickel pass  rushers Gerald Nichols and rookie Dennis Byrd have combined for 2 1/2 sacks.  Rookie defensive end Ron Stallworth, who shined in the preseason, lost his  starting job after three games. Expect Stallworth, Byrd and fellow rookie  Marvin Washington to receive more playing time. Why not? There's nothing to  lose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LINEBACKERS  </P> <P> Problems here, too. This group used to be tough against the run, but not  anymore. In pass coverage, the linebackers are extremely limited because of  mediocre speed. Kyle Clifton leads in tackles, but he's not fast enough to  cover backs coming out of the backfield. Troy Benson has been steady since  reclaiming his job from Kevin McArthur. Where's Alex Gordon? Lots of talent,  little production. He has 19 solo tackles, a curiously low number for a  strongside linebacker. No. 1 pick Jeff Lageman got off to a slow start after  missing most of camp in a contract holdout, but he's starting to come on. He's  vulnerable to the chop block and his pass rushing needs lots of work, but he  looks like he'll become a solid player. The Jets were high on third-round pick  Joe Mott, but he has been used exclusively on special teams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SECONDARY  </P> <P> Where would the Jets be without free safety Erik McMillan? He has four  interceptions and three TDs, two more TDs than the offense has produced in the  past five games. He still gets caught out of position, but McMillan deserves to  go to the Pro Bowl again. Overall, the secondary hasn't shown much improvement  since 1988. Nineteen TD passes allowed is terrible, but that's partly because  of no pass rush. A course in remedial tackling would help. Corner back James  Hasty, slowed by a training-camp injury, is starting to play better after a  poor start. He has three interceptions. Corner back Bobby Humphery, victimized  on at least seven TD passes, has struggled at times. Strong safety George  Radachowsky, replacing injured Rich Miano, is gutsy but limited. Nickel back  Kerry Glenn has been useful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPECIAL TEAMS  </P> <P> How the mighty have fallen. This used to be a formidable group, but injuries  and personnel changes have disrupted the continuity. The return and coverage  teams have been below average. Townsell, who led the AFC last season with a  11.7 punt-return average, is averaging 8.3 yards. The Colts' Clarence Verdin  returned a punt 49 yards for a TD, the first time in four seasons the Jets have  allowed a TD runback. Punter Joe Prokop ranks last in the AFC with a 36.6  average, but he leads the NFL with 17 punts inside the 20. He's as  unpredictable as the wind at Giants Stadium. Pat Leahy (6-for-9 field goals)  hasn't had much action because of the mistake-a-minute offense. Linebacker Ken  Rose leads in tackles by special-teams players. The Jets miss Marion Barber,  who's on injured reserve with a knee injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COACHING  </P> <P> No head coach in the league takes more abuse than Joe Walton, but he doesn't  deserve all of the blame. He's working for an organization that lacks proper  structure. Remarkably, Walton has remained upbeat, which has helped prevent  dissension among the players. On the negative side, Walton doesn't seem to have  the motivational ability to lift a struggling team. The Jets have been  outscored in the first half 101-43, which suggests they're not prepared.  Walton's decision to bench O'Brien in New Orleans was a mistake. The  play-calling has been predictable. Why did he opt for a field goal on a  fourth-and-2 from the 49ers' 7-yard line Sunday? The Jets needed a TD; the  offense needed a confidence booster. Walton needs wins. If the Jets don't  finish strongly, long-suffering fans may get their wish. It's all up to Boss  Leon Hess.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERALL  </P> <P> The Jets have played two good halves of football: the unsuccessful second-half  comeback against the Patriots and the stirring second-half comeback against the  Dolphins. The other halves were lousy until a victory over New England on  Sunday. Other than McMillan's spectacular play, there's absolutely nothing  redeeming about the season.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Ecology worry is dismissed High environmental standards do not damage a country's international competitiveness, according to a new working paper from a senior World Bank economist. Demands from countries with high environmental standards for trade protection against countries with lower standards are misguided, it argues. Industries which are subject to tight environmental rules - particularly the chemical, energy and paper sectors in Europe and North America - have been concerned that they will be undercut by competitors in other countries. But developing countries have frequently seen these fears as disguised protectionism. This month's meeting in Marrakesh to sign the accords in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade set up a committee to examine these potential conflicts. The World Bank's policy research paper, by Ms Piritta Sorsa, compares performance of sectors which are subject to tight environmental regulation in seven countries: Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Japan and the US. The countries were chosen because they aim for high environmental standards, she says. The study, which does not represent the views of the bank, concludes that the industrial sectors which spend most on pollution control generally maintained their international competitiveness between 1970 and 1990. World market shares in these sectors have not changed dramatically over the past two decades, despite introduction of higher environmental standards in most industrial countries, it adds. Of the seven countries, Austria and Finland have increased their world market shares in these highly regulated sectors. The report attributes this partly to environmental policies which have encouraged investment and innovation. While Germany, Sweden and the US maintained the competitiveness of these industries, Japan 'has opted out of trade in many environmentally sensitive goods' and its market share has halved, the report concludes. It attributes the loss of share partly to high energy costs in Japan, particularly in the 1970s, rather than to environmental costs.

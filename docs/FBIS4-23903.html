			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] The ANC's determination to find out which of their  own members spied on the movement has led to a big search in the  shadowy world of South African spies. This could have  disastrous consequences for the country and could prove to be a  big embarrassment for the ANC because heads could roll in top  government structures. Such an embarrassment could also prove  to be a serious setback for the South African National Defense  Force's [SANDF] three-year plan to integrate the various armed  forces. The first visible signs of nervousness in the  intelligence community were evident a week ago when Minister of  Defense Joe Modise obtained a Supreme Court interdict to silence  the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN and two former spies of the  Directorate of Covert Collection's (DCC) disbanded front  organization PAIIC [Pan Afrik Industrial Investment  Consultants]. Earlier this week, Mr. Modise withdrew his  application.  <H5>  Talks </H5>   Last week, Mr. Modise held talks with the PAIIC group.  High-level secret talks are also taking place between ANC  intelligence officials and members and former members of SANDF  and police concerning the sensitivity of information on the  identity of spies in the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation]. The planned Commission of Truth  and Reconciliation hangs like a sword over the heads of  thousands of policemen and soldiers. Deputy President F.W. de  Klerk has already publicly warned "that old wounds should not be  scratched open." The anxious policemen are now waiting to see  what effect Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe's  comprehensive document on the issue to Safety and Security  Minister Sydney Mufamadi will have. "We know that we kept the  apartheid government in power," says a senior officer to RAPPORT  this week, "but the ANC has also committed acts of terrorism and  we know what they did. They also know what we did."  <H5>  `Unacceptable' </H5>   He added that someone like Judge Richard Goldstone would be  totally unacceptable to the police as chairman of such a  commission of truth. Meanwhile, the continuing rumors  surrounding the identities of spies and former spies of the  defense force have taken a serious turn with indications that  former members fear that the lives of their families are in  danger because several former informants are becoming very  anxious, fearing reprisals. Mr. Clive Brink, spokesman for the  PAIIC group who believe that they were unfairly dismissed, told  RAPPORT this week: "We made it clear from the very beginning  that we will protect the identities of these people and we even  went as far as protecting it with our lives." This was soon  after the acting chief of staff intelligence of the SANDF, Major  General Dirk Verbeek, said at a news conference that the SANDF  would have to consider taking former spies to court if they  continue with their threats. He alleged that this group,  serving members of the SANDF and the DCC, are making threatening  telephone calls day and night.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDATORY SAVING WATER RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> California farmers are among the most efficient users of water in the country,  despite accusations by The Times and others. Two recent independent studies  each showed that overall Central Valley agriculture is 99% efficient in its use  of water. An acre of homes consumes about the same amount of water as the  average acre of farmland. And farmers are not the end users of this water. It  takes over 1.5 million gallons of water to grow the food for one person for one  year.  </P> <P> Comparing agricultural and urban water costs is misleading. Agriculture water  costs less for several reasons. One important reason is that farm water is not  chemically treated as is urban water. For every tax dollar that goes into  providing agriculture with water, the government gets back two. That's an  investment, not a subsidy.  </P> <P> You misrepresented the facts about the water reclamation law. There are nearly  20,000 family farming companies that legally participate in the water  reclamation project, while The Times points to only a handful of abuses. A  study by the General Accounting Office reports that Western farmers are  complying with the law.  </P> <P> Central Valley farmers have paid for their federal water several times over.  Tax revenues generated by the water projects have amounted to $45 billion over  the last five decades, while the investment has been only $9.5 billion over the  last eight decades. According to the U.S. Bureau of Census, the average  California farm size is 369 acres. Roughly half of these California farms have  sales of $10,000 or less. Of those with sales of more than $10,000, over 80%  consist of fewer than 500 acres.  </P> <P> Misinformation, such as spread by The Times, if repeated often and left  unchallenged, becomes institutionalized as "fact." It is time we set the record  straight.  </P> <P> DAVID L. MOORE, President  </P> <P> Western Growers Assn., Irvine  </P></p>

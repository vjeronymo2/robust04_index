			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Asprey loses some of its sparkle Despite the unseasonably warm weather, a chill wind has been blowing through the elegant showrooms of Asprey, the exclusive jewellery retailer whose various businesses are scattered along the streets of London's West End. Indeed, Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive of the group he refers to as 'the most luxurious gift shop in the world', suggested last week that the super-rich had not only been absent from the group's London stores, but that 'it's the same in the United States, Switzerland and even on Avenue Montaigne in Paris'. However, as Asprey revealed a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 12.2m) for the six months to September 30, he suggested that there had been a small improvement in the weeks since the profits warning of September 9. He will be hoping that this improvement continues or watchers of the group will question the wisdom of his expansionist moves of the past few years. To a group containing the core Asprey business with three outlets, he added Garrard and Mappin &amp; Webb in 1990, Watches of Switzerland in 1992 and Les Ambassadeurs, a watch and jewellery retail chain, in 1993. The 1993 launch of Zeus, 'an experiment' aimed at younger shoppers, took the group yet further from its known territory. Garrard is the kind of shop where most items have no price ticket, presumably on the assumption that if you need to ask, you can't afford it. Its most expensive item retails at Pounds 2.8m, while M&amp;W's costliest bauble is a snip at Pounds 95,000. Asprey's stock ranges from a Burma ruby and diamond suite at more than Pounds 4m to a heron dish at Pounds 23.50 which, strangely, is the same price as a Swatch watch, the cheapest item at Watches of Switzerland. The acquisition drive has broadened the customer base away from the rarefied world of Arab princes, heads of states and governments on which the group used to depend. This was Mr Attallah's intention. He maintains that otherwise the group would be at the financial mercy of the whims of 'certain overseas customers'. In this, he has the broad agreement of Mr Arnaud Bumberger, managing director of Cartier in the UK, who says: 'We are not having these problems at the moment, but we might tomorrow.' In Asprey's interim results, the sharpest turnover fall - to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 39.3m) - was at the core Asprey business. Garrard's turnover was flat at Pounds 11.7m and Mappin &amp; Webb's slipped by Pounds 1m to Pounds 16.2m. Profits at Watches of Switzerland were lower as a result of the growth of overheads as the company expanded from 26 to 33 outlets, but its turnover grew to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.7m). Asprey's expanded customer base contains many who were relatively rich in the 1980s but have since tightened their belts. And Mr Attallah fumed at the government's lack of understanding of psychology, railing at the bad timing of the upcoming Budget: 'We have had a quiet November, because people are deterred from Christmas buying when they don't know what their position will be after next week.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SGS-Thomson "number two" Piero Martinotti by </F> Jean-Pierre Della Mussia; place, date not given: "Martinotti:  `SGS-Thomson Will Now Remain Profitable'" -- first paragraph is  ELECTRONIQUE INTERNATIONAL HEBDO introduction]    [Text] SGS-Thomson did not win shares in the semiconductor  market in 1993 because it is not present in the DRAM [dynamic  random access memory] or 486 [processor] segments, which  experienced the strongest growth. However, it outperformed the  rest of the market in most of the sectors in which it is active.  Piero Martinotti, SGS-Thomson's "number two," considers that  his company will continue to make progress.    [Della Mussia] In 1992, you covered 2.7 percent of the world  market. You also covered 2.7 percent in 1993. Are you still  aiming to cover 5 percent of the world market? How do you hope  to achieve that?    [Martinotti] Indeed, 5 percent is a limit above which a  general semiconductor company can obtain structural stability.  In my opinion, this percentage can even fall to 4 percent,  since our Japanese competitors now have to generate some cash  flow, which was not previously the case; they therefore have  fewer financial options. We are concerned with maintaining our  momentum: The semiconductors market is set to double every  seven years; our challenge is to try and double our revenues  every five years while accepting that there will be no capital  increases, that is to say relying solely on our current  strengths and existing product catalogue. However, our  shareholders could decide on faster growth by increasing the  company capital.    I reckon that one-third of our 1993 profits were due to a  favorable economic climate and two-thirds can be put down to  internal action. Now, even if the market goes into decline, we  will remain profitable in all our product lines and continue to  win shares in the market. Moreover, our debt/equity ratio of  just 0.285 gives a certain financial flexibility. Once again,  however, it is up to our shareholders to decide whether we  should grow faster, with possible takeovers of other companies.  For example, this would be the case if we decided to  manufacture 486 circuits.    The favorable economic situation means that we envisage  making shareholders' equity investments in the region of $550  million this year. If there were a crisis, we would scale down  our ambitions to maintain the cash-flow.    [Della Mussia] You still rank in the same position among the  world's semiconductor companies. Why?    [Martinotti] NS and Philips are ahead of us, but the gap is  closing. Be patient.    [Della Mussia] SGS-Thomson still has an enormous number of  factories in the world. Is that not a handicap?    [Martinotti] If we were starting again from scratch, we  would  doubtless shed four factories. However, we have to live in a  real world. That is why we are reinvesting in Rennes, simply  because, at the current time, Rennes is very profitable and will  most likely remain profitable for another four or five years.  At the moment we are reinvesting, too, in Rousset for five-inch  chip manufacture in the area made available by the closure of  the four-inch production line, in particular with an EEPROM  [electrically erasable programmable read-only memory] technology  for microcontrollers that we will transfer from Agrate.    [Della Mussia] Will the Mitsubishi-Hitachi agreement on  flash  memory influence your strategy in this area?    [Martinotti] Our strategy with regard to Mitsubishi remains  unchanged, even if our developments were delayed by a few months  and the Hitachi agreement has complicated our relations  slightly. We have decided on the NOR technique, but we do have  access to the DINOR and AND techniques. We will make our choice  in due course. In any case, we have already defined with  Mitsubishi the products that we want to manufacture together and  we are currently making our technologies compatible. [Martinotti  ends]  <H5>  SGS Bets on the Future -- Investment in 1999 </H5>   $480 million    85 percent up over 1992    23 percent of sales    8 percent more than the industry average    World number nine (in dollars)  <H5>  Research and Development in 1999 </H5>   $300 million    20 percent up over 1992    15 percent of sales    2 percent more than the industry average    World number 10 (in dollars)    327 patents registered</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belsky] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--The Moscow branch of the  Democratic Russia Movement welcomed plans to create a liberal  conservative party, likely to be called "Russia's Choice", and  announced readiness to help organize it.    A resolution to this effect was passed at the report-back  election conference of Democratic Russia's Moscow branch. The  initiative to set up a new party was moved by the Russia's  Choice parliamentary faction led by key reformer Yegor Gaydar.    According to most speakers at the conference, the new party  is to promote "consolidation of democratic forces". Ilya  Zaslavskiy, a Democratic Russia leader, said "the powerful,  disciplined political association of reformers" would  counterbalance opposition forces presently gathering strength.  The planned organization based on dual membership "is by no  means counterpoised to the Democratic Russia Movement",  Zaslavskiy emphasised.    However, some of the Democratic Russia leaders do not share  this view, for example Lev Ponomaryov, Dmitriy Katayev and Gleb  Yakunin. According to Yakunin, "creation of the party will bury  the Moscow branch of Democratic Russia" by turning it into a  mere appendage to the political organization headed by Gaydar.</p>

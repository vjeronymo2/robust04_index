			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: CGS seeks partners for Sogeti CAP GEMINI Sogeti, the leading European computing services group, is seeking partners to join Germany's Daimler-Benz as shareholders in Sogeti, the group's holding company, according to Mr Serge Kampf, the CGS chairman. His comment follows the announcement by CGS that talks with Olivetti, the loss-making Italian computer manufacturer, which had been going on since the early part of the year, had been abandoned. A statement said the discussions had become too complicated for the current state of the computer market, currently in its worst recession. The subject of the talks had never been made public but there had been intense interest in the prospect of a deal between Olivetti, which is expanding its interests in computing services, and CGS which has remained independent of computer hardware manufacturers. Olivetti has a broad range of alliances and associations with other companies but no single large partnership comparable with the deal concluded some months ago between Groupe Bull of France and International Business Machines of the US. Mr Kampf refused to make predictions for the current financial year but said revenues in the first quarter amounted to FFr2.44bn (Dollars 448m) compared with FFr2.49bn in 1991. A new streamlined and decentralised structure for the company would be announced next month, he said.</p>

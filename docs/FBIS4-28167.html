			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] North Korea's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, who  is on a visit to the Ukraine, expressed his intention on 6 June  to positively examine Russia's proposal for holding eight-way  talks which came up last March, thereby attracting our attention  as we wonder if there has been any change in North Korea's  attitude.    That day, Foreign Minister Kim said: "We are interested in,  and are examining, Russia's proposal." Thus, he indirectly put  forth a proposal for discussing North Korea's nuclear issue in  the "eight-way talks." The proposal for eight-way talks was put  forth by Russia on 24 March. The idea is to find a solution to  North Korea's nuclear issue through eight-way talks involving  South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Russia,  the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Because the background for his remarks is unknown, it is not  certain whether Foreign Minister Kim meant a revision of North  Korea's "principle of solving the nuclear issue through the  North-U.S. talks" or whether his remarks were ceremonial ones.  But, at the present moment, the prevailing view is that those  remarks hint of an obvious change in attitude in light of the  fact that North Korea's nuclear issue is now in its final stages  of discussion at the UN Security Council. [passage omitted]    First of all, we can interpret this as showing a change in  its attitude because, realistically, the nuclear issue has  already lost its value as a bargaining chip in its negotiations  with the United States because the issue is now at a cul-de-sac  stage when the UN Security Council is discussing the imposition  of sanctions. As for North Korea, the only way to break through  the present difficulty without suffering from sanctions is to  accept the U.S. demand for ad hoc inspections and for a full  confession. In this case, because this will be regarded as  surrender to the United States, it will be difficult for North  Korea to cope with the consequences. Rather, as far as North  Korea is concerned, the eight-way talks may serve as an  alternative because the talks can lessen North Korea's burden.    Of course, many people say that it is unreasonable to regard  his remarks as showing a change in North Korea's attitude on the  grounds that official media of North Korea are still advocating  the solution of its nuclear issue through North-U.S.  negotiations.    Those who have this kind of view see his remarks to be of a  long-shot, public attention-arousing nature, or--in view of  North Korea's diplomatic attitude which we have seen thus  far--as merely a strategy to earn time to lessen the  ever-seething international mood for the imposition of sanctions.    If North Korea has really changed its attitude, it is now  clear that a new turning-point will be provided in the solution  to North Korea's nuclear issue through dialogue--which is now at  a deadlock--although the possibility of immediate realization of  the eight-way talks is small because the UN Security Council has  already begun discussing the issue.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Accounts body calls for reform THE ACCOUNTING standard dealing with deferred taxation should be amended to improve the level of disclosure, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said yesterday. The analysis of SSAP 15, an accounting statement introduced in 1978, was edited by Professor Pauline Weetman of the University of Stirling on behalf of the research committee of the Scottish institute. Deferred tax is that amount assessed for tax purposes in one period but recognised in a company's financial statements in another. In the long term the study calls for a 'flow-through' approach to accounting for tax, in which actual tax charges would be adjusted only for short-term timing differences such as those caused by interest payable or receivable being different to that paid or received. In the short term, it suggests: A new disclosure note reconciling the effective tax charge to that which would have applied at the full rate of corporation tax. Greater emphasis in the standard on the need for better quality disclosure in the notes to the accounts. Treating advance corporation tax as a separate asset item which should not be set against the deferred tax liability.</p>

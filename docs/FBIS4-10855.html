			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Chimanovitch] </F>   [Text] The town of Chaparro, on the Venezuelan side of the  border, is within rifle range of Brazilian territory. From  there it is possible to see the increased military activity in  the Amazon region. Venezuelans are reinforcing their positions  and building a defense line similar to our Calha Norte. There  are also rumors that the Caracas Government might be buying  missile batteries from Eastern European ex-Communist countries.  There is no territorial dispute between Venezuela and Brazil,  and this military buildup does not mean that Venezuela is  preparing to invade the Brazilian Amazon region. It is just a  reaction to the increased Brazilian military presence, which  began early in 1993. Military observers have confirmed what  high-precision satellites have for a long time detected: The  Amazon region has become a training camp for the Brazilian Armed  Forces. It is not yet like that ofApocalypse Now,  the famous Francis Ford Coppola film, but military activities  have become routine in the area.    There is abundant evidence of the increased Brazilian  military presence in the area. The airport of Boa Vista, the  capital of Roraima, is a virtual frontline defense base. The  Brazilian Air Force (FAB) has deployed F-5 and Mirage squadrons  in the area. They join the Tucano single-engined planes to  perform exercises with ground and sea forces. Navy frigates and  destroyers are conducting maneuvers in the mouth of the Amazon  River, where they have performed beaching exercises. Ex-Army  Minister Carlos Tinoco, and current Army Minister Zenildo de  Lucena have both transferred military units from central and  southern Brazil to the Amazon. The Petropolis Infantry Brigade  (Rio de Janeiro) was sent to Roraima and the Santo Angelo  Infantry Brigade (Rio Grande do Sul) was sent to Tefe (Amazon).  Border platoons are being created to safeguard the military  presence in the area. The Tefe brigade camp, for example, will  occupy 500,000 square meters and operate along 2,200 km of the  border. It will have three jungle infantry battalions, a  hospital in Tabatinga (Amazon), and will have 1,700 troops: 500  in Tefe, 900 in Tabatinga, and 300 in Cruzeiro do Sul, in Acre.    The Amazon military unit will have jurisdiction over a  highly  strategic region: from Santa Rosa in Acre to the Traira River  near the Colombian border. It was there that Colombian  guerrillas clashed with Brazilian soldiers in 1990. There have  been successive incidents in the Amazon since the 1960's, when  the Venezuelan Government attempted to take Pico da Neblina,  Brazil's highest peak, (3,014 m). In the past few years,  intense drug trafficking activities and the growing presence of  miners who dispute land ownership with Ianomami Indians, have  heightened the tension. Last year Brazil was accused of  massacring 73 Ianomamis, although it was later discovered that  there were only 19 victims and they were killed in Venezuelan  territory. From neighboring Colombia there is also the  potential threat of 12,000 FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia], ELN [Army of National Liberation], and EPL [Popular  Liberation Army] guerrillas. Those organizations allied  themselves with drug trafficking cartels to obtain funds for the  armed struggle. According to Colombian intelligence services,  the guerrillas are giving armed protection to drug trafficking  routes, and they are likely to end up clashing with Brazilian  military and police forces. In Peru, the Maoist Shining Path  group has allied itself with drug trafficking.    The increased presence of Brazilian military troops stems  from a change in the strategy of the Armed Forces. According to  studies by the War College (ESG), the increased cooperation with  Argentina and the development of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] have reduced the geopolitical importance of the southern  region of the country, which has been the traditional point of  attention for the military. The hypothesis of an external  conflict has moved to the Amazon. What was mere theoretical  expectation has become official doctrine: since the beginning of  1993, the new line of the ESG has been blatantly christened the  National Strategic Concept. Admiral Hernani Goulart Fortuna, an  ex-ESG commander who is now a reserve officer, believes Brazil  is now really devoted to the Amazon, which occupies an area that  is subject to various international interests. "Brazil does not  have border problems, it has problems at the border," he said,  adding that it is no longer reasonable to maintain 35,000 Navy  and Army men in Rio de Janeiro. Fortuna has written a report  entitled: "The Amazon: Real Situation and Political, Strategic  Vision." In his report, Fortuna claims Brazilians became more  concerned about the Amazon following the end of the Cold War.  The admiral explains that the latent conflicts, which were  being kept on hold by the nuclear terror balance between the  United States and the ex-USSR, have begun to emerge in various  parts of the planet, and South America -- particularly the  Amazon -- is not free of this phenomenon.    Sergio Porto da Luz, a reserve sea captain and ESG  strategist, has pioneered the thesis of military reinforcement  in the region. In his book, Structure for National Power  in 2001, Luiz criticizes the broadly disseminated concept  that the Amazon is a sort of "world lung." Porto da Luz says:  "French President Francois Mitterrand has said that the Amazon  is an asset that belongs to mankind, where it could be necessary  to exercise the right of intervention. International interest  in this region, which has been monitored by all possible sources  of the First World, is growing." He believes it is necessary to  "show to the international community that Brazil is firmly  determined to prevent the Amazon from being treated with  impunity." General Antenor Santa Cruz Abreu, who headed the  Amazonas Military Command for three years, agrees. He says  Brazil should never yield to the "spurious thesis" of the  so-called relative sovereignty. Santa Cruz believes the  measures adopted by the Army to strengthen the defense of the  region, and those of civilian nature like those under the Amazon  Region Surveillance System (Sivam) are essential to prevent an  international strategic plan from being imposed on the country.  "If Brazil abandons the Amazon, there will not be a  conventional invasion but an attempt to create an international  force to preserve the earth's lung," he warns. Army Minister  Zenildo de Lucena prefers not to regard the increasing military  presence in the Amazon within the context of a possible  conflict, but as a guarantee of security and integration.    Not all military men, however, feel free to openly discuss  the issue. General Sampaio Maia, current chief of the Amazon  Region Military Command, CMA, did not want to talk to ISTOE  reporters. According to the officer in charge of the CMA public  relations, Gen. Sampaio Maia was "disgusted" at the treatment  the press had given to military activities in the region.  Nonetheless, on 8 and 9 March, Gen. Sampaio Maia met in Sao  Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, with General Valentin  Porras who commands the 5th Jungle Infantry Division of the  Venezuelan Army. The objective of the meeting was to reduce  border tension between the two countries. During the meeting,  which could not be covered by the press, they discussed the need  to improve communications between the Brazilian and Venezuelan  armies, to establish more simplified rules for military flights  along the border area, and to adopt common procedures to deal  with citizens who are caught in irregular situations. One week  later, Sampaio Maia received in Manaus the new head of the U.S.  Southern Command, General Barry MacCaffrey, who officially  conveyed to him the Pentagon's decision not to conduct military  maneuvers in Guyana. Brazilian military experts stated that  this decision was more than mere courtesy toward the Brazilian  officers who did not hide their concern over these maneuvers.  Porto da Luz is convinced that Pentagon strategists are aware  that Brazil is very seriously considering occupying that  territory. Admiral Fortuna said the U.S. Navy proposed to the  Brazilian Government to conduct joint maneuvers in the Amazon  Region. He even suggested modifying military doctrine and  giving priority to the antinarcotics effort.    Within this framework, it can be seen that General Bayma  Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry was no  accident. Gen. Denys, a former secretary of the National  Security Council and former head of the Eastern Military  Command, knows very well the logistic problems faced by the  Brazilian Armed Forces in the Amazon region as a result of the  somewhat sketchy highway system. Gen. Denys will begin to  repair the main accesses to the Calha Norte project site. To  give an idea of how precarious the region's roads are, it takes  more than five hours to drive the 200 km that separates Sao  Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, from the Venezuelan and  Colombian borders, and it is impossible to do it during the  rainy season. Only recently did the Brazilian Army ensure  deployment through the use of Manaus Aviation Squadron  helicopters and Brazilian Air Force Buffalo planes. Bayma  Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry implies the  presence of more Brazilian Armed Forces contingents in the  Amazon Region.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 40,000 PROTEST TO BACK YUGOSLAV MINERS' STRIKE  </P> <P> About 40,000 ethnic Albanians in the republic of Serbia refused to work on  Friday in support of striking miners protesting ethnic discrimination and  demanding the resignation of a provincial Communist Party chief, state-run  media said.  </P> <P> Yugoslav Communist Party leader Stipe Suvar spent three hours 3,000 feet  underground in a futile meeting with strikers at the Trepca lead, zinc and  silver mine in the autonomous Kosovo province.  </P> <P> Although he would not comment on the meeting, sources said he had been told by  Aziz Abrasi, the director of the mine, that the strikers said, "You can have us  out only in our coffins."  </P> <P> More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some of whom are also on a hunger  strike, have refused to leave the mines since Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Right to Issue Ultimatums  </P> <P> Later Friday, Suvar met with management at the mine, located in Mitrovica,  which lies just north of Pristina, the provincial capital. State-run media said  he told the officials that "nobody, not even the miners, have a right to issue  political ultimatums to the country."  </P> <P> Throughout the province, schools and most businesses closed, and the official  Tanjug news agency described the region as "on the verge of a general strike  and total paralysis."  </P> <P> The state-run media said 40,000 people staged sympathy strikes across the  southeastern province, which borders Albania. About 1.8 million ethnic  Albanians and 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins live in Kosovo.  </P> <P> The protesters condemn Serbia's drive to secure greater control over Kosovo by  changing the current constitution, fearing they would lose autonomy granted to  them in 1974. They also demand the resignation of provincial party leader  Rahman Morina, whom they consider an ally of Serbian Communist Party chief  Slobodan Milosevic.  </P> <P> Serbian leaders have asserted that they must have more control in Kosovo to  protect the mainly Christian Slav minority allegedly persecuted by  predominantly Muslim ethnic Albanians.  </P> <P> Suvar, 52, accompanied by Milosevic, later flew to Pristina to help ease the  tension by reassuring the protesters that changes in the Serbian constitution  will not violate their rights.  </P> <P> In late November, about 10,000 ethnic Albanians took to the streets in Pristina  for five days of demonstrations in support of two Kosovo ethnic Albanian  leaders, Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, who they said were dismissed under the  Serbian Communist Party leadership's pressure.  </P></p>

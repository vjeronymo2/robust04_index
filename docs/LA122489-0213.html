			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Glen H. Arnold, a counselor who specializes in treating the fears of people who  fly, says holiday travelers can take these steps to reduce anxiety before and  during a flight.  </P> <P> BEFORE THE FLIGHT  </P> <P> * Pack early to minimize departure-day stress.  </P> <P> * Beginning 24 hours before departure, avoid or minimize stimulants such as  caffeine, nicotine and sugar. Eat foods closer to their natural states, such as  fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.  </P> <P> * Set the mood early on the day of departure by listening to a relaxation  cassette before getting out of bed.  </P> <P> * Wear loose, comfortable clothing. Wearing slippers and layers of clothing you  can remove if necessary are good ideas.  </P> <P> * Give yourself lots of extra time to get to the airport.  </P> <P> * Check Christmas gifts like you do your luggage so you won't have to struggle  with them on board the airplane.  </P> <P> * Take a portable audiocassette player and familiar, relaxing recordings. A  relaxation cassette is a good idea.  </P> <P> * Take healthy snacks such as trail mix or dried fruits to eat during the  flight.  </P> <P> * Set a goal for each flight, such as making the flight 25% more comfortable  than the previous one.  </P> <P> * Make a "flight plan" -- how you expect to spend your time during the flight.  Breaking long flights into smaller units provides a feeling of greater control.  </P> <P> DURING THE FLIGHT  </P> <P> * Accept the fact that airliners encounter air turbulence about 10% of the  time.  </P> <P> * Keep your seat belt on all the time you're in your seat, and make it as snug  as possible without affecting your breathing. This minimizes body movement  during turbulence.  </P> <P> * In turbulence, visualize how a block of Jell-O would react and let yourself  yield similarly to the motion. If you grab something and stiffen your body, you  exaggerate the discomfort.  </P> <P> * It is critically important to maintain a feeling of control during the  flight. You can't control air turbulence or the airplane; concentrate on  controlling your reactions.  </P> <P> AFTER THE FLIGHT  </P> <P> * Did you achieve your goal? Any improvement is an advance. Reward yourself in  some fashion. STEVE EMMONS  </P></p>

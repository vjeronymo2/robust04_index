			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Grand Theatre, Leeds Opera North's 'new' Butterfly puts a run-of-the-mill, efficient staging by Jonathan Alver into the utilitarian, monolithic set by Lez Brotherston devised for the company's earlier production. The real novelty of the show is musical, for Martin Andre conducts what are claimed to be the first performances in this country of the original version of the score. The premiere of Madama Butterfly at La Scala in 1904 has become one of the best known disasters in operatic history. Stung by the public humiliation, Puccini worked on the piece over the next three years, progressively rewriting and rewording, and it is the version that emerged in 1907 that was published and used for performances ever since. For his WNO production in 1978 Joachim Herz unearthed and reinstated some of Puccini's original thoughts, and Graham Vick's Coliseum production of the early 1980s preserved many of those amendments; but Opera North's wholesale return to the first version has no precedents in Britain. The thrust of Puccini's revisions had softened the edge of the tragedy, toning down the cultural clash between East and West, making Pinkerton a less callous, more remorseful figure and Butterfly a tragic heroine in a more conventionally European mould. Pinkerton's final aria 'Addio fiorito asil' was one of the additions; without it his final appearance is harsher and almost devoid of guilt, and the role of Kate Pinkerton bulks larger and infinitely harder-faced. In the original Sharpless is weaker and morally bankrupt, while Butterfly herself seems more remote from reality than ever, adrift in a world half-way between childhood fantasy and adult feeling. It makes for a rawer, more uncomfortable opera than ever, though the inclusion in the first act of more japonaiserie between Butterfly's geisha friends and her relations hobbles the dramatic pace of the act just at the point at which the approaching love duet is all that matters. That passage apart, Puccini's initial dramatic instincts were as sure as his second thoughts, and Alver's production, unselfconsciously detailed, allows them an unimpeded run. Andre's conducting too is idiomatic and sharply theatrical, but on Friday the orchestral playing was consistently too loud for the moderately powered cast. Only Patricia Bardon's grave, beautifully focused Suzuki was able to make every phrase tell. Both Keith Latham's intelligently characterised Sharpless and Richard Taylor's surprisingly unheroic Pinkerton were covered too often. Maryanne Telese's Cio-Cio San made herself heard most of the time and accomplished a telling transition from wide-eyed innocent to hopeless victim, but carved out her vocal lines in a breathless unsatisfying way. The entirely Anglophone cast sings in Italian; there are no surtitles. Such purism could have been appropriate had the standard Butterfly been performed, but seemed unhelpful here. One of the points of resuscitating Puccini's original version was to reinstate material that deepens the cultural and psychological context of the opera. Unless the list of Opera North's achievements now includes making their audiences fluent in Italian, most of those textual changes will have gone for nothing.</p>

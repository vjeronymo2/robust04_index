When and how does corruption occur?  In your opinion, where are the highest levels of corruption in  Colombia?    [Samper] The country's highest corruption rates are found  within the public administration because of influence peddling,  irregularities in the handling of contracts and procedures, and  illegal actions by government officials. Certain positions  within the government are more vulnerable to corruption and the  abuse of power because of the nature of their functions.  Therefore, the plan against corruption I have proposed includes  special mechanisms to identify and control those positions and  create "transparency zones" [zonas de transparencia] in the  administration.    [Pastrana] The highest levels of corruption in Colombia are  linked to the large mafias, particularly the mafias involved in  drug trafficking and contraband. These mafias have managed to  infiltrate institutions such as civil aeronautics, customs,  justice, and the political system. Administrative corruption  has also grown because the state continues to be viewed as  political booty. The result is a distorted administrative  structure--one without goals, dominated by power brokers,  characterized by permanent changes in leadership, and which  lacks incentives for honest officials; one in which  disorganization fosters corruption. Taking into consideration  that this same "politization" dominates our control mechanisms  and that our justice system has shown little efficiency, is not  hard to understand that why a climate that favors the use of  public posts for personal gain has spread.    [Navarro] THE ECONOMIST has described Colombia as one of the  most corrupt countries in the world. We believe it is one of  the most corrupt countries in Latin America. The roots of  corruption are embedded in the breakdown of our social values,  where religious ethics have not been maintained or have been  replaced by secular ethics. Corruption is eroding relations  between the public and private sectors in two main areas:  decisionmaking and compliance with the law. In order for  corruption to exist, someone must be willing to take money and  someone must be willing to pay it. In the state, corruption is  basically concentrated in the Executive Branch, because this is  where most decisions are made and most funds are handled.  Taking into account there are some exceptions, corruption  occurs from the highest national levels to the lowest municipal  levels. This is clearly associated with public activities,  particularly with politics.    [EL TIEMPO] 2. Will you "negotiate" with Congress? Congress  and the government have been criticized for negotiating bills in  exchange for sinecures (appropriations, positions, etc.). Do  you believe this mechanism contributes to corruption? Would you  employ it during your tenure?    [Samper] Of course this mechanism contributes to corruption,  and therefore, I will not use it. That was why the Ethics Code  of last year's campaign clearly stipulated the responsibility of  congressmen supporting my candidacy. Those congressmen are  committed to back and promote from Congress the approval of  measures aimed at facilitating the government plan I have been  presenting to Colombians. In a way, it is a programmatic vote  at a national level.    [Navarro] Independent government branches are essential in a  mature democracy. Therefore, not only will I not employ this  mechanism, but I propose that as of today, it be considered a  crime to do so.    [Pastrana] The country strongly opposed the appropriations.  Therefore, we should not yield to any pressure to reinstate  them. The problem of positions is linked to a concept of  bureaucratic rewards that causes great harm to the country. The  weak partisan structures make relations between the president  and Congress difficult. We must establish rules to ensure  governability. I believe it would be a good idea to explore the  mechanism of a pact similar to the one signed by the New  Democratic Force with President Gaviria. That pact should seek  a commitment with the government plans, and, at the same time,  it should publicly assume responsibility in policies. In  addition, we should create a political consensus around a  development plan that would alleviate pressure on annual budgets.  <H5>  3. Other Measures </H5>   [EL TIEMPO] What other measures, in addition to draft bills  or statutes, will you implement to fight corruption?    [Samper] Our task is to once again make ethics a form of  social behavior. To my way of thinking, it is fundamental that  the laws generate credibility and thus encourage citizen  participation, which I consider the only way to win the struggle  against corruption. If we do not get the people to join the  struggle by reporting and cooperating, the task of moralization  will be very difficult. I intend for my government to once  again have grade school classes in constitutional ethics and  civics instituted, so that new citizens being formed in school  classes may once again take up the lost concept of good  citizenship.    [Pastrana] I have already begun. The Congress Ethics  Commission was created at my request and has started combating  corruption in the Legislative Branch. The statute against  corruption that I submitted will allow the state the legal basis  to investigate and prevent corrupt behavior. It is important to  break up that "marriage" between the corruptor and a corrupt  person. An organization with power and citizen support is  required to carry out intelligence operations as specified in  the statute.    Special treatment and a commitment by society and by the  state is required in order to cope with the Mafia. The status  of the war against narcotics trafficking is a result of the  permissiveness of government and society. Contraband has always  been allowed by the passive and permissive attitude of society.  First, there were the sanandresitos [area where smuggled goods  are sold openly], and today there are strong ties between  contraband and money laundering. The presence of these monies in  political parties and in Congress is an insult to the country.  Society must wage a considerable battle against contraband if  we want to defend our industries and our jobs.    The issue of the Cusiana [oil fields] is something else. The  country is worried about the macroeconomic effects, but it has  not devoted much attention to how to prevent corrupt practices  associated with financial boons. Many countries have squandered  opportunities that have arisen from such a boon.    [Navarro] Laws and statutes are necessary. They must  include appointing civic supervisors, punishing more severely  front men in money laundering operations and those who pay  bribes, lifting bank secrecy laws, requiring public officials to  provide statements of income, strengthening control mechanisms,  and rewarding informants, among other things. In addition, two  essential things are needed:    A) To practice new ethics and preach by good example,  starting with the president of the Republic.    B) To organize an Operation Clean Hands as of 1500 on 7  August 1994 led by the Search Bloc against corruption, with the  participation of the Presidency of the Republic, the Prosecutor  General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, the Treasury  Overseer's Office, and the technical and support teams that are  necessary.  <H5>  4. Strategies </H5>   [EL TIEMPO] How will you cope with corruption at the  national, departmental, and local levels?    [Samper] This will be done by strictly applying the  anticorruption statute which I presented and which I hope will  become a law as soon as possible. In addition, it is necessary  to promote citizen participation in this struggle against  corruption, through public trials, citizens supervisors, and  privileged access to information.    Colombian democracy cannot succumb to the cancer of  corruption, which is as dangerous as violence itself. It must  strengthen and expedite the work of the control mechanisms. The  Attorney General's Office, the Comptroller General's Office, and  the Treasury Overseer's Office exist for these basic purposes.  As for the issue of regional officials, that worries me,  because we cannot allow this great democratic achievement of  political decentralization to be foiled by the actions of  corrupt and immoral regional officials. The people in the  regions must choose their representatives well, since this is  the only manner of ensuring that decentralization successfully  stays on course.    [Pastrana] It is essential to strengthen and make  independent  all control structures. This must be done not only among those  in charge of disciplinary and penal control, but also among  those responsible for the control of efforts and results. In  the first case, it is important that the country have a visible  leader from whom the people can demand results. The Attorney  General's Office must take over this role in cases of  administrative corruption, just as the Prosecutor General's  Office has been doing for other crimes.    In the second case, deficiencies at the comptrollerships are  considerable and more attention should be paid to them. It is  also necessary to strengthen the superintendencies to prevent  aberrant situations such as those observed in the public  services, or financial crises such as we had in 1982 or the one  that Venezuela is currently experiencing. To conclude, a pledge  must be made to modernize the administration, increase the  continuity of the managerial structure, and actively involve  various civic organization in the administration and  surveillance of public services.    [Navarro] The points outlined above are the main strategies  we will use. In addition, we will adopt the following specific  measures:    A. We will give the post of Overseer of the Treasury  permanent status, maintain Dr. Jorge Garcia Hurtado as its  director, give that office more punitive duties and its own  agents in the departments and in the 50 most highly populated  municipalities of the country. We will also establish alternate  overseers in the municipalities that receive seizable bonuses.    B. As of 7 August 1994 all employees, beginning with the  president and vice president of the Republic, must declare their  properties and incomes at the Office of the Overseer of the  Treasury. The GAZETTE will publish the declarations of  officials who have jurisdiction and control on the day they are  sworn in and on the day they retire.    [EL TIEMPO] 5. What is the connection between the  centralization of power and corruption? What will you do about  this situation?    [Samper] Someone once said: "Absolute power corrupts  absolutely." Therefore, the best way to avoid this corrupting  power is to open democracy, decentralize power, and implement  efficient and effective mechanisms like the ones foreseen in the  new Constitution. This connection exists throughout the world,  and therefore it is essential to continue to achieve progress in  the regional and local autonomy processes--so that power is  distributed among more people and so the citizenry has more  access to it. Fortunately, in Colombia we have a presidential  regime; with the 1991 Constitution, we continue to strengthen  the other two state branches--the legislative branch and the  judicial branch. Nevertheless, we can and must do much more for  the balance and independence of these branches, and to give more  power to the regions.    [Pastrana] I have no doubts about the connection between the  concentration of power and corruption--both political power and  economic power--and even worse is the possibility of either of  them ending up controlling the media. The Television  Broadcasting Law should ensure that this cannot happen and that  the executive branch should be ready to fight the figureheads  with all means at its disposal.    We must also strengthen the overseeing authorities and  establish political campaign financing limits.    [Navarro] Of course there is a connection. The  centralization of power implies a weakening of checks and  balances. This is why we will move toward a balance of power,  as outlined by the spirit of the Constitution. We will also use  the Search Block we mentioned before to combat our current  problems.    [EL TIEMPO] 6. Campaign financing could generate corruption.  What changes will you make in this area?    [Samper] I believe significant steps have already been taken  to control the entry of funds whose origin is unknown. There  are two basic measures that should be highlighted: government  financing and the work of the Overseer of the National Treasury.  It is urgently necessary for these measures to go even further,  and it is up to us candidates to show transparency and honesty  in financing our campaigns. This is why I appointed a director  of ethics to control our income.    [Pastrana] Illegal money and contributions by economic  groups  should be handled differently. Regarding the former,  eradication is part of the comprehensive strategy I proposed  against drug trafficking and contraband. We must also fight the  negative influence of economic groups and their control over  politics. The 1991 Constitution took one step forward by  obliging the state to finance political campaigns and by  controlling the contributions made by private individuals. To  do this, we need to tighten the measures regarding auditing,  accountability, and public reporting of campaign resources.    [Navarro] It is absolutely essential to establish spending  limits for political campaigns. The ceilings do exist today,  but there is no control over penalties for those who violate  them. I propose that the Overseer of the National Treasury  serve as the authority to enforce these controls and that any  violation of them be reason for disqualification.    In addition, it is essential that information regarding  campaign finances be verifiable and that any related violation  also be reason for harsh penalties.    [EL TIEMPO] 7. The Inspector General's Office, the Attorney  General's Office, and the Comptroller General's Office require  changes to become more effective. What are these changes, and  when should such changes be implemented?    [Samper] It is necessary to make investigation procedures  more efficient and to conduct them expeditiously to convince the  people, who often do not believe these institutions are  reliable. It is necessary to eliminate obstacles and simplify  procedures. Investigations of public officials should not go on  for four or five years, and sentences should not be announced  when the officials are no longer in office. Greater efforts  must be made to update and improve these institutions. Also, it  is necessary to standardize penalties and procedures for all  public officials. It might even be advisable to consider the  possibility of officials waiving statute of limitations benefits  in disciplinary investigations in corruption cases.    [Pastrana] All of these institutions require urgent changes.  Nevertheless, I do not think there are any clear-cut means to  enable the people to assess the results of such changes. The  Attorney General's Office should become the great visible leader  in the fight against corruption--the great ally of the people.  This office should be invested with broad powers to conduct  investigations and show results to society. The Comptroller  General's Office should be made to fit the new concept of  stringent procedures and results. It is incredible that, while  our public institutions are inefficient, the citizens do not  have information enabling them to pressure for the necessary  changes.    [Navarro] Several changes have already been mentioned, in  particular those within the Inspector's Office, which seek to  strengthen the office and keep the current inspector. This is  very important because he has exceeded the expectations placed  on his position. An Inspector's Office without bite is of no  use.    The Comptroller General's Office requires in-depth reforms,  because it is one of the state's most influence-peddling  institutions. This is why we did not include it in the Counter-  Corruption Search Block that we propose.    It is necessary to start by changing the procedure to  appoint  the comptroller general, for which the Congress is currently  responsible. The comptroller general should be appointed by the  attorney general, the Inspector General's Office, and the  Legislative Assembly's judicial commission. In addition, the  comtroller general's control functions should be strengthened  urgently as ordered by the Constitution.    [EL TIEMPO] 8. During your government, what specific  mechanisms will the citizens have to actively participate in the  struggle against corruption?    [Pastrana] There are several mechanisms that should be  implemented. First, public hearings would allow public  officials and the community's representatives to meet to discuss  and resolve matters related to efficiency and morality in  carrying out the tasks in the relevant institutions. Meanwhile,  civilian overseers should be organized with the power to request  from state officials information on contracts and agreements  signed by various administrations. This will allow the citizens  to know what these contracts are all about. Last, the promotion  of active participation is necessary by the various media in  this struggle in order to facilitate this task.    [Samper] The people and the press should play an active role  in the struggle against corruption. It is important to instill  in the citizens high moral values and to organize a broad  council whose main goal will be to outline goals and assess  results. Moreover, the common, everyday citizen should be  constantly informed on the quality of services he receives and  on the costs of negligence and corruption he is forced to pay.  To reach this goal, it is necessary to have more dynamic media  and to establish an information system of an obligatory nature  that is easily understood by all Colombians.    [Navarro] The citizens will have two specific types of  anticorruption duties:    A. The accusation, with mechanisms as those previously  mentioned, such as protection of witnesses and rewards for  information, which would go to individuals or to organized  communities.    B. Control of the process of public contracts and their  execution, as well as in the decisionmaking process in matters  of public interests We will also establish the community tax  clearance certificate.    A great deal of encouragement will be given to all of those  municipal administrations that, in keeping with current laws,  offer active participation to citizens when awarding contracts  for public works projects in the community.    [EL TIEMPO] 9. And what about the police? Are the changes  implemented in the police effective enough to control corruption  within this institution? Why?    [Samper] We cannot deny that progress has been made in  cleansing the police. Nevertheless, the population still  considers corruption to be the main problem within this  institution, which obviously encourages growing distrust. The  recent creation of the post of national high commissioner and  the excellent performance by the former directors have  contributed to the institution's efficiency. Likewise, it has  contributed to improving the institution's public image.  However, there is still much to be done such as training,  increasing the number of units, especially in the large cities,  and establishing efficient and acceptable mechanisms that will  prevent excesses by some institution members.    [Pastrana] For many years we have neglected our police.  Restoring citizen safety depends in great measure on our ability  to rescue this institution. Changes are important, but we must  be cautious in order to be able to adapt to an ever-changing  situation. I would welcome a more concrete commitment by the  Executive Branch, because the reforms, including the  institution's control and cleansing guidelines require  significant investment.    [Navarro] Apparently, not. It is necessary to wait for the  results of the preliminary report prepared by the National  Commission, a body created within the police as a result of the  recent restructuring. If it is demonstrated that it is  insufficient, new changes will need to be implemented to grant  more control to the population.    [EL TIEMPO] 10. Performance Indicators. If you were  president, which indicators could the Colombian people resort to  in order to evaluate your performance in the struggle against  corruption?    [Samper] They could rely on the most important indicator for  a public official: the ability to honor promises made--my word.    [Pastrana] During my government, I will be committed to  eradicating contraband from Colombia. We are talking about a  frontal and permanent struggle for the survival of our entire  industry and honest work in general. Another of my objectives  is to continue the battle the country has been waging against  the influence of drug trafficking. All the officials in my  administration will be honest and divorced from petty political  party interests. We cannot continue attacking influence  peddling during campaigns and at the same time exercise it in  the government.    [Navarro] The indicators will be as follows:    A. The number of inmates and persons tried for crimes  carried out against the public.    B. The public resources recovered during Operation Clean  Hands which I propose be carried out by the Search Bloc against  corruption.    C. The number of citizens overseeing operations throughout  the country at the end of my term.    D. The number of public officials who demonstrate  transparency in carrying out their duties, which will be  measured through their disclosing their income and property.    E. The results of the reforms implemented to the  institutions which I referred to previously.</p>

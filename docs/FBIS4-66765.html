			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by H.T.: "Moral Dilemma"] </F>   [Text] The murder of two religious is a new insult to a  country that has sheltered the steeple, minaret, and synagogue  in peace for so long. There is no reason to say that the Marist  priest and the Assumptionist nun were killed primarily because  they were members of religious orders or because they were  French citizens. But the relentless logic of the  Islamists--which is the same as that in Sudan or  Egypt--invariably calls for attacking minorities, whether  civilian or religious. This double murder constitutes a new test  for relations between Christians and Muslims. And also for  Islam, whose image is distorted by this new violation of the  state of "dhimmitude" [Muslim toleration of religious  minorities], which obligates the faithful to respect the weaker  members of society--women and children--and priests as holy men.    There are still 30,000 Catholics in Algeria.[.sup]1[/]  Faced with the rise of fundamentalism, the Christian communities  of North Africa are having to deal with a moral dilemma, as  evidenced by the synod of African bishops that has just been  held in Rome (see page 14 [not reproduced]). They must  simultaneously avoid exposing themselves and being made  "martyrs" by the FIS on the one hand and, on the other, preserve  the future and concrete friendships with moderate Muslims who  are repelled by that Islamism. "It is necessary to stay because  among us, it is a matter of loyalty," said Archbishop Tessier of  Algiers before the murders on Sunday. And he added: "We have  been with them during colonization and since independence. We  remain with them in their anxieties."    The Christian churches have often been criticized for their  naiveness in wanting to continue a dialogue with Islam at all  costs, even when the latter was becoming more aggressive, even  toward Christians and the Vatican. But rather than "naiveness,"  it is opposition that one must speak of today. There is an  intransigent line of thinking that is inspired by events in  Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan and hostile to the political  statements of radical Islam. It is demanding as many rights for  Christians in Islamic lands as Muslims enjoy in Christian lands,  and its basis is the demand for "reciprocity" that was mentioned  by the pope in Casablanca in 1985. But there is also resistance  by a moderate group that advocates cooperation between  Christians and Muslims in a multifaith and, at the moment,  peaceful context, as is the case in Senegal, Mali, and even  Libya.    If dialogue is still possible with all sincere Muslims who  condemn terrorism and violence, and they are by far the most  numerous and the most reduced to silence, good will in only one  direction is not enough. It no longer seems capable of saving  anyone, religious or not, in Algeria today.  Footnote    1. Algeria has four Catholic dioceses (Algiers, Oran,  Constantine, and Laghouati), 170 priests, 100 monks, and about  350 nuns, most of whom are involved in educational and social  work.</p>

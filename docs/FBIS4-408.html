			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk, Zulu King </F> Goodwill Zwelithini, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, and ANC President Nelson Mandela near Skukuza at the  Kruger National Park on 8 April-- recorded, broadcast in  progress]    [Text] [De Klerk] ...they had to adapt and make special  arrangements to enable us to meet at this venue and we thank  them very much for the very efficient service which they  rendered to us and the discomfort they also had in the process,  during a very popular week, in making available this special  venue of which we made use. We have distributed a joint  statement, which no doubt you will interpret that it hides more  than it discloses. If that is your conclusion you are  absolutely right because that was the intention, not because we  have not had fruitful discussions, but because our discussions  in many senses of the word have not been completed. For that  reason we have appointed a task group with a specific  instruction. You might say, oh, another task group. [laughter]  I would like to say that this one is different in that it has  to report back in less than a week, to the leaders, and in that  there is an agreement for a follow-up meeting during which the  discussions will be taken further, and this is the main reason  why the statement is incomplete on all the burning issues, which  are not dealt with specifically in the statement.    I feel that we have made good progress in some respects  today. On the burning issue and the very important issue of the  accommodation and the full recognition of the monarchy of the  Zulu nation, of the Zulu kingdom, I am confident that this task  group will come up with good results because my perception is  that between our proposals, the proposals of the ANC, the  proposals from the side of Chief Minister Buthelezi and the  kwaZulu government, there is already discernible, a broad  consensus and that it is now a question of putting together the  how -- of the accommodation and recognition of the Zulu kingdom.  The fact that it is to be recognized, and that that is to be  done constitutionally, I think can be accepted as having been  fully established and that there is a broad consensus on that.    On some of the other issues I am disappointed that we  haven't  made more progress, but the door is not closed and discussions  will continue. There will now be a broadened basis of  discussion on the issue of mediation and mediation can play a  constructive and a positive role and the government will be  cooperative on the basis that we reach agreement on a number of  outstanding aspects affecting the issue of mediation. If we can  reach such agreement mediation can make a constructive  contribution towards bringing us nearer to solutions on many of  the substantive issues at stake. In general, I think we have  achieved today the beginning of a discussion and a continued  negotiation process between main role players which should have  started long ago. I have for many, many years been advocating a  meeting like the one we have had today and I'm glad that at last  it has taken place, and as far as the government and the  National Party is concerned, we will seek ways and means of  ensuring that also this important forum which has been brought  together today, will continue to operate and interact with each  other because there lies a heavy responsibility on the shoulders  of the four people and that which they represent in public life,  sitting before you. To a certain extent we have come to the  brink of a very serious situation, and our responsibility is to  through dialogue and negotiation, find ways and means to defuse  the issue in the province and to ensure that peace comes to all  the people of South Africa, and that the full opportunity for  all those who want to participate, to participate freely and  without fear, will be ensured and for those who choose the other  options, and that is not to participate, to also do so without  interference. Participation or not is a choice. It is part of  the democratic process, but the rights of those who want to  participate is as sacrosanct as the rights of those who don't  want to participate, and I'm glad that nothing has happened  today which in any way takes away from a previous agreement  reached between me and Chief Minister Buthelezi, that this  principle of free democratic organization for those who  participate and who don't participate, is an important principle  which should be upheld throughout our country in every inch and  every corner. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.    [Zwelethini] Well, from all that the state president has  been saying, I should say to the discussions that have taken  place in the meeting, which actually everybody has been ... has  been looking for, I'm so pleased that the meeting has taken  place today although some of my demands, as far as I'm  concerned, has never been met yet, but as far as this meeting is  concerned I hope that it's going to be very concerned about the  problems that have been accumulated in this country, especially  from the political parties whom actually their followers are in  a problem of fighting against each other, which I hope that  today, this meeting of today is going to show, especially to the  grassroots level, that the leaders themselves -- what do they  want from their own followers. So, I don't think there is  anything that I can say thereof, except that the joint press  statement for myself and the chief minister is going to be right  by him. Thank you.    [Buthelezi] Today his majesty, the king of the Zulu nation,  leaders of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC and the  South African Government and the National Party, and their  respective delegations met in a summit in a venue within this  Kruger National Park. The parties in this summit exchanged  presentations on their respective positions with respect to the  grave issues which are facing the country in the present  national crisis.    Unfortunately, progress could not be made with respect to  most of the fundamental issues tabled by his majesty the king of  the Zulus and by the Inkatha Freedom Party to which the leaders  and the delegations of the South African Government, National  Party and of the ANC, could not provide any responsive answer as  they still had to consult with their cabinet and with the  members of the working group through the ANC before responding.  The IFP upholds the summit to seek ways and means to reach a  constitutional compromise which could form the basis for a  broader political settlement and reconciliation which would  enable the IFP to join the electoral process on an equal footing  with all other political parties of South Africa. In this  respect the IFP felt that a postponement of the election date is  essential to achieve an all inclusive participation. Both his  majesty the king and the IFP also tabled the issue of the Shell  House massacre and of the most disturbing lack of police action  to secure evidence and ensure the conviction of those who  perpetuated that carnage. The issue of the sovereignty of the  kingdom of kwaZulu was tabled once again by his majesty the king  and the Zulu nation and an ANC proposal continued provisions to  be implemented by a government of national unity after elections  was found to be unacceptable by His Majesty and his delegation.  The issue of violence in the country and especially in the  kwaZulu-Natal area was discussed and the IFP tabled its firm  opposition to the declaration of the state of emergency in  kwaZulu-Natal and intervention of the SAP [South African Police]  and the SADF [South African Defense Force], which has already  proven to escalate the situation of violence and arrest in that  region.    The IFP insisted that the immediate lifting of the state of  emergency is a necessary precondition to the holding of free and  fair elections in the region. In order to seek compromise and  reconciliation the IFP tabled further proposals to reach a  constitutional settlement contained on pages five and six of the  presentation delivered by the president of the IFP. Such  proposals were not even discussed. International mediation  between the South African Government, the IFP, and the ANC was  also discussed and all parties stated their commitment to it.  In this respect the president of the IFP further proposed the  involvement of Norway in the mediation process, to which there  was no objection from the other parties.    That is a statement which His Majesty commanded me to read  to  you just now, and I must say that just like the state president,  I feel that although there may be that disappointment that there  has been nothing concrete as far as the expectations of many  people in this country and also outside this country are  concerned -- but nevertheless I do believe that the day was not  wasted. I believe that every minute that was spent in  addressing the issues of the king and the kingdom, in addressing  all the other issues that the state president has mentioned and  also issues that I mentioned, were well spent.    [Mandela] Firstly, I would like to say that the statement  read by the chief minister comes to me as a complete surprise.  I certainly was not informed about it before now. The  statement that has been distributed to the press was drafted by  committee representatives -- all the parties involved in this  discussion -- and I would have expected that if there was a  separate statement we should have been informed, warned about  this. The second point I want to make is that the IFP wanted the  date of elections to be postponed. We have emphatically  rejected that. That day is sacrosanct and there can be no  compromise over it whatsoever.    The third point I would like to make is that we would expect  the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to give full facilities to the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to deploy the voting  stations and to make all preparations for the elections, as has  happened in other parts of our country. There is no area in  which the IEC has encountered problems and we would appeal to  the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to cooperate with the IEC.  Those who want to participate in the elections should be free  to do so and those who want to boycott the elections should also  be free to campaign for the boycott of elections, after all,  that is what democracy is all about. The only issue which we  (?are against) -- as we have done in our resolution, is the  question of seeking to obtain ones objective through the  employment of violence. We have harshly condemned these  massacres and called upon our followers to commit themselves to  peace and we have condemned all forces, including those that are  known and unknown which are responsible for this violence, but  we hope that the authorities in that area will give full  cooperation to the IEC in its work.    Now, we made certain proposals to his majesty, as the ANC,  in  order to meet his concerns. We went out of our way to address  everything which we believe a constitutional monarch would like  to enjoy -- the powers, the rights which are sovereign  everywhere in the world, in a constitutional dispensation,  enjoy. There is hardly any power in our view which we reserved,  except perhaps we were silent on the question of the right of  His Majesty to communal land and to indigenous law. When this  was pointed out to us we indicated that as the African National  Congress we are prepared to address this question because we are  keen that the fears and the concerns of his majesty must be  fully addressed and I will be going back to my organization to  point out that amongst the proposals that we made, his majesty  felt that this particular question of his rights in relation to  communal land and to indigenous laws is a matter which he feels  we should have addressed, and we will treat this with all  seriousness. This discussion with his majesty is going to  continue. We will address it if we are unable to resolve it  before the election. We propose to continue after the election.    Without going into details I do not want us to have  exaggerated expectations about the task group because the  reasons for the reservation that have been expressed -- his  majesty expressed a certain reservation about the proposals that  were made to him and in my view these are reservations which  cannot be properly addressed by a task group. They are  reservations which can properly be addressed by a government of  national unity. Nevertheless, I will not oppose any mechanism  which my colleagues and all the other parties involved think  might be useful, but I would like to warn you that we should  have no exaggerated expectations as to what this task group is  likely to achieve.    Now the issue of the powers, the rights, the privileges of  His Majesty, have nothing to do with the form of state. Whether  it is a federation, or a unitary state, or a hybrid state, his  majesty will enjoy the rights of a constitutional monarch, with  all ceremonial powers. I believe that you must have gone  through our proposals because they are now in the hands of the  press, and we believe that subject to the two issues on which  our proposals seem to be (?based), subject to those two, we  believe we have gone a long way to address the concerns of his  majesty. But the addressing of his concerns is totally  unrelated to the form of state and that is the spirit in which  we handled the affair.    Now in regard to the Shell House massacre, that was raised  by  His Majesty and I pointed out that this matter is now in the  hands of the Goldstone Commission and we better wait until that  commission has made a finding. We will then take up the matter  on the basis of the finding of the learned judge, and I believe  that we saw more or less eye to eye on this point. Now we are  unable to place before you any tangible results of these  discussions, but of course as you know the fact that we sat  together to exchange views is itself progress. We now know what  the concerns of his majesty are, what the demands of the IFP  are. We have responded to them. They know what our point of  view is and further discussions, therefore, will build on what  we believe the basis that was made and the proposals that were  made to his majesty are a basis for further discussion of his  position. The African National Congress is very much concerned  about the demands of his majesty. It is one of the most  illustrious royal houses in this country and we would like his  majesty to feel sure that we are proud of the achievements of  that illustrious royal house, and it is for that reason that the  ANC has gone out of its way in order to meet the fears of his  majesty, and we are, therefore, leaving the meeting in the  knowledge that we have tried our best to meet the concerns of  his majesty, and as I say the discussions between ourselves on  his position, and his majesty, will go on before the 27 April,  and if we do not reach a solution, those discussions will go on  after the 27 April, but I want to make sure there should be no  doubt, whatsoever, about the elections on the 27 April. As I  said elsewhere, we cannot postpone our freedom and we are  determined to set up a government of our own choice on that day  and I hope that everyone will understand why we are so  determined that the elections should take place as scheduled.    [Buthelezi] I just want to clarify one thing that Mr.  Mandela says, when he says that he was not informed about a  separate statement that I have made. I think the issue Mr.  Mandela has discussed very clearly and I think that it was Mr.  Matthews in our party who stated there was a time when we were  not, in fact, in favor of issuing part of a joint communique,  but then the state president said that there were issues in  which we had agreed, that in fact we all agreed -- it was sure.  We are making it very clear that each person has the right to  make their own statement. The fact that we have put down what,  in fact, is our point of view doesn't mean to say that there is  no right to state our own point of view, but I mean it wasn't as  if we were doing this secretly. I don't know whether, maybe,  Mr. Mandela could not have understood the argument. There are  some arguments about it when we agreed on this matter, and I  would also like to, and I would also like to say that as Mr.  Mandela has put it, the discussions have gone -- inasmuch as the  state president has stated -- but concerning, you know,  elections the head of state in this country, Mr. de Klerk, has  stated to you that in fact I have not deviated from all the  undertakings that I made to him previously, and in fact all of  you have got my statement which I have given to you and all of  you are aware of the fact that it isn't as if on our part we are  trying to, you know, to deprive the IEC of any facility that it  is within our competence and powers to make available, and  thirdly, I would say that when the king raised the issues that  he has raised about the sovereignty of his people, and also the  whole issue of the Zulu kingdom, you stated that if there had  been a federal state that we would never had raised the issue.    So that, therefore, I think that the issue arises precisely  because the issue of the federal state, the three of us -- I  think the president, the president of the ANC, and myself we are  not at the negotiation council, except that they attended of  course the Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa]  plenary sessions, which I did not attend. But I would say that  the issues that the king has raised have a lot to do with the  self- determination of the Zulu people, that the issue is not  just a personal issue which his majesty the king raises, you  know, about himself and his person and his family. It's an  issue which he raises on behalf of his people as a whole, and if  the issue is not, actually sorted out, and he has pleaded that  it should be sorted out from January this year, when he spoke to  the state president, then it is a very problematic situation  because, therefore, I mean those of us, who may be members of  the IFP who are Zulu speaking will find it very difficult to  participate in the elections.    But I would like also to draw your attention to my statement  that I think I have made some very reasonable proposals because  the IFP intends participating in the elections, in fact we do  want to participate in the elections, and therefore, we made  some very reasonable compromises in an effort to try and have  this issue resolved before the elections because we do want to  participate in the elections. Now to say that when there should  be a government of national unity, and we should be called the  government of national unity, in which we are not part of -- I  think that of course is a misnomer because we cannot really be a  government of national unity in this country -- in which quite a  large segment of the people of South Africa are not represented.    So I just wanted to clarify those issues, and to say to Mr.  Mandela that there is no -- our meeting has gone on very  amicably and there was no tensions in the discussions, even  between us and that, therefore, there is no subterfuge, there is  no issue of us issuing a statement which was secretly (?drawn  up).</p>

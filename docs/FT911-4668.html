			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Potash market shows signs of recovery THE WORLD potash market, depressed in 1989 and most of 1990, is showing signs of a comeback. Canada's biggest producer has won a Dollars 9.50 (Pounds 5.30) per tonne price increase from Japan and Korea and believes China will accept the new base price of Dollars 110.50 per tonne. Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, which normally sells more than 50 per cent of its yearly output of nearly 4m tonnes abroad, asked Japan and Korea for a rise of Dollars 12. It will be satisfied if the lower price helps to stabilise the market in the North American market, says Mr Charles Childers, chairman. PCS, with five mines in Canada's biggest wheat province, is a low-cost producer with mine capacity of 9.2m tonnes and reserves of 4.7bn tonnes or 100 years. The deposits are of the easily worked flat-bed type and extraction is highly automated. The market turnabout started late last year when China made a big order. The favourable shift in the first quarter this year had a dramatic impact on PCS after two successive years of declining sales and earnings from the 1988 peak. Offshore sales were up 54 per cent for the first quarter and North American 30 per cent. Earnings more than tripled to about CDollars 12m (Pounds 5.8m). Mr Childers says that in spite of growing demand for potash as a fertiliser, especially from Asia and Latin America, balance between world supply and demand is several years away. Production and demand have been falling steadily in the Soviet Union and former Comecon countries for two years, and half the 12 east German mines have been closed. Mr Childers says the former eastern bloc producers are now active in Asia, particularly India, and demand hard currency in place of bilateral agreements and barter deals. 'The trend towards market-driven economies in many areas will tend to firm world prices,' he says. The Soviet Union is the biggest potash producer with 34 per cent of world output; North America is next with 31 per cent; Europe, including reunified Germany, 27 per cent; and Israel and Jordan 8 per cent. The consumption figures are different: 23 per cent for the Soviet Union; Europe, 32 per cent; North America, 20 per cent; 16 per cent in Asia; and 7 per cent for Latin America. China is now buying about 2m tonnes a year as it reduces nitrogen use. This is expected to rise to an estimated 6m tonnes by the year 2000, says Mr Childers. The World Bank estimates an annual rise in demand of up to 2 per cent. Mr Childers sees little chance of new mine production coming on stream anywhere yet. 'A 1m tonne yearly mine and processing plant costs around Dollars 350m in North American terms and the return on investment is very slim,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- The Tokyo High Court  rejected Friday [3 June] a plea by voters to invalidate the 1993  general election in which the weight of a vote in a sparsely  populated constituency was nearly three times as much as that in  a densely inhabited electorate.    Presiding Judge Shigeru Sato said in the ruling the vote  disparity of 2.88 to 1 "cannot be ruled unconstitutional in view  of the preceding decisions by the supreme court." The ruling  cited the highest judicial body's 1985 decision that said a  maximum disparity of 2.92 to 1 is constitutional as well as a  1993 decision that found a gap of 2.99 constitutional.    However, Sato said the Diet should observe the principle of  equality under which the weight of a vote in a certain  constituency should not be double that of a vote in another.  The judge also urged a government panel -- now commissioned  with redistricting the current multiseat constituencies for the  511-seat House of Representatives into 300 single-seat  electorates -- to pare down the disparity to less than 2 to 1.    The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit filed last year  by a group of 72 voters from 16 constituencies in Kanagawa,  Tokyo, Chiba and Saitama Prefectures, who said the 1993 general  election was unconstitutional because of the 2.82 disparity.  The group of plaintiffs was spearheaded by Kiyoshi Miyagawa, a  Dokkyo University professor, a resident of Chiba's No. 4  constituency, as well as attorney Yasushi Koshiyama, a voter in  Tokyo's No. 3 constituency.    Miyagawa has condemned as unconstitutional the current legal  provision that allows the Diet to allocate to constituencies  seats whose numbers are often disproportionate to the number of  registered voters.    The plaintiffs said they will appeal the ruling to the  supreme court. The latest ruling was made when a panel of  experts named by the previous government is trying to demarcate  the 300 new single- seat constituencies so that the next Japan's  next general election could be held under the new voting system.    The Home Affairs Ministry has reportedly said that whittling  down disparity in the weight of votes among the 300 single-seat  constituencies to less than 2 to 1 may be unattainable due to  limitations associated with a new electoral map being worked out  on the basis of the package of electorate change bills  legislated in January.</p>

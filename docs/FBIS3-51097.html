			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 5 and 11 January.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 5 January reports that Holguin  Province has begun 1994 with water levels in its reservoirs of  slightly over 83 percent of potential, "one of the best  situations in recent times, in this respect."    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that the David Diaz  Guardarrama Recapping Plant in Villa Clara delivered over 4,200  recapped tires for harvest use in the provinces of Santa Clara,  Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, and part of Matanzas.    Lastly, Rebelde reports that "ICAIC [Cuban Institute of  Cinematographic Arts and Industry] is urging all inhabitants of  Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality, Havana City Province, who  are interested in participating" in the filming of a joint  French-Cuban movie, to apply at its offices in the Vedado  section of Havana.    Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 5 January reports that the  Spanish  consortium Caguama Caribbean Hotels has announced that by late  1994 it plans to complete remodeling the Riviera Hotel in Havana  in the hopes of making it a fine five-star hotel. Regarding the  Caguama-Punta Blanca hotel, the group has announced that the  remodeling work has begun. Ricardo Roquero, president of Caguama  Caribbean Hotels, has confirmed that they chose the Caribbean,  and Cuba in particular, because of the great potential and  opportunities for investment.    Radio Reloj at 2052 GMT on 5 January reports that the Jose  Gregorio Martinez factory in Cienfuegos repaired approximately  400 hydraulic pumps used in the KTP sugar combines in 1993. The  factory workers have said that they can repair 150 pumps a  month. Last year workers were not able to produce the number of  cylinders, hoses, and shock absorbers needed for agricultural  equipment because they did not have the necessary raw materials.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 7 January quotes a GRANMA  article today reporting that a total of 777 Basic Cooperative  Production Units [UBPC's] were created nationwide in noncane  agriculture in 1993. GRANMA notes that to-date, there are 62,215  caballerias under UBPC jurisdiction and that slightly over  78,000 workers have joined these units. According to data  provided by the Agriculture Ministry, 407 of the 777 UBPC's tend  cattle; 226, miscellaneous crops; 65, tobacco; 29, citrus  plantations; 23, fish farms; 14, rice; 12, coffee; and one is a  forestry unit.    Radio Reloj at 2049 GMT on 7 January reports that  Tourhoteles  Enterprise surpassed its foreign exchange income goal by 7  percent in 1993. During the year, this enterprise was host to  270,000 tourists from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Italy,  Guatemala, and Brazil.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 7 January reported that  in  1993, Havana City reached an infant mortality rate of 8.9 per  1,000 live births, which is the lowest in its history. Villa  Clara achieved the lowest rate in the country, 6.6.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 January reports that the  Solidarity Cuba-France flight has donated $100,000 for GRANMA  newspaper and other supplies. The French Communist Party senator  stresses growth of the solidarity movement.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 January reports that the  first line of tubes [tubos] earmarked for the manufacture of  Cuban bicycles has begun continuous production in areas of the  (Indalecio Montejo) factory in south Ciego de Avila City.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 January reports that the  factory in Santa Cruz del Norte municipality, Havana Province,  which makes cardboard of various weights -- the only such plant  in Cuba -- will resume operations this month after an extensive  period of inactivity due to the current economic limitations.  The plant will process over 3,000 tons of cardboard of various  weights with support from a Swedish-Venezuelan company, and will  earmark this first shipment for the promotion of its products on  the international market. "The Santa Cruz del Norte cardboard  plant will use raw material acquired through foreign financing,  which will allow us to make this plant part of the national  strategy to bring in foreign currency."    Cuba Vision at 2330 GMT on 11 January reports that the first  phase of the Palo Alto bulk sugar terminal in Ciego de Avila  Province is near completion. The project, estimated at over 75  million pesos, will increase efficiency in marketing the sugar  produced by 17 nearby mills, as well as reduce transportation  costs. The facility is designed to handle 750 tons of sugar per  hour. Minaz and Micons workers affirm the first phase will be  completed within the next few weeks.    Cuba Vision adds that the San Jose White china factory in  Havana is operating in the black a few months after its  inauguration. Ninety percent of the raw materials used by the  factory are obtained in Cuba. The factory has already  contributed $500,000 to the national economy. It has 140 workers  and operates 24 hours a day.    Cuba Vision also reports that the workers of Varadero's  Tuspan Hotel accrued $10 million in 1993, thereby fulfilling  their pledge to Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered among the  best in Cuba due to the quality of its service and its economic  efficiency. The 230- room two-year-old hotel is a joint  investment of Cubanacan and the Mexican group DSC, and is  managed and marketed by the German enterprise LTI. The money  earned is a significant contribution toward purchase of food and  medicine for the people.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Ayrshire pylons inquiry opens The plan to run a line of pylons across south Ayrshire to take power from Scotland to Northern Ireland is to be considered at a public inquiry which opens in Ayr today and is likely to last more than two months. The 40-mile line of pylons is part of a proposed interconnector whereby ScottishPower will supply Northern Ireland Electricity with 250MW of power. The project will cost Pounds 175m. The European Union has promised a grant of Pounds 61m and ScottishPower will invest Pounds 20m. The project has attracted strong opposition in Ayrshire from a campaign group called Stop the Overhead Powerlines - otherwise known simply as Stop - which argues that the pylons will ruin some of the finest scenery in Scotland, pose a hazard to health and damage the local economy. They will also contend that Northern Ireland Electricity has cheaper alternatives to importing power from Scotland. The inquiry will consider the environmental arguments, and examine the need for the interconnector and its consequences for the national and local economy. Northern Ireland Electricity believes that the interconnector is the best solution for meeting its projected shortfall in power after 1997. Scottish Power sees the project as a way of increasing output and maximising utilisation of its coal-burning power stations. It will argue that the project should thus benefit the Scottish economy, especially by providing increased demand for coal from the Scottish coalfield, shortly to be privatised. The interconnector would involve building more than 200 pylons from a site near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire. There will also be a cable across the Irish Sea. Kyle and Carrick district council, across which the pylons would run, is one the leading objectors. However, a consultants' report commissioned by the council concluded that the project would bring substantial economic benefits to Scotland and was the only way to meet Northern Ireland's power shortfall. The government is not obliged to adopt special precautions under European law to safeguard children from exposure to possible health risks from new underground power cables, two High Court judges ruled yesterday. Three children from London, acting through their fathers, applied for court orders requiring Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct the National Grid to ensure that fields from new cables do not exceed levels which latest research suggests are safe. The children live in South Woodford, where National Grid is laying a high-voltage underground cable. Their parents fear dangerous electromagnetic fields could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers. Their lawyers argued that changes in European law required member states to act on 'precautionary' principles when carrying out legal duties. But Lord Justice Farquharson and Mrs Justice Smith refused their application for judicial review. The parents are considering an appeal to the Court of Appeal and then, if still unsuccessful, taking their case to the European Court of Justice.</p>

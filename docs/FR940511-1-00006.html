In a case involving the purchase or sale of real estate, the option or sales contract must state who will pay the title clearance and closing costs.

Title insurance is the recommended method for protecting FmHA interests. State Directors are authorized to require title insurance for all loan closings or some loan closings based on the type of loan and/or the geographical area of the state. If title insurance is used, State Directors are authorized to require a closing protection letter issued by an approved title insurance company to cover the closing agent, if such closing protection letters are customarily provided by title insurance companies in the state. The State Director's determination to require the use of title insurance will be based on the commercial and residential loan closing practices of the state and the economic and legal feasibility of obtaining title insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close FmHA real estate loans, provide necessary title clearance, and perform such other duties as are set forth in this subpart. A closing agent will be responsible for closing FmHA loans and disbursing both FmHA loan funds and funds provided by the borrower in connection with the FmHA loan. The borrower will select his or her closing agent. FmHA employees will not recommend the use of any particular closing agent or title insurance company, although as provided in &sect;927.54(a) the borrower may be required by a state instruction to provide title clearance with either a title insurance policy or an attorney's opinion. If title clearance is by an attorney's opinion, the approval official will approve the attorney who will perform the closing on a case-by-case basis in accordance with &sect;927.54(c) prior to loan closing. In such cases the attorney will be approved after submitting Form FmHA 1927&hyph;19, ``Certification of Attorney.'' If title certification will be by means of a policy of title insurance, the title company which will issue the policy must have been approved in accordance with &sect;927.54(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Speedy and realistic transport policy Sir, I would agree that Philip Robin's proposal (Letters, March 22) to reduce top speed on the roads to 50mph would have an immediate impact. Carrying capacity of Britain's roads would be dramatically reduced and would seize up on many critical stretches. May I suggest that the quickest way to promote a realistic transportation policy would be to put all politicians on public transport for a week, removing all access to private transport and parking privileges. One might also look at the logic of granting a lifelong driving licence from the age of 17 which does not include assessment on a motorway. If drivers were retested annually, an advanced driving licence for motorways and main arterial roads were required, and the minimum speed limit on such roads were raised, it could reduce the number of vehicles and increase the carrying capacity of our present main networks. The cost to the individual would be insignificant compared to the current costs of maintaining and running a car. I have been told that annual retesting of drivers is political suicide, but some may argue that politicians are replaceable, whereas our countryside and environment are not. The environmental impact of increased fuel consumption at the higher average speeds would be offset by the reduction in consumption idling in traffic jams on the same journey.

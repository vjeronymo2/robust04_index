			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Observer: Light at the end At last a seating plan for the London Underground. Rupert Saunders, an enterprising cove who runs the Clever Map Company, has published a Pounds 2.50 pocket guide which tells where to sit on the London underground for the speediest connection on leaving the tube. Passengers taking the Piccadilly line at Knightsbridge for Kings Cross, for example, should board, the fourth carriage from the front. Beyond Kings Cross, the tip is to sit in the last carriage. 'If someone saves 10 minutes a day by using the Tube Hopper map, it is the equivalent of an extra week's holiday a year, ' enthuses Saunders. Observer would still prefer to know which carriage to sit in to avoid being mugged.</p>

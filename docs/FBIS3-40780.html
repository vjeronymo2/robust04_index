			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 19--The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP]  today patted itself on the back for losing but standing first in  the November 1993 elections and there was a clear indication  that it was not to change direction or dilute its Hindutva  ideology.    But having congratulated itself on emerging as "the single  biggest party" in the country and for its overall poll  percentage of 36.14 (a good 10 percent ahead of the nearest  rival, the Congress), it went on to draw some "lessons" from its  electoral defeat. Over-confidence, too much emphasis on national  issues during the poll campaign, lack of discipline in some  State units were among the factors held responsible for the  debacle.    Advani's note: Significantly, the key to the  party's stand towards its electoral debacle came from a  three-page note for consideration of the party's national  executive committee which Mr. L.K. Advani, party president, sent  from his confinement in Pipri, where he is under judicial  custody in connection with the Babri demolition conspiracy case.    Mr. Advani noted that the party had set a high target for  itself, that of capturing power in five States. That has not  happened. "The sprinter has failed to break another record." But  that the BJP is still "numero uno" is not doubted by him,  although he admits that it was inadequate compensation for the  electoral defeat. The "apt comment" on the elections would be  "loser stands first," Mr. Advani said.    The task before the party, he advised the national  executive,  chaired in his absence by the senior vice-president Mr. Sundar  Singh Bhandari, was to "so fine-tune our approach and strategy"  that the present disappointment with the November Assembly  election results proves a fleeting phase. Quite unequivocally,  Mr. Advani said the setback in the election was not a setback  for its ideology, for its support base had increased. "The  enlargement of the party's popular base is proof that the  party's ideology of cultural nationalism continues to gather  more and more adherents," Mr. Advani stated.    General secretaries' report: Today on the last of  the two-day meeting of the national executive the party  discussed not only Mr. Advani's note but also a report on the  recent elections prepared jointly by the party's five general  secretaries. The report, which has been by and large accepted by  the executive, has concluded that several factors may have been  responsible for the poor performance.    These have been identified as over-confidence and  complacency, failure to project unity at the organisational  level in some of the States, tough and unpopular measures taken  by some of its State Governments, too much emphasis on national  issues rather than important local issues during the election  campaign, and lack of adequate attention being paid to the  backward and scheduled caste factors.    Till late this evening the executive committee was  discussing  the draft political resolution which will be released tomorrow.  However, it is learnt that the resolution will by and large  reflect the position that the party has not fared badly, that  its dizzy growth has been momentarily slowed down, that the  general direction of the party and its main ideology needs to be  strengthened rather than diluted, and that the task before the  party is to rededicate itself to this task.    Changes suggested: As a result of the experience  from this Assembly election the general secretaries' report has  suggested some changes in the method of selecting candidates. It  has suggested that the party should invite applications from  candidates only for those constituencies where it proposes to  drop a sitting MP [member of Parliament] or MLA [member of  Legislative Assembly] or change the candidate which had last  fought elections from there. It also has a word of caution for  future BJP governments--not to take too stiff and unpopular  measures too soon--for the party has identified this factor as  the main reason for its rout in Himachal Pradesh.    The main discussion on the general secretaries report and  the  poll debacle was initiated last night by Mr. Sunderlal Patwa,  former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and the man most  maligned in party circles as the villain of the electoral defeat  in that State. Today's deliberations suggest that the party is  opposed to singling him out or making him a scapegoat for the  debacle, for after all in Himachal Pradesh the party suffered a  complete rout.    Madhya Pradesh was not the only State unit which was "sure"  that the party would win hands down. In Uttar Pradesh, the  report recorded, the party office-bearers had from the start of  the campaign talked about "280 seats in our pocket." The party  has been critical of this kind of complacency and has warned  that in future too there could be new political alignments and  the party would have to prepare itself well.    PTI reports:    The BJP is likely to call off its boycott of Parliament from  tomorrow, the leader of the Opposition, Mr. A.B. Vajpayee,  indicated.    He said a final decision would be taken at the Parliamentary  Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning.    He said the boycott issue was discussed at length at the  national executive and it was felt the party had registered its  protest in Parliament against the continued "illegal detention"  of its leaders in the Ayodhya case.</p>

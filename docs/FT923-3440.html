			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Bank of Japan sees bleak economic outlook JAPAN stared a real recession squarely in the face yesterday. The country's leading steelmakers forecast sharply lower profits, securities houses announced plans for streamlining and the stock market again lost confidence - along with 4.2 per cent of its value. The bleak mood was drawn in more detail by the Bank of Japan, which released its quarterly economic survey of enterprises. The bank found business confidence across the economy sagging badly since its last survey in May, with the manufacturers' index falling from - 24 to - 37. The outlooks for profits, sales and investment were all down. The only category rising was inventories, the index for which rose from 32 to 38, pointing to a sharp decline in industrial production in the months ahead. The survey was reinforced by Nippon Steel's forecast of a 74.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the half year ending this month. Most other steelmakers announced similar declines in profits. More important, the industry said it was preparing to seek government subsidies for 'employment adjustment'. This is the euphemism for transferring workers to subsidiaries, asking workers at idle factories to stay at home until business improves, retraining workers, and, as a last resort, sacking them. Mr Takeshi Noda, economic planning minister, gave clear notice of what lay ahead when he said: 'We are one step before entering into the phase of employment adjustment.' Job losses have so far been relatively few. But with consumer demand waning, output falling, inventories growing and profits plunging, many economists say it is only a matter of time before the manufacturing sector contracts with big job losses. Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming Securities, expects manufacturing employment to decline by 3 per cent in the next year, based on the current decline in industrial output. This means half a million workers could be on the streets. They are unlikely to stay there long, however, given Japan's steep rise in public investment that will start next year as part of the government's Y10,700bn (Pounds 44bn) emergency economic package announced two weeks ago. But in the meantime many industries will face tough times. Trade surplus grows, Page 3 Steel profit forecasts cut, Page 10 Honda quits car racing, Page 22</p>

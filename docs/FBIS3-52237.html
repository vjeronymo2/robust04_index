The spokesman pointed out that intensive and continued  contacts are under way through diplomatic channels on this  issue. An announcement on taking this step will be made soon,  he said.    The spokesman added that final arrangements will be worked  out to translate the cordial and distinguished relations between  Jordan and the Vatican. His Majesty King Husayn and His  Holiness Pope John Paul II are eager to entrench these  relations, so they will enjoy much respect and appreciation  proceeding from the historic and distinguished bilateral  relations, he noted.    The Vatican's official spokesman, Dr. (Navarro Valse), said  Jordanian-Vatican relations are good and fruitful. In a news  conference held at the Vatican, he added that the Vatican also  has good relations with many regional states, and has contacts  on fruitful cooperation with some of them. He particularly  pointed to relations with Jordan, and asserted that Christians  in Jordan enjoy unequalled privileges. Dr. (Valse) added that  out of their desire to put these good relations in an  institutional framework, the two sides began to negotiate the  establishment of full diplomatic relations. There was an  agreement on this issue.    (Valse) explained that the arrangements on this issue are  about to be finalized, and that they will be announced soon. He  expressed the hope that this step will be a catalyst to enhance  the current cooperation with Jordan that has long contributed to  supporting and promoting the peace process. He indicated  Jordan's great role in regional stability and security.  [passage omitted]</p>

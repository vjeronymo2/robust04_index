			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DAY-CARE CENTER WOULD COMBINE ELDERLY,  YOUNG  </P> <P> Imagine a day-care center where children and the elderly mix -- sharing meals,  recreation and activities. At least twice a day, the two groups would break  from their senior citizen or preschool activities and mingle.  </P> <P> Such a proposal was unveiled Monday by Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy Picus, who  said at a news conference that she is helping seek funding for a privately  operated "inter-generational day care center" in the west San Fernando Valley.  "It will be the first of its kind in Los Angeles and it will carve new roads in  the care of seniors," she said.  </P> <P> If funding comes as expected from charitable organizations, state and federal  sources and other donors, the center could open by the end of next year, Picus  said.  </P></p>

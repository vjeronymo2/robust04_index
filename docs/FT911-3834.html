			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Cronite puts two problem offshoots into receivership CRONITE GROUP, the Birmingham-based industrial holding company, said yesterday that it was putting into receivership two of its subsidiaries where irregularities, including misappropriation, had been discovered. The shares, suspended at 12p on April 5, rose to 23p when were restored to listing after the announcement. The bigger of the two subsidiaries is Cronite Alloys, which recycles stainless steel. The other is Abtex, which manufactures hand portable fire extinguishers. The company said it also intended to close or dispose of two other businesses, Hy-Tech, a machining company, and North American Cronite, a sales organisation. Accounts for the five months to end-February, also published yesterday, showed total losses for the four companies, including closure costs, of Pounds 3.05m. At the pre-tax line, the company incurred a Pounds 2.18m loss. That compared with a Pounds 1.22m profit for the year to end-September. Cronite said it had discovered that Alloys had suffered a shortfall in expected income amounting to about Pounds 400,000 while management accounts had overstated the value of certain stock by Pounds 500,000. At Abtex, continuing trading difficulties had been exacerbated by misappropriation of stock. Concluding that continuation of losses at these two subsidiaries would have an unsustainable effect on cash requirements, Cronite had requested Barclays, its bank, to appoint receivers. Mr James Lindsay-German, chief executive, said he could not comment on whether the irregularities would give rise to any legal action. The decision follows investigations by Arthur Anderson, the accountants. Cronite said Barclays had confirmed the availability of facilities for the remainder of the year, subject to an Pounds 8.2m maximum, and with this arranged it hoped it would be able to develop its profitable businesses. But there will be no interim dividend owing to a shortfall in distributable reserves. At the trading level, five-monthly losses at discontinued businesses were Pounds 1.87m (against Pounds 70,000 for the 12 month period) while profits at the rest of the group were Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 2.4m). Net assets per share were 31.1p (48.2p). The deterioration follows a sharp fall in profitability during the previous year when pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m were about half their 1989 level.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UN must be more even-handed in sponsoring peace in Angola Sir, The United Nations Security Council has just imposed, as you reported ('UN imposes sanctions on Angolan rebels', September 17), an arms and oil embargo on Unita via Resolution 864. Moreover, it has threatened further sanctions on Unita, covering a trade ban and travel restrictions, if a ceasefire has not been agreed by November 1. This is a manifestly retrograde step. It not only serves to delay, even to obstruct, the peace process and the deployment of humanitarian aid, but poses the question of whether UN actions are hindering or facilitat-ing a peaceful settle-ment to Angola's problems. The UN role in Angola, before, during and after the September elections has been less than auspicious. The head of the UN mission during the electoral process, Margaret Anstee, admitted recently that the UN's mandate at the time was 'woefully inadequate'. A UN report on the elections reinforced her view by concluding that electoral irregularities were discovered that 'could have affected the final election result'. In addition, once the process was derailed, an opportunity for a ceasefire, during the Abijdan talks of April-May was lost because the UN mission in Angola was told that no 'Blue Helmets' would be available for six to nine months. It appears that not only was the UN under-resourced for the task but was also at odds with itself. The UN secretary-general has recently requested that the security council allow him more UN staff to help the UN's 'mediation and good offices' but this has been denied. Instead the security council decided on punitive sanctions on Unita, combined with a series of deadlines. The UN does not, however, explain what incentive there is for the MPLA to agree a ceasefire. If the MPLA knows that a failure to agree a ceasefire will lead to more sanctions against Unita, clearly it will do all it can to delay agreement. Unita does believe that the UN has a role to play, but it must be seen to be even-handed and coherent in its policies, and it must also demonstrate that it is prepared to commit the necessary resources on the ground to allow a ceasefire and negotiations to take place. We look forward to seeing evidence that this is the case. I Samakuva, London representative, The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, 3 Clifford Street, London W1X 1RA</p>

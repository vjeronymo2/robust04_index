			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Gulliver Tied Down By Moral Strings"] </F>   [Text] Delegates to the annual OAS meeting in Brazil  expressed their opposition to an armed intervention in Haiti to  restore Jean Bertrand Aristide's democratic government. The  small English-speaking Caribbean countries expressed support for  military action against the Haitian military coupists. Nothing  suggests, however, that they did so because of U.S. pressure  when even the Clinton administration seems unenthusiastic about  supporting such military action.    It seems that good sense has finally prevailed. Democracy is  not imposed through armed invasions. This is, however,  frequently overlooked in politics on the basis of the strong  moral justifications which have dominated Washington and North  America for many years. Although Republican administrations were  responsible for the military operations against Grenada and  Panama, the democrats' "moral" reasons are also very strong. The  truth is that its experience in Somalia, which is considered a  failure, has embarrassed the United States. In view of this, it  has reviewed, once again, its moral role in the world.    Some time ago, Clinton explained that the United States  cannot resolve world problems. Perhaps this means it will not  even try in the future. This means the bloodbaths in Rwanda and  South Yemen will continue indefinitely, enabling the U.S.  Administration to maintain peace of mind. It tried, it failed,  what else can be done. All this is fine if it entails an end to  military invasions justified through legal resolutions. It is  bad, however, if it means the United States -- paralyzed by  moral contradictions -- will conduct its international affairs  in a disorderly fashion.    The Clinton administration has been fiercely criticized for  renewing China's most-favored-nation status, overlooking human  rights violations. What is condemnable, however, is not the fact  that it has made an exception with China, but that it has not  done so in other instances. While the reasons may differ, there  is no need to insist that exceptions apply only in terms of  trade.    There is no sense to military intervention of Haiti. Not  just  because the OAS, with good sense, rejects the imposition of  democracy through military force, but because U.S. intervention  in international affairs depends on the nature of the issues in  question. Undoubtedly, every human life is precious, but human  rights violations in China are not the same as the massacre of  hundreds of thousands of Rwandans or Somalis. Furthermore, it is  not absolutely clear that the military action in Somalia was  wrong. The international community, through the United Nations,  made a courageous decision to stop the massacre of innocent  people. This is not the same as imposing commercial or military  sanctions on a country to restore democracy.    The international community needs a leader who can decide  where to act and where not to act. If the Clinton administration  does not overcome its moral paralysis, it will be tied down like  Gulliver by the Lilliputians.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Ethnic groups' disparity widens AN increasing disparity is emerging between the circumstances of ethnic minority groups, the Policy Studies Institute says today. Its research, based on a study of the Department of Employment's labour force survey, says a complex pattern now exists which 'can no longer be adequately summarised by a simple contrast between relatively well-off 'whites' and poorly-off 'blacks'.' The report says that members of the African-Asian and Indian communities have higher proportions of well-qualified people, have attained comparable job status with whites, and have unemployment rates closest to those of the majority population. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have the largest proportions of people without formal qualifications and consistently suffer the highest jobless rates. Afro-Caribbean people tended to be in a more complex position between these two extremes. But, concludes the report, it was clear that general circumstances had changed little for people of Afro-Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin over the past 10 years. They remained concentrated in lower-level jobs, and were subject to much higher rates of unemployment than other ethnic groups. Research suggested that levels of racial discrimination in the mid 1980s were similar to those of the mid 1970s, it says. Britain's Ethnic Minorities.

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TESTING PLANNED FOR VIDEOCASSETTES THAT WOULD SELF-ERASE AFTER NUMBER OF PLAYS  </P> <P> Reminiscent of the "Mission Impossible" television series, a major film company  plans to test-market a videocassette that will self-destruct after the movie  has been watched a set number of times.  </P> <P> MGM-UA Home Video has decided to test the "disposable" tapes this summer in an  undisclosed city, according to Herb Fischer, vice president of sales and  marketing.  </P> <P> The mission of the new videocassette -- should studios decide to accept it --  will be to encourage the production companies to sell video rental stores more  copies of a movie for the same price they would pay for fewer tapes with  unlimited play. That would make it easier for movie renters nationwide to find  a hot new release at their video stores.  </P> <P> "It saves you going back three times to get the same film," said Steve Roberts,  president of the Los Angeles-based S. Roberts Co.  </P> <P> The company is consulting on the project for Rank Video Services America, a  manufacturing duplicating company based in Torrance, Calif., that licensed the  patent to the new product.  </P> <P> Although these tapes will not go up in smoke when the limited number of plays  are completed, they will erase themselves and cannot then be re-recorded, said  Roberts.  </P> <P> "It becomes inoperative as a normal cassette," said Bob Pfannkuch, chairman of  Rank Video Services America. He said the technology for this type of  videocassette has been around for 3 to 5 years.  </P> <P> However, it will be the first test-marketing of this type of tape that could  have a profound influence in the $8-billion videocassette industry. The first  title has not yet been selected.  </P> <P> Introduction of the new tapes, which will have green cases to distinguish them  from the typical black cases, could meet strong initial demand for popular  movies, Roberts said.  </P> <P> He said retailers lose from 5% to 20% of their potential business because  frustrated customers who cannot find their first-choice movie leave without  renting anything.  </P> <P> A retail outlet currently pays more than $60 for a movie title and cannot  afford to stock it in depth. However, with the disposable tapes programmed at  20 plays, that retailer could buy the same movie for about $30, he said.  </P> <P> "The goal of this is not to replace the traditional black tapes," said Roberts,  who explained that retailers would still buy the permanent tapes but would also  purchase the green disposable movies for "depth of copy."  </P></p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Amoco falls as margins and demand weaken AMOCO, the fifth-biggest US energy company, yesterday reported a 22.5 per cent drop in underlying second-quarter earnings, reflecting a squeeze on margins and weak demand in the group's refining, marketing and transportation divisions. Wall Street reacted to the figures by marking Amoco's shares Dollars 1 1/2 lower to Dollars 48 5/8 . Amoco's results were distorted by a previously announced Dollars 805m charge for restructuring and job cuts. The provision pushed Amoco into the red for the quarter. Excluding the substantial charge in the latest quarter and charges of Dollars 68m a year earlier, Amoco earned Dollars 237m, or 48 cents a share, in the 1992 quarter. The result was still lower than the Dollars 306m, or 62 cents, earned a year earlier. Extraordinary items in both years brought the company's reported net loss to Dollars 478m, or 96 cents, compared with net earnings of Dollars 238m, or 48 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 7.4bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 6.8bn, largely because of the settlement of natural gas contracts. For the first half, Amoco had a net loss of Dollars 244m, or 49 cents, on revenues of Dollars 13.8bn. A year earlier, earnings were Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 2.08, on revenues of Dollars 14.1bn. Stripping out extraordinary items in the latest period, Amoco earned Dollars 423m, or 85 cents. Excluding gains from an accounting change, the company last year earned Dollars 730m, or Dollars 1.46. Amoco said its underlying foreign exploration and production results had fallen in the quarter. Higher exploration expenses and lower crude oil volumes more than offset the benefits of an increase in crude oil prices and favourable currency translations. Including a one-time charge of Dollars 258m and the gas contracts settlement, foreign exploration and production expanded its loss to Dollars 174m in the latest quarter from Dollars 24m a year ago. Profits from domestic exploration and production fell to Dollars 60m from Dollars 131m. Depressed margins cut underlying earnings from refining, marketing and transportation to Dollars 115m, against Dollars 227m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beth Veloso from Congress] </F>   [Text] Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the  Senate, said the government may adopt radical measures if the  social emergency fund bill is not approved next week. He said  today that the government may adopt strong measures with radical  effects to curb inflation. He also said Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso may resign his post if Congress  continues delaying a decision on the economic plan.    [Begin Simon recording] His argument is that if the bill is  not approved all the government can do is return to what we all  know, that is, strong measures like radical economic packages  and the plans we already have lived through and whose results  are known. He is capable of resigning if the bill is not  approved. [end recording]    Sen. Pedro Simon said that in his speech to the nation on 7  February, Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will make a final  appeal to the congressmen to turn up in the plenary hall and  assume their responsibility.    [Begin Simon recording] In his speech, the minister will  explain the whole issue and he will call on congressmen to vote  either in favor or against the bill. It would be fantastic if  they vote against it because they would be rejecting a bill  that, although it was prepared by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, was  totally modified by Congress. Congress must give a reply. Do the  congressmen agree that we must solve the public deficit? Do they  agree that the government must stop borrowing money from the  bank to pay interest it cannot pay? Don't you agree with this?  The congressmen must approve the bill they modified. [end  recording]    Sen. Pedro Simon said the government needs the social  emergency fund bill to be approved on 8 February in order to  honor its commitments to its international creditors and then be  ratified on 10 March.</p>

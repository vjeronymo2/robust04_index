			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> ST. JUDE HOSPITAL TO OPEN A 37-BED SKILLED-NURSING FACILITY ON MARCH 21  </P> <P> Later this month St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton  expects to become the first hospital in Orange County to open skilled-nursing  facilities on their premises.  </P> <P> Barry Ross, the hospital's vice president for rehabilitation and mental health  services, said the hospital expects to start admitting patients to its 37-bed  skilled-nursing facility on March 21, assuming it obtains final state licensing  approval.  </P> <P> He said the skilled-nursing facility will take patients released from  acute-care hospitals -- primarily from St. Jude Hospital -- who need special  rehabilitation and other nursing services before returning home or to  convalescent facilities.  </P> <P> "It allows us to have the patients receive the most appropriate and economical  level of care," Ross said.  </P> <P> Ross said that hospital-based skilled nursing services have the advantage of  providing convenience to the patients who can use the hospital's diagnostic  facilities.  </P> <P> He said the skilled-nursing facility is housed on one floor of a wing at St.  Jude Hospital that previously contained administrative offices and various  ancillary services. Over the past six months, he said, that space has been  converted for patient beds as well as a rehabilitation gym, beauty shop and  recreation area.  </P> <P> Room and board at the new nursing facility will cost $250 a day, Ross said.  Approved Medicare patients -- representing the vast majority of patients --  will pay $25.50 a day for the first 8 days. After that, he said, Medicare will  pick up the entire tab for care up to 150 days.  </P> <P> Also planning to open skilled-nursing facilities are Anaheim Memorial Hospital  and Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center in La Habra.  </P> <P> Katherine Dopler, director of communications at Anaheim Memorial Hospital, said  that hospital already has received state approval for a 20-bed skilled-nursing  facility scheduled to open April 24.  </P> <P> Similarly, Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center, previously La Habra  Community Hospital, is planning to convert about 36 of its acute care hospital  beds to skilled nursing beds.  </P> <P> Robert Hanna, the hospital's administrator, said architectural plans for the  skilled-nursing facility, which will be established in part of the existing  hospital, are under review by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and  Development. He said he hopes the facility will open in the late spring or  early summer.  </P> <P> John Gilwee, director of the Orange County office of the Hospital Council of  Southern California, said he welcomes the trend toward the creation of  hospital-based skilled nursing facilities. He said it gives hospitals a  potentially profitable opportunity for diversification while providing a needed  medical service. LESLIE BERKMAN  </P></p>

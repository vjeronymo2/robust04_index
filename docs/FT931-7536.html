			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Juvenile crime measures pledged MR JOHN Major yesterday promised new measures 'very shortly' to deal with juvenile crime, while emphasising that responsibility for addressing the problem 'spreads far beyond any government.' Challenged at prime minister's questions, Mr Major included the family, churches and schools among institutions with a duty to help stem the problem of persistent young offenders. Children who played truant were 'far more likely to be involved in juvenile crime,' he said. His remarks came after the form the new measures would take was discussed in cabinet. Officials said no conclusions were reached, however, due partly to differences over where the money to fund a new programme would come from.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The 34th session of the Presidential Defense and  National Security Council was held today under the chairmanship  of the Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic. The Council  discussed certain topical foreign and domestic policy issues, as  well as economic subjects.    The Council was informed about the meeting yesterday [5  January] between the Croatian and Bosnian delegations in Vienna  and about preparations for the meeting between Presidents  Tudjman and Izetbegovic scheduled for Saturday [8 January] in  Bonn.    It was assessed that Croatia's international position and  reputation were good -- moreover, owing to Croatia's very  constructive role in the resolution of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they were on the upswing.    Gratitude was expressed to the command of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] which, at President Tudjman's request, had  enabled [Zagreb Archbishop] Cardinal Kuharic and Croatian  bishops to reach Sarajevo, where they attended the ordaining of  the new auxiliary bishop of Sarajevo.    In connection with the publishing of certain classified  information by the press, the Council entrusted several state  bodies with the task of uncovering those responsible for  divulging state secrets.    The participants in the session reiterated the Croatian  leadership's stand on the consistent respect for legal  regulations and on personal responsibility for the committing of  crimes, but also warned that a person was innocent until proven  guilty. It was particularly stressed that certain acts  committed under wartime conditions should be viewed within the  general context of the aggression against Croatia, and the fact  that the war was being waged on Croatian soil where many Croats  had been killed and towns and villages razed. Therefore, care  should be taken that the reputation of the honorable  participants in the war must not be tarnished as a consequence  of irresponsible editorial practice and the actual misdeeds of  individuals subject to criminal prosecution, the announcement  issued by the Office of the President of the Republic says.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Anger over scale of pit closures: British Coal to shut down 31 mines - 30,000 jobs to go - Pounds 1bn aid package pledged BRITISH COAL announced sweeping cuts in its operations yesterday with the shutdown of 31 pits and the loss of 30,000 jobs. The closures, which will start this week and mark British Coal's first compulsory redundancies, will devastate large areas of the east Midlands and north-east England where unemployment is already high. The government immediately announced a Pounds 1bn package of redundancy payments and measures to help the affected areas. But the severity of the company's action, which will leave it with only 19 pits, set off a wave of protest and anger from trade unions and coal communities over what they claimed was the virtual destruction of the coal industry. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said the cuts, which include the mothballing of four collieries, were necessary 'in light of harsh conditions in the electricity market and the urgent need to bring supply and demand back into balance'. He said it was clear that the company's sales of coal to UK electricity generators, its main customers, would be sharply reduced next year to 40m tonnes from 65m tonnes this year. 'However much we dislike this - and we dislike this very strongly - it is a reality that we have to live with,' he said. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he knew the announcement would come 'as a severe shock to a great many miners and their families'. He went on: 'But British Coal cannot go on producing coal which cannot be sold. These decisions have been taken only after the most careful consideration. They are painful but they are essential to secure the industry's future and cannot be postponed.' He said the remaining coal industry 'will be well placed to achieve a profitable and sustainable future'. The government hopes to privatise British Coal next year. For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, the party's trade and industry spokesman, called on Mr Heseltine to intervene 'in the same way that the German government intervenes to help German industry'. He said taxpayers would pay 'millions more in redundancy' for miners to claim unemployment benefit instead of producing coal. As part of its aid package, the government will give assisted area status to Doncaster and Barnsley in South Yorkshire and Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. About Pounds 11m of European Community money will be available, with possibly more to come. Government agencies and British Coal Enterprise, its job creation arm, will also work to rehabilitate stricken communities. British Coal said the usual procedures for appealing against pit closure would be suspended, and Mr Clarke warned miners that protest action would result in lost redundancy entitlements. Union leaders greeted the announcement with dismay. Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, described it as an act of industrial vandalism and urged his members to take industrial action. Officials of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which broke away from the NUM in the 1984-85 strike, were even more stunned, having apparently won support for an employee buy-out plan from ministers. The union said it was considering an injunction against British Coal's abandonment of the review procedure and might invoke EC competition law. The UDM, which estimates the total cost of closure at Pounds 8bn, also called for a public inquiry into the future of the industry. Mr Peter McNestry, leader of the Nacods pit supervisors union, said direct job losses could be as high as 45,000 because of the number of private contractors working in pits. British Coal is negotiating new long-term supply contracts with the electricity generators which will be based for the first time on commercial rather than subsidised prices. Although this is forcing British Coal to shrink, it will also drive down the cost of power generation.

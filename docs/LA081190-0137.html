			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURFING SALT CREEK BEACH PRO-AM;  </P> <P> ROBINSON PATIENTLY WAITS FOR PERFECT WAVE, GETS PERFECT SCORES  </P> <P> With six years of experience on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour,  Ted Robinson knows when to wait for just the right wave.  </P> <P> And Friday at Salt Creek Beach, he waited . . . and waited . . . and waited.  </P> <P> But Robinson's chance finally came. He scored two perfect 10s and three 9.5s on  a three-foot wave with eight minutes left to hold on for a win in his  fourth-round heat at the Laguna Sportswear pro-am.  </P> <P> "I really had to take anything I could get and I was hoping for the best," said  Robinson, 26, of Manhattan Beach. "I had to grab what I could. It paid off to  be patient, I guess.  </P> <P> "I was behind at first and I knew I had to do something. It was a real treat to  get one that big."  </P> <P> Under most circumstances, a three-foot wave isn't considered big. But surfers  have struggled with one- and two-foot waves all week at Salt Creek.  </P> <P> "This is a real challenge," said Robinson, who has competed on 25- to 30-foot  waves in Hawaii. "It's so hard to stay in tune with the small waves."  </P> <P> Others in the heat weren't quite as fortunate. Robinson easily held off  second-place finisher Ryan Keenan of Huntington Beach, who also advanced to  today's first round of the main event. Dwayne Maki of Daytona, Fla., was third  and Christian Fletcher of San Clemente was fourth.  </P> <P> "These young guys come out here and have nothing to lose against me," Robinson  said. "Everyone's dogging each other out there. We're not nice to each other at  all, at least not in the water."  </P> <P> Robinson is ranked 32nd overall on the ASP world tour, with his best finish  being a ninth at Narrabeen, Australia, in April. He competes in Professional  Surfing Assn. of America events such as the one at Salt Creek during breaks on  the world tour.  </P> <P> "The best is yet to come," said Robinson, whose best finish on the PSAA tour is  a third at Imperial Beach in June. "I want to win one of these badly, and I  won't stop surfing them until I do."  </P> <P> He just has to be patient, though.  </P> <P> Dial a surfer: Oakland slugger Jose Canseco soon will have some competition on  the 900 toll telephone number market.  </P> <P> Robinson and two Manhattan Beach pals have set up a 900 telephone number for  fans who want to listen to top pro surfers on the ASP world tour.  </P> <P> "The kids can call in and punch in a code to pick the surfer they want to  listen to," Robinson said. "If they want to listen to Martin Potter talk about  floater (maneuvers), they'll dial one number. If they want to hear Derek Ho  talk about surfing Pipeline, they punch in another number."  </P> <P> Robinson will tape the interviews for the 1-900-PRO-SURF line, which begins  operation Aug. 20.  </P> <P> Several Orange County surfers were eliminated in Friday's fourth round,  including Mike deNicola of Mission Viejo, Laka Burgess of Huntington Beach,  Kasey Curtis of San Juan Capistrano, Joey Zintel of Huntington Beach, Scott  Desidero of El Toro, Christian Fletcher of San Clemente, Matt Coleman of Dana  Point, Kirk Tice of Huntington Beach, Darren Brilhart of Costa Mesa and Donavon  Frankenreither of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Chuy Reyna of Oceanside continues to be the hottest surfer in the trials,  winning his fourth consecutive heat Friday. Reyna edged Brock Little, one of  the top big-wave riders in Hawaii, in their heat.  </P> <P> Surfing Notes  </P> <P> Competition resumes at 7 a.m. today with the main event first round of the  surfing competition. The bodyboarding main event starts at 12:40 p.m., followed  by the second round of surfing at 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Those scheduled to compete in the surfing event include Colby Outlaw of  Huntington Beach, Pat O'Connell of Laguna Niguel, current points leader Charlie  Kuhn of Indian Harbor, Fla., three-time U.S. champion Mike Lambresi of  Oceanside, and Dino Andino, Shane Beschen and defending champion Jim Hogan, all  of San Clemente.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Members of the  delegation of old officials of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) headed by Paek Chong-won,  chairman of the Korean Physical Culture and Sports Federation,  and the 209th short-term home-visiting group of Korean residents  in Japan on a visit to the socialist homeland met comrade Yi  In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, at the People's Palace  of Culture on April 17.    Noting that he had fought, keeping his pledge to the party  and the leader and the motherland, Comrade Yi In-mo said "we  will certainly win if we have the revolutionary faith to uphold  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il."    The visitors said they would devote their all to the  national reunification and patriotic work of Chongnyon,  upholding the leadership of respected Generalissimo Kim Il-song  and dear Marshal Kim Chong-il with loyalty.    They hardened their indomitable will, singing in chorus "We  will win because you are leading us", a song of faith.    On the same day, the delegation of old officials of  Chongnyon  met anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters, veterans of the  fatherland liberation war and those who had rendered meritorious  services in the wartime.</p>

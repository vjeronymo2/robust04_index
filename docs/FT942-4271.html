			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pressure mounts for greater disclosure - Directors' share options are coming under increasing scrutiny Share options: like American GIs in Britain, they are overrated, over hyped and over here. They are also under increasing scrutiny thanks to a new set of guidelines circulated in May. Directors are being encouraged to provide far greater disclosure of the value of their share options than most companies now report, under draft proposals issued this month by the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board. At a time when the debate on executive pay in both the US and the UK is hotting up, Mr David Tweedie, ASB chairman, calls the guidelines a 'do-it-yourself kit' for investors wanting to place a value on options granted. Companies are being asked to show option information for all directors, and separately listed for individual directors, which would highlight the number of options granted, exercised, and lapsed unexercised. They should also reveal the exercise price and the prevailing share price of any options exercised during the financial year to which the accounts refer. Unusually for proposed 'abstract' produced by the urgent issues task force, the exposure draft on share options will not become mandatory, and cannot be enforced by the Financial Reporting Review Panel. The original aim, when board members began discussing the topic last year, was to make its recommendations compulsory. However, they were caught by a loophole in the law. The 1985 Companies Act calls for disclosure of emoluments payable to directors, including 'the estimated money value of any benefits . . . otherwise than in cash'. But the drafting of the law means that if the benefits cannot be precisely quantified, they do not have to be disclosed at all. The Accounting Standards Board discovered - as has its equivalent in the US, the Financial Accounting Standards Board - that there is considerable debate and uncertainty about the valuation of options. The board says that valuation would require theoretical, complex and subjective models contingent on future performance, requiring continued employment by directors. Lawyers say this level of uncertainty in developing a single definitive value means that options need not be disclosed at all. The board stresses that most of the details in its proposals must in any case be revealed by law for quoted companies in a register of options available for inspection. It adds that greater disclosure of executives' remuneration is urged by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance in its report published at the end of 1992. The principal additional recommendation from the task force is to bring all this information together in the annual report, together with details of the options' prices, which is not currently required. For most companies, the proposals will require extra space and effort, although some, including SmithKline Beecham, British Petroleum and Reuters Holdings, already provide quite extensive disclosure of the value of share options as part of the data on directors' remuneration. Mr Phillip Wood, deputy finance director at Reuters, says: 'We're trying to be a bit leading edge in our disclosure. We feel we have got nothing to hide, and because the company is protected from takeover, there is an additional burden on the board to demonstrate that we are well managed. This is one area where there is no commercial sensitivity.' Of course, what the task force's proposals do not raise is the desirability of share options in the first place. Mr Alan McDougall, joint managing director of Pensions Investment Research Consultants in the UK, which advises many local authority pension funds, says: 'Options are almost like money laundering. They are not exactly, but I can't think of a better name.' He advises his clients to vote against options because he says there is little evidence that they help improve company performance or motivate the best managers, and because they are generally only granted to senior executives rather than other employees who may be equally important in improving profitabil-ity. But at least investors of those companies that follow the guidelines will in future have the chance of assessing the value to the business and to them of the options granted to the board - and whether they should vote against them.</p>

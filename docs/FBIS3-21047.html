			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Paris--The Franco-German firm Eurocopter has decided  to revamp its Tiger program by expanding the number of combat  helicopter versions to five to meet German and British needs.    The Tiger will evolve into "an 80-percent standard  helicopter, to which different equipment will be added as  needed," said Eurocopter president Jean-Francois Bigay.  Industrialization of the helicopter is slated for early 1995,  following the recent signature of a government agreement between  France and Germany.    Initial designs called for two versions: an antitank  helicopter dubbed Tiger, and a battlefield version christened  Gerfaut. France plans to buy 140 Tigers and 75 Gerfauts, which  the army has just renamed Tiger. Budget difficulties and a new  strategic context have prompted Germany to cut back its need for  Tigers (which it calls UHUs) to 75 for the 1993-2003 period.  Germany will order a versatile antitank/battlefield version,  said Mr. Bigay.    In terms of exports, Eurocopter is counting on a British  order of 91 Tigers, on which London plans to announce its  decision in May of 1995. In addition, the joint venture firm has  just begun studying another versatile, cheaper Tiger version,  which it plans to export beginning in 1998, notably (it hopes)  to the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Amdahl cuts payout after heavy shortfall AMDAHL, the US mainframe computer manufacturer, reported heavy first-quarter losses, including charges associated with job cuts. Last week the company said it planned to reduce its 8,500 workforce by about 1,000. Yesterday, the company also announced it had cut its annual dividend from 10 cents a share to 5 cents. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 239.7m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, after a Dollars 243m pre-tax restructuring charge. In 1992, first-quarter income was Dollars 4.4m, or 4 cents. Revenues declined to Dollars 380.7m from Dollars 498m. The company said savings from cutbacks would be substantial and the streamlining of operations would enable it to eliminate some excess production capacity within the mainframe computer industry. This should stabilise prices and profit margins. Amdahl warned last month that first-quarter losses would be larger than analysts had expected and revenues would be below expectations. The company said soft economic conditions have produced erratic demand and intense competitive pressure on prices. The first quarter is also generally the weakest in the mainframe computer market. This one was unusually difficult because of announcements of new mainframe computers made in February by both Amdahl and IBM. Customers typically await such announcements before making purchase decisions. 'We remain committed to the IBM-compatible mainframe market,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive officer. 'But we also recognise that growth has slowed down as customers investigate smaller systems that appear to offer lower computing costs.' But he remained convinced that customers would ultimately recognise the need for mainframe computers.</p>

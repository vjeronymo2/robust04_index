			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (8): All trading together - Black Sea Economic Co-operation 'We've decided to drop the p for project and the z for zone,' said the Turkish foreign ministry official, trying to explain why there seemed to be a word missing from the title of the newly formed Black Sea Economic Co-operation. Agreeing a name will probably turn out to be one of the easier tasks, as officials try to jump-start this fledgling trading body of 325m consumers which Turkey initiated in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, more than a year after its fanfare inauguration, the world's youngest trading organisation is making steady, if slow, progress. It now boasts a secretariat housed in the grounds of the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. The building was originally used by the sultans to shelter during the earthquakes that periodically shake the city. Not an inappropriate choice of site, some might say. For the thrust of the BSEC may be economic and commercial, but as Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze once warned, the idea could be 'still-born' unless the region's various political disputes are resolved. 'It's an achievement every time they meet together,' says a western official in Ankara. At the first - and so far only - BSEC summit in June 1992, the real prize should have gone to the official who arranged the seating. After all, as many as seven of the 11 members were in open dispute with each other  -Romania and Moldova over the Dnieper; Ukraine and Russia at loggerheads over the future of the Black Sea Fleet; Russia and Georgia over Abkhazia and perhaps the biggest obstacle to regional peace the ongoing conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The idea, though, is a laudable one - to help boost trade ties between the region's market economies and the former Comecon bloc. As Mr Ercan Ozer of the Turkish foreign ministry puts it: 'The driving force, the locomotive, is to be the private sector. You shouldn't put a label on the BSEC. It is sui generis.' And what progress there has been is largely the result of the energy and vision of Turkey which is footing the bill, at a time when its own budget is under strain. The BSEC today comprises Turkey, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan with latecomers Albania and Greece. Officials say the club is open to new applicants. Poland has observer status and Belarus is considering a similar move. But joining is the easy part. Achieving concrete results is more difficult. Organisationally, the work load is split between an international secretariat representing national governments and a parliamentary assembly to agree the implementation of legislative changes needed to underpin trade relations. For Turkish officials, some of the teething problems should have been easier to predict than others. The parliamentary assembly, for example, was meant to comprise 70 members; however both Greece and Bulgaria currently choose not to participate. Finding the staff to run the secretariat has been bedevilled by other, more unusual, coincidences. As one official explains: 'We did in fact appoint a Russian in charge of financial affairs. But after recent events in Moscow, we have no idea of his fate.' The objective is to improve on the current negligible trade volumes within the region, and co-ordinate policy in such areas as telecommunications, energy and port and road infrastructure development. A separate agreement has been made by Black Sea states to address the environmental issues. The region's industries, within the communist bloc, were typically organised so as to be dependent on Moscow. Today they need to reforge those links. However, this time relations will be based on mutual agreement and benefit. The long-term hope is that these economies, while competing with each other, may find new areas of co-operation. Turkey's trade relations with the region have had a scatter-gun quality since the Soviet break-up, but the trend is improving. In the first half of 1993, imports from the former Soviet republics more than doubled to Dollars 1bn while exports increased 60 per cent over the same period in 1992 - Russia and Azerbaijan accounting for the largest share. Other areas have produced immediate dividends. In Romania, Turkey now has some 3,000 registered companies in Bucharest. Turkish beer is now being bottled in Romania. Coca-Cola's Turkish bottling operation is supplying the Romanian market. Turkish bakers are said to have a virtual monopoly of bread production in the Romanian capital. Groups such as Penta say counter-trade or barter is an indispensable part of a trader's armoury. To help oil the wheels, some Turkish businesses have sought out partnerships with international counter-trade firms. However, the markets are difficult. Interbank, a small privately owned Istanbul bank, joined up with the Finnish concern Kaukomarkkinat, hoping to take advantage of its partner's knowledge of trading with the Comecon countries. However, today their joint venture has been liquidated. And as Mr Melih Araz, the head of Interbank, says: 'When you get into a dispute on every shipment, why do it?' But Mr Ozer of the foreign ministry has a different perspective. 'You're not dealing here with Africa. Remember all these countries have some basic industry and an educated manpower.' In the short term BSEC officials believe the best they can hope to achieve is to address businessmen's day-to-day problems, such as visas, and legal questions such as protection of investment and the implementation of double taxation codes. Institutionally, there is an urgent need to compile a statistical base. About the only fact on which officials currently agree is that the BSEC's trade with the rest of the world is falling. Where governments can also play a part to further business activity is in such areas as telecommunications. A fibre optic sub-sea cable is to link Istanbul with Varna, Costanza and Moldova. Turkey's Eximbank is expected to provide financial support. Already officials claim that 40 per cent of the cable traffic has been pre-sold. Separately, agreement has been reached for a Dollars 60m cable, running from Russia and the Ukraine through the Black Sea and eventually to Italy. The idea has even been mooted to extend the cable to Israel, to facilitate contacts between Israel and Jewish immigrants still in Russia. Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey have a fibre optic and radio telephone link. The launch of Turkey's Turksat satellite next January will allow further collaborations. In the transport sector too, the BSEC is considering a Greek suggestion to create a corridor connecting all the littoral cities of the Black Sea. Officials say Greece is keen to use its experience in port construction. Romania has also proposed a scheme to upgrade Turkey's Samsun harbour so that freight arriving in the Black Sea via the Danube could be loaded onto trains to reach the Mediterranean across Turkey rather than add to congestion in the Bosporus. Next month, the organisation faces perhaps its biggest test when foreign ministers of the 11 member states meet in Sofia to finalise the launch of a trade and development bank. According a draft of the memorandum to be agreed, the bank is being set up to 'finance and promote regional projects . and to assist in encouraging intra-regional trade especially in capital goods.' All member countries have agreed their contributions to the bank's capital structure, although this is not to say they have yet committed the funds. The main sticking point is likely to be the site. Istanbul, Sofia, Bucharest, Costanza and Thessalonika are all bidding to host the bank headquarters.</p>

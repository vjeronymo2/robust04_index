			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Heitmann aims to close a door on the past CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's controversial conservative candidate for the German state presidency, Mr Steffen Heitmann, is a passionate believer that Germany's 'special role' in the post-war world is finished. 'I believe the post-war era has come to an end,' he told the parliamentary caucus of his Christian Democratic Union on Tuesday night. 'Germany had a disastrous special role forced upon it after 1945. As far as I am concerned, that time is past.' Quite what he means by the phrase is unclear. Mr Heitmann won resounding applause from his party colleagues in the Bundestag. Yet it arouses deep foreboding in the world at large. Chancellor Kohl and a clear majority of his CDU have closed ranks behind Mr Heitmann, hitherto a rather retiring justice minister in Saxony, to insist that he is the right man to take over the German presidency from Mr Richard von Weizsacker, who steps down next year. Representatives of both the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, nominated him last night. At an extraordinary meeting of the parliamentary group this week, his supporters booed and whistled at the respected president of the Bundestag, Mrs Rita Sussmuth, when she questioned his conservative views on the role of women in German society. It was clear that the widespread criticism of the chancellor's choice, in the German media, from the opposition Social Democrats, and from the minority Free Democratic party in the ruling coalition, has caused the party to dig in for the defence. Yet what is most remarkable about Mr Heitmann is his very unremarkableness. As he says himself about his own role in East Germany before the revolution: 'I was never much of a hero.' He is rather quiet, rather grey, and rather insecure. This was his biggest public appearance so far. Most of his political views are unexceptionable, well within the mainstream of good Christian Democratic thinking in Germany. But he lacks the sophistication of a western politician to present it for public consumption. Mr Heitmann had a tough childhood growing up in the ruins of Dresden after the war. His father died in a Russian camp in 1945. His mother died of TB when he was 12. He clearly feels very strongly on issues like abortion. He has linked the debate on liberalising abortion to the rise in youthful violence against foreigners. The latter, he believes, is largely a reflection of broken families and unloving parents. Those who would ease the abortion laws in Germany reflect the same lack of love. The election for the next state president is not until May. But all the main political parties are now locked in to the struggle with party political candidates. Mr Heitmann seems determined to stay the course.</p>

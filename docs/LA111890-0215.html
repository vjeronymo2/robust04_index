			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSOURI RECEIVER HAULS IN THE RECORDS  </P> <P> Missouri wide receiver Linzy Collins had a record-breaking performance Saturday  during the Tigers' 31-21 victory over Kansas in a Big Eight Conference game at  Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> Collins, a senior, caught nine passes for a conference-record 229 yards and two  touchdowns and also set several school records as Missouri finished 4-7 overall  and 2-5 in the Big Eight. Kansas finished 3-6-1 and 2-4-1.  </P> <P> Collins set a Missouri season record with 56 catches, breaking the mark of 49  set by Herbert Johnson in 1985. Collins' 229 yards erased the one-game school  mark of 193 he set last year against Kansas, and broke the Big Eight standard  of 222.  </P> <P> Collins, who last week became Missouri's career receiving leader, teamed with  freshman quarterback Phil Johnson to score on pass plays of 50 and 10 yards. He  also set up two other scores with gains of 71 and 49 yards.  </P> <P> His 71-yarder preceded Ronnell Kayhill's seven-yard touchdown run on the next  play and gave the Tigers a 24-7 lead with 13:48 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> There was confusion among the game statisticians over whether to count Collins'  last pass, which went for a two-yard loss. The catch was originally not counted  because of a penalty on the play. But several hours later, media outlets were  advised that the catch and the minus-two yards would count.  </P> <P> The change shaved two yards off Collins' totals but gave him complete  possession of the school mark for career receptions with 102.  </P> <P> His Missouri career record stands at 1,760 yards, erasing the mark of 1,491  held by Mel Gray.  </P> <P> His season total of 957 yards also is a Missouri record.  </P> <P> Oklahoma State 25, Iowa State 17 -- Gerald Hudson rushed for a career-high 264  yards and Cary Blanchard kicked a career-best four field goals to lead the  Cowboys (4-7, 2-5) over the Cyclones (4-6-1, 2-4-1) in a Big Eight finale at  Ames, Iowa.  </P> <P> Hudson, a senior, carried 27 times and scored on touchdown runs of 18 yards and  one yard in improving upon his previous best of 255 yards against Missouri  three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Blanchard kicked field goals of 24, 23, 39, and 34 yards.  </P> <P> Hudson broke a 58-yard run to the Iowa State nine on the Cowboys' third play of  the game. That set up Blanchard's 24-yard field goal and the Cowboys never  trailed.  </P></p>

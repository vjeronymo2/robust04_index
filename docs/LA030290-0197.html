			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DERBY HOPEFULS HARD TO PEG THUS FAR  </P> <P> The yellow brick road to Louisville looks like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway  with a lane closed. Intriguing 3-year-olds, it seems, are everywhere; there is  great congestion and a smattering of anxiety but little forward motion. No  horns blare but the sound of guessing and second-guessing is beginning to  build.  </P> <P> With traffic stalled and only nine Saturdays left before the Kentucky Derby,  the rumor mill is agush.  </P> <P> Summer Squall, who will be absent from the Fountain of Youth Stakes on Saturday  at Gulfstream Park, either bled mildly in a recent workout or gushed like a  sieve, depending upon whom you speak to. Similarly, Summer Squall, who was  undefeated in five races at 2, is either completely sound after knee surgery or  training more tenderly every day.  </P> <P> The only thing that seemed certain on the eve of the Eastern season's first  graded two-turn stakes for 3-year-olds was that it will be some time before  anything is certain. Undefeated Champagneforashley has yet to enter the picture  and undefeated Mister Frisky must be watched in the California preps. With  luck, the traffic will begin to break up soon, perhaps Saturday.  </P> <P> Thirteen were entered for the 1 1/16-mile Fountain of Youth, four of them major  Triple Crown figures. Another important ingredient in this melange, Red Ransom,  is entered at Gulfstream for the second consecutive Saturday and will make his  long-awaited 3-year-old debut in a seven-furlong allowance race. Well, maybe.  It might rain.  </P> <P> Red Ransom was scratched from an allowance race against older horses Saturday  when trainer Mack Miller decided his final pre-race work had been too fast to  allow complete recovery. The colt, sensational in his two races last season,  worked a much more conservative 48 1/5 half-mile under a heavy exercise rider  Thursday and is one of 13 late nominees to the Grade I Florida Derby in two  weeks, a race not in the conservative Miller's original plan.  </P> <P> Slavic, who won a 1 1/16-mile allowance race in a solid season's debut, is the  favorite to win the Fountain of Youth over a field that includes 1989  2-year-old champion Rhythm, Remsen champion Yonder and Young America winner  Roanoke, who will make his first start of the year. It is a race that mirrors  the division, since it would be no surprise if any of these colts won the  Fountain of Youth and only mildly surprising if none of them won.  </P> <P> Late-running Yonder comes off a big move into a slow last quarter, finishing  second in the seven-furlong Hutcheson. Trainer Woody Stephens expects a repeat  performance, but frets over the pace. "He won't get any better," Stephens said.  "He was dead fit for the Hutcheson, fittest horse in the field. But he needs a  fast pace."  </P> <P> Rhythm was a disappointing seventh in the Hutcheson but has since worked well.  Trainer Shug McGaughey will likely learn much about the colt's Derby prospects  Saturday. Roanoke, a huge, rangy colt, will probably need a race or two before  coming into form. And Slavic, whom trainer Scotty Schulhofer said is "as good a  3-year-old as I've ever been around," may be a step or two away from his best  form.  </P></p>

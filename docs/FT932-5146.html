			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / MoD halts work on Tornado F3s A PRIVATE company caused damage thought to be worth millions of pounds to RAF Tornado fighters which it was contracted to work on, it emerged yesterday. The Ministry of Defence said it cancelled the contract with the company, Airwork, last week after the RAF discovered damage of 'a very serious nature' to a number of its Tornado F3s. It was still assessing the extent of the problem, believed to be in the main fuselage sections. But it had already concluded that 'the damage would in certain cases reduce the safe life of the aircraft'. The ministry said it would 'certainly seek redress' from Airwork, which is one of the RAF's principal contractors for aircraft maintenance. Remedial work would be needed to allow the Tornados to fly safely, the ministry added. Airwork, based in Bournemouth, Dorset, was carrying out structural modifications on the fighters at the RAF's St Athan base in South Wales. Neither the ministry nor the company would say how many aircraft were affected. But Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said he had been told 16 out of 18 aircraft involved in the contract were damaged and 12 were grounded. He called for an inquiry and said all future maintenance should be handed back to the RAF. 'This is part of the government's market-testing mania which this time seems to have gone hopelessly wrong,' he said, adding that he would write to the comptroller and auditor-general 'because the costs involved in this affair should be made public'. Airwork, which in the last financial year undertook 49 ministry contracts, said it was 'disappointed' by the cancellation decision, and said it had 'a long and successful history of supplying services to the RAF'. It added: 'As in the case of any potential dispute, the company is not at liberty to discuss the matter.' The F3 is the air defence variant of the Tornado bomber, introduced in 1986. The RAF has about 100 in operational service, with about 60 more in reserve. The ministry said the incident would not affect the RAF's defence capability. Six of the aircraft are involved in enforcing the no-fly zone in Bosnia. The UK is discussing a deal for Italy to hire some of the RAF's spare F3s as interim replacements for its Starfighters. Mr Wyn Bevan, south Wales district officer of the electricians' section of the AEEU engineering union, said a bid by skilled civilian staff at RAF St Athan for the F3 work had been ignored by the ministry.</p>

Without  putting the results of last December's constitutional vote in  doubt, Mr. Isakov still maintained that the contradictions  inherent in the new constitutions will require amendments in the  near future. Mr. Isakov told RIA, in particular, that the  Constitution does not remove many contradictions between the  executive and legislative authorities in Russia.    At the same time, Mr. Isakov's interview implies that the  former fervent proponents of the "Soviet" draft of the  Constitution as opposed to Mr. Yeltsin's version have drawn  lessons from last year's political developments and are not  going to fan passions around the constitutional issue. Mr.  Isakov said that the effort to elaborate cardinally new drafts  of the Constitution will take place in the framework of public  initiatives, but in no way in the Duma.</p>

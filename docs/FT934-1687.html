			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Crest not more costly for private investor Sir, Mr J D Whittle thinks (Letters, December 11/12) that it is generally accepted that the Crest share settlement system will disadvantage the private investor while increasing his costs of dealing. I do not think either point of this view is well-founded. Crest will improve conditions for the private investor, by helping to facilitate a more efficient and liquid wholesale market, and by bringing settlement conditions in the UK into line with the best international practice. Costs will be sharply reduced by getting rid of much of the very large volumes of paper that have to be processed in the City and at registrars, and there will be significant reductions in risk in the settlement process. These benefits improve the attractiveness of London as a financial centre, and the private investor will benefit from this because his shares will be traded on a more liquid and efficiently priced market. Moreover, I believe that when Crest is introduced the cost of dealings for the private investor need be no more than today, even where the private investor chooses to retain share certificates. (The cost will, of course, be lower if he chooses to participate fully in Crest by giving up his certificate.) This is because the 'wholesale' part of the transaction, between the investor's broker and a market maker, should be cheaper than today, while the paper-based part should remain very much like today's arrangements.

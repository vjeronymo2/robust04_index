			<p>BFN     [Text] Yoram Lizovsky, chairman of the Israel Manufacturers  Association, has divulged that PLO political elements are  demanding that foreign companies wanting to maintain business  relations with the Palestinians refrain from cooperating with  Israel. Mr. Lizovsky also was disappointed and concerned about  the decision of PLO political elements not to involve Israeli  companies in investments in the autonomous area. Our  correspondent Yafa Glick reports that Mr. Lizovsky, addressing  the Ra'ananna Economic Club, noted that the only benefit that  the Israeli economy is reaping from the political process is an  increase in the number of foreign economic delegations coming to  Israel.</p>

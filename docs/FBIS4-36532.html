			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that today's  stabbing in Jerusalem was not connected to the political changes  happening in the region but was part of the ongoing war against  murderous organizations which sought to kill Jews. These  organizations tried to murder Jews in the past, are continuing  to do so, and will pursue their attempts in the future, the  prime minister told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal upon leaving a  meeting of the Labor party bureau. Mr. Rabin nevertheless  pointed out that in recent weeks, the number of terrorist  attacks had dropped to a certain extent.    The prime minister said that Jordan was demonstrating a  readiness to reach a peace treaty with Israel and this was  greatly facilitating the negotiations between the two countries.  The very discussion of the elements of a peace treaty was  important in itself, Rabin said, and one should hope that within  the framework of these efforts, steps would be taken to  strengthen normalization between the two countries -- for  example, with regard to free movement and the Elat-Egypt highway.    As for the negotiations with Syria, the prime minister said  that the gaps between the parties' positions were still large  and he did not expect a breakthrough or what he described as a  miracle.</p>

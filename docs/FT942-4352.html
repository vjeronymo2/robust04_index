			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Call for independent Bank The incoming deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Stanley Fischer, has called for the Bank of England to be given independence. In a paper prepared for the Bank's tercentenary, Mr Fischer concludes: 'On her 300th birthday, it is time for the Old Lady to be allowed to take on the responsibilities of independence.' Last month it was announced that Mr Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would replace Mr Richard Erb as the IMF's deputy managing director. In a long paper, Mr Fischer points to empirical studies which have shown that countries with independent central banks have been more successful at controlling inflation. 'The relationship between inflation and central bank independence is attributable mainly to the central bank's ability to use its policy instruments freely and to the presence of a price-stability goal.' Mr Fischer suggests that the Bank's mandate should be to achieve price stability 'by which is meant a low (1 per cent to 3 per cent) average rate of inflation'. Qualifications to the mandate should be included to allow the Bank to take account of the short-term trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The Bank governor should be made responsible for meeting the targets and should testify in public twice a year to a House of Commons committee. Mr Fischer argues that the government should have the right to overrule the Bank, but only by a public directive, along the lines of the Canadian system. However, such a public move might lead to the governor's resignation. Proposals to make the Bank independent have been backed by former chancellors Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank, has argued that granting independence to it would be the most likely way of achieving long-term sustainable growth with low inflation, but this could only happen if there was a public consensus on the need for independence.</p>

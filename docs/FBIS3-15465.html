			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, new head of Russian </F> Counterintelligence Service, by unidentified correspondent,  place and date not given -- from the "Novosti" newscast;  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] It is said that either your service  will be completely abolished, or you will be forced to surrender  some of your very important units to, say, the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations.    [Stepashin] I will not take part in that, that's clear, and  I'll tell you straight that the special services will not go  through another such perestroyka or katastroyka [pun on  katastrofa, catastrophe]. I would like to stress once again --  this is very important for those who hear me, for our colleagues  -- there will be no such perestroykas. But clearly, we should  try and prove our importance and constantly say that we're  necessary and important, not only and perhaps not so much by  public statements, but by concrete actions and putting things  into effect. I think you'll hear about many of them in March.    [Correspondent] Last week there was a meeting of the  Security  Council, and by all accounts you were given certain specific  instructions for fighting corruption at the top levels of power.  Could you reveal more specifically what kind of instructions  these are, and is corruption really so strong that it has to be  fought?    [Stepashin] It's always necessary to fight it. Specific  instructions were indeed given there for the organs of  counterintelligence to wage a determined fight not only against  corruption at the top levels of state power, which you asked  about, but also against banditry. By the way, we already have a  number of very serious things projected and implemented in these  terms, especially for St. Petersburg.    [Correspondent] In this regard, how will you cooperate with  Primakov's department?    [Stepashin] Just as before. By the way, we have a very good  level of cooperation, especially in terms of intelligence from  the territories. We are developing a general strategy. I would  draw your attention to some of the things we have done recently.  We have agreed to hold a joint meeting this month with Boris  Nikolayevich -- that is, our service, the intelligence service,  the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff,  Starovoytov of the Federal Agency of Government Communications  and Information, and the border troops -- in order to reach  agreement on closer cooperation, together with the national  security adviser, and to create, if you like, a kind of  prototype intelligence community.</p>

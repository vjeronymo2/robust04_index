			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S DEPT. OFFERS SAFETY ADVICE FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS  </P> <P> Southeast area law enforcement officials have several tips for Halloween  participants.  </P> <P> As alternatives to traditional trick-or-treating, the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department advises parents to take their children to parties at a  neighbor's home or in local parks.  </P> <P> But for those parents who want their children to gather candy door to door, the  department offered several suggestions. Parents should make sure their children  start off while there is still light and cross only at corners.  </P> <P> Parents should also dress children in light colors or reflective tape and check  that the costumes are short enough to avoid being stepped on or getting caught,  according to the Sheriff's Department. And children wearing masks should  maintain clear vision.  </P> <P> Children should carry a flashlight to make them easily identifiable on the  streets, and parents or adults should accompany them at night, according to  deputies.  </P> <P> Lt. Ray Baytos of the Pico Rivera sheriff's station added that parents should  supervise what kinds of treats their children pick up. Deputies "always tell  kids to ask for candy that's been wrapped commercially and (avoid) homemade  popcorn balls," Baytos said.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Police Department suggested that children use makeup instead of  a mask and wait until they get home before eating treats.  </P></p>

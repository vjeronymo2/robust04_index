			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a statement by the Croatian Foreign  Ministry, the Croatian Government welcomed the resolute NATO  action against the military positions of the Bosnian Serbs  around the besieged Muslim enclave, that is, the protected area  of Gorazde.    The Croatian Government believes that the air strikes  against  the Serb military positions around Gorazde are a legitimate and  justified action in support of the implementation of UNPROFOR's  [UN Protection Force] mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  statement stresses the fact that the action followed a blatant  violation by Serbs of all UN Security Council resolutions and  statements on the protection of Gorazde, and was in keeping with  a plan of action jointly elaborated by the United Nations and  NATO.    Besides the immediate effect of stopping Serb advances on  central Gorazde, and averting danger to the town and tens of  thousands of civilians and refugees, the NATO action undoubtedly  has a symbolic significance. The NATO air strikes carried out  by U.S. fighter-jets shows that, despite the complexity of  international coordination mechanisms, it is possible to reach  an effective consent at short notice, and that the international  community has enough legitimately adopted documents, measures  and responses to counter violators of international norms.    The Croatian Government therefore considers the Gorazde  action to be the last warning of the international community and  a call to certain forces among the Serbian people to stop  military activities, blatant violations of international norms  and agreements, and to join serious negotiations, in order to  find a solution acceptable to all sides and to restore peace,  stability, and security in this part of Europe.</p>

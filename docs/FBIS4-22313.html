			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov, Kazan, under rubric </F> "Consequences": "The Election Has Occurred in Tataria: But the  Nationalists Intend To `Start Everything From the Beginning'"]    [Text] All things considered, the re-election to the RF  [Russian Federation] Federal Assembly that was held in Tataria  on 13 March will have serious political consequences, and  primarily for the Republic itself. The election that was held a  month ago after the signing of a bilateral treaty had heated up  the political passions, primarily in the Tatar  national-patriotic movement. The nationalists felt that they had  been betrayed once again: what appears to be insulting to them  is the very fact that the president and the chairman of the  Supreme Council of the "independent state of Tatarstan" will  occupy deputy seats in the Upper House of the parliament of a  "neighboring state," and they feel that it is doubly offensive  that they received their mandates as deputies during the days of  the holy month of Ramadan.    Local author Zulfat Khakim, in an open letter to President  Shaymiyev that was published in SUVERENITET [Sovereignty]  newspaper -- which is published by the radical committee of the  same name -- wrote, "In the freedom-starved soul of the nation  and in the history of our nation, you will be marked by black  letters, and your descendants will say your name alongside of  the name of Shah Ali (Ed. note: who surrendered Kazan to Ivan  the Terrible) and other traitors of the Tatar nation..."    An associate of Khakim, Milli Medzhlis Chairman  Fauziya Bayramova, in a telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov,  chairman of the RF Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral  Commission], and signed by representatives of five local  nationalist organizations, remarked, "The unconstitutional  election... has led to a state of civil war in Tatarstan." At a  press conference Ms. Bayramova explained that by civil war she  meant first of all the aggravation of the age-old conflict  between the nomenklatura and the people: "But  nevertheless there will be war. Society has already split up."    The nationalists say that, during the preparation and the  holding of the election, they recorded numerous instances of  violations. In the telegram addressed to Nikolay Ryabov it is  stated that "in the course of the election campaign, the  national bloc was completely deprived of the opportunity to  carry out agitation; picketers were beaten up in Naberezhnyye  Chelny; picketers were chased away in Kazan; rallies, meetings,  and the preparation of agitation material were banned... The  voters in the cities were threatened with nonpayment of their  wages and with layoffs, and those in the villages were  threatened with a refusal to be given any help in carrying out  the springtime field operations. The most rigid censorship was  established in the mass media." The bloc of national movements  of the Tatar nation has called upon the international public to  investigate the "legality of the scheduling of the election by  RF authorities on the territory of Tatarstan, as well as the  antidemocratic conditions in which the election was held."    All these facts, in the nationalists' opinion, indicate that  official Kazan "wants to gain favor with Moscow" as a sign of  gratitude for the treaty that was signed in February between  Russia and Tataria. In the opinion of Ildus Amirkhanov,  president of the All-Tatar Public Center (VTOTs), they also mean  that "sovereignty has been trampled upon, and it is necessary to  raise the struggle for the independence of Tatarstan, to begin  everything from the beginning..."    The activization of national-patriotic forces in Tataria is  occurring against a background of their unification. The same  Ms. Bayramova, who calls herself a "national-democrat," is  actively seeking points of contact with the local democrats,  after apparently recalling the bygone times when most of the  current political leaders existed under the aegis of the one and  only opposition organization -- the People's Front of Tatarstan.  The split into nationalists and into democrats proper occurred  on the basis of the attitude toward the republic's sovereignty.  In the opinion of Ms. Bayramova, the unification of all the  oppositional forces is necessary so that "the scenario that was  tested on 13 March does not get used in the forthcoming election  to the People's Assembly of Tatarstan: if we lose this election  also, then it will be necessary to say goodbye to democracy."    Currently the national-patriots are preparing documents  concerning the violations in the course of the election, for the  purpose of sending them to the court and to RF Tsentrizbirkom.  Also engaged in this activity are the candidates for Moscow  Electoral District No. 24 -- Yuriy Voronin, former first deputy  chairman of the RF VS [Supreme Soviet], and political expert  Vladimir Belyayev: on the basis of documentally confirmed data  concerning violations, they consider the election of Oleg  Morozov, former assistant first secretary of a CPSU oblast  committee, as a deputy to the State Duma as never having  occurred. In their opinion, the election in Tataria can be  considered to have occurred, but it cannot be recognized as  being completed.</p>

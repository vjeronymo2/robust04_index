			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt still undecided on Lome regime Nearly three years after the entry into force of the fourth Lome Convention between the European Union and almost 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has still not decided whether the pact is consistent with international fair trade rules, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. A Gatt working party set up last year to examine Lome IV has been unable even to agree to disagree on the issue. The EU and ACP nations are refusing to brook any hint of criticism in the report, fearing that this could lead to a direct challenge to Lome under Gatt's disputes settlement system.</p>

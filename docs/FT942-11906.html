			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Major rebukes Portillo over single currency Mr John Major yesterday rebuked Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, as cabinet tensions over Europe and the party leadership left the government in visible disarray on the eve of tomorrow's local elections. Facing a fierce opposition attack in the House of Commons, the prime minister denied the cabinet was split over whether Britain should participate in a single currency during the next stage of European integration. His response coincided with calls from a procession of senior ministers led by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for the party to end its factional infighting. The ministers sought to dismiss a call from a senior backbench MP, Mr David Evans, for large-scale cabinet sackings and the appointment of a new party chairman to replace Sir Norman Fowler. But the damage-limitation exercise did little to dispel the speculation among Tory MPs that heavy defeats tomorrow and in the European elections on June 9 would seriously imperil Mr Major's leadership. Amid alarm among party managers about the threat of an electoral catastrophe, Mr Portillo said he had not broken cabinet ranks in voicing opposition to a single currency. He told a Westminster press conference that he fully backed the government's stance that it would decide whether sterling should be subsumed by a single currency only if and when the occasion arose. Remarks he made at the weekend had been misreported, he said. Turning to the leadership, Mr Portillo, the emerging candidate of the right in any possible contest, insisted he did not expect a challenge to Mr Major. He was not encouraging friends to campaign on his behalf. But party insiders did little to disguise Mr Major's anger at the way Mr Portillo had reopened the European debate in the last critical days of the local elections campaign. Officials said the chief secretary had issued his clarifying statement on the direct instruction of the prime minister's office. Mr Major's personal irritation was visible when he told MPs that Mr Portillo had 'made clear this morning that he fully supports our policy on a single currency, a policy agreed by the whole cabinet of which he is a member'. Mr Clarke also distanced himself from his deputy at the Treasury. But ministers on the Euro-sceptic wing of the party backed the chief secretary. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary and another prominent cabinet sceptic, was among those said to be angered at the suggestion that senior ministers were not allowed to voice their opinions. In the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat deputy, ridiculed the prime minister for failing to assert his authority.

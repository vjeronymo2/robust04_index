			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MASTER'S LOSES BUT HELP SITS CLOSE AT HAND  </P> <P> The Master's had a lot of talent sitting on the bench Thursday night.  Unfortunately, the Mustangs weren't able to use it.  </P> <P> Master's suffered a 75-51 nonconference loss to visiting Cal State Bakersfield  as freshmen Melvin Adams and David Humphreys and sophomore Damon Greer could  only provide vocal support. The trio -- all guards -- won't be eligible until  Monday.  </P> <P> "We really missed them out there tonight," said Master's Coach Mel Hankinson,  whose team was playing its fourth game in seven days -- two of which they have  won.  </P> <P> "We were tired and exhausted. We needed them to give us a shot in the arm."  </P> <P> Or maybe a shot at the basket.  </P> <P> Trailing, 58-48, with 5:30 remaining, Master's (7-5) went scoreless for the  next four and a half minutes. In the same time span, Bakersfield (5-1) scored  12 points before Jeff Newton hit a three-point basket with a minute to play.  </P> <P> The Master's trailed, 33-23, at the half, but the Roadrunners quickly built a  14-point lead as 6-foot-4 center Marvin Redeemer scored Bakersfield's first 11  points.  </P> <P> The Mustangs got within eight points twice but could get no closer.  </P> <P> Redeemer finished with a game-high 22 points.  </P> <P> Larry Lopez and Newton finished with 11 and 10 points for The Master's.  </P></p>

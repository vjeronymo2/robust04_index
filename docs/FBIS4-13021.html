			<p>BFN     [Text] The meetings of the subcommittee charged with  studying ways of sending relief aid to those in need in the  south under the supervision of the Intergovernmental Authority  on Drought and Development [IGADD] Mediation Committee were  suspended in Nairobi yesterday afternoon until 3 May.    The participants, who included the Sudanese Government  delegation and that of the rebel movement, as well as the  representatives of the four mediating IGADD states and the  official in charge of Operation Lifeline Sudan, suspended the  meetings after the delegation of Garang's faction refused to  sign the draft agreement in its final form, having expressed  some reservations. The participants in the meetings had  concentrated on discussing various views on the ways by which  relief aid could be dispatched to a number of areas, protecting  and supervising the routes to be taken in sending the aid and  vaccinating children in the south against infectious diseases.    A diplomatic source stated that the Sudanese Government  delegation had shown great understanding during the negotiations  on cooperating with the mediating team on most of the proposals  put forward by the latter. The government delegation made it  clear right from the beginning that it had no objection  whatsoever to any citizen in the south being given food,  irrespective of his orientation.</p>

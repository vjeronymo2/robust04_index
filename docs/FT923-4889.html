			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Doubts thrown over Yeltsin visit to Japan PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's security service, in an extraordinary leak to the press, suggested yesterday that his visit to Japan might not take place because Tokyo was unable to fully guarantee the Russian leader's safety from terrorist attack, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Against a background of fierce diplomatic posturing over the territorial issue which is dominating the Russo-Japanese agenda, it was not clear whether the leak was sanctioned at a high level to prepare for a cancellation of the visit. It could be a crude attempt to embarrass the Japanese for insisting that Russia must return the South Kurile islands before economic assistance is available. Alternatively it may be a fit of pique by the security forces, who complained the Japanese were forbidding them from bringing firearms into the country.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Where the price is right - Salerooms in London and Berlin YOU HAVE to admire art dealers, especially those who trade in 20th century British art. Sales in the past two years have been as rare as pandas yet most have survived. Among the more unfortunate casualties has been the Odette Gilbert gallery of Cork Street and some of her stock is being liquidated at Christie's next month. If you want an atmospheric Carel Weight for around Pounds 7,500 (less than its price at the 1990 Royal Academy Summer Show); or a strident John Bellany; or a lesser Freud, Auerbach, or Bomberg, try the sales on June 5 and 12. You could pick up a bargain. It is ironic that a major gallery should go under just as there are signs that the market in 20th century British art is picking up. Two sales in London this month - a second division auction at Christie's and a sale of important pictures at Sotheby's - have been encouraging. Very few dealers can afford to buy more stock, but that makes the pickings better for private collectors. Sotheby's was lucky it had five top rank pictures from the collection of the late Lord Walston. So confident was it of the quality, and so keen to secure the group from the competition of Christie's, that it was tempted to offer the executors a guaranteed sum. In the end it trusted the market and secured auction records of Pounds 198,000 for a work by Edward Burra and Pounds 170,500 for a LS Lowry. The two Lowrys, and two Stanley Spencers, might have made more in 1989 but compared with a decade ago these are extraordinary prices. Of course some modern British pictures were over-inflated and now fetch up to 50 per cent less than their 1989 prices. But at least they are selling. Harold Harvey is one of the sufferers, but ' A Summer Morning' went for Pounds 16,000 last week: three years ago it might have edged Pounds 30,000; but a year ago, unsaleable. An excellent example of the state of the market was provided by an early Munnings, 'In the shade'. A year ago Sotheby's offered it with an estimate of Pounds 60,000-Pounds 80,000 and it was unsold. This time its estimate was Pounds 40,000-Pounds 60,000 and it went for Pounds 57,500. Another Munnings, sent for sale by a distressed Lloyds 'Name', a group of potential sellers that Sotheby's is successfully pinpointing, made Pounds 36,300, above its estimate. But Munnings has always been popular. Philip Connard, bought by collectors who could not quite afford a Laura Knight, offers an example of the fate of middling quality early 20th century British art. His 'Windswept' was unsold last year at Pounds 14,000 and found a buyer last week at Pounds 7,700. By keeping the estimates low - down 20 per cent on average on 1990 - Sotheby's managed a total of approaching Pounds 2.5m with less than 10 per cent unsold, encouraging the market. At Christie's the task was harder - finding buyers for less exceptional works. In the event its sale made around Pounds 250,000 and was roughly three quarters sold. Certain artists, Mary Fedden, Carel Weight, Dorothea Sharp, are out of favour, but others, Augustus John, Edward Seago, Ken Howard, and Russell-Flint, have ridden the recession well. Christie's confidently expects a record for a painting by Robert Bevan, 'Horse dealers at the Barbican' which it is offering, with a Pounds 70,000-Pounds 90,000 estimate, on June 5. Its auction of post war and contemporary art six days later may have more difficulties. This tougher, more challenging, art has restricted appeal. The UK is acknowledged to have produced some of the finest sculptors of the past 50 years and there are good examples of the work of Elisabeth Frink, Michael Ayrton, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Lynn Chadwick, and more, carrying reasonable estimates. With the fall in the market apparently over, frustrated sellers may well be offering more, and better, things on to the market in the autumn. But anyone who has regained their confidence about the financial future could find this summer an excellent time to buy art. What more potent symbol of capitalism than an art auction? In Germany, reunification and new east German interest in sales is making ripples in the market which could soon become a splash. Sotheby's, on Unter den Linden since 1990, is bullish about its modern German art sale next weekend. Villa Grisebach, the big Berlin house, drew crowds previewing its major spring sale (May 29 and 30) in Dresden last week. 'Nowadays, people go crazy if the Brandenburg Gate is in a picture,' says Grisebach's Michaela Kapitzky; good news for the Expressionist renderings of Berlin by Lesser Ury, the Jewish recluse from Silesia, in her sale at around DM160,000. The kernel of the German market, the expressionists, Nolde, Beckmann, Kokoshka, Kirchner, have always been bought by collectors, not speculators, and so escaped the recent rise and crash of, say, French Impressionists. Prices increase steadily at 8 to 10 per cent a year; the powerhouse is German - 70 per cent of Grisebach's buyers, 90 per cent of Sotheby's, in this sector. Emigre art traditionally went to private Swiss or American collections, whence come most of next week's plums. Otto Dix's portrait of Dresden businessman Max Roesberg (Sotheby's, estimate DM350,000 to DM400,000), and Beckmann's Neuhaus (Grisebach, estimate DM1.9m to DM2.4m - the price may beat Germany's DM2.6m expressionist record) are both emigre American pictures, almost certain to be bought back into Germany. Nolde's exotic 'Girl and Lilies' (Grisebach, estimate DM700,000 to DM900,000) and Beckmann's Sea View (Grisebach, estimate DM500,000 to DM700,000), confiscated from Cologne's risque Wallraf-Richartz Museum in 1937 to join the Nazi Degenerate Art exhibition, both come from Switzerland. But the latest trickle onto the market comes from the east, where art dealing was streng verboten. Now they are the freshest pieces around - Moedersohn's Spring on the Moor (Grisebach, estimate DM30,000 to DM40,000), from a private Leipzig collection and previously unknown, is causing a stir. But museums like Leipzig, given grants by Bonn to fill gaps in their collections, are also among the new buyers. The German market is localised - mountain scenes, which flop in Berlin, soar in Munich - but strong, safe, immune from international recession and speculative Anglo-Saxon habits. Recent exhibitions have spawned wider interest. After a Berlin show, Corinth now finds favour in the US; but artists, like Ury and Liebermann, much admired by Van Gogh, are Berlin men. Says Reuter: 'I'd never sell a good Liebermann in New York. If it's a Wannsee garden, you can smell it here.'</p>

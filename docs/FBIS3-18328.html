			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F> Popular Party Secretary, by Alberto Statera; place and date not  given: "Martinazzoli: A Constituent Government, Then"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Statera] Let us admit it, Mr.  Martinazzoli: Your image is not a very smooth one and your  language is not sufficiently basic.    [Martinazzoli] I am well acquainted with my face and I have  no problem with it, even though it is not the Hollywood type. I  certainly do nothing to make it smoother, because I refuse to  show off, and I am irritated by stereotyped smiles and  unnaturalness in politics. I will not disguise myself, because  I am convinced that at least a little truth is fundamental in  politics.    [Statera] But to go from that to the funereal....    [Martinazzoli] I know, I am even said to be able to cast the  evil eye and to lower audience ratings. But Funari [television  presenter] for one does not think so. In any case, my face  makes me the real leader of the neo-centrists, by virtue of all  my skin blemishes...    [Statera] That is a good one...    [Martinazzoli] As for my language, the ultimate would be not  to speak at all, since television encourages not thinking but  watching. But since I do not expect an Oscar nomination, I  reject this mystification. Politics needs words, not looks,  teeth, and banalities.    [Statera] So will the centrists not make much use of  television?    [Martinazzoli] Look, this is not just an anti-conformist  option; it is also a financial necessity. The resources  available to the right and the left are infinitely greater than  ours. We will spend some 3-4 billion lire, and [Forza Italia  leader Silvio] Berlusconi's right 10-15 times more.    [Statera] You mean 40 billion?    [Martinazzoli] More, more. An entrepreneur can throw his  money around however he pleases. I admit that I do not know the  anthropological profile of the Berlusconi man, but I must assume  that he is not only a yuppie but must also be a supporter and in  some instances also a volunteer, otherwise Berlusconi would go  broke: How much must those strange 11,000 clubs cost him? Be  that as it may, do not make me say that I want to disinvent  television and its political product. It is not true: I am  simply well aware of what Popper said, of the danger of the  manipulation of consensus, the problem of freedom connected with  the domination of the mass media. We need new ethics, for which  even the foundations are lacking.    [Statera] Do you mean self-regulation for television?    [Martinazzoli] Self-regulation makes me laugh. For the first  time Giuliano Ferrara is right, when he ridicules it. Moreover,  I support Fede, who broadcast Berlusconi's first remarks. True,  it took considerable faith [fede] -- pardon the pun -- to sit  there and watch that program, but I did so and found it  interesting, though I perceived some grim warnings in it.    [Statera] Of what?    [Martinazzoli] Though, of course, Berlusconi is not the  devil  incarnate, unfortunately the idea of a charismatic,  publicity-based, and plastic democracy is taking hold amid this  desert. But politics extends beyond merely the home, health,  and certain sacrosanct necessities: It is the complex  relationship among all these things, which must not be  oversimplified in order not to create false hopes. You cannot  make handfuls of promises using arguments that do no hang  together.    [Statera] You yourself said that the sublimation of  television is to remain silent, simply to be seen....    [Martinazzoli] Yes, but I am still convinced that the people  are not simply an audience and that life is not entirely  confined to television; indeed, life conflicts with its  televised image. Face powder is not everything; I hope that  arguments still count for something. Some American friends  agree with me in this: When they heard that in our  constituencies some 35,000 votes are needed in order to be  elected, they told me: "In that case you can meet with the  voters individually and promise something to each one." We are  not relinquishing direct contact with the people and are thus  exorcizing invisibility, which is a curse in politics: It is  like betting on a lame horse. A moderate visibility, not a  vulgar, spectacular one. Kafka said that if Ulysses had not put  wax in his ears he would have died not from hearing from Sirens'  song but from the silence.    [Statera] Do you refuse to answer reporters' questions  because you fear banality?    [Martinazzoli] At one time we had Gorresio, but now  authoritative opinion makers stay in their offices and write  about things they know nothing about, and journalists have been  taught only to report witticisms. I do not like to talk in  witticisms. I hate appearing to be something that I am not: I  am a lawyer from Brescia, precisely as your fellow journalist  from Cuneo said, dismissively. But what more than witticisms  can be produced by a politics that is now conducted with the  abacus?    [Statera] Who now conducts politics with the abacus?    [Martinazzoli] When I visited Berlusconi around Christmas I  told him: Look, if you use the arithmetical logic of the  abacus, even the traditional mistrust of the Italian Social  Movement [MSI] will cease to exist. I tried to explain to him  that we have been part of Italian history since 1919: We saw  Mussolini grow up and saw many Popular Party members go with  him. But Sturzo and others went into exile instead -- an exile  which De Gasperi then legitimized. You need to take the long  view, I told him. He replied still using the abacus. If it is  he who is that the Italians want, then let them have him, but  they must know that the exile of politics will not benefit  anyone. I am talking not about threats of dictatorship but  about the disappearance of the very substance of democracy: The  mere fact of appealing to a savior who makes all kind of  promises means that democracy is losing its very meaning. We  are in danger of becoming what Arbasino calls a Country Without.    [Statera] Without what?    [Martinazzoli] Without history, without any authoritative  voices. People talk about a country reduced to rubble, but that  is nonsense recounted by people with bad memories: It is  nonsense to say that everything that existed before the Second  Republic should be rejected. This displays a shortcoming on the  part of Italy's intellectuals: It is not clear whether they are  more quick-change artists or conformists. This is a clumsily  revolutionary period which some people have exploited.    [Statera] Who?    [Martinazzoli] What do you mean, who? Berlusconi -- who, if  he deserves any credit, it is for having arrived at the right  moment, when the whole scene was in disarray, to put forward a  change with no sense of direction.    [Statera] Upstaging [Pact for Italy leader] Segni?    [Martinazzoli] Yes, with a kind of cheap trick. After the  trouble over the lists, Segni must at least have realized that  referendum movements are not politics and that you really cannot  conduct politics without some kind of organization. In modern  democracies parties are not redundant, as some maintain: We  need to start drawing a distinction between corruptions and the  value of parties that have been cured of them. That is, unless  we want the leading role to be performed by television stations  and mass media conglomerates, instead of politics itself.    [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martinazzoli, but do you not have  the impression that while you are competing for seats in  parliament, other centers of power are defining a new order for  Italy?    [Martinazzoli] I certainly do have that impression: Several  major vested interests think that they can do without the  mediation of politics. The eclipse of politics also embodies a  contest between economic potentates -- telecommunications,  television, the banks, and so forth. We risk becoming subjects  rather than agents, or watching the cake being sliced up among  various businesses directly by their leading figures, one of  whom, moreover, is also personally involved in politics.    [Statera] So is this invisible center becoming increasingly  marginal?    [Martinazzoli] Keep in mind that we have two years of  honorable conduct behind us, and I would like that to be  acknowledged: We have supported the policies of [Prime  Ministers] Amato and Ciampi, and indeed we have helped Ciampi  more than anyone else, and I have had enough...    [Statera] Of what? Of Ciampi?    [Martinazzoli] No, I really have had enough of hearing  [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Achille] Occhetto  portraying himself as a Quintino Sella [prefascist finance  minister]. He is not. It is we who have supported this  government, even though we recognized its political limitations.    [Statera] But do you think that this can be considered a  merit by the Berlusconi man, by voters poisoned by rather stupid  cliches?    [Martinazzoli] Many respectable things in this country were  the outcome of minorities -- the Risorgimento, the Resistance...    [Statera] So you would not mind being in a minority?    [Martinazzoli] I do not like being in a minority at all; I  have no vocation to be a martyr, but I am sure that politics is  not like a restaurant, where the customer is always right. You  engage in politics for the sake of you own personal ideas, and I  am rather stubborn about mine.    [Statera] Very well, but Berlusconi enjoys a virtual  monopoly  of support, Occhetto has his own tough kernel....    [Martinazzoli] Forget about the opinion polls. Let us talk  about serious matters. Maybe one of the three blocs will win.  If Berlusconi's wins, on the basis of the abacus, then it will  govern. Otherwise, I see a gloomy future for that front. Can  you not see that Bossi is muzzled and that his leading role has  been undermined? If they win, perhaps they will succeed in  staying together, otherwise....    [Statera] What if Occhetto wins?    [Martinazzoli] More or less the same applies.  Occhetto-Quintino Sella criticizes me from London -- he who is  allied with the man who wants to tax government stock. How is  it possible, either on the right or on the left, to accept  alliances that exist solely for technical reasons?    [Statera] Very well, Mr. Martinazzoli, the centrists too  might win, but let us consider the most likely hypothesis --  that none of the three alignments wins.    [Martinazzoli] I do not believe that if someone is sick he  can be operated on every six months, so if that does happen I  would try to salvage this legislature.    [Statera] How?    [Martinazzoli] Since we do not know how the new parliament  will behave and we do not know how the seats will be  distributed, I have in mind not a second Ciampi government but a  constituent government, which will tackle the mass of  constitutional problems.    [Statera] Do you mean that you are resisting the rule of  alternation to the bitter end?    [Martinazzoli] Not at all; we want alternation, but not  fictitious alternation or, worse, something that is not  alternation but the splitting up of the country.    [Statera] What exactly would this constituent government  have  to do?    [Martinazzoli] Complete an electoral reform that is anything  but complete, establish a forum for the debate on the specter of  federalism, provide a guarantee that constitutional amendments  will not entail sudden violent wrenches or excesses but will  take place possibly by means of a number of referendums -- not  only on abrogation but also to indicate preferences.    [Statera] A new form of associationism?    [Martinazzoli] No, I repeat: Whoever wins will govern. And  I also repeat that we will not merge with the left, as many  suspect. But if nobody wins, the patient must not be killed.  There must be a constituent forum that will take the place of  the assembly elected directly by the people, which I myself,  Cossiga, and Miglio had in mind. And this forum could be  precisely a constituent government.    [Statera] What would its purpose be?    [Martinazzoli] There are several differences within the  Pact:  I am not in favor of the direct election of the prime minister,  which is what Segni wants. I have in mind, rather, a  German-style system with a chancellor.    [Statera] What will your own role be?    [Martinazzoli] I would like to think that I have helped to  prevent a disintegration, and on that basis, to take my leave.    [Statera] Thus regaining true invisibility?    [Martinazzoli] Look, we may be somewhat invisible, but we do  have a core of popular support that those people with all that  face powder and make-up can only dream of.    [Statera] Are you pledging that there will be no television  appearances between now and 27 March?    [Martinazzoli] Since nobody is giving us any free  half-hours... Be that as it may, you can be sure that you will  not be seeing me on "Il Rosso e il Nero," [The Red and the  Black] where opium and various other drugs are consumed --  ideological ones, of course.</p>

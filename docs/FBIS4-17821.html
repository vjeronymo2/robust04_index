			<p>BFN     [Text] The Black Sea Fleet seriously disapproved of  Ukraine's position which had insisted that Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov not take part in the recent talks on the Black Sea  Fleet between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers. This  was announced by Chief of the Black Sea Fleet headquarters, Rear  Admiral Petr Svyatashov in an interview with INTERFAX.    He repeated that in accordance with Ukrainian legislation on  power-sharing the Crimean leadership and its executive and  legislative bodies must be informed on the establishment of new  military units and dislocation of the troops.    Svyatashov suggested that the Ukrainian defense minister had  considered his authority to be higher that the Ukrainian law on  power-sharing adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet.    The last developments when a Ukrainian Navy patrol post had  been established in order to control the Black Sea Fleet naval  infantry in the Kazachya Bay (Sevastopol) undermined all the  statement by General Vitaliy Radetskyy on friendly intentions  and peace civilized settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue,  Svyatashov said.</p>

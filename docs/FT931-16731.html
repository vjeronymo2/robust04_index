			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Italy blocks cars from Japan ITALY is blocking further imports of cars from Japan, trade minister Mr Claudio Vitalone, said yesterday. It wants the European Commission and Japan to agree on the overall number of vehicles which it can export to the EC this year. France was last night understood to be planning to follow the Italian move. It comes after inconclusive talks between the Commission and Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry in Tokyo in December. Such blocks - described by Mr Vitalone as a 'temporary measure' - are expected to have little, if any, overall impact on Japanese import sales levels. However, this depends on an agreement being reached quickly when the Commission-Miti negotiations reopen later this month. The blocks should not apply to vehicles produced within the Community by Japanese 'transplants', car plants run by companies such as Nissan which manufacture within the EC. Any such blocks would breach an EC-Japan 'understanding' and provoke a furious government response from the UK where most 'transplant' production is situated. However, the unilateral action by two member states four days after the EC single market took effect underlines widespread concern about the vagueness of the levels of Japanese car sales within the region. It provides for twice-yearly 'monitoring' of the EC market and agreement on an appropriately 'prudent' level of sales for Japanese-built cars. But it is so vaguely worded that some fear running disputes may mark the transitional period until the EC becomes a completely open market for Japanese cars by the end of 1999. Until January 1, when nationally imposed quotas became illegal, Italy and France had the most restrictive regimes on direct imports of Japanese-made cars. Under Article 115 of the EC treaty, individual member states can ask the Commission to allow them to keep or reimpose controls to prevent 'economic difficulties'. Commission officials said yesterday they had yet to receive any formal such requests from Italy or France. The talks in Tokyo in December ended when the Commission and Miti failed to agree on the likely level of total EC car demand this year. In Tokyo last night, the Miti expressed 'surprise and concern' and said it was seeking formal confirmation from Italy and France that the blocks were being imposed. 'If they are, it would appear to be a breach of the agreement we have,' a spokesman said. Japan to relax tax rules for importers, Page 4</p>

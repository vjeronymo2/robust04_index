			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Heseltine backs move to boost coal sales THE GOVERNMENT would be prepared to seek changes in the law if this could increase the market for coal in the UK, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said last night. He told a select committee of backbench MPs that he had tried to intervene in negotiations about the future of British Coal, which had threatened to close 31 pits. But he had received legal advice that this would not be possible. Last month, he said, he had considered getting British Coal, the electricity generators and distribution companies 'into one room' to thrash out a new set of long-term coal supply contracts. But he was advised on September 7 that he did not have the legal authority to interfere in the privatised electricity industry. 'I don't have the power to make the electricity industry buy coal,' he told the committee on trade and industry, which was holding the opening session of its inquiry into the future of the coal industry. As Mr Heseltine appeared before the committee, the European Commission offered to give evidence to a Commons select committee and urged a suspension of the shutdown programme pending a full inquiry. The offer to go to Westminster to outline the economic impact on the Community of the government plans was made by Mr Antonio Cardoso de Cunha, EC energy commissioner, at a meeting in Strasbourg with members of the Association of Colliery Managers. In separate talks with Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, the commissioner endorsed the idea of an independent inquiry into the closures. Mr Scargill said: 'In answer to my questions the commissioner said he believed that there should be an inquiry to examine all aspects of energy policy and all claims by all sides. 'He said that until such an inquiry had been held all 31 pits should remain open and no miners should be made redundant.' At the select committee, Conservative and opposition MPs criticised Mr Heseltine for the abruptness of the decision to reduce the UK coal industry, and sought assurances that threatened pits would be kept open during the three-month inquiry. Mr Heseltine said news of closures should not have come as a shock because they had been widely anticipated. However, the timing of the announcement, on October 13, had been dictated by widespread leaks, he said. Although details of the redundancy terms to be paid to miners had been agreed on October 2, the decision to announce the closures was only taken on October 11, two days before.

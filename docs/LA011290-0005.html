			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FATHER OLIVARES  </P> <P> As a Claretian priest living and working at La Placita church, I take exception  to many inaccuracies in Rodolfo Acuna's column "A Uniquely Needy Flock Mustn't  Lose Its Padre" (California Commentary, Dec. 25).  </P> <P> * The transfer of Father Luis Olivares will not mean "a weakening of the  church's commitment to the cause of social justice . . . " or " . . . also mean  a loss of faith."  </P> <P> There is a very long list of Claretian priests and brothers, and dedicated  parishioners, since 1910 who have labored for the poor, the immigrant, and the  Hispanic for social justice.  </P> <P> * Father Olivares' initial term of three years was renewed; even after six  years as pastor, special permission was sought from Rome to allow him three  more years, a total of nine years as pastor!  </P> <P> * There are other dedicated Mexican American Claretians who offered to be  considered as the new pastor. They have credentials not only of words, but of  feeding and clothing the poor.  </P> <P> * I personally have not seen Rodolfo Acuna at La Placita. We welcome his  presence -- and that of his students -- to come and bring clothes for the poor,  and perhaps come once a week to feed the hungry!  </P> <P> * Dr. Acuna mentions a demonstration at St. Basil's church 20 years ago. What  he fails to mention is that at Communion time, a member of the self-proclaimed  group, Catolicos por la Raza, took the consecrated host, yelled a slogan, and  threw the consecrated host to the floor! After that moment, this group lost all  support in the Hispanic Catholic community!  </P> <P> * La Placita will continue to be a haven for the poor as long as the Claretian  priests and brothers are given the privilege of working here.  </P> <P> FR. ARTURO GOMEZ, CMF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

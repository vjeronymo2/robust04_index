			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Counselling proves positive for the unemployed: How some executives cope with losing their jobs MRS Jilly Shaul knew all the theory about how individuals should come to terms with the pain of unemployment. Before she was made redundant 12 months ago she ran job-search seminars and job clubs for unemployed executives. But Mrs Shaul became one of the thousands of unemployed individuals who, according to the British Psychological Society this week, have been forced to seek professional help for the trauma of losing their jobs. 'My job should have cushioned me for the shock,' says 55-year-old Mrs Shaul. 'I knew I should get rid of my feelings of anger as quickly as possible and start being pro-active. 'In the event, as I started to get my letters of applications returned, I started to get tearful and become as affected by feelings of rejection as my former clients. Then my mother died and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I just could not cope.' Mrs Shaul, who had watched her husband become depressed after early retirement, contacted a psychotherapist whom she knew. 'Over a period of some weeks I came to terms with my feelings and I became kinder to myself,' she says. She believes counselling facilities should be attached to every Jobcentre and be freely available. 'Why me?' was all that 42-year-old Mr Keith Coxon, finance director of the Nottingham Co-operative Society, was able to feel when he agreed to accept voluntary redundancy. Eighteen months on he has found similar full-time work at a slightly lower salary. After periods of depression and lethargy, he has a new sense of well-being and energy. He credits this partly to his involvement in a small self-help group, set up with the help of Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council. His initial response to unemployment was fairly typical. For the first few days he sat in his Pounds 190,000 home in a state of shock. The next step was anger, followed by a period of intense introspection in which he blamed himself. But he was aware of the dangers of allowing himself to deteriorate. His GP was not particularly helpful, telling him: 'This happens to a lot of people - just get on with life.' More solace came from his church, which he visited more frequently. It was the training and enterprise council's self-help group that helped most. Mr Coxon says: 'It is the loneliness, the hurt and sense of loss that your friends who are employed cannot understand. People in the same boat understand. That includes our counsellors, a couple of which have themselves experienced unemployment. 'I had never thought I was the sort of bloke that needed any advice or help. But I have learnt so much. How to be positive again for a start and gain self-esteem from new activities.' He and his wife, a solicitor, sold their detached home in a desirable suburb of Nottingham. 'It was such a relief getting rid of the Pounds 95,000 mortgage', says Mr Coxon. 'Like a lot of people I had got the status bug.' 'Now I've got a more realistic approach to my life. I would never trade up again to a house like that until I had a lot of money in the bank.'</p>

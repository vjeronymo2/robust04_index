			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Engineering a success story - Int'l Business Machines International Business Machines will report third-quarter results Thursday. The world's biggest computer company is in the midst of a broad 're-engineering' effort to boost profitability. Wall Street analysts forecast third-quarter earnings of about 90 cents per share, compared with losses of 12 cents per share. Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, said last week that the company is making progress. 'Unfortunately we have an uneconomic cost structure but we are well into fixing the problem.' In Europe, IBM is ahead of schedule in reaching competitive cost targets. Stronger-than-expected sales of mainframe computers have boosted IBM's profitability in the last two quarters and analysts will be watching to see whether that trend is continuing. Sales of IBM's new Aptiva home computers, introduced last month, should help to boost the performance of IBM's PC division, which has suffered market share losses this year in the face of fierce competition from Compaq Computer. IBM will introduce new desktop and portable personal computers on Monday. The desktop models, aimed at corporate PC users, are expected to be loaded with IBM's recently announced 'Warp' software, which competes with Microsoft's Windows. The company will also launch new versions of its popular 'Thinkpad' notebook computers.</p>

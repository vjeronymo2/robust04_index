			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives has sent a letter to  UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the president  and members of the UN Security Council.    The letter expressed the House of Representatives'  appreciation for the Security Council's positions and its  concern about the protection of the independence and sovereignty  of nations. It also expressed the hope that these stands will  be further bolstered when the Security Council reviews the  internal Yemeni developments that have to do with the essence of  preserving its sovereignty, security, and independence in line  with the Constitution and the laws in force.    In its letter, the House of Representatives found it strange  that the Security Council should address our internal issue by  depending on wrong information and outside mediators, despite  the fact that our country, an active UN member, has not filed a  request with the council in this regard.    The letter of the House of Representatives explained that  Yemen -- land and man -- has experienced eternal unity in its  history and culture. There are no ethnic or religious  minorities in Yemen. Yemeni unity, achieved on 22 May 1990 and  hailed by the Arabs and the world, is the unity of two political  regimes, not two different peoples. The unity was achieved by  peaceful and democratic means. The agreement on the proclamation  of the Yemeni Republic and the Constitution of the unity states  was signed by the two presidents of the two former regimes and  endorsed by the two houses of parliaments in the former two  parts.    The letter notes that the first national consensus on unity  was achieved when a public referendum was held on the  Constitution of the unity state in 1990. International  organizations attested to the integrity of this referendum. In  the first unified parliamentary elections on 27 April 1993, more  than 22 political parties and organizations, as well as  independents, took part. The entire world attested to the  integrity of the elections. All international organizations and  commissions that care about human rights, primarily the United  Nations and the five Security Council permanent member states,  blessed these elections. Also, all political parties, including  the Socialist Party, recognized the results of the elections.  After the elections, Yemen moved from the legitimacy of merger  through political agreement to the legitimacy of unity through  the constitutional and legitimate institutions. Thus, regional  representation was canceled when the first unified House of  Representatives convened on 12 May 1993, in accordance with the  Constitution that stipulates that the members of the House of  Representatives represent the entire people and look after  public interests, and not individuals.    The letter of the House of Representatives to the UN  secretary general and the president and members of the UN  Security Council added: Following the elections, the Republic  of Yemen entered a new experiment in government. A coalition  government was formed, including the three major political  parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform  Grouping, and the Socialist Party. This coalition adopted a  document that was called the Document of Government Coalition.  It asserted an adherence to national principles, including the  preservation of unity as a question of sovereignty that is not  to be infringed upon. The unity state adhered to democratic  practice in accordance with political pluralism and freedom of  expression. In this state, different views and programs were  aired in the service of society in line with modern foundations,  based on total respect for human rights.    In its letter, the House of Representatives further  explained  the constitutional status of the formation of the unity state  and its institutions. It then reviewed attempts to circumvent  constitutional legitimacy and democracy in the country and  undermine the unity state by a rebellious gang that defied law  and order and chose violence by exploding the military situation  to implement its scheme that aims at fragmenting unity and  undermining the nation's determination.    The letter noted that when this gang found that the outcome  of the 27 April elections was not in its favor and did not  advance its fortunes to occupy top posts in power, they started  to contemplate a coup against constitutional legitimacy by  creating crises and triggering explosions and assassinations and  disrupting security. Then, they caused the political and  economic situation to become tense and confused democracy by  setting new conditions and demands with the aim of canceling  constitutional legitimacy. The leader of the rebels, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, refused to submit to the Constitution and the laws and  regulations of the country as a vice chairman of the unity  state, so he did not complete the constitutional measures. This  is in addition to hindering the work of the state institutions  through their participation in power by staying in Aden, the  commercial and economic capital, and their sabotage of these  institutions.    Despite all of the above, the legitimate authority of the  country adhered to dialogue, with the participation of national  forces and political parties and organizations. As a result of  this dialogue, an accord document was signed in Amman. However,  no sooner had the document been signed than the rebels exploded  the military situation in Abyan.    The chapters of the conspiracy reached the peak on 21 May  1994 when al-Bid declared secession in a serious, illegitimate  precedent. Al-Bid wanted to form a state from a homeland that  has a unified origin, culture, creed, history, and language.    The letter added that the House deems this declaration null  and illegitimate, based on Article 1 of the Constitution of the  Yemeni Republic. Based on this Article, the House of  Representatives deems any recognition of this secessionist  declaration by any side, state, or organization as an attack on  the Yemeni people's right of national unionist belonging.    In its letter, the House of Representatives also asked the  UN  secretary general and the president and members of the Security  Council to deal with what is happening in our country as an  internal affair in line with Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN  Charter and to reject any request to discuss the Yemeni issue  unless it is filed by the Government of the Yemeni Republic.  The letter also asked the UN secretary general and the  president and members of the Security Council to pressure the  member states of the United Nations and the Security Council  which seek to have a foothold regarding what is happening in  Yemen so as not to interfere in our country's internal affairs  because this would further complicate the situation and prolong  the war.</p>

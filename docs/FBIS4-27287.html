			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim  Yong-sam held a security-related ministers meeting at Chongwadae  [presidential office] on 30 May and made a bellicose, violent  remark by saying that it is necessary to have a 24-hour  operation of the early warning system, that it is necessary to  strengthen the South Korea-U.S. joint alertness, and so on. The  traitor also ordered a special alert and emergency alert for the  whole army and the police from 31 May.    A few days ago, the traitor inspected on-the-spot the actual  fighting combat readiness by the units of the puppet's army,  navy, and air force in the front line area and instilled the war  fever. The reason that he ordered a special alert and an  emergency alert, convened a security-related ministers meeting,  and decided to strengthen joint alertness by making violent  remarks of war, hints that the military moves to put into  practice the new Operation Plan 5027, which is a war provocation  to invade the North, has emerged into an extremely dangerous  stage.    This kind of military move clearly proves itself that the  Kim  Yong-sam ring is truly through and through a warmonger all the  more running toward the adventurous road of war opposing the  fellow countrymen by conspiring with the outside forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The agreements concluded  between Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and Leonid  Kravchuk on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian  territory "will tell most positively on the Russian national  security", because Russia thereby gets a nuclear-free neighbour  state, ITAR-TASS was told today at the Kremlin by Secretary of  the Russian Security Council Oleg Lobov.    He confirmed that Russia and the United States "will give  Ukraine the broadest possible guarantees of security as a  nuclear-free power".    "The main thing is that Ukraine has confirmed its  nuclear-free power status and has agreed to hand over its  nuclear warheads to the Russian side," Lobov stressed, noting,  that "Russia will have to pay compensation, of course, by  delivering nuclear fuel to Ukrainian atomic power plants".    The secretary of the Russian Security Council described  Ukraine's decision concerning nuclear weapons as "a very good  step towards normalising relations with Russia", which must be  developed on the basis of "partnership, trust, joint  participation in the organisation of a European security system".    Asked whether Ukraine could again sharply raise the question  of the Black Sea Navy after having relinquished its nuclear  weapons to Russia, Lobov said: "I think the two problems should  not be linked. The existing Black Sea Navy problem must be  examined separately. I think that there should be no  'bargaining' over it".    Lobov admitted that Russia would have to make some financial  spendings linked with the transfer of Ukrainian warheads to its  territory and with deliveries of low-enriched uranium to  Ukraine. Nevertheless, he noted that "Russia is getting in  return highly enriched weapon Uranium and, in addition, it will  no longer have to spend money on the servicing of warhead  storages".</p>

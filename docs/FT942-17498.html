			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Athens acts against ex-king Greece's socialist government took steps yesterday to seize the property of ex-King Constantine and to cancel the former royal family's passports. Finance Minister Alexandros Papadopoulos made public a draft bill which returns all royal property in Greece to the state and revokes all passports and other travel documents issued by Greek authorities to the former royals. Ex-King Constantine has lived in England since fleeing in December 1967, after a failed attempt to overthrow a military junta.</p>

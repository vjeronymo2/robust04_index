			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Retail sales recover despite tax increases An apparent rebound in retail sales last month coupled with a smaller than expected government budget deficit in June have provided further evidence that Britain remains on course for steady economic growth in spite of April's tax increases. In a report released today, the Confederation of British Industry said retailers in June reported the strongest annual rate of sales volume growth this year. They expect a similar rise in July. Official figures, released yesterday, showed that the government's budget deficit, or public sector borrowing requirement, was lower than expected at Pounds 2.86bn in June. According to economists, the drop in the PSBR from Pounds 4.3bn in May and Pounds 3.95bn in June 1993 reflected accelerating economic growth as well as gains from increased taxes imposed in both the 1993 Budgets. The growth rate is suspected to be trimming unemployment and welfare costs as well as increasing value added and income tax revenues. The CBI said its survey of 502 companies in the retail, wholesale and motor trades found sales volumes in the year to June rose at their strongest rate since October 1988. The growth in the wholesale sector was especially strong, led by demand for industrial materials. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI distributive trades panel, reported a 'significant improvement' in the retailers' own assessment of their business, although stocks remained higher than expected demand. Mail order companies reported the strongest sales volume increase among retailers while large multiple chains reported 'significant growth'. Small chains, however, reported only a slight rise while, on balance, traders with single outlets experienced a slight fall in sales.

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / FedEx wraps up its European dream: Nikki Tait reports on the US courier's retreat to home base Ask an American to send you a small package overnight, and the chances are he will suggest 'FedEx-ing' it. Make the same request in Europe, and the sender might mutter anything from 'DHL', through a nationalised rail service to a local courier. This linguistic difference says much about the retreat from intra-European business last week by America's largest express delivery company. Memphis-based Federal Express has inveigled its way into US business life to where it is part of the language. In Europe, it has conspicuously failed. This has not been for want of money, effort or incentive. Faced with a maturing domestic market, Federal Express has poured about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) into international expansion since the mid-1980s, much of it in Europe. Yet its international operating losses have spiralled from Dollars 43m in 1988-89, to Dollars 391m in 1990-91. During the quarter to end-February 1992 they reached Dollars 125m. This demanded action, and rumours that FedEx would abandon intra-European deliveries, or subcontract such services, have been rife for months. But now the decision has been taken, three questions remain. Why did the strategy fail? Will this retreat staunch the international losses?  And where will retrenchment leave FedEx's longer-term strategy outside its home territory? The company was born 20 years ago, when its founder, Mr Fred Smith, built up a fleet of purple-painted aircraft and vans, and created a reliable US overnight delivery market. Today, up to 3m overnight packages are transported daily in the US, and Federal Express commands about half the business. However, within a decade of formation, FedEx was seeking new areas for expansion. It made one disastrous foray into the facsimile business, with ZapMail. When that was aborted in 1986, its attention shifted overseas. Like much of its competition, Federal Express was attracted by Europe. The 1992 harmonisation measures were expected to ease customs and logistical problems, while development of pan-European business organisations seemed likely to boost demand. FedEx bought its way into Europe with relatively small deals - including the UK's Lex Wilkinson in 1986, and Littlewoods' Home Delivery Service in 1989. But in 1988, it acquired Los Angeles-based Tiger International, the world's largest air cargo carrier, for Dollars 880m. This two-fold strategy appears to have been a mistake. According to an analyst, it provoked 'all the classic problems of an American company arriving in Europe'. FedEx attempted to stamp a single identity on disparate European businesses, but failed to appreciate the difficulties of blending local practices. The European operations were largely ground-based, but FedEx mostly used air transport. 'They couldn't combine successfully and found a low level of synergy existed,' said Mr David Gutherie, an analyst at Morgan Keegan, the Memphis brokerage. Tiger, meanwhile, produced its own problems. The workforce was unionised while FedEx's was not, and much of its customer base comprised freight-forwarders - essentially competitors to FedEx. They were wary, and integration was difficult. Projections for European market growth were over-optimistic. Mr Tom Oliver, head of FedEx's worldwide customer operations, estimated last week that the intra-European overnight market was 100,000 packets a day - a trickle compared with the US. Competitors, notably Connecticut-based United Parcel Service, were determined to move in, while Brussels-based DHL and Australia's TNT provided established competition. 'Current capacity could service 150 per cent of what is being projected for the year 2,000', said Mr Paul Schlesinger at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. FedEx's retrenchment will cost 6,600 jobs, involve subcontracting intra-European deliveries outside 16 major cities, and confine FedEx to a direct service between the US and these points. In theory, this should stem some operating losses. But analysts are not optimistic - reflected in FedEx's share price which ended the week Dollars 3 lower at Dollars 51 1/4 . Federal Express's finance director, Mr Alan Graf, declined to say how much of last quarter's deficit could be attributed to intra-European business. FedEx warned it was 'unable to predict with certainty whether the announced restructuring will reverse the existing trend of increasing international losses', although it predicted recovery in 1993. The company claims the 16-city service will mean it delivers about 45 per cent of its European packages itself - with all the 'quality control' advantages this implies. As the retrenchment was being announced, FedEx wrote to its US customers, explaining that the Express freighter service - offering speedy intercontinental service - would expand to Paris and Milan. Mr Oliver also said that while FedEx was 'not happy with revenues out of Asia', the market is different from Europe, and no radical overhaul is planned. Yet, should demand for overnight delivery in Europe grow in future, re-entering the market will not be easy. Clearly, the major remaining players - DHL, TNT, and UPS - will take every advantage of FedEx's retrenchment. 'It's a fine line,' suggested Mr Schlesinger, 'between a strategy they can't afford, and a strategy that's essential to the long-term well-being.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FEDERAL EXPRESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Results for years to end-May (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1991      1990      1989      1988  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues                        7,688.3   7,015.1   5,167.0   3,882.8 Total operating profits           279.8     413.6     424.4     379.5 split between:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- International operating losses    391.4     194.5      42.7      30.5 Domestic operating profits        671.2     608.1     467.1     410.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- After-tax profits                   5.9     115.8     184.6     (65.6)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Net loss followed write-off on ZapMail  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

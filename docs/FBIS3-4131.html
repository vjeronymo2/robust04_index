			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday morning, State Councillor Chen Junsheng  stressed in a full meeting of the Guangdong delegation that  Guangdong must concentrate its efforts on the issue of grain to  ensure the acreage producing grain, increase grain output, and  raise the self-support level of grain to guarantee the  settlement of the issue of feeding Guangdong's people.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: The key to stabilizing grain  production and increasing the self-support level of grain lies  in stabilizing the acreage under grain. He said: Now there are  too many development zones, and they have occupied a lot of good  farmland. If the situation remains unchanged, grain output will  drop. This situation must be changed very rapidly.</p>

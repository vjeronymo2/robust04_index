			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Judith in two guises - David Murry on new opera at the Almeida BESIDES this year's Almeida Opera commissions from Kevin Volans and Julian Grant, the Almeida has mounted the British premieres of two shorter pieces by David Lang and Ian McQueen. The same Septuagint tale inspired both Lang's Judith and Holofernes and McQueen's Line of Terror, staged here with expert imagination by Christopher Leith and Matthew Richardson respectively (last performances: 4 pm this Saturday). The one, a mime-drama with orchestral accompaniment, makes a tolerable curtain-raiser to the other, which is a mini-opera of real resource and conviction. For reasons of his own (he blames television), the American composer Lang has chosen to detach his Judith from anything like communal struggle or personal sacrifice. Instead, it becomes 'a story of a woman trapped in a recurring nightmare of loneliness and violence, who begins and ends in solitude, who uses sex to kill a man who finds her attractive and profits little from it. In other words, it is a quite different story.' Well, yes. The eternal-return bit is enacted in slow motion, at start and finish, by a silent Judith and three other gauze-clad undead. In the middle they manipulate Judith and Holofernes puppets, Bunraku-style, through the seduction and assassination. It all looks rather stylish. Lang's accompanying ensemble toys with just a few notes, each of them repeated to distraction on the spot, but there is explosive punctuation to screw the tension up - vicious drum-thwacks at first, then sharp orchestral barks, and a long dissonant screech at murder-time. Not long ago, the premiere of McQueen's latest opera Fortunato in Sweden was admired on this page by Paul Driver. Line of Terror, an earlier piece, shows the Scottish composer with a confident grasp of how to make an opera work. The story is plainly told, but artfully broken up by commentary from the eight-strong Israelite chorus, fearful, threatened and threatening (a fine team of dramatic voices here). The theme is neither horror nor a mythic past, but the morality of terrorism. All three principals - Judith, the tyrant and an Ammonite leader whom he has brutalised and half killed - get strong, professionally shaped set-pieces that carry the drama forward. Richard Halton makes Holofernes a towering brute with a coarsely amiable side, and as the Ammonite victim Andrew Watts projects his counter-tenor with surprising force and poignancy. The role of Judith is meaty and wide-ranging,a gift to an intelligent soprano like Virginia Kerr, who gives her the full-throated anguish of a Strauss heroine. At her soaring climaxes, the music tips toward Broadway show-style (a bit opportunist, perhaps). Elsewhere it is deliberately tougher ' not overwhelmingly original, but with telling variety and sharp instrumental effects. This score offers the conductor Martyn Brabbins far more scope than Lang's does, and he and the Almeida Ensemble take full advantage of it. We look forward keenly to McQueen's next works for the stage; he is not yet 40. Sponsorship by the Peter Moores Foundation</p>

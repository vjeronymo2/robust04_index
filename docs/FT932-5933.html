			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: A model approach to underwriting fees in rights issues THE risks in underwriting positions justify the fees charged to companies in rights offerings? Surely, with underwriting fees immutably fixed at 2 per cent of the capital raised, regardless of the quality of the issuer, something must be out of line. Certainly, the Office of Fair Trading has mused over this point. Last year, it announced an inquiry into underwriting fees and has still come to no firm conclusions. However, it has asked Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School to update a 1980 study into the profits earned by underwriters in rights offerings. Swiss Bank Corporation, meanwhile, says it has a technique for evaluating the risks in an underwriting position which can more clearly demonstrate where the pricing must be. The model uses a derivatives approach to understanding a rights offering and breaks the deal down into a series of put and call options. Mr Brian Keelan, executive director at SBC, says that in a rights offering, underwriters are simply selling companies a put option - the option to put the shares to them at a given price - and issuing a call option to other investors to call for the shares at a set price. By studying the historic volatility in a given company's share price, it is possible to determine whether or not the 2 per cent underwriting fee is generous for the risk accepted or too stingy. Such analysis, which relies on a Black Scholes model, is used to evaluate the pricing of other equity options. It was just such an approach that led SBC to make its controversial intervention in an offering of enhanced scrip dividends by BAT, an offering which had been designed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Those dividends, designed to help BAT cut its bill for advance corporation tax, gave investors the choice of a cash payout or a payout in new shares having a value 50 per cent above the cash option. And for those who did not wish to keep the extra shares, BZW offered to buy them, with no transaction costs, at 5 per cent below the market price determined by the average of three days closing prices. But SBC, using its derivative model, said it found 5 per cent far too generous to the underwriter and realised it could still do the deal profitably by repurchasing the shares at only a 2 per cent discount. SBC said it used the technique to evaluate a rights offering by Trafalgar House last February and concluded the pricing offered was generous. SBC had earlier used an options model to help its client, Hong Kong Land, build a stake in Trafalgar House so it had already researched the historic volatility in the company's share price. An SBC official said that at the time of the offering, put and call options on TH traded on the London Traded Options Market suggested a volatility of 70 per cent, meaning the price could rise or fall 70 per cent in a year. But using its own proprietary data base, SBC concluded the volatility was actually much lower, thus, the options were probably priced too high. The TH rights offering, a two-for-one deal, gave new shares at 60p each against a pre-rights offering price of 78p, a discount of 24 per cent. The price of the put option to TH is effectively the 2 per cent underwriting fee. An SBC official, citing the London Business School's own options data base, shows that the volatility by that measure is a much more modest 40 per cent. And at that rate, a price of .012 per cent would have been sufficient to cover the risk in that underwriting. SBC's analysis of the differences in rights offerings may be purely academic. There is no suggestion underwriters have either the incentive or the muscle to begin to compete with each other on underwriting fees. For one thing, the institutional shareholders who sub-underwrite the deals are unlikely ever to agree to it. But certainly, the maturation of the equity derivatives market could help to call into question the whole issue of the valuation of rights offerings.</p>

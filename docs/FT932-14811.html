			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Bid talk boosts Petrofina shares SHARES in Petrofina, the Belgian oil and gas company, rose 6 per cent yesterday morning in heavy trading on the Brussels bourse, amid speculation about a possible takeover bid for the group. After reaching a peak of BFr9,750 at 2pm, the shares slipped back to close at BFr9,400, an increase of 2 per cent on the opening price of BFr9,200. The group's share price has risen nearly 25 per since Petrofina announced poor 1992 results in February, and traders have speculated that Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company, may be a suitor for the company. Elf said yesterday that it owned a small stake in Petrofina - less than the 5 per cent threshold for declaration - but said it had not bought stock in yesterday's heavy trading, which saw turnover reach nearly 74,000 shares. The group said it held the shares as a financial rather than an industrial investment, and as a means of maintaining a presence in the north European market. Petrofina is in the process of strengthening its defences against a takeover. However, the company says this is not a reaction to recent speculation, but the implementation of plans mapped out after Belgium reformed its stock exchange rules two years ago. The group hopes to improve the transparency of its share register by making it obligatory for investors to declare stakes of over 3 per cent. It also wants to be able to buy in its own shares without obtaining shareholder permission in advance. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on April 27. The share price of Petrofina, one of Belgium's largest quoted companies, suffered last year after doubts were raised about the group's investment in the Ekofisk oil field, and investors realised that the group's main divisions - refining and marketing, and petrochemicals - were both experiencing a downturn. The stock fell from a high of BFr11,750 in May to BFr7,010 in mid-October. In practice, however, it would be impossible to bid for the company without the support of Belgium's two largest holding companies, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, which controls some 28 per cent, and Societe Generale de Belgique which owns a further 11 per cent. Consolidated profit at Petrofina dropped by 72 per cent last year, to BFr4.6bn (Dollars 195m).</p>

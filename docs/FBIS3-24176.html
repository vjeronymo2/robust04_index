			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by Algirdas Brazauskas, president of the Republic of </F> Lithuania, to the North Atlantic Council: "Cooperation For  Peace, Not War]    [Text] Mr. General Secretary of NATO!    Your excellencies!    Ladies and gentlemen!    Only upon having restored its national independence on March  11 of 1990, after a hiatus of fifty years, and upon having  consistently carried out political and free market economic  reforms, is Lithuania beginning to participate in the  implementation of the new security strategy of the North  Atlantic states. This strategy is oriented toward the  establishment of the fundamental values of democracy, law,  peace, and human dignity.    The security and stability of a country are essential  preconditions for the functioning of democracy and of the free  market. We are convinced that the assurance of Lithuanian  national security is an integral and inseparable part of the  security of Europe as a whole. Lithuania alone cannot ensure its  own security. We think that European--and Lithuanian--security  must be guaranteed by the political, economic, and military  integration of the countries concerned, the most important  institutional manifestations of which are the European Union and  NATO.    Lithuania seeks to participate in the strengthening of the  security of the North Atlantic region by becoming a member of  NATO and of the European Union, as well as of the Western  European Union. Lithuania sees its integration into the economic  and political structures of the European Union and its  integration into the political and defensive structures of NATO  and the Western European Union as mutually interrelated  processes.    Lithuania welcomes the NATO initiative "Partnership for  Peace" as a means of improving the security and stability of the  whole region from Vancouver to Vladivostok. I would imagine that  this initiative does not fully satisfy all of those countries  that seek to draw closer to NATO or to join the Union. It is a  compromise plan, oriented toward the future, not the past,  toward a Europe not riven by suspicion, hate, opposing  ideologies, or widely divergent standards of living.    I would especially like to emphasize that by entering into  the "Partnership for Peace" program, Lithuania has as its  clear-cut goal full-fledged membership in NATO, a goal that I  have also emphasized in my letter to the General Secretary of  NATO.    More and more people in Lithuania are beginning to realize  that the mere desire to become a member of NATO and to receive  guarantees of security is not enough. We ourselves must create  in our own country not only the military, but also the  political, economic, and psychological foundation for  integration corresponding to those of the NATO countries.    Upon signing the major document inviting "Partnership for  Peace," Lithuania is prepared to begin the work of implementing  the democratic control of defense structures, opening up the  defense budget process, and common planning, training, and  exercises. We will try to create opportunities for cooperation  with NATO forces in areas such as peacekeeping, search and  rescue operations, humanitarian aid, etc. Lithuania recognizes  that integration into NATO is a complex evolutionary process  that requires great intellectual and material resources.    We should ask other interested countries to join in the work  of "Partnership for Peace."    I would also like to make note of the organizational  significance of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.  Lithuania views with favor the role of the Council's political  consultations in the successful withdrawal of the Russian army  from Lithuania. We intend to apply the recommendations of the  "North Atlantic Cooperation Council Group on Cooperation for the  Maintenance of Peace" in developing the idea of a joint  Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian peacekeeping unit. Lithuania  welcomes the opportunities set forth in the proposal for the  preparation of joint military training and exercizes, and is  preparing to fully participate in them. We were pleased to hear  the news that the foreign ministers on the Council had accepted  the suggestion that the meeting of the Atlantic political  advisory group with the "Cooperation" partners scheduled for the  spring of 1994 be held in Vilnius.    I would like to draw attention to the fact that the  Lithuanian position on membership in NATO is not directed  against any neighboring or other European country.    Lithuania is a supporter of a unified move of the Baltic  states into Europe. Lithuania's request of January 4, 1994, for  membership in NATO is an integral part of the cooperation of the  Baltic states amongst themselves and with NATO. The military  cooperation of the Baltic states is not and must not be  construed as the creation of a threat to Russia. Lithuania has  no territorial claims whatsoever against its neighbors.    Russian pronouncements to the effect that Russia has special  interests and rights to maintain peace in the so-called "near  abroad", or the ex-territory of the USSR, do not quite accord  with the spirit of either international law or of the  "Partnership for Peace." Especially difficult to understand are  Russian claims of special interests in the Baltic states, if  only because Lithuania and the other Baltic states were never  legally parts of the USSR.    Lithuania is in favor of the implementation of international  norms and agreements, and emphasizes the importance of the  rapid, orderly, and unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army  from Latvia and Estonia, which will increase the security and  stability of the Baltic sea region. The peaceful withdrawal of  the Russian army from Lithuania serves as an example of the  fundamentally new possibilities for coexistence in this region  of Europe.    The acceptance of the Baltic states as well as of the  Visegrad and other Central European countries into the European  Union, NATO, and the Western European Union would strongly and  effectively stimulate economic and political reforms in those  countries. We are convinced that it would provide significant  support for the strengthening and continuity of the democratic  processes in Russia. We are among those who are convinced that  Russia can have a democratic future. That is why the leadership  of the Republic of Lithuania supports the efforts of Western  countries to help Russia carry out its political and economic  reforms, to create a democratic Russia.    I believe that after the passage of some period of time, in  a  similar auditorium, a president of Lithuania will place his  signature on a document that will ratify full integration of the  Republic of Lithuania into a structure that recognizes common  values and guarantees security and stability--the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.</p>

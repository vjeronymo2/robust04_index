			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Lloyd's to press for early trial Lloyd's of London has decided to press for an early trial of issues raised by a Court of Appeal ruling last month which could undermine efforts by the insurance market to collect more than Pounds 1bn owed by loss-making Names, Ralph Atkins writes. Lloyd's had wanted to appeal to the House of Lords over the ruling that the insurance market might have contravened European Union law, in particular by asking Names to contribute to a 'central fund' while underwriting. But Lloyd's decided it had a better chance of an early resolution by applying for a trial in the commercial court next spring.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Sanzo Nosaka, the former  leader of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), acted as a spy for  the former Soviet Union's intelligence agency ever since his  return from Moscow in 1946, according to a book released  Saturday [16 April] by the JCP.    Nosaka, who served as the party's first secretary and then  Central Committee chairman between 1955 and 1982, died last  November after being expelled from the party in 1992 for his  involvement in a spy scandal.    The book, titled "70 Years of the Japanese Communist Party,"  depicts major events in the party's history since its foundation  in 1922.    The book says, "Nosaka had been working as a spy affiliated  with the Soviet intelligence agency ever since he returned to  Japan in January 1946."    It also accuses former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of having  tried to control the JCP by taking advantage of Nosaka, who had  climbed up the party echelons to gain its leadership.    "Nosaka showed his loyalty to Stalin by helping him  interfere  with the Japanese Communist Party due to Nosaka's tie with the  Soviet intelligence agency," the book says.    It accuses Nosaka of falsely reporting to the Soviet  authorities his prewar colleague Kenzo Yamamoto, another JCP  member, as a Western spy, resulting in the 1939 execution by  shooting of Yamamoto.    In 1931, Nosaka fled the repression of the prewar Japanese  Government to the Soviet Union.    Yamamoto also fled to the Soviet Union in 1928 and continued  his political activities in Moscow until 1939, when Nosaka wrote  a letter to the Soviet authorities identifying him as a spy.    The truth surrounding Yamamoto's death was exposed only in  August 1992, when a Japanese news magazine reported Nosaka's  letter which had been kept at the Soviet Communist Party  archives in Moscow.    The JCP subsequently sent an investigative mission to Moscow  and stripped him of his membership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Jia Zhaoquan (6328 2507 0356) and </F> XINHUA reporter Ma Xiaochun (7456 2556 2504)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The exhibitions and  demonstrations of exchange, carrier wave, microwave, satellite,  optic fiber, and computer networks and software developed by a  telecommunications research institute under the People's  Liberation Army [PLA] General Staff Headquarters today indicated  a historic leap into a regularized, serialized, and programed  new stage for the PLA's telecommunications and command  automation programs.    As a leading PLA scientific research institute specializing  in telecommunications and command automation programs, this  institute has scored great successes following three decades of  hard work in tackling key problems. Of over 2,000 scientific  research projects it completed, 200 were winners of state,  army-level Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards,  including State Scientific and Technological Advancement Awards  and Invention Awards for eight projects. The development and  application of these scientific research achievements has helped  the PLA upgrade its telecommunications equipment from electronic  tubes and transistors to large-scale integrated circuits,  resulting in the substantial enhancement of its overall  telecommunications level. As far as the PLA's command  automation programs are concerned, the completed process from  single machine development to a remote on-line and armywide  network has provided the PLA with a modern security device in  terms of operation command, military training, force management,  and information processing.    The promotion of the PLA's telecommunications and command  automation programs also effectively supports state economic  construction, bringing impressive social and economic benefits.  In recent years, the application of 218 scientific and  technological achievements in state economic development has won  high praise from both local governments and the masses.</p>

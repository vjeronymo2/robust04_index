			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Trade fillip for Caracas VENEZUELA'S efforts to become a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) have been given a fillip with a trade agreement which will open the Venezuelan market to duty-free imports from members of the community, writes Canute James from Kingston. Under the agreement, Venezuela will allow one-way preferential access to its market for imports from the 13 Caricom countries. Tariffs will be reduced gradually over five years until a duty-free entry has been agreed for the imports.</p>

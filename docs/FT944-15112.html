			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: British bankers try out a royal sales pitch Behind the pomp of Queen Elizabeth's visit to Russia, British and Russian businessmen have been getting on with the 'development of capitalism,' the title of a seminar held on the royal yacht Britannia. Some 50 Russian businessmen and bankers have been invited on board the yacht, moored on the Neva River, just out of sight of the Russian cruiser Aurora where the first shots of the Bolshevik revolution were fired. British Invisibles, an umbrella body promoting invisible trade, had been quick to exploit the publicity surrounding the Queen's visit to stage a sales pitch for the virtues of British banking, legal, accounting, and management consulting services. It was their eigth such foreign event this year and the third occasion on which they had utilised the royal yacht. A string of British advisers represented included Kleinwort Benson, Robert Fleming, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, Smith New Court, Ernst and Young, and Coopers and Lybrand. With Dollars 500m of foreign portfolio investment pouring into Russia every month, the British delegation said equity could provide a cheap and effective means of raising funds to finance the growth of Russian companies. However, they cautioned that substantial preliminary work including accounting and legal studies would be required first. A discussion on financing the growth of a hypothetical Russian company sparked lively debate and highlighted the differences in business cultures. It also emerged that some of the Russian guests had their own sales pitches to make. Mr Cyril Smirnov, president of Astro Bank, a large local commercial bank, suggested that the Russian banking system could provide sufficient funding and that companies did not need the assistance of outsiders. A university lecturer said Russian managers needed re-education and training before they would be up to the task. Many of the Russian guests blanched when the subject of prospective fees was raised. A margin of 5 to 7 per cent to raise Dollars 10m of fresh capital clearly seemed excessive to some - no matter how much it would help fuel future growth. An interpretation of both business cultures was put forward by Mr Igor Kostikov, the managing director of a local stockbroking firm. 'Russian managers are reluctant to accept the loss of control that goes with raising equity capital. But they also worry about taking on the liabilities of corporate debt. They feel that it is enough to survive at the moment and do not yet see the need to grow,' he said. Sir Brian Pearse, chairman of British Invisibles, expressed cautious optimism. 'We do not think that there can be any quick fix for Russia but we are saying very clearly that we will be here for the long term.'</p>

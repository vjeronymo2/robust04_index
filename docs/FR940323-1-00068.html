All of the devices of a particular lot, model, code, etc., FDA will classify the action as either one of the following: (a) Recall, if the action was undertaken to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health; or (b) safety alert, if the action was undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device and not to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

Section 301(e) of the act, which prohibits, among other things, the failure to establish or maintain any record, or make any report, required under section 519 of the act or the refusal to permit officers or employees designated by FDA to have access to or verification or copying of any such required record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

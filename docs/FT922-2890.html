			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Managing agents' rules eased by Lloyd's LLOYD'S of London, the troubled insurance market, has lifted the requirement that managing agents must obtain insurance against negligence claims. But managing agents who do not have cover are unlikely to be able to attract new business, and the move is seen as hastening the shake-out of weaker managing agents. Lloyd's Names - whose private wealth stands behind insurance claims - are unlikely to wish to place business with underwriters who in effect cannot be sued for negligence. Claims against so-called 'errors and omissions' policies have soared in the past 18 months and premiums for that type of insurance have become a significant part of managing agents' costs. Managing agents manage underwriting syndicates. Mr Dick Hazell, Lloyd's deputy chairman, said last week in a letter to Names that 'severe difficulties have been experienced in establishing a viable market for such insurance this year and it seems likely that the situation may be even more uncertain next year'. Mr Hazell acknowledged that removal of the mandatory requirement for errors and omissions insurance could cause 'understandable concern'. However, he said that Lloyd's Council would continue to monitor underwriting agents to see that they met the required standards and this will take into account the extent to which they voluntarily purchased such insurance.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Volvo hopes to maintain Renault link despite halt on merger Volvo will seek to maintain its three-year-old alliance with Renault despite its decision to abandon plans to merge with the state-owned French vehicle manufacturer. Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of the Swedish group who led a management revolt that halted the merger proposal on Thursday, sought yesterday to limit the damage to relations with Renault. 'I can only say sorry and apologise and hope that France understands,' he said. 'We must ensure that the common projects (between Volvo and Renault) continue to be developed.' The French government said it continued to believe the merger remained desirable. 'However, the opinions held by Volvo executives need to clarified,' it said in a statement. But Volvo said there was no immediate prospect of renegotiating a full merger and Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, emphasised the difficulty of future co-operation. The companies were likely to discuss their joint prospects very soon, Volvo said. Mr Schweitzer said the existing alliance, including cross-shareholdings and joint purchasing and product development, remained in effect. But he added the merger's failure would damage the momentum of co-operation and require existing collaboration to be appraised on a case by case basis. He expressed pessimism over the flagship P4 project to build a new range of executive cars. Mr Gyll sought to bolster morale within Volvo after the board decision, which prompted the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman who had led Volvo for 22 years, and four other directors. Officials said a meeting of shareholders, whose hostility to the merger sparked the crisis, would be called early in the new year to elect a new chairman and board. Mr Gyll is expected to be confirmed as chief executive. In meetings with managers and employees at Volvo's headquarters in Gothenburg, Mr Gyll emphasised the group's financial strength and his determination to bind the internal wounds opened by the merger proposal. Volvo officials said a strategy review would include consideration of how to raise up to SKr8bn (Pounds 645m) in extra capital. The options are a share issue and sales of non-core assets. Mr Schweitzer said the merger's failure did not threaten Renault's future or compromise plans to privatise the car group. Other investors could be found to act as a counterweight to Volvo's 20 per cent stake in Renault. Curse of Gyllenhammar, Page 9 Swedish forests sell-off, Page 11</p>

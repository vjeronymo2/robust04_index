Diaz was the person charged with making known the unrest of  the military leadership regarding a precept that reduces the  officers to mere observers at the meeting, which is currently  being held in Buenos Aires and will conclude on 18 March.    Questions of form must also be added to this unrest, as the  Armed Forces Staff received a photocopied paper informing it of  the opening and conclusion of the meeting, and this was  considered "more of a notification than an invitation."    The military observers (or "listeners," as some  sarcastically  termed them) were thus in this role able to follow the  discussions regarding a main point: the creation of a new  continental security system, and the distrust of those countries  that fear an attempt at "verticalization" under the hegemony of  the United States.    The Mexican delegation stated that progress in the  implementation of measures of mutual confidence cannot be  achieved until a "new security concept that responds to the  threats hovering over the region" has been clearly defined.    The comments from the Argentine ambassador to the OAS,  Hernan  Patino, somewhat cleared the atmosphere, which to that point had  been somewhat monotonous, and his specific reference to the  chicken and the egg seemed to block any further delay in  discussing the heart of the problem.    This problem concerns the concrete measures of a military  nature that are to be taken by the armed forces of the member  countries -- measures that go further than the usual exchanges  of officers and goodwill meetings.    For its part Brazil supports to a certain extent the  Argentine position of achieving progress on this topic, although  essentially on a bilateral country-to-country basis. Uruguay is  concerned with the principle of non-intervention, while Peru and  Venezuela give priority to the non-military problems such as  underdevelopment and what they call "the crime transnationals."    In sum, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, who arrived  in the country on 16 March, will not find a panorama much  different from what he has observed during his entire tenure, in  other words, the beginning of a long road that will have to be  taken step by step.</p>

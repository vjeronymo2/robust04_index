This method may also be used to prepare  recording media for optical information carriers. Systems where  the metal is included in the hydrocarbon matrix are particularly  promising. The precipitation processes and the properties of the  resulting polymer films are affected by such parameters as  pressure, flow rate of the organo-metallic compound, temperature  of the substrate, and energy characteristics of the low  temperature plasma, which depend greatly on the type of  discharge. In the present work a study was made of the processes  for preparing thin films by dissociation of tetramethyl Sn in a  high frequency discharge and in a direct current discharge.  Differences in the Raman spectra of the tetramethyl Sn in the  liquid and film states were established, and precipitation  conditions were determined under which the resulting films have  maximum sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for use as  recording media for optical recording of information.

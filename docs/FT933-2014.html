			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bermuda triangle of independent television Lord Hollick, the youthful-looking head of media and financial services group MAI, is wryly amused when reminded about the chequered past of the independent television franchise which his 61 per cent owned Meridian group has recently begun to serve. 'It has been the Bermuda triangle of independent television,' he laughs. He is adamant, however, that Meridian - which paid Pounds 36m for the south of England license  - will not disappear. It is developing a strong regional emphasis within the franchise, encouraging local advertising and programmes, which the Labour peer believes will offset any decline in independent television advertising. 'We are selling some slots three times over,' he says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial coal work meeting which ended on 21  June pointed out: Our province's specific guidelines for  developing its coal industry are that we must base ourselves on  the real situation in our province, implement unified planning,  stabilize the Datong Coal Mine, and devote our primary efforts  to develop the (Rehe) coal mining area. We must select the best  coal mines and transform them [words indistinct]. We must pay  attention to the production of anthracite and coke and support  the development of coal mines run by townships and towns. We  must strive to boost the province's annual coal production  output to 4.5 million tons by 2000.    The above-mentioned meeting convened by the provincial  government made a conscientious analysis of the present  situation of the coal industry in our province and the present  difficulties facing the coal enterprises. It worked out  preferential policies for supporting the development of the coal  industry in our province and made overall arrangements  beneficial to that development. Coal has occupied an important  position in our province's fuel production setup. At present,  coal has accounted for 58 percent of our province's energy  consumption; however, our province's self-supporting rate of  coal last year was only 52 percent. We need to import 1,700,000  tons of coal every year. Developing the coal industry and  increasing its self-support rate is our province's long-term  goal of struggle.    Vice Provincial Governor Wang Hanmin spoke at the meeting on  the future development of our province's coal industry. He  said: Our province's coal industry has been developing under  difficult conditions, but it has nonetheless made marked  contributions to economic development throughout the province.  In recent years, though coal enterprises have encountered  enormous difficulties and their output has dropped, we must  understand that demand in the coal market is currently in a  state of change. A favorable opportunity has come our way.    Wang Hanmin stressed: We must seize this favorable  opportunity and have sense of urgency for reform and  development. We must focus on running existing coal enterprises  well, increasing investment, and speeding up the pace of  updating facilities and technical transformation. We must  transform or expand several of the existing enterprises'  production projects, increase their production staying power,  and boost their production output. Coal enterprises are also  facing the problem of transforming their operational mechanisms.  They must free themselves from the long-term traditional planned  economic pattern, must transform their internal management  systems to meet the needs of the market economy, and must  promote the development of the coal industry in our province.</p>

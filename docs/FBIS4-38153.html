			<p>BFN     [Text] A strike is being observed today in some parts of  country at the call of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of  Commerce and Industry [FPCCI] against nonacceptance of their  budget proposals by the government. In Karachi, industrial  units and main shopping centers are closed. However, public  transport and private vehicles are plying as usual. Most of the  main shopping centers and markets in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and  Peshawar are closed.    However, the minister for commerce speaking in the National  Assembly said a number of factories in Sialkot, Naushahra,  Gujrat, and Sindh are not observing the strike. The minister  for commerce, Chaudhary Ahmad Mukhtar, has again asked the  Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry to call  off the strike and resume talks with the government about their  demands. Replying to a point of order by Haji Mohammad Nawaz  Khokar in the National Assembly today, the commerce minister  said that the government during talks with representatives of  FPCCI wanted to evolve some package. However, they continued  their threatening posture saying that if their demands were not  accepted, they would go on strike. He said they wanted taxation  rules and laws of their choice and were trying to dictate to the  government. He said there were some politically motivated  people who raised slogans and misbehaved during the talks.</p>

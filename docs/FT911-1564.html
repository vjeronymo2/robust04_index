			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Prospect trebling size with Pounds 14.25m Dunn purchase PROSPECT INDUSTRIES, the Hull-based engineering group that was floated out of Tace in 1989, is to triple in size by acquiring Dunn International, a supplier of engineering services to the power generating sector, for Pounds 14.25m in cash and shares, writes David Owen. The transaction will be part-funded by the placing by Henry Ansbacher of 59.67m ordinary shares at 12p, raising Pounds 7.16m. This is a 2 1/4 p premium to the level at which Prospect shares were temporarily suspended yesterday. It is expected that share dealing will recommence on May 30 after an extraordinary general meeting to seek shareholder approval for the proposals. Yesterday's move is in line with Prospect's strategy of expanding through acquisition within the engineering and related sectors. 'We have turned a lot of stones and this is the acquisition we have brought forward,' said Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman and chief executive. Under the terms of the deal, Prospect will pay an initial Pounds 10.25m in cash and Pounds 1m by the allotment of 8.33m ordinary shares. There is a deferred consideration of Pounds 3m to be satisfied in cash. In addition, Pounds 3.75m of the initial cash payment will be used by the vendors to subscribe for Prospect convertible preference shares. The transaction will give the vendors about 9 per cent of Prospect's enlarged 133m ordinary share base, while exercising the convertible could put a further 12.5m shares in their hands. Wilbraham-related entities will hold 20.7 per cent of the shares following the placing. Existing Dunn directors are to enter two-year service contracts on completion of the deal. Dunn's net assets at December 31 1990 totalled just Pounds 2.5m, which will oblige Prospect to take a hefty goodwill write-down onto its balance-sheet. The combined group looks like starting life about 200 per cent geared but with interest at least six times covered.</p>

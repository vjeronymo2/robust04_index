			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "NEGA Reports" column] </F>   [Text] North Ossetia -- A meeting has taken place in  Vladikavkaz between republic President Akhsarbek Galazov,  parliament head Yuriy Biragov, and Provisional Administration  chief Vladimir Lozovoy. The focus of attention was on matters  related to the rehabilitation of housing and communications  destroyed in the course of the tragic events of October and  November 1992, as well as socioeconomic problems in the state of  emergency zone. Also taking part in the discussion were members  of the government and parliament of North Ossetia, as well as  representatives of federal ministries and departments on a  fact-finding mission in North Ossetia and Ingushetia.    According to Vladimir Lozovoy, a large group of Russian  Federation ministry and department chiefs arrived in the  conflict zone to organize preparation for the return of refugees  and forced resettlers to four populated areas in Prigorodnyy  Rayon, in line with the Russian Federation president's 30 May  1994 edict On Introducing a State of Emergency in Parts of the  Territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The meeting  pinpointed the main lines of activity by the republic leadership  toward adjusting the situation. North Ossetia is ready to  implement the Russian president's edict and a corresponding  resolution by the Russian Federation Government, but the refugee  problem should be resolved in a comprehensive manner, on the  basis of the agreements signed in Kislovodsk. A decisive say  here belongs to conciliation commissions that were set up in all  populated areas of Prigorodnyy Rayon. Their activity is already  yielding some results. Thus, residents in the village of  Kurtat at their meeting ruled that six Ingushi families return  to their former homes, specifying them by name.</p>

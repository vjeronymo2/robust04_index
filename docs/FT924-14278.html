			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Battle joined against red tape A NEW drive for deregulation and a fresh attempt to find ways of encouraging joint public and private-sector investment in the infrastructure were promised yesterday in Mr John Major's speech. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is to spearhead an offensive against the increasing weight of regulation imposed on business. People must be able to feel confident about food safety and public-health standards, the prime minister said; 'But when this reaches the point where you may need 28 separate licences, certificates and registrations just to start a business, then I say again: this sort of thing must stop.' Deregulation has been a consistent Tory theme, but Mr Major's signal that a relaxation of the Treasury rules on co-operation between public and private-sector investment in public works such as roads was more unexpected. 'It's too easy, when spending is under pressure, to forget the long term, to let the burden fall on the private sector alone,' he said. 'We must work with industry to see whether the public and private sectors working together can do more to invest in our future.' Mr Major was responsible for a relaxation of the 'Ryrie rules' when he was chief secretary to the Treasury, but even that loosening of the arrangements for combining public and private investment has not led to many joint projects. The Conservative party organisation is undergoing its most radical overhaul since 1945, Mr Norman Fowler, party chairman, told conference yesterday, Bethan Hutton writes. A post-election review of the party's organisation started this year. 'This is a review that will lead to action, not a review which is a substitute for action,' Mr Fowler said, but made no mention of demands from within the party for a directly elected executive committee and chairman. Mr Fowler said the party's Pounds 10m overdraft was 'deeply unsatisfactory' and must be eliminated. 'I believe you want an organisation that lives within its means.' Suspicions that Central Office was spending wastefully have led to some associations refusing to contribute to central funds.</p>

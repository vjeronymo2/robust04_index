			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Christie back in black with Pounds 11,000 Christie Group, the specialist business agency, returned profits of Pounds 11,000 pre-tax over the six months to September following three years of first half losses. The turnround, which compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 507,000, was struck from a turnover little changed at Pounds 7.62m (Pounds 7.57m). Earnings of 0.05p compared with losses of 2.8p. Christie has no net borrowings and the directors said they were confident the group would emerge from the recession with a 'significantly enhanced market position'.</p>

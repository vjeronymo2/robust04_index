			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S RACE TIGHTENS IN LATEST CALIFORNIA POLL  </P> <P> If a new statewide survey is on the mark, it clearly pays to be active in the  early stages of a governor's race.  </P> <P> Democratic Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, in a dramatic turnaround, is now  essentially even with Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in a theoretical matchup  by the independent California Poll.  </P> <P> According to political professionals who have seen the numbers, Van de Kamp has  44% to Wilson's 43%. The poll of 807 people, including Republicans and  Democrats, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points.  </P> <P> Just three months ago Wilson was leading Van de Kamp by 8 points in the  California Poll, which is conducted by Mervin D. Field of San Francisco.  </P> <P> "What explains this change is that you've had one very active candidate for  governor since the summer and that candidate is John Van de Kamp," said  Democratic media consultant Kam Kuwata.  </P> <P> A recent Los Angeles Times Poll also found Van de Kamp and Wilson dead even.  </P> <P> Perhaps the worst news in the new California Poll was for former San Francisco  Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who is challenging Van de Kamp for the Democratic  gubernatorial nomination.  </P> <P> Feinstein led Van de Kamp by 27% to 22% in Field's February survey, an  admittedly early poll that few paid attention to. In the new survey, those  familiar with the numbers said Monday, Feinstein is now trailing Van de Kamp by  53% to 35%.  </P> <P> For that matchup, political sources said, 387 Democrats were polled and the  survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 points.  </P> <P> Beginning in late July, Van de Kamp has generated a lot of headlines, charging  that a ballot initiative sponsored by Wilson could endanger a woman's right to  abortion and introducing his own initiatives on the environment, crime and  political ethics.  </P> <P> Feinstein has been quietly trying to raise money and build political alliances,  neither of which automatically makes news. She also has been without a  full-time campaign consultant since Clint Reilly of San Francisco quit in a  huff in August.  </P> <P> For his part, Wilson has received some attention by taking on the plight of  drug-addicted babies and by being very active after the Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> But as the senator conceded in an interview last month, his attention to his  duties in Washington has put him at a disadvantage so far in the governor's  race.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, being in the state all the time, has been better able to seize the  initiative at this stage.  </P> <P> "People are responding to our positive discussion of change, to new ideas," Van  de Kamp said Monday after hearing of the turnaround in the California Poll.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the Wilson camp had its own interpretation of the latest poll  numbers.  </P> <P> "We have been anticipating all along that this race was tight," said Wilson  campaign manager George Gorton. "It is a result of Pete Wilson doing a good job  as U.S. senator, which is reflected in this same poll, and in John Van de Kamp  consolidating his left, which will come back to haunt him next year."  </P> <P> The California Poll found that 48% of Californians believe Wilson is doing an  "excellent or good job" as a U.S. senator, up from 38% who thought that in  April.  </P> <P> "Our turn will come next year when Pete is out here and people begin to focus  on the governor's race," said Gorton.  </P></p>

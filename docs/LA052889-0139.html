			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 200 MOURN TEEN-AGE RUSSIAN ROULETTE VICTIM  </P> <P> More than 200 mourners, including friends and relatives wearing T-shirts  adorned with his name, said goodby Saturday to Gabriel Soto, the 13-year-old  victim of a shooting that occurred during a one-sided version of Russian  roulette.  </P> <P> After a Mass at Our Lady of Perpetual Hope Catholic Church, the boy's body was  buried on a windy, steep hillside at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall,  where the crying of his family and the strains of traditional mourning songs  were almost drowned out by noise from the Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> Gabriel's mother, Olga Soto, broke down and stretched over the coffin as the  graveside ceremony drew to a close, and mourners and pallbearers placed white  carnations on the ground. A girl wept into a handkerchief that enfolded  Gabriel's school photo.  </P> <P> At graveside rites, Father Robert Rankin, an associate pastor at Our Lady of  Perpetual Hope, said: "Human life in God's mind is complete, no matter how long  it lasts."  </P> <P> Olga Soto had been one of the last family members to see the boy alive, as he  was leaving the family's small home on Arch Street near the railroad tracks in  Newhall on Tuesday morning to visit a friend. His classes at Placerita Junior  High School did not begin until 1 p.m. She had told him not to be late.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drawn Into Deadly Game  </P> <P> Gabriel and a 14-year-old friend went to an apartment in Valencia where another  classmate lived. Authorities believe that the third boy, also 14, drew the  other two into a deadly game of Russian roulette, using a gun owned by his  father.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have said the third boy always held the  gun, allegedly pointing it at his own head and then at the other two boys. The  suspect pleaded not guilty Friday to a murder charge, and a June 21 hearing  date has been set. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> At his funeral, Gabriel was remembered as a fun-loving boy who joked, rode his  bicycle around the neighborhood and played games "just like any 12- or  13-year-old boy would do," said Francisco Orona, 17, a neighbor. "He was just  like a little brother to all of us."  </P> <P> He had had some difficulties at school, but family members said his grades were  improving, and a special school seemed to be making a difference. His father,  Edward Soto Sr., an auto mechanic whose specialty is electronics, said that  Gabriel always had wanted to help him work on cars and that his son was saving  his money to buy a motor bike.  </P> <P> Albert Valenzuela, another mourner, said: "We're all like one big family" in  the neighborhood where the Sotos have lived for 15 years. Valenzuela wore one  of the T-shirts, which also had the date of Gabriel's death and the words "In  Memory" across the back.  </P></p>

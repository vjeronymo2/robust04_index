			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Boots Boots has struggled before to spend its surplus cash wisely. It may soon confront that challenge again thanks to its ever-dependable chemists chain. Having paid its interim dividend early, Boots was able to use Pounds 67m of its Pounds 201m cash flow to reduce debt. By the year-end, Boots should have made a big dent in its remaining Pounds 137m of net borrowings, if not eliminated them entirely. Cash would then start accumulating rapidly, especially now the pharmaceuticals division's needs have subsided following the failure of Manoplax. There may be several short term demands on the money. The costs of closing some Do It All stores will consume a fair dollop. The modest expansion of the chemists chain and the acquisition of more OTC medicines and retail properties would represent a more worthwhile use of funds. Even so, Boots is likely to generate cash at a far faster rate than it can spend it. A Reuters-style share re-purchase scheme may represent the most sensible means of addressing the issue. Rather that, after the Ward White deal, than making charitable donations to other company's investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Gomez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said today that 1994 offers no special prospects  for changes in Cuba's relationship with the United States.    During a news conference shortly before departing on a tour  of five African nations, Robaina pointed out that Cuba cannot  decide whether there will be changes in those relations because  the island has defined its position, and it is now up to  Washington to change its policies.    We should not be overly enthusiastic about the absence of  aggressive language because this can be the case even while, as  is currently happening, the blockade is intensified. Under such  conditions there is not room for much, Robaina said.    Regarding a list of political prisoners given to American  clergyman Jesse Jackson during a recent visit to Havana, Robaina  pointed out that he has categorically asserted that Cuba may  have many concerns, but it does not work through requests or  lists. The fact that at a given moment, under certain  circumstances we agreed to this in 1984 [as received] does not  mean that it will always be the case.    Nevertheless, Robaina pointed out, Jackson requested  information concerning certain cases and the government provided  him with the information. He did not request that anyone be  released.    The Cuban diplomat underscored that Cuba was not under any  obligation to present the list and does not have to respond for  the people listed, because their situation does not exactly  depend on a request or on the difficulties that may emerge  during a negotiations process.    Robaina added that the first thing that is evaluated during  a  penal process is what the person's current situation is, what  sentence he received, and how he has behaved. It is not a  phenomenon based on lists because there are many lists floating  around the world but there is a lack of information concerning  the people who are on those lists, he said.    Regarding Cuba's relations with other areas of the world,  Robaina said that 1994 offers new opportunities which may not  necessarily be for the better or very lofty or numerous.    Today we have a situation in Latin America that we did not  have in the past; we have formed a joint commission with the  Caribbean that did not exist in 1993, we are about to  participate in a technical meeting to create the Association of  Caribbean States, and we are preparing the Fourth  Spanish-speaking Latin American summit scheduled to be held in  Cartagena.    Furthermore, Robaina added, we recently held a meeting with  representatives from the European Parliament which is a sign of  a new relationship with that community.    We have not asked anyone to share in what we are doing,  Robaina underscored, adding that it is not necessary to share  what Cuba is doing but to respect it. Cuba, he said, is willing  to maintain exchanges with the entire world, including the  United States.    Concerning his two-week tour of five countries on the  African  continent, the foreign minister said it will help to strengthen  Cuba's already magnificent relations with the governments of  those countries.    Although an expansion of Cuban civil cooperation with those  states is not expected, Robaina pointed out that Cuba might  cooperate with them in areas such as health, education, culture  and sports.    Robaina pointed out that he basically wants to brief those  countries on the island's current reality and identify areas in  which relations could be strengthened, especially economic  relations which, due to the current opening, offer magnificent  investment opportunities for African businessmen.    Regarding the internal situation in Angola -- one of the  countries he is scheduled to visit -- Robaina pointed out that  it is up to the Angolan people to find a solution.    In response to a question regarding Cuba's position on the  negotiations process in South Africa, Robaina said that his  country is closely following it.    During this first trip to Africa since his appointment in  April, the Cuban foreign minister will make official visits to  Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia, in that order.    Prior to his arrival in Accra, capital of Ghana, Robaina  will  take advantage of a brief stopover in Zurich to meet with Swiss  officials from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and  Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, PRENSA LATINA was told by  Tomas Lorenzo, head of Robaina's office.    Robaina, accompanied by a small entourage, will meet with  President Jerry Rawlings (Ghana), Jose Eduardo Dos Santos  (Angola), Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Frederick Chiluba (Zambia)  and Sam Nujoma (Namibia).</p>

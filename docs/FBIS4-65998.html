			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Varley] </F>   [Text] Paris, May 26 (AFP) -- Europe tried to lay to rest  the ghosts of wars past on Thursday [26 May] with a Stability  Pact intended to settle potential border disputes and solve the  problem of minorities in central and eastern Europe.    But the conference on stability in Europe, brainchild of  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, left aside the wars in  Bosnia and the Caucasus, concentrating on preventing conflicts  that could regenerate from Europe's turbulent past.    And Europe's future relationship with Russia, which will not  be part of the pact, appeared ill-defined as the two-day  conference opened at UNESCO headquarters here.    In an opening speech, Balladur said "we must begin by  liquidating the old quarrels, resolving the old conflicts,  dissipating the old fears, we must stabilise our continent as  far as borders and minority rights are concerned."    The prime minister said the conference's objective should be  to sign the Stability Pact by early next year, perhaps in  February "but perhaps it will take longer."    A successful outcome would help Balladur in French  presidential elections due in May, 1995, analysts said, but the  Stability Pact project is less ambitious than when the prime  minister launched it a year ago.    It is now limited to preventing potential conflict. The war  in Bosnia, said Balladur, "is a veritable lesson of what we must  no longer tolerate."    The pact would incorporate existing good-neighbour  agreements, such as recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier  between Germany and Poland, and new accords to be reached in the  interval, Balladur said.    The aim of the pact was to reconcile the desire of "numerous  countries to join the European Union with the need to preserve  the unity of our continent and thus develop very close relations  with Russia," the prime minister said.    He added that the "greater Europe of the future" should  enjoy  "privileged relations of partnership" with Moscow.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev welcomed the  proposed  pact, but struck a note of caution, saying that Moscow preferred  that border disputes and minority issues be addressed by the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    He hailed the pact as "yet another attempt to come to grips  seriously with the extremely dangerous signs of aggressive  nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance" in  Europe.    But he added, "discussion of issues related to state borders  as well as to national minorities should take place exclusively  in the framework established by CSCE documents."    Balladur also said Thursday the future pact would be closely  linked with the CSCE.    The United States is represented at the conference by  Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff.    The conference is chaired by Greece in its capacity as  current president of the EU after the union adopted Balladur's  initiative.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this week that the  summit aimed to settle border and minority problems between  "countries with the vocation of entering the EU," following the  collapse of the Soviet bloc.    They are six central and eastern European countries --  Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and  Romania -- and the three Baltic countries - Latvia, Lithuania  and Estonia. Only one country that emerged from former  Yugoslavia - Slovenia - has been invited.    French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the  EU, while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take  on board "new sources of conflict." The aim was to "provide a  political impetus" to handle good-neighbour problems "better and  quicker," Juppe said.    On the agenda are the big Hungarian minorities in Romania  (1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000).    Budapest is anxious to protect their rights to autonomy,  notably in the cultural field, while the Romanian and Slovakian  governments are seeking Hungarian acceptance of the  inviolability of existing frontiers.    The conference will also attempt to deal with the problem of  Russian minorities in the three Baltic countries and the  withdrawal of Russian troops.    The four candidate members of the EU -- Finland, Norway,  Sweden and Austria -- are attending the Paris conference, along  with the three neighbours of the central European Visegrad group  -- Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.    Apart from Russia and the United States, eight other states  with a direct interest in European stability are also taking  part -- Albania, Canada, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, Switzerland,  Turkey and the Vatican.</p>

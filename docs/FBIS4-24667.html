			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Railroads Hope To Lure Investments From </F> Abroad"]    [Text] The Ministry of Railways is working on more  "attractive" policies to lure direct overseas investment and  management into its projects.    The move seeks to push railway development to catch up with  rapid economic growth.    The policies will allow railway joint ventures to be set up  and independently managed. Such commercial railways will have  much more say in setting prices than State-run ones, a ministry  official said.    The joint ventures will enjoy a wide spectrum of  "attractive"  treatment, such as pricing power and a wider business scope,  such as railside real estate developments, to help balance  foreign exchange.    "This will be a stimulus to foreign firms which are still  hesitant to invest in railways with huge input and lengthy  construction periods," said An Shunyi, deputy head of the  ministry's Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office.    The coastal regions have been targeted with a list of  lucrative rail projects for foreign investment, he said. The  projects will not be revealed for several months.    Many experts suggest that the envisioned Beijing-Shanghai  high-speed railway should be on the list. But the more than $10  billion project still awaits final State approval.    Negotiations are taking place with an American firm to  co-build the Zhangzhou-Chaozhou-Shantou line, which will stretch  more than 300 kilometres in Fujian and Guangdong provinces.    And talks are continuing with a Canadian company on the  100-kilometre Yantai-Lancun line in Shandong Province.    The government is also trying to soak up more overseas  preferential loans to finance its modern railway network,  according to An.    A total $3.7 billion from the Japanese Government and World  Bank since 1980 has helped China complete 5,700 kilometres in  new lines, rebuild 6,500 kilometres of old ones, and revamped  six rolling stock plants.    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will grant a $200 million  loan for technical enhancement of the Beijing-Kowloon line,  which is under intense construction.    The agreement for the project is scheduled to be signed next  month in Manila, signaling ADB's growing interest in China's  national railways, rather than local lines.    The Japanese Government is preparing $2 billion as its  fourth  railway loan parcel to China. Agreements will be struck next  Summer.    China will use the blessing to update the existing  Zhuzhou-Guiyang line in the southwest, and build a new  240-kilomtre line linking Xian and Ankang in the northwest.    It will also cover a railway and highway bridge spanning the  Yangtze at Wuhu of Anhui Province, and probably the  Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail project.</p>

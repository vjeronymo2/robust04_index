			<p>BFN     [Text] Mecca, May 17, IRNA -- Three battalions of Saudi  Arabian police have been mobilized in front of the headquarters  of Iranian pilgrims in anticipation of the annual `Disavowal of  Polytheists' rally, which was however cancelled by the leader of  the Iranian pilgrims in order to ensure that the Saudis have no  excuse for desecrating the holy sanctuary.    The Saudi forces are heavily armed and equipped with machine  guns, armoured personnel carriers, tear gas cannisters and water  cannons.    The battalions have arrayed themselves in the form of a  triangle in the northeastern side of holy Mecca. One battalion  has taken up position at al-Aziz street at the site of the  Iranian pilgrim headquarters. This battalion forms the point of  the invasion triangle of the Saudi commandos. The main part of  the equipments and personnel of this batallaion are seen in the  al-Azizieh school which is precisely in front of the Iranian  pilgrim headquarters.    In the Azizieh street there is another battalion that is  completely ready.    In addition to these forces, dozens of private cars are seen  on different sides of the triangle stopping and interrogating  unsuspecting pilgirms to the holiest sanctuary of Islam.    Many pilgrims who pass this region interpret the abnormal  movements of the Saudi police as disrespect of the divine  sanctuary. The insulting behaviour of the Saudi police with  pilgrims from various countries in many cases has met stong  objection.    In view of the provocative behaviour of the Saudis, Hojat  ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader of the Islamic  revolution's representative for the Hajj, was forced to call off  the annual rally which was planned for Tuesday May 17.    The rally in accordance with the spirit of the Hajj aims to  promote Islamic unity and awaken the ummah to the plots of  enemies against them.    Quite strangely the Saudis are averse to this all-important  rally and on one such occasion in 1987, Saudi security forces  massacred over 400 Iranian pilgrims near the most inviolable of  sanctuaries where the shedding of even an animal's blood is  divinely prohibited.</p>

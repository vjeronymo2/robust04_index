			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: US welcomes Arafat back in from the cold THE ceremony was set for 11am, but the White House gates opened at 8am, for those specially invited to witness it, and some were already queuing soon after 7am to be sure of a good seat. At the head of the queue was a man from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Until a few weeks ago that committee, perhaps the most formidable lobbying organisation in all Washington, would have moved heaven and earth to prevent the re-election of any senator or congressman foolish enough to suggest a resumption of official contacts between the US and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, let alone an invitation to the White House for Mr Yassir Arafat himself, whom most Americans have regarded as the world's arch-terrorist ever since his famous 'gun-and-olive-branch' appearance at the United Nations in 1974. But there was the man from Aipac (after consulting the woman next to him he declined to give his name) queuing up to get within handshake distance of the PLO leader, and declaring benignly his support for 'the peace process'. Later arrivals included most of those who in successive US administrations have handled that 'process', which has been a principal feature of US foreign policy under both Republican and Democratic presidents since at least 1973. There was Mr Henry Kissinger, who as secretary of state in that year negotiated the ceasefire at the end of the Yom Kippur war and the 'disengagement of forces' agreements which followed, first between Israel and Egypt, then - a far tougher affair, requiring a two-month marathon of shuttle diplomacy - between Israel and Syria. But it was also Mr Kissinger who in 1975, as part of the price for Israel's partial withdrawal from Sinai, gave the pledge that the US would never deal with the PLO unless it first renounced terrorism and recognised Israel's right to exist. There was former President Jimmy Carter, who 15 years ago hosted the three-week Camp David summit between Egypt's then President Anwar Sadat and Mr Menachem Begin, Israel's prime minister of the time. Mr Carter has perhaps as much right as anyone to feel fulfilled by yesterday's agreement, since it is closely modelled on the Camp David 'framework', which at the time the PLO, along with almost the entire Arab world outside Egypt, furiously rejected. He may have reflected with irony that, had the framework been accepted, the interim period of Palestinian autonomy might have started in 1979 rather than 1993 or 1994, in which case negotiations on the final status of the territories should have begun by 1982 and been concluded by 1984. Yet Mr Carter was bound throughout his administration by the Kissinger pledge, and so was never able to bring his diplomatic talents directly to bear on Mr Arafat or other PLO representatives. This thought must yesterday have been running through the mind of Mr Andy Young, the black American leader who in 1979 was forced to resign as Mr Carter's representative at the United Nations after secret contacts between him and the PLO representative there came to light. There were Mr Cyrus Vance and Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, respectively secretary of state and national security adviser in the Carter administration and frequently at odds over the Middle East as well as over policy towards the Soviet Union. There was General Alexander Haig, who as Mr Ronald Reagan's first secretary of state gave the green light for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and resigned in the midst of the crisis which followed. There was his successor Mr George Shultz, who in 1988 negotiated the PLO's first explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist - an essential precondition for yesterday's agreement. And there were former President George Bush and his secretary of state, Mr James Baker, who between them nudged Israel and the Arabs into the peace conference which began in Madrid the year before last, in the wake of the Gulf war. They also can take some credit for bringing Mr Rabin to power in Israel last year. By witholding loan guarantees from Israel they showed for the first time US support was not unconditional. Indeed it depended on Israel's willingness to halt the settlement process in the occupied territories and give up 'land for peace'.</p>

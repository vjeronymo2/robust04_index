			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Grey future for retailers MANY retailers will face a tough challenge this decade adjusting to an ageing Britain, according to a report. As the median age of the UK population increases, many retailers that sell their products mainly to the under-30s will see a sharp drop in the number of customers in their target age group. The report by Verdict Response, a retail consultancy, suggests that the number of people aged from 15 to 29 will have fallen by 22 per cent to 7.2m by 2001. Verdict says that on these estimates Miss Selfridge, the fashion retailer, will 'lose' 8.3 per cent of its customers by the end of the decade while the Next fashion chain will see its target market decline by more than 5 per cent. Other prominent retailers most affected include River Island, Top Man, Olympus and Body Shop. However, the 'greying' population base will create more lucrative markets for retailers that pitch their appeal to older age groups. The number of people aged 30 to 39 is likely to increase 14 per cent to 9.1m by 2001 while the number aged from 50 to 59 will rise 22 per cent to 7.3m. In total, the adult population is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent. Verdict suggests that retailers including Currys, the Co-op, BhS, Marks and Spencer, Littlewoods and John Lewis Partnership will see more than 2 per cent more customers falling into their ideal age ranges. The report points out, however, that general economic factors - such as trends in home ownership and interest rates - will affect the spending power of different age groups in different ways. High-street shops are bearing the brunt of the recession, with the south-east the worst affected, according to a report from American Express. More than 40 per cent of retailers said business revenue was down in the first three months of 1992 compared with the same period last year. Only 20 per cent of retailers reported a rise in profits in the first half of the year. Verdict on Retail Demographics 1992, Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London. WC1V 6JS. Pounds 695</p>

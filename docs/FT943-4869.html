			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Receivers to Swans say sale is remote Price Waterhouse, the receivers to the Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, said yesterday that the prospects of selling the yard were now remote, Chris Tighe writes. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said there were at this stage no serious bidders. Price Waterhouse, he said, would now begin looking at offers received for parts of the business, in parallel with any approaches for the whole. The receivers, he added, would try for a whole sale right up to the departure of the Type 23 frigate Richmond, the last vessel on Swans' books, on November 2. Following Monday's collapse of hopes of a sale to Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the receivers are considering a CMN proposal to sub-contract work for some weeks to Swans' design team. Mr Horsfield said that, if agreement could be reached within 48 hours, the Friday deadline for making Swans' 100-strong design team redundant would be lifted. It emerged yesterday that the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, North and South Tyneside and Newcastle councils and private-sector interests had formulated a proposal, should no going-concern sale be possible, to acquire Swans as a subsea oil and gas exploration and production base. The initiative, costing around Pounds 20m, would require government support. Organisation Management and Survey, a Manchester-based engineering consultancy, also confirmed it was interested in buying Swans as a going concern.</p>

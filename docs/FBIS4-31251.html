			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, June 7 (TANJUG) -- A woman was killed and her  daughter wounded in the Serb village of Puracic near Doboj in  northern Bosnia in the renewed Moslem shelling of the Doboj area  on Tuesday morning [7 June], Bosnian Serb military sources  report. The intensive shelling of Doboj in the past two months  has left 20 civilians dead, five of them children, and more than  60 wounded. The shelling is a prelude to an all-out Moslem  attack on that Serb town, which has been openly stated by the  Moslem commanders, with the aim of cutting the vital corridor  along the Sava river which links the western and eastern parts  of the Bosnian Serb republic.    The Bosnian Serb army on Tuesday repelled three heavy  combined artillery-infantry attacks by the Moslems on Mt. Ozren  in northern Bosnia. The Moslem attack was backed by U.N.  Leopard tanks, Bosnian Serb military sources say. On April 30  in the region of Moslem-held Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia,  Nordic U.N. troops for the first time backed a Moslem ground  attack on Serb positions which left nine Serb soldiers dead and  five wounded. The Bosnian Serb army says that the Moslems have  also been attacking Serb villages in the Mt. Ozren area.    In the area of Teslic, Bosnian Serb troops have neutralized  a  Moslem commando team, it adds. The Moslems are launching a  major offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic while their leaders  are negotiating a general cessation of hostilities in Geneva.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FINANCING IS A BIG IF FOR JAIL PLAN ON GYPSUM SITE  </P> <P> If all was to go smoothly, without any hitches whatsoever, the first inmates  would arrive at a new Orange County jail in Gypsum Canyon in 1995, at the  latest.  </P> <P> But everything is not going smoothly.  </P> <P> Last week, the county's plans to build a 6,700-bed jail complex in the canyon  just east of Anaheim Hills were dealt what could become a serious setback.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) withdrew from  consideration in the Senate Judiciary Committee a bill she had sponsored that  would have allowed voters to decide on a proposed half-cent sales tax increase  for the construction and operation of jail and court facilities.  </P> <P> The reason: Santa Ana officials, fearful that voters will approve a June, 1990,  ballot initiative requiring that all future county jails be built in their  city, want to attach an amendment to Bergeson's bill that would prohibit the  money from being used to build any jail in Santa Ana within a mile of a school.  That would eliminate many Santa Ana sites from consideration.  </P> <P> Bergeson balked, she has said, because local officials were inappropriately  confusing a jail-financing plan with a jail site-selection plan. Late Thursday,  however, she offered to compromise if Santa Ana city officials would remove  their proposed amendment. She promised that she would not pass the sales tax  measure to the governor for his signature until the Board of Supervisors gives  final approval to the Gypsum Canyon site sometime in September. As of Saturday,  there was no formal response from the city, so the sales tax question remains  stalled.  </P> <P> But even if Bergeson's bill is revived, wins passage in both houses of the  Legislature and is signed by the governor and ultimately is approved by a  majority of the county's voters, the money generated by that a half-cent sales  tax would not be enough to operate the proposed Gypsum Canyon jail for 1 year,  much less pay for the land it would be built upon and finance its construction.  </P> <P> The sales tax would generate no more than $100 million annually, with jail  construction projects vying with court construction projects for a piece of the  pie.  </P> <P> By contrast, the current estimate is that it will cost at least $700 million to  buy the Gypsum Canyon site from the Irvine Co. and to build the jail. It would  cost another estimated $75 million to $100 million annually to operate it,  county officials say.  </P> <P> Where would that kind of money come from in a county that last year considered  massive layoffs to balance its budget?  </P> <P> "Obviously we don't have very many ways to get it if we don't get it from some  source outside our routine budget," Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F.  Riley said. As far as he knows, Riley said, the county has no concrete plan for  financing the jail in Gypsum Canyon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans Have Died  </P> <P> Plans that have been offered in the past, all of which would have required  voter approval, have died on the vine.  </P> <P> The latest was killed in August by the Board of Supervisors. Under that  proposal, voters would have been asked to approve a $700-million bond financing  plan to pay for the first phase of the Gypsum Canyon Jail and for a new  $250-million courthouse in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> At that time, supervisors and other officials said they did not believe Orange  County's conservative voters would be receptive to a measure that would add an  estimated $70 in property taxes for every $100,000 in assessed value.  </P> <P> Officials also have discussed creation of a community services district, in  which properties are assessed a special tax for specific public improvements.  Creation of such a district would require that voters approve it with a  two-thirds majority.  </P> <P> If such financing plans eventually were put to voters and approved, the $100  million generated by a half-cent sales tax might be adequate to pay the annual  charges to service the debt, county officials said. Even so, money for  day-to-day operation of the jail still would have to come from somewhere else.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Residential Development  </P> <P> Now, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the Gypsum Canyon jail project --  and in part because of it -- is the Irvine Co.'s announcement that it is  beginning preliminary planning for residential development of its landholdings  in the area, which include the proposed jail site.  </P> <P> Construction of homes on or near the jail site would make the county's purchase  of the land through condemnation proceedings more difficult -- and more  expensive.  </P> <P> "We had put any plans for development on hold," said Dawn McCormick, a  spokeswoman for the Irvine Co. "But since there has been no movement by the  county, and there are plans for other development in the area, it's become  necessary to begin initial master planning . . . in cooperation with the city  of Anaheim."  </P> <P> The Hon Development Co., in conjunction with Anaheim, is planning to annex land  in the adjacent Coal Canyon area, and that move would require the annexation of  a small piece of the Irvine Co. land as well, McCormick said.  </P> <P> "Because of that, it seemed appropriate . . . that we work with . . . Anaheim  to begin development of a master plan for the area," she said. "Since the  county movement has stalled, it's in our interests to look at that property for  development."  </P> <P> Still, McCormick said, the company is several years away from actually building  houses on the land.  </P> <P> Murry Cable, an assistant county administrative officer, said he did not know  what impact, if any, the Irvine Co.'s announcement would have on plans for a  new jail in Gypsum Canyon. He noted, however, that both the county and the  company formally opposed the proposed Coal Canyon annexation plan at a meeting  last month of the Local Agency Formation Commission, a county agency that  oversees cityhood and annexation proposals. The matter was continued for 90  days, Cable said.  </P> <P> Some county officials in private conversations have talked of paring down the  Gypsum Canyon project considerably and financing construction from the county  general fund. Such an alternative, however, would require huge -- and perhaps  untenable -- cuts in county services.  </P> <P> So where does that leave the Gypsum Canyon project, which could become part of  a legal tangle if voters approve the 1990 initiative to build jails only in  Santa Ana?  </P> <P> Still alive, insisted Supervisor Riley.  </P> <P> The county is in the process of completing a state-required environmental  impact report on the Gypsum Canyon site, which was chosen from among several  remote canyon areas by a sharply divided Board of Supervisors in July, 1987.  </P> <P> The environmental report, Riley said, is due to be finished in early September,  and the Gypsum Canyon site is expected to get final approval from a majority of  the five supervisors.  </P> <P> By then, Riley said, he also hopes that Bergeson's bill will have been revived,  passed and ready for the governor's signature.  </P> <P> At that point, the county can seriously pursue its plans to build a jail in  Gypsum Canyon, Riley said.  </P></p>

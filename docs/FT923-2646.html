			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to sell building in NY for more than Dollars 100m OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled Canadian property developer, yesterday said it had agreed to sell a 34-storey building in Park Avenue to the New York-based Mutual of Am-erica Life Insurance Company. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Mutual is believed to be paying more than Dollars 100m for the building. Mutual said the company plans to invest about Dollars 70m in an extensive renovation of the property. This could create about 1,000 construction jobs in New York. O&amp;Y is likely to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off a series of outstanding bank mortgages on the property; these are believed to total about Dollars 100m. 'We are not assuming any mortgages that O&amp;Y had on the building,' said Mr Thomas Moran, the president and chief operating officer of Mutual. Mr Moran said Mutual, which has total assets of more than Dollars 6.2bn, plans to use the building as its new headquarters and to move in by 1995. 'We will use about one third of the building and lease out the rest,' Mr Moran said. The building, located near the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, was previously the world headquarters of ITT, the US financial, industrial and travel conglomerate. It has remained vacant for the past 18 months. The building consists of 664,000 sq ft and requires much work to remove asbestos and make a number of repairs.</p>

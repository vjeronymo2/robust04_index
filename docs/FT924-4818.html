			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Warning on toxic dam threat to Danube UNITED Nations officials warned yesterday that the damaged dam in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro holding back millions of tons of toxic sludge from pouring into the Danube river system remains highly dangerous. Work began last Thursday to prevent further erosion of the gravel and shale Mojkovac dam, which was on the verge of collapse after flash floods in mid-October tore away concrete supports along its base. Mr Hans Zimmermann, who is co-ordinating the emergency repair work at the UN disaster relief agency in Geneva, said yesterday there had been no further deterioration in the dam's condition. But, he added, 'the slightest additional rainfall would aggravate the situation again'. The preliminary toxicology report on the site, which contains an estimated 7m tons of poisonous sludge from a now-closed lead and zinc mine, says the dump contains lead, zinc, copper, iron and sulphur compounds, as well as traces of nickel, cadmium, arsenic and antimony. Analysts also found high levels of zinc in the river Tara just below the dam. The fast-flowing Tara runs via the Drina and Sava rivers into the Danube just above Belgrade. The report, from the Cantonal Ecotoxicological Service of Geneva, says that if the dam was breached the river would wash out the toxic elements from the sludge, which has the consistency of sand, carrying them downstream. In that event, it says, all plant and animal life along the rivers could be poisoned, and people would have to be protected from contaminated food and drinking water. Full tests on the 30kg of sludge analysts brought back to Geneva from their inspection visit on November 15 are expected to take another month. Mr Zimmermann said yesterday that preliminary work on protecting the base of the 12m-high dam from further erosion had been completed. Engineers are now building three jetties upstream to lessen water pressure on the dam and dredging a new channel in the river, to stop water eddying around its base.</p>

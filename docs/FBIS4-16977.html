			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary for </F> President Boris Yeltsin, "this morning" in Moscow -- recorded]    [Text] Yesterday in the evening one of the last versions,  if not the very last, of the text was drawn up to be submitted  to the State Duma. Today this document will be handed over to  the president and to the State Duma, where it will be discussed.  I would like to inform you that this document will now be  called A Treaty on Public Accord [Dogovor ob Obshchestvennom  Soglasii]. This is a truly agreed upon text. It takes into  account comments made by factions, parties, and public  organizations, including the comments of Communists and the  Liberal Democratic Party. The text has become more specific  and, if you like, milder in its political part. During the  process of consultations several provisions, which can be used  for confrontation purposes, were removed from it. In particular,  paragraphs on sanctions against those who violate the conditions  of the accords were removed.    As you know, a week is left before signing. Today I spoke to  Boris Nikolayevich on this topic and asked him how much he hopes  for success. He said that he is optimistic. He hopes for  success and believes in it. The president understands that not  everyone will sign this document, but the main political forces  and groups will sign it. In our view, the necessary mass of  political will toward an accord will be created -- not just  created, but registered as well.</p>

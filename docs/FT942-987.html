			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Tighter absence controls revealed Companies have tightened absence controls because of government moves to shift the cost of sickness benefit from the state to employers, says an independent employment agency. Incomes Data Services has found that in spite of government assurances that lower National Insurance contributions would compensate for the higher burden on employers of sick pay, many employers still feared that they would be be inadequately re-imbursed. The report adds that while a Confederation of British Industry report found that the cost of absence to UK businesses was Pounds 11bn last year, equivalent to eight days per employee, companies believe that fear of redundancy is maintaining a downward pressure on absences. The report recommends that companies establish formal absence policies alongside the compilation of regular absence statistics. Some companies, such as Kodak and Yorkshire Chemicals, have introduced attendance bonuses for their workforce. Employees at Yorkshire Chemicals can receive an attendence bonus of up to Pounds 210 a year. Absence &amp; Sick Pay Policies (IDS Study 556). 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

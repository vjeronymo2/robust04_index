			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend boost for RBOS News that Mr Peter Wood, a director of Royal Bank of Scotland and one of the founders of the bank's hugely successful Direct Line telephone insurance business, had bought more than 2m shares in the bank set the seal on a scintillating performance by RBOS shares. They were easily the best performer in the FT-SE 100, racing up to a peak 435p before reacting to close 33 higher at 428p, a rise of almost 8.5 per cent. Turnover in the stock reached 16m, by far the highest in a single trading session since last August when Scottish Equitable sold a block of 20m shares at 286p. Earlier the market had lifted the shares substantially after RBOS announced preliminary profits of Pounds 265m and a 25 per cent increase in the dividend, both figures being well in excess of the most optimistic analysts' forecasts, which ranged up to around Pounds 230m. Earnings predictions for the current year were quickly hoisted to above the Pounds 450m mark, with dividend estimates being lifted to around 13p. Bank specialists focused on RBOS's rapidly improving bad debt situation, and its successful cost control moves. They also pointed to the huge benefits to the banks of a low interest rate climate in the UK.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this time, Federal subsistence management program regulations apply to all non-navigable waters located on public lands and to navigable waters located on the public lands identified at 50 CFR 100.3(b) and 36 CFR 242.3(b) of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) published May 29, 1992. Nothing in these regulations is intended to enlarge or diminish authorities of the Departments to manage submerged lands, title to which is held by the United States government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Review Process_Regulation Comments, Proposals, and Public Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments or proposed regulation changes may be submitted in writing to the address identified at the beginning of this rulemaking by November 11, 1994. Comments or proposals may also be presented at Regional Council meetings to be held from October 3&hyph;November 4, 1994 in Anchorage, Barrow, Bethel, Fairbanks, Galena, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Naknek, Nome, and Sitka.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals should be specific to subpart D regulations, including changes to subsistence seasons, harvest limits, and/or methods and means. Proposals submitted to the Board should include, at minimum, the following information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a.

PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN CUSTOMARY AND TRADITIONAL USE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS, CHANGES RELATING TO FISH OR SHELLFISH REGULATIONS, AND CHANGES TO THE OVERALL PROGRAM WILL  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NOT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD AT THIS TIME. The public is encouraged to use standardized proposal forms to submit recommendations to the Board. Proposal forms may be obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the address listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following public distribution of proposals for changes to the 1995&hyph;1996 proposed subpart D regulations, a second 30-day comment period will be provided to allow public review of those proposals that will be considered by the Board. A second series of Regional Council meetings will be held in February 1995, to assist in developing recommendations to the Board. Written comments on proposals may be submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before conclusion of the second comment period which is presently scheduled to end on January 13, 1995. The Board will discuss and evaluate proposed changes to this rule during a public meeting scheduled to be held in Anchorage, April 1995. The public may provide additional oral testimony on specific proposals before the Board at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Record of Decision, Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, April 6, 1992, and the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 36 CFR 242.11 (1992) and 50 CFR 100.11 (1992), and for the purposes identified therein, Alaska has been divided into ten subsistence resource regions, each of which is to be represented by a Regional Council. Charters for these Regional Councils were approved and signed by former Secretary Lujan on January 19, 1993. The Regional Councils provide a forum for rural residents with personal knowledge of local conditions and resource requirements to have a meaningful role in the subsistence management of fish and wildlife on Alaska public lands. The Regional Councils have a substantial role in helping residents of the region reviewing this proposed rule and making comments on it. Presently, the Regional Councils are composed of no fewer than seven and no more than thirteen members who are residents of the region and are knowledgeable of local subsistence concerns. Regional Council members serve a three-year term with one-third of the terms expiring annually. An extensive recruitment effort for new Regional Council members occurs each fall. The Regional Council members represent varied geographical, cultural, and user diversity within each region. Moreover, the Council Chairs present their Council's recommendations at the Board meeting in April 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service, to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964, May 29, 1992) implements the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process. The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0075.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average .1382 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018&hyph;0075), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information collection requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established under Subpart B. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses of public lands indicates that they will not be significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612. Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

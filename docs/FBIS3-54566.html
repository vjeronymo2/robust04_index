			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, Ay Annar [January] 27 Jamahiriyah News  Agency -- The Jamahiriyah news agency's local affairs editor  noted that certain foreign media outlets continue to use  incorrect descriptions and terms when reporting on the General  Peoples Congress, describing the latter as a parliament and  using such terms as `minister' and `president'.    The editor said that the jamahiri system is a contradiction  of the system of representation and parliamentarianism - there  is nothing in Libya which is termed a `parliament'. Power in  Libya is vested in the people, all the people are involved in  decision-making, and it involves everyone of 18 years and over.  The peoples committees are appointed through [words indistinct]  of direct selection to act on the decisions of these people  through peoples committees in all matters related to both  foreign and internal policy of the Great Jamahiriyah.    The General Peoples Congress is the general forum of basic  peoples congresses, peoples committees, trades unions,  federations and vocational syndicates. It does not have the  right to take decisions or to discuss things on behalf of others  but instead formulates the final product of what is originally  decided upon by the basic peoples congresses, the peoples  committees and the secretaries of the trades unions, the  federations and the vocational [words indistinct] syndicates.  They are the members of the [words indistinct] attend the  meeting of the congress carrying with them [passage indistinct].    There is no such thing as a president in the jamahiri  system.  There is only the people. It is they who are the `president',  the `ruler' who themselves have power vested in them, who  determine their own destiny. The peoples congresses are the  `president'. Furthermore, there are no `ministers' in the  jamahiri system who represent the government but there are  secretaries of peoples committees whom are elevated from the  base through the basic peoples congresses throughout the Great  Jamahiriyah with the methods of direct democracy embodied in the  direct, free jamahiri choice. The secretaries of their peoples  committees do not make decisions nor do they formulate foreign  policy on behalf of the masses but instead are entrusted with  only the implementation of foreign and internal policy which is  drawn up by the masses.    This insistence by the media to use incorrect and  contradictory terms and descriptions to report events in the  Great Jamahiriyah. [sentence as received] It is not ignorance  on their part, of the true nature of events taking place in  Libya, involving the popular system and genuine democracy,  practiced by a sovereign free people through the unique jamahiri  system where peoples congresses make decisions and peoples  committees act on these decisions, but is a deliberate attempt  to cover up this great achievment by the Libyan people, who are  heralding a new era where all forms of repression, tyranny,  exploitation and subjugation are eliminated. It is the era of  the masses where the people have power vested in them, and are  self determining, without representation or go-betweens, whether  an individual or government, whether political party or faction  or tribe.    This fallacious appraisal can only be considered as part of  a  powerful muscle flexing war against the aspirations of a small  nation, making a mockery of its freedom aspiring attempts. It  is thus a war against humankind where the powerful tyrants are  trying to deprive humankind from benefitting from an important  experience such as Libya's. At this time, where the world is  experiencing destructive conflicts and protests, which never  cease due to the conventional systems' inability to solve the  political problems they are facing, namely the problem of power,  economic problems and the resulting social ills and disasters.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank worries erase early European gains European government bond markets opened higher yesterday as traders responded positively to the previous day's rise in US interest rates. However, worries about the Bundesbank's intentions soon erased the early price gains and many markets ended lower. 'The reaction to the Fed rate rise has been transitory,' said one analyst. The German central bank is due to hold a policy-making meeting today after its four-week summer break. Dealers were unnerved by a German press report suggesting that some Bundesbank council members were in favour of a rate cut by September on the view that it would be justified by a further slowdown in German M3 money supply. Some analysts said a rate cut in Germany would be inappropriate against the backdrop of rising interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic and the stronger-than-expected economic growth in Germany. They added that the most likely move from the Bundesbank would be a cut of 5 basis points in the repo rate. 'The long end of the German yield curve would not like a rate cut just as everyone is revising yield forecasts upwards,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg. He added that it was important for the Bundesbank to nurture its credibility with the market in view of its large issuance programme. He noted that yesterday's Treuhand auction of five-year notes was not a resounding success, with only DM1.65bn worth allocated to the market and the Bundesbank retaining a fairly large amount, DM1.35bn, for market tending operations. On Liffe, the September bund future went as high as 92.42 but in late trading it was quoted at 91.59, down 0.35 point on the day in volume of 155,231 lots. In London, the UK government bond market continued to outperform its European counterparts but early gains were also largely erased. Long-dated gilt futures rose by as much as 1 1/2 points following news that the July retail prices index was up 2.3 per cent year-on-year, below the market's consensus forecast of 2.6 per cent. However, analysts warned that such a good number had only delayed but not removed the likelihood of a base rate rise. The data caused the yield differential between 10-year gilts and bunds to narrow by 20 basis points to 147 basis points, the low end of the current range. Analysts said gilts would need a further boost to break below this range. On Liffe, the September long gilt future hit an intraday high of 102 but by the late afternoon it stood at 101 7/16 , up  5/16 point on the day in volume of 97,179 lots. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday afternoon when a surge in oil prices prompted the market to give back some of the gains struck on Tuesday's monetary tightening. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at 101 7/32 , with the yield rising to 7.392 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 15/16 , to yield 6.140 per cent. Bonds across the board held steady in the early hours of trading, as the market sought to regain its balance after Tuesday's surge in prices at the long end. The rally had been triggered by the central bank's decision to lift two short-term interest rates in an effort to slow the economy's rate of growth. The move to boost both the discount rate and the Federal Funds target rate by 50 basis points each - to 4.00 per cent and 4.75 per cent, respectively - was welcomed by traders because it reinforced the Fed's credentials as anti-inflation stalwart. In choosing the bold alternative - as opposed to pushing up the Fed Funds target by a modest 25 basis points - the central bank also signalled the beginning of a period of relative calm. The subsequent surge in prices prompted some profit taking, holding bonds across the board close to their opening values. However, a big rise in crude oil prices began to tug at the market's inflation fears during the late afternoon. As a consequence, the long bond was showing a moderate loss as the session drew to a close.</p>

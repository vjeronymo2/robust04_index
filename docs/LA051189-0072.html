			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: CONTROVERSY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT, INTO THE VALLEY OF SPORTS . . .  </P> <P> Just leave civilization for 10 days and watch what happens to the world of  sports hereabouts.  </P> <P> What had been a placid pond has turned into a boiling caldron.  </P> <P> Everything had been going so smoothly. The Padres had made the transition from  Camp Tranquility to an Appetizing April. The Chargers were applauding the  fruits of their draft. Even the Sockers were sailing comfortably into the  playoffs. Cup-of-tea time.  </P> <P> It's amazing how quickly things can get turned upside down by controversies and  concerns.  </P> <P> THE BEATHARD CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard, who directs football operations for the Washington Redskins,  announces that he is resigning. He does what he does as well as anyone in the  National Football League, so he is obviously an attractive face to unexpectedly  hit the marketplace.  </P> <P> Alex Spanos, who owns the Chargers, recognizes this. He says he would like to  hire Bobby Beathard.  </P> <P> Steve Ortmayer just happens to be employed by the Chargers, and he just happens  to do what Beathard does.  </P> <P> I have heard that you can never have too many good wide receivers or offensive  linemen or cornerbacks, but I have never heard it said that you can never have  too many good directors of football operations.  </P> <P> Maybe one of them can play quarterback and solve . . .  </P> <P> THE QUARTERBACK CONCERN  </P> <P> One thing the Chargers do not have is a quarterback controversy. These are  caused by abundance rather than absence. These are caused by having both Norm  Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield on the same roster.  </P> <P> The Chargers, in the midst of mini-camp, are auditioning . . .  </P> <P> * A veteran who was the lowest-rated NFL quarterback for the past two years.  </P> <P> * A youngster coming off a severe knee injury.  </P> <P> * A journeyman whose most endearing credential is that he happens to know the  offense.  </P> <P> * A rookie whose last game was against Oklahoma State in Tokyo.  </P> <P> You all come. There's still time to get in line.  </P> <P> THE BENNY BENCHING  </P> <P> Never on Sunday. That's when Benito Santiago doesn't play catcher for the  Padres. That's Parent's Day.  </P> <P> Not lately.  </P> <P> I turned on the television Tuesday night, of all times, and there was Mark  Parent behind the plate. And he had been there Saturday night as well as his  usual Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> How badly was Santiago hurt? Not at all, except maybe for pride. Suddenly, the  man who was supposedly the best at his business in the game today was unhappily  camped on the bench.  </P> <P> It seems Jack McKeon was making a point. A catcher who can throw strikes so  well ought to concentrate a little more on hitting them.  </P> <P> Santiago was swinging at anything airborne near the plate. That must be why the  moths are gone from the stadium.  </P> <P> GETTING SIDEKICKED  </P> <P> The Too-Smooth Sockers had the home-arena advantage in their Major Indoor  Soccer League semifinal series with the Dallas Sidekicks, until they took care  of it at the Sports Arena Saturday night.  </P> <P> With a one game-to-zero advantage, they cleverly turned a 4-2 fourth-period  lead into a 5-4 defeat.  </P> <P> And so now they go to Dallas Friday with the home-arena disadvantage. Most  teams would consider this to be an uncomfortable predicament, but not the  Sockers.  </P> <P> These guys think adversity is an entree.  </P> <P> MUSICAL LINEMEN  </P> <P> Forgive me if I get the impression that the Chargers are putting their  offensive line together by having contestants dance around chairs and see who  ends up where when the music stops.  </P> <P> Last year's right guard is now a backup center, when he's not working at left  tackle.  </P> <P> The 13-year starter at center will learn to play guard.  </P> <P> Last year's right tackle will learn to play guard.  </P> <P> Neither of last year's regular left tackles seem to land anywhere but in a  whirlpool.  </P> <P> Last year's left guard is probably being groomed to be either quarterback or  director of football operations.  </P> <P> THE RASMUSSEN BLUES  </P> <P> Having noted that Dennis Rasmussen has developed a propensity for giving away  the store in the first inning or two, I have a solution.  </P> <P> Where is it written that Mark Davis' two innings have to be at the end of the  game?  </P> <P> Give Davis the ball for the first two innings, and then turn it over to  Rasmussen.  </P> <P> These might not be the most wild and crazy of controversies and concerns, but  face it. They're all we have.  </P> <P> San Diego State tried to help. Al Luginbill, a bit of a controversy himself as  football coach, tried to convince the world all along that his quarterback job  was up for grabs when everyone knew all along it would be Dan McGwire.  </P> <P> Nice try, Al. We appreciate the effort.  </P></p>

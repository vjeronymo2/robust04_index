			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Practical Traveller: A supersonic experience - David Pilling tries (and fails) to travel cheaply on Concorde CONCORDE is for the seriously rich. A standard British Airways return fare to New York costs Pounds 5,030 plus tax - Pounds 670 per hour on board - while a cheap-day Concorde return is priced at Pounds 4,156. It may be a soul-stirring experience to arrive in New York an hour and 10 minutes before you departed - the flight leaves daily at 10.30am and touches down at JFK at 9.20am - but most souls can be stirred for a much more modest sum. Before you despair of breaking the sound barrier, however, there may be cheaper options. Be warned, though: I said cheaper options; cheap I did not say. For the absolute miser - in Concorde terms this represents someone with Pounds 500 or so to blow on 20 minutes of supersonic bliss - you could fly to France. Paris Travel Service (tel: 0920-467-467) has chartered Concorde five times next year and will, for Pounds 598, whisk you to Paris for a night. On the outbound flight, Concorde takes a detour over the Bay of Biscay where it slips into supersonic realms. Returnees limp home on scheduled subsonic flights. The first 1993 departure is April 25. The same company sometimes has last-minute deals on unsold seats, which it sells as day trips, usually for a little under Pounds 300. Goodwood Travel (0227-764-949) specialises in Concorde charters and has, in its nine-year history, flown to 39 destinations. Next year you can be sped to St Petersburg (for the Kirov), Moscow (for the Bolshoi), Monaco (for the grand prix) or Cairo (for the hell of it). Prices range from about Pounds 925 (Paris) to Pounds 2,250 (Egypt, including a seven-day Nile cruise and time in Luxor). If you get your skates on, you could fly to Finnish Lappland for Christmas, including the opportunity - should you wish - of visiting the Santa Claus village. Goodwood's Lappland departures this month start at Pounds 1,295. Another Concorde idea for the festive season is the so-called Atlantic Time Tunnel which offers the chance to celebrate New Year's Eve twice in the same year. Passengers, paying Pounds 3,999, celebrate the end of 1992 in Shannon, in the west of Ireland, until half-past-midnight, at which point their champagne is confiscated and they are herded on to Concorde for the three-hour flight to Bermuda. Here they become acquainted with their old friend 1993 for the second time that evening. The Guinness Book of Records will be monitoring the event which, if successful, will be a world first. Two nights later, Concorde takes you on to New York for a Bloomingdale's reception (Dollars 10,000 to spend for one lucky passenger) and from there, on January 3, back to London. For bookings, contact Hogg Robinson (081-897-2525). For those who prefer their supersonic travel at a more leisurely pace, Elegant Resorts (0244-329-671) can fix you up with Concorde extravaganzas to Barbados. For Pounds 2,775 you can secure seven nights in a Treasure Beach ocean view suite (b&amp;b), flying out on Concorde and back on BWIA first class. The standard Concorde return fare to Barbados is Pounds 4,228. On most of the packages mentioned, your planemates are likely to include those for whom Concorde is something special: honeymooners, those celebrating anniversaries and romantics with long-cherished supersonic dreams. They will not be those for whom Concorde is merely a rapid means of shuttling between important meetings in London, New York and Washington. Your fellow travellers are likely to celebrate the supersonic experience with champagne, caviar and an expedition to the cockpit. Scheduled passengers, by all accounts, spend the 3 1/2 -hour transatlantic trip looking underwhelmed (but smart), sipping carbonated water, waving away expensive food and giving the impression that, for them, Concorde is a weekly event.</p>

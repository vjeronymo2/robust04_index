			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) --  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said today at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit that Cuba should return to the Latin  American family of nations but it also must change its political  system.    "I believe the time has come for Cuba to fully join the  community and the judicial and social systems of the continent,"  Caldera said in his speech during the summit's opening session.    Immediately thereafter, the Venezuelan president said: "with  my greatest respect, the time has also come for Cuba to change  its own system, for which the world situation is favorably  disposed."</p>

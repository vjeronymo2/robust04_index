			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Creditanstalt Investment Bank rises in the east - Austria's second largest bank has made a successful strategic thrust There has been considerable sympathy in European financial circles for the plight of Creditanstalt. Austria's second largest bank has been largely paralysed for the past three years because the country's government has repeatedly failed to carry through its promise to complete its privatisation. However, the one area where CA has nevertheless been able to make a significant and successful strategic thrust during this uncertain period is in eastern Europe. The bank itself has opened branches or commercial banking subsidiaries in Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Ljubljana. Meanwhile, a fledgling subsidiary, Creditanstalt Investment Bank, has pushed its way to the top of the league tables alongside the large US and British investment banks in many eastern European investment banking markets. Indeed, CAIB ranks well ahead of its rivals in a listing of 1993 privatisation assignments in eastern Europe by the newsletter Privatisation International, with 30 jobs compared with only 20 for Samuel Montagu, its nearest competitor. That this has happened is all a bit of an accident. CA Investment Bank was created in 1989 to focus on Austrian clients. At the time, Austria still operated with a house bank tradition under which it was impossible for a bank to charge its large corporate clients for advisory services. 'We wanted to get them used to paying for M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) services,' Mr Wolfgang Lafite, CAIB managing director, says. The bank was capitalised at a mere Sch10m and sent on its way. However, after the Iron Curtain lifted, it became apparent that there was a great need for corporate finance services in many of the eastern European countries and a wide open field for those who could provide them. 'We went systematically into all the countries where we thought Austria and Creditanstalt could play a role,' Mr Lafite says. In general, that meant all the former countries of the Austro-Hungarian empire where ties of language and business custom could be levered. Today, CAIB has offices in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw, Bratislava and Sofia and has just opened in Bucharest. Its range of activities has expanded from corporate finance to securities business and private banking. CAIB's first major assignment in 1989 was a private placement for Graboplast, the Hungarian plastics group which went public earlier this year. The bank has gone on to become the largest issuing house and broker on the volatile Budapest market. Its other coup was to plunge into the radical mass privatisation programme in what was then Czechoslovakia in mid-1992. It was the only foreign bank to set up a voucher investment fund to help Czech citizens channel their stakes in the first round of privatisation of some 1,500 companies, and its fund is still the sixth largest in the Czech Republic. 'No other foreign bank was so optimistic, and that gives us a very profitable business, plus a platform for our securities and corporate finance businesses,' says Mr Lafite. Largely because of its experience in the Czech Republic, CAIB is the only foreign bank leading one of the 17 consortia that are on the short-list of Poland's forthcoming mass privatisation programme. Now it is eyeing Bulgaria and Romania. Last year, it advised Amylum, a US-UK-Belgian consortium that bought a Dollars 20m maize products plant at Razgrad in Bulgaria. 'Mass privatisation programmes are bound to happen,' says Mr Lafite, although he expects they will follow the Russian model with an explosion of secondary market activity following free distributions of shares. The bank has made profits every year since its foundation, and half of its present Sch110m capital comes from retained earnings. Mr Lafite says the bank has been careful to be aware of its limitations. It has eschewed Moscow, for example, where CS First Boston made a killing last year, feeling that it has no special leverage there. CAIB has neither the skills nor the capital to compete with the big US and UK banks on the few very large deals that come along. Instead, the bank points out to the large numbers of small and medium-sized eastern European companies that it is their neighbour and is exclusively committed to their region. There is, of course, a danger in this. As Mr Lafite says: 'We have all our eggs in this basket. If the clock is ever turned back . . . .'</p>

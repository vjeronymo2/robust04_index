			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Calderon] </F>   [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli  Rivas has said that relations between Venezuela and Colombia  remain excellent after the Venezuelan candidate for OAS  secretary general withdrew from the race. These relations were  never affected by the campaign for the post of OAS secretary  general, he added. "Relations are excellent and will remain so"  despite the struggle for the post, he said.    A number of vehicles stolen in Venezuela, taken to Colombia,  and returned by Colombian authorities in a joint effort by the  Colombian-Venezuelan border commissions, will arrive in the  country next week, the minister said, although the information  had already been published.    Venezuela succeeded in having the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency sign an agreement to lift the ban on  reformulated Venezuelan gasoline, Burelli Rivas said. He also  said that PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the Foreign Trade  Institute, the Energy and Mines Ministry, and the Foreign  Ministry also succeeded in having the EU accept orimulsion  [water-emulsified fuel] in their markets.    The delegation that will represent Venezuela during next  Sunday's OAS session is made up of the deputy foreign minister  and the ambassador to the organization, Guido Grooscos. The  latter will vote on behalf of the country during the election  for secretary general. Demetrio Boesner was designated acting  director general of the Foreign Ministry.    Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will visit  Venezuela in the second half of June to improve bilateral ties  and discuss ways to improve trade between the two countries.    The president of the prime minister's cabinet is scheduled  to  arrive in Caracas in the middle of May to agree on the items  that Cavaco Silva will discuss during his stay. The information  was confirmed by the Portuguese ambassador during a visit to the  foreign minister's office.</p>

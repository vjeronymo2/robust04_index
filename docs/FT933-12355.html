			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria to sell its Bayernwerk stake to Viag THE German state of Bavaria is selling its majority stake in Bayernwerk, the country's third-largest utility, to Viag, the energy-based conglomerate. The Bavarian government is swapping its 58.3 per cent stake in Bayernwerk for a 25 per cent stake in Viag, in addition to DM1bn (Dollars 588m). The deal will mean Viag will move its headquarters from Bonn to Munich, and be able to expand its energy base. The share exchange will lead to the merger of two companies which already have close ties. The merged group will have an annual turnover of more than DM40bn, and 100,000 employees. The deal is seen as a two-pronged strategy by the Bavarian government to attract larger companies to the state and speed up privatisation. Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister, denied he was selling off the 'family silver'. The government maintains it is determined to boost, as well as diversify, the state's industrial base, partly through privatisation. The deal, which will be sealed later this year at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Viag, lifted Viag's shares DM6 to DM392.50. The merger will also give Bayernwerk, released from state control, greater freedom in the capital and stock markets, as well as opportunities to diverse and invest outside Germany. It could also place the new company in a stronger position to compete abroad with RWE Energie, the German market leader, and the Veba unit PreussenElektra, the runner-up. Mr Max Streibl, former prime minister of Bavaria, had resisted moves to relinquish control over Bayernwerk or to introduce privatisation on broad scale. Viag and Bayernwerk already have a close relationship. Before the merger, Viag owned 39 per cent of Bayernwerk, and the latter held a 24.9 per cent stake in Viag. In addition, Mr Jochen Holzer is chairman of the supervisory board of Viag, and chairman of Bayernwerk.</p>

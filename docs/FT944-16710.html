			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Arts: The orchestra reinvented - Concert The BBC Symphony calls its current Berlioz celebration on the South Bank, 'Reinventing the Orchestra'. On Monday, again with Andrew Davis conducting, we had two striking examples of that: one by Berlioz himself, the early overture Les Francs-juges, and Kaija Saariaho's 1990 Du Cristal. The climax of the concert, however, was Berlioz's great Te Deum, for large orchestra, organ and triple chorus, which is not so much 'reinvention' as magisterial consolidation. Les Francs-juges went with brilliant sonorities and clatter, obviously inspired by Weber (think of the Freischutz overture) but no less obviously French and confidently original. Berlioz composed the first version at 23; David Cairns' excellent programme-notes speculated that in later drafts - the original is lost - it acquired authority as well as a lot more instruments. Now, however, we know the even earlier Messe solenelle, 'lost' but recently rediscovered, from which much music was to be recycled in his mature scores. And though it acquired refinements in its various new dresses, the pristine inventions of the original were astounding from the start: no wonder that Berlioz used to be unjustly reputed as an extraordinary orchestrator but an amateurish composer. It takes time to realise that the music and the 'effects' are indissoluble. There is no mistaking that in the Te Deum, where the grandeur of the 'Tibi omnes' and above all the 'Judex crederis' - in Cairns's memorable phrase, 'swaying between terror and splendour like the swing of an enormous bell' - are wholly musical. The Davis performance was splendid, with the Philharmonia Chorus vying with the orchestra in weight and depth, and John Aler a moving tenor soloist. The New London Children's Choir was well up to standard too. One regretted just a little the dryness of the Royal Festival Hall acoustic. The solemn opening chords, for example, alternating between orchestra and organ, were designed for the reverberant church of St. Eustache; here there was only dead air between them. The grand organ part was well played by Malcolm Hicks, but much subdued by the closed upper doors before the organ-pipes. Surely a mistake? - even if the requirements of the live broadcast made it seem prudent. The Festival Hall organ cannot be at the opposite end from the orchestra, as Berlioz intended, but it can roar, and it didn't. Miss Saariaho's Du Cristal is a study in soft, infinitely refined orchestral densities. It fields a synthesiser and any amount of percussion. Little by little, one perceives slow harmonic breakdown and change as if through deep water - or behind crystal, as her title suggests, or even ice (she is Finnish, and the score has a distinct Nordic atmosphere). On the surface tiny tunelets float and bob; just occasionally, the variously deployed orchestral sections come together in hammered ostinati. It holds and tantalises the ear, to mysterious expressive effect. When we can hear it together with its companion-piece, a 'capricious' double concerto called . . . a la fumee, more may be revealed. One cannot but be intrigued by learning that the solo cello-trill that ends Du Cristal so delicately is also the first sound in . . . a la fumee. Sponsored by Land Rover.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Chandigarh, May 4 -- The Akali Dal (Longowal) today  revolted against the newly-formed Akali Dal and rejected the  "Amritsar Declaration" made by the six-member committee, report  UNI and PTI.    The former Home Minister and the Akali Dal (Longowal)  general  secretary, Captain Kanwaljit Today Singh, said the declaration  violated the spirit of the Guru Granth Sahib and "I completely  and thoroughly reject it."    Describing the declaration as "anti-Sikh, anti-Punjabi and  anti-nation", the Akali leader appealed to the Sikh masses also  to reject it.    Meanwhile, the president of the Akali Dal (Mann), Mr  Simranjit Singh Mann, today asked the Centre and the State  Government to impose a ban on the Shiromani Akali Dal and warned  that the Akalis would not entertain threats from any quarter.    Addressing a press conference here, he said the Akali Dal  leaders are meeting at the Akal Takht on May 6 to discuss the  threat reportedly held out by the Union Home Minister, Mr S. B.  Chavan, and the Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Beant Singh, and to  chalk out the future course of action.    When asked whether Mr Parkash Singh Badal would also attend  the meeting, he said: "I hope that all Akali Dal leaders would  attend the meeting."    Referring to reports that Mr Badal would show his strength  at  the Akal Takht, Mr Mann said: "One should show humility and not  strength at the Akal Takht."    He said that the Akali Dal would not contest the  by-elections  in Punjab as it felt that the elections would not be free and  fair. He said that the Dal would participate in future elections  but the same should be held in the presence of the SAARC and the  Commonwealth observers. He said the Dal proposed to write to the  Chief Election Commissioner making such a request.    The desperate stand of the Akali Dal leaders at Amritsar  would prove disastrous as it was an attempt to "rekindle the  flames of violence", he added.    The Minister of State for Public Health and Public  Relations,  Mr Surendra Kapoor, today appreciated Capt Kanwaljit Singh's  decision in rejecting the so-called "Amritsar Declaration"  adopted by the newly-formed Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)  seeking a separate area for the Sikhs.    Meanwhile, the Punjab unit of the CPI(M) today described the  "Amritsar Declaration" of the newly formed Akali Dal as "most  unfortunate development", saying it would provide "strong  ideological basis to the secessionist forces."    In a statement here, the party State secretary, Mr Mangat  Ram  Pasla, said: "The declaration is not only similar to the  Anandpur Sahib resolution of 1973 but it also legitimises the  activities of Khalistani marauders".</p>

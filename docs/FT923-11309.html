			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gulf worries depress share prices CONCERN over mounting tensions in the Middle East dealt a further blow to fragile confidence on the London stock market yesterday. Share prices reacted more severely in the UK than in other European bourses to reports at mid-session that US warships in the Gulf had been placed on alert after the UN inspection team had left Iraq. The FT-SE Index rallied before the close but the day's fall of 22.3 made a total loss over the two week equity trading account of 4.6 per cent. The session opened nervously as the 542.15 fall in the Nikkei Average turned attention back towards the problems of the Japanese markets. But UK equities suffered only minor losses until lunchtime, when a combination of a sell programme from a leading UK house and the unsettling news from the Gulf sent the market into a nosedive. With the September stock index future contract leading the way, the market fell 37.8 to 2,361.7 at the day's low, breaking through the 2,376 support line. A slow rally set in later and the final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,377.2. Government bonds traded quietly, closing just below the best with gains of nearly  1/4 at the long end of the range as traders continued to assess the implications of the government's plans for restraining public spending in the future. In the equity market, poor trading volume remained the principal feature. The day's Seaq total of 495m shares compared with 512.9m on Thursday when the retail or customer component was worth only Pounds 976m, still on the low side for a profitable market. The institutions, which provide the bulk of the customer business in equities, have kept out of the market this week. However, Sharelink, Europe's largest execution only stockbroker, which deals extensively for private investors, said that 60 per cent of these clients had traded on the buy side last week. Traders sounded disappointed by the lack of interest in trading for the new trading account which opened last night, and a further check to confidence came when the finance director of Amstrad, the computer manufacturing group, resigned. But fund managers were pre-occupied yesterday with the close of the Wellcome share flotation. Investment sentiment remained clouded in London, with the developments in Iraq providing further cause for concern in a market unsettled by economic uncertainties. Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained below last year's daily average levels as recession worries depress confidence.</p>

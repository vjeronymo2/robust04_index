			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARSAW VIEWS ITS ROLE IN GERMAN TALKS AS TRIUMPH  </P> <P> Poland on Thursday said its planned inclusion in German reunification talks is  a diplomatic triumph that marks the end of the "Yalta era."  </P> <P> "I think the real end of Yalta took place yesterday," government spokeswoman  Malgorzata Niezabitowska said in a televised statement.  </P> <P> She called the decision "a success for all Poles."  </P> <P> Meeting Wednesday in Bonn, East and West Germany and the major World War II  Allied powers -- the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union --  agreed to invite Poland to discuss border issues during their talks on  reunification.  </P> <P> Niezabitowska said the invitation ended an era that began in 1945 with the  Yalta conference, at which U.S., Soviet and British leaders decided the postwar  shape of Europe.  </P> <P> "I hope this will be a good precedent and that every state from now on will be  able to . . . participate at times when its fate is to be decided," she said.  </P> <P> However, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski appeared to raise the stakes  by saying Warsaw wants a voice on topics other than border issues, such as  Germany's political and military situation.  </P></p>

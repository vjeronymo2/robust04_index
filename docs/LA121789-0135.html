			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> DON KING, BOB ARUM -- WOULD THEY BE MISSED?  </P> <P> Impertinent questions:  </P> <P> If promoters Don King and Bob Arum disappeared from the fight scene, would  anybody even bother dragging the river?  </P> <P> With an average of 36,000 no-shows at their last two home games, how soon will  it dawn on New York Jets owner Leon Hess that his is one sorry operation?  </P> <P> Because 225 million homes throughout Europe and Asia have access to National  Hockey League games already, how soon will it be before the league goes  hemispheric?  </P> <P> Considering the football season Occidental College had -- whipping up on rival  Whittier, 7-0, and finishing 7-2 -- isn't it now apparent that Dr. John B.  Slaughter left the chancellor's job at Maryland to be with a winner?  </P> <P> And, in the light of subsequent events, can you believe Slaughter still won't  admit the hiring of basketball coach Bob Wade might have been a mistake?  </P> <P> Is it possible a gent won $3 million playing baccarat at The Mirage in Las  Vegas the night before the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran snooze?  </P> <P> Do any of those dudes looking for a football coach at Navy -- admirals,  commanders, captains and a guy from the math department -- have a say, or are  they yes-men to the athletic director?  </P> <P> With Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, Clemson and Maryland  down in the rankings from No. 20 to No. 90, is this the weakest ACC basketball  season in decades?  </P> <P> Can anyone think of a bigger sacrifice than the one Kent Hrbek just made,  accepting a third-best offer of $14 million for five seasons so he could play  ball in his native Minnesota? That's at least worth a statue outside the  ballpark when he's gone.  </P> <P> Do I remember right or are the contracts free-agent ballplayers are dragging  down these days outstripping what the Orioles and Yankees were purchased for in  the '70s?  </P> <P> Does anyone seriously believe that of the 300 or so Division I college teams  playing hoops only 11 deserve to be on probation at the present time?  </P> <P> You mean it took a gang of archeologists digging for a couple of months to  discover Babe Ruth's old man ran a saloon where the center field fence of  Camden Follies will stand? John Steadman, a Baltimore Evening Sun columnist,  told me that at least a year ago.  </P> <P> With news that the Suns are going to toss in about $15 million toward the  construction of a new arena in Phoenix, Ariz., can we now expect the Orioles to  let us know how much they're tossing into the pot for the new ballpark?  </P> <P> With a strike war chest well in excess of $100 million, is there any doubt the  baseball owners plan a hard-line approach in basic agreement talks with the  players? Of course, they'll cave in as usual.  </P> <P> The Pac-10 is dropping its season-ending conference basketball tourney, which  is staged over a long weekend, because the players are losing too much class  time. Believe it? Now the NCAA tourney, that's a different story. It only goes  for three weeks.  </P> <P> Has any tennis player ever pulled a bigger fade than Mats Wilander, dropping  from three Grand Slam titles in '88 to just one quarterfinal appearance in the  big four this year?  </P> <P> Has anyone noticed ol' Spunky (Earl Weaver) has his Gold Coast Suns up to  within nine games of first place in the Southern Division of the Seniors  Baseball League? What do you mean, no?  </P> <P> Isn't the reason John Thompson schedules games against Hawaii-Loa, Florida  International, St. Leo's and Shenandoah Conservatory of Music to prove that he  does what he damn well pleases at Georgetown?  </P></p>

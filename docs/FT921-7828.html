			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / British MPs express gloomy view on east THE failure of democratic politics to deliver improved living standards in eastern Europe could lead to the re-emergence of autocratic regimes, the foreign affairs committee of the Britain's House of Commons said yesterday. In a gloomy report on the outlook for the former communist bloc, the committee described as 'too sanguine' the views expressed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. He told the committee that recent experience of totalitarian rule in these countries has 'for the time being inoculated them against' the authoritarian temptation. The report urged the UK and its EC partners to take every kind of supportive measure to strengthen economic and political reforms but underlined that 'help is likely to be a difficult and extremely expensive task'. Should democracy fail, however, 'the emergence of authoritarian nationalist, demagogic regimes on the borders of the planned European Union would raise a host of problems and threaten its planned common foreign and security policy.' On security questions the report called for 'the gradual evolution of a single, coherent system to ensure European security'.</p>

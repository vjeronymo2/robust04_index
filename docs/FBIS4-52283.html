			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The government is expected  to announce its official position soon on the Samsung business  group's bid to enter the automobile manufacturing business, it  was reported Monday.    A senior official at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and  Energy said that Minister Kim Chol-su is scheduled to leave for  Mexico next Sunday and the government is likely to announce its  decision on Samsung before he departs.    Another official said that as far as he knows, "This problem  has already been decided."    For the sake of formality rather than anything else, he  added, the government is holding discussions with Samsung and  the Chamber of Commerce in the southern port of Pusan, where  Samsung hopes to build car manufacturing plants.    Samsung, one of the country's largest conglomerates, plans  to  submit for government approval its technology cooperation  agreement with Nissan Motor Co. of Japan to produce passenger  cars in Korea.</p>

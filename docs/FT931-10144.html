			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / People: Mathieson returns to Rover One of the more senior Eindhoven-based sales and marketing executives of DAF, the collapsed Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is back at a desk within the UK's Rover Group. The return to Rover of Sandy Mathieson (right), who is to become commercial director of Rover's UK car sales, reunites some of the key figures who in the 1980s shaped the fortunes of DAF's Birmingham-based vans subsidiary. The latter is now - like the rest of DAF's UK operations - in the hands of receivers. Mathieson's welcome back on board at Rover, formerly British Leyland, is courtesy of George Simpson, Rover's chairman. Simpson himself is a former managing director of Leyland DAF, appointed soon after the formerly UK State-owned Leyland truck and van operations were merged with DAF, under Dutch control, in 1987. Simpson first made his name, however, by turning round the vans operation - then known as Freight Rover - into a profitable enterprise in the years leading up to the DAF takeover. Mathieson was his right-hand-man as sales and marketing director. Mathieson will also be joining Graham Morris, managing director of Rover Europe, who oversees sales and marketing operations for Rover cars and Land Rover/Range Rover 4wd vehicles throughout Europe.</p>

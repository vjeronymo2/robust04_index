The proposed changes include amendments to conform the interference rules to 35 U.S.C. 104 as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993) (North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act) and a number of clarifying and housekeeping amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be submitted no later than November 30, 1994.

Amendments Responsive to Adoption of Public Law 103&hyph;182 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Several of the proposed amendments to the interference rules (i.e., 37 CFR 1.601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are responsive to Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993) (North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act), which amended 35 U.S.C. 104 to permit reliance on activities occurring in a ``NAFTA country'' to prove a date of invention. Paragraph (b) of &sect;104 as amended states that ``the term `NAFTA country' has the meaning given that term in section 2(4) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.'' That section of Public Law 103&hyph;182 has been codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301(4), which reads: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> (4) NAFTA Country <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided in section 3332 of this title, the term ``NAFTA country'' means_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Canada for such time as the [North American Free Trade] Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States applies the Agreement to, Canada; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Mexico for such time as the Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States applies the Agreement to, Mexico. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 37 CFR 1.601 by adding a new paragraph (r) defining the term ``NAFTA country'' and ``non-NAFTA country'' and to amend the following interference rules, which set forth the requirements for preliminary statements, so as to permit reliance on activities occurring in a NAFTA country: &sect;&sect;1.622(b), 1.623(a), 1.624(a) and 1.628(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR 1.684, which relates to the taking of testimony in a foreign country, is proposed to be deleted and reserved in view of proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;1.671 and 1.672. Section 1.671 is proposed to be amended by redesignating paragraph (h) as paragraph (i) and adding new paragraphs (h) and (j). New paragraph (h) would set forth the requirements for a motion &sect;1.635 to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign country. New paragraph (j) would provide that the weight to be given testimony taken in a foreign country will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Little, if any, weight would be given to testimony taken in a foreign country unless the party taking the testimony proves by clear and convincing evidence (1) that giving false testimony in an interference proceeding is punishable as perjury under the laws of the foreign country where the testimony is taken and (2) that the punishment in a foreign country for giving such false testimony is similar to the punishment for perjury committed in the United States. The proposed amendments to &sect;1.672 include amending paragraphs (a) and (b), redesignating current paragraphs (c) through (f) as paragraphs (e) through (h) and adding new provisions identified as paragraphs (c) and (d). Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would limit a party's case-in-chief testimony to affidavits, except where testimony is to be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24 or compelled from a party or in a foreign country. New paragraph (c) would provide that where an opponent objects to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted with an affidavit, the opponent must file and serve objections stating with particularity the nature of the objection, to which the party may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and supplemental official records and printed publications. New paragraph (c) further would provide that any objections to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted with a supplemental affidavit shall be by a motion to suppress under &sect;1.656(h). New paragraph (d) of &sect;1.672 would require any cross-examination of affiants to be by deposition within the United States, which is defined in current &sect;1.601(p) as the United States of America, its territories and possessions. New paragraph (d) of &sect;1.672 would require that the party whose witness is to be cross-examined notice the deposition under &sect;1.673(e), obtain a court reporter and provide a translator of the witness will not testify in English. Although not set forth in the proposed rules, any party attending the deposition can bring its own translator or the parties can agree to share the cost of single mutually agreeable translator. Paragraphs (g) and (h) of &sect;1.671 as proposed to be amended would provide that a party seeking to compel testimony or production of documents or things pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 24 or to compel testimony or production from a party or in a foreign country would have to first file a &sect;1.635 motion to obtain permission from an administrative patent judge. A motion to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign country would have to show that the witness has been asked to testify in the United States and has refused to do so or that the individual or entity having possession, custody, and control of the document or thing has refused to produce the document or thing in the United States, even though the moving party has offered to pay the expenses involved in bringing the witness or the document or thing to the United States. When permission has been obtained from the administrative patent judge, the party, after also complying with the current requirements for an oral conference (&sect;1.673(g)) and service of documents and a proffer of access to things (&sect;1.673(b)), would be required to notice the deposition under &sect;1.673(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

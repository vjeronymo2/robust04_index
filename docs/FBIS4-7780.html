			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, April 5 (TANJUG) -- A spokesman for the U.N.  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Ron Redmond, said on  Tuesday that the situation in the regions of Banja Luka and  Prijedor (northern Bosnia-Herzegovina) has stabilized since last  week but that UNHCR was concerned about the fierceness of  fighting around Gorazde (eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina).    The tragic events in Prijedor (northwest Bosnian Serb  Republic) which killed 16 civilians, mostly Moslems, between  March 29 and April 1, broke out after the Moslem army delivered  six massacred Serb bodies to the Prijedor authorities.    The representatives of the local authorities and the ruling  Serb Democratic Party (SDS) strongly condemned these murders on  Tuesday. The enquiry conducted so far showed that many persons  had participated in the killings and that they were committed  for gain, while the Prijedor police underscored that they would  persist with solving of each particular case.    Redmond set out that UNHCR was concerned about the  development of the situation in Gorazde where heavy fighting was  going on, and said that according to the latest U.N. report  from Gorazde no UNHCR convoy had been allowed to enter the town  since March 22.    U.N. Security Council President Colin Keating said on Monday  that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] statements showed that the  Moslems had provoked the latest fighting with Serbs in Gorazde.    The heavy Moslem offensive on Serb positions and villages  was  launched from Gorazde in late March, although the town should  have been demilitarized as a U.N. protected area last spring.  Over 10,000 Moslem troops are engaged in the operations.    After signing the Washington Agreement to form a  Moslem-Croat  Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in March, the Moslems launched  an all-out offensive on the Bosnian Serb Republic in an attempt  to gain as much territory as possible before the resumption of  the peace talks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Human Development Minister Enrique Ipina; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] [PRESENCIA] Will there be changes in the  secretariats of the Ministry of Human Development (MDH) because  of the cabinet crisis?    [Ipina] The new arrangement does not affect the Law of  Ministries structure, which clearly defines the responsibilities  of the MDH. These responsibilities--which are substantive and  are not to be considered incidental--must be carried out by  well-defined executive organs, and the system of secretariats  that we now have in the Ministry fulfills these  responsibilities. Therefore, they will all remain.    [PRESENCIA] But Popular Participation, which had been slated  for the MDH, has been passed to the Ministry of Sustainable  Development....    [Ipina] Popular Participation is unique. It is not an  exclusive function of this ministry, although it is substantive.  In fact, it covers all of the state's powers.    What in fact was formed was a Technical Unit of Popular  Participation (UTPP)--not a secretariat--and a team was  organized that prepared the Popular Participation plan, directed  by Minister Fernando Romero and supported by the national  secretaries.    The plan was the subject of a lengthy discussion. It had  more  than 35 versions, because the president himself took an interest  and personally took charge of directing the discussions in a way  that could be described as merciless: indecisiveness, vagueness,  and improvisation were not tolerated.    [PRESENCIA] Will this unit be passed to the Ministry of  Sustainable Development?    [Ipina] The president is studying that possibility. The UTPP  can fit in the MDH as well as in the Ministry of Sustainable  Development.    I personally believe that it would be better off in  Sustainable Development for one simple reason: I am convinced  that Popular Participation is something that should be above any  suspicion of partisan manipulation, because it reflects the  highest and most substantive policy of the state: the  development of democracy.    In that sense, the UTPP can carry out its responsibilities  with a better public guarantee of party neutrality if it is  headed by an independent minister and not by a supporter of the  government, which is my situation.    With Minister Guillermo Justiniano--a man of proven ability  and honesty, of great commitment to the country--Popular  Participation will have an additional guarantee, visible and  palpable--if the statements by the Executive Power were not  already sufficient--of the government's intention, decision, and  determination that this matter be managed above the interests of  the parties.    [PRESENCIA] What are the general guidelines that you will  establish in the MDH?    [Ipina] I am convinced that the standard of living in our  country cannot be considered suitable for human dignity. We are  a country that is deeply divided into two worlds. One rural,  tremendously impoverished by an urban world that feels insecure,  but that bases its welfare on the exploitation or  hyperexploitation of the rural world.    We have a typical case, for example, in agricultural prices  which, because of the way they are established, pay the smallest  benefit to the peasant.    Thererefore, the policy of human development must  concentrate  precisely on trying to overcome this kind of hyperexploitation  of the countryside by the city, which is also evident in that  the relatively high quality of basic urban services is made  possible only because of the almost total lack of such services  in rural areas. We have to lean toward establishing a system of  equity in the basic social services and support everything that  implies the humane attention of society.    Our greatest concern must be to provide water, sewers,  power,  health, education, enjoyment of and participation in cultural  activities, sports, welfare services for abandoned children and  for the aged, where such services do not exist or are very  scarce, while not forgetting that there are also enormous and  complex needs in urban areas, especially in outlying zones,  where we are witnessing a dramatic phenomenon.    In that sense, our concern for rural areas should not stop  at  the limits of the urban peripheral world. It should enter it,  and this explains the president's determination that there be  integrated treatment, rural and urban, of social problems. Both  have become so merged with one another that the welfare of one  is closely connected to that of the other, and overcoming the  lack of development would be impossible without taking this into  account.    This justifies and explains the Popular Participation Law,  that creates the urban-rural municipality, territorialized,  which transcends the old colonial concept of the urban area and  which gives it the right to concern itself as much with the  province as with the classic city.    [PRESENCIA] Why is there so much opposition from city halls  and civic committees to the Participation Law?    [Ipina] Actually, the opposition is not so great, because,  in  an institutionally democratic country, no one can be against  popular participation. There has been a kind of fear and  nervousness over losing special treatment that the urban world  has enjoyed.    Taking into account that 83 percent of the nation's income  is  concentrated in just three large cities, we can imagine the  state of abandonment of the rural areas, not only of the  provinces, but of the smaller cities, even the capitals of  departments.    Observing this phenomenon and assigning an equitable  distribution of the national income to the municipalities, based  on the number of inhabitants, those who are privileged--the  large cities--obviously are afraid of losing out. And as their  problems are also not resolved, their opposition or contained  resistance explained why the attitude of the municipalities has  been and continues to be very prudent.    [PRESENCIA] But the government has had to accept the fact  that Congress is considering the proposed Administrative  Decentralization Law at the same time as the Popular  Participation Law....    [Ipina] In my opinion, administrative decentralization, as  it  is being put forward, was more in response to the interests of  the large cities. That is why there has been some resistance.    What we are doing now is showing how decentralization at the  departmental level does not conflict with popular participation,  with the allocation of resources to the basic territorial  organizations, to the provinces, and to the small towns.    [PRESENCIA] The health, education, sports, and cultural  areas  are defined. But the others are not: Provincial and Rural  Development; Ethnic, Gender, and Generational Affairs; and  Social Investment, which includes the funds. How do you intend  to orient them?    [Ipina] Good planning for activities of the state begins  with  an analysis of basic social needs. The Plan for Everyone saw  this clearly: an extremely impoverished rural area, a great need  for social services and therefore low productivity by Bolivians.    We saw clearly that we needed to promote and improve rural  and peasant life in Bolivia. Therefore, an objective was  assigned to a perceived need: to energize that neglected area of  national life. And the assignment of an objective calls for the  creation of an instrument: the National Secretariat of Rural  Development.    The same holds true for the National Secretariat of Ethnic,  Gender, and Generational Affairs. There are obvious inequalities  in our country. The most serious of all is ethnic inequality.  The evidence is clear. The great majority of adults who do not  know how to read are indigenous. It is evident that there is  ethnic inequality, and if we analyze further, we find that three  of four who do not know how to read are women. There is evident  inequality by sex difference--as we used to say--or by  gender--as we now say.    In the world of labor, of education, health, culture,  sports,  woman shines by her absence. With very rare exceptions, this  continues to be a country made by men for men, through women who  work for them. This cannot continue. The same is true of youth,  childhood, and old age.    Thus, the Secretariat answers this need, not with welfare  (which is the responsibility of ONAMFA [expansion not given]),  but with a program for improvement, which is different and which  is the responsibility of the Secretariat.    In the case of the Urban Secretariat for Urban Development,  we used to have a Ministry for Urban Affairs and Housing, whose  functions duplicated those of the autonomous municipalities. It  was understandable that there be such a ministry when  municipalities were not autonomous and mayors were handpicked.  But it no longer made any sense once the municipalities were  democratized. However, there is a need for a Secretariat charged  with improving the municipalities, of strengthening them in view  of the need to extend the system to the entire country and not  just to a few cities, and of organizing the entire country into  municipalities. That is its function.    It might seem, then, that the three Secretariats are not  well  defined, but they are, and although the quality of their  services might not yet be appreciated, people will realize how  important they are as they carry out their work.    [PRESENCIA] One sees in your explanation a logical sequence  of the idea of human development. But when it comes to putting  it into practise, the General Budget retains the traditional  tendency to prioritize economics and politics. Why is it  impossible to change that relationship?    [Ipina] I believe that, while there is a change in general  direction that can be seen in a kind of 50-50 division between  economic and social factors (another question is the political  sector, which also takes its slice: the Ministries of Defense  and Government, because of the problems we face in the fight  against drug trafficking, etc.), it seems to remain static  because the pie continues to be small.    We have inherited a pie, furthermore, that is inflated by a  6.5 percent budget deficit. But we could not continue on with  that policy, as it would have caused the loss of one of our  country's great achievements in recent years, macroeconomic  stability.    But when the pie grows, which we hope will happen as a  result  of capitalization, there will be no reason for the economic and  political sectors to grow significantly, and the social sector  will be the only one able to grow.    This means that if we now have 100, which is divided in  40-40-20, when we have 200, the new relationship will be  20-10-70. This is why the pie has to grow.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Educational Reform in a few words </H5>   [PRESENCIA] What are the principal features of Educational  Reform?    [Ipina] There are two central pillars: popular participation  and interculturalism.    The first refers to democratization of the administration of  education, to the very institutionality of the system, which is  to open it to the participation of the community, which must  have the possiblity of assisting in educational tasks and in  administration.    The second pillar is pedagogical in nature and has its major  philosophical orientation in interculturalism, which is the soul  of Reform. This a novel view of an old reality: the  multipluralism of races, cultures, and regions in the country,  which we regard as a comparative advantage, like a natural  resource, like a group of positive factors that make us better  people and, some day, better off economically.    [PRESENCIA] Specifically, how will the education system be  organized?    [Ipina] The reform proposal's philosophy is evident, first,  in the opening of the curriculum to regionalization, on the  basis of common national roots, so that it not only answers  national needs, but also regional and local ones as well.    Second, bilingualism where it is necessary so that children  learn to write in their mother tongue and acquire Castilian as a  second language.    The curriculum is divided into four levels: initial,  primary,  secondary and superior, which is the usual arrangement. The  interesting part is to see what happens within each of them.    The nonformal part of the initial level will be entrusted to  the family and the community; the school will only occupy a  year, in order to be able to extend the service to all children.  At present, we are only teaching 30 percent of the children for  two years; we hope to reach 60 percent soon, for a single year.    At six years of age, the child enters the primary level.  There are no longer any grades, to avoid truancy and being left  back. This phase is conceived as a single level organized by  blocks of objectives that have to be achieved by all pupils,  according to their personal rhythm, so that groups move ahead,  respecting their personal rhythms.    If a child fulfills the objectives of one block, he or she  passes on to the next. There is no first or second grade, etc.,  but rather basic, essential, and applied apprenticeships. An  entire cycle should last eight years at most, but a high  percentage of children can do it in six years, and some even in  five. The slowest will finish in eight. No child should lose a  year or be left back. Therefore, no child should have any reason  to leave school. We want to broaden coverage and retain the  child in school for at least eight years of primary school.    This assumes that the curriculum will contain an  intercultural focus, because regional and cultural diversities,  and individual differences, will be respected.    At the secondary level, there will be a common two-year  period of technical education for everyone, not forgetting  language and mathematics. Then it branches out: two years of  technical education at midlevel and two years of preparation for  university undergraduate education.    In this way as well we will be responding to local and  regional planning needs, because these technical proposals will  be drawn up in each department.    Finally, at the superior level: higher technical and  standard  university courses towards the baccalaureate and doctoral  degrees.    This curriculum follows faithfully the doctrinal  philosophical focus of interculturalism, the soul of the reform.    In sum, Education Reform can be synthesized in two great  concepts: popular participation and interculturalism.    [PRESENCIA] How long will the process of change take?    [Ipina] Something that assumes gradual growth cannot be  implanted overnight. Curriculum changes will begin in 1995,  gradually and progressively. But the institutional changes,  those regarding popular participation, have to be fully achieved  by 1997.    The Technical Support Team for Education (ETARE) has  established a 20-year period as being necessary to appreciate  the magnitude of the results, but these results will be evident  objectively and concretely each year in the way that these  activities are carried out.    [PRESENCIA] Attention will be centered on the primary cycle?    [Ipina] Yes, but the others will also benefit, through  improvement of education. Curriculum reform has two elements:  change and improvement. The first will be applied radically with  those programs that are just beginning; the second, with those  that are already operating.    [PRESENCIA] You have just returned from the United States  where you obtained assistance for education reform. With whom  did you meet and what specific agreements did you bring back?    [Ipina] Together with the negotiating team, I met with the  World Bank (IBRD), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and  representatives of the friendly donor countries, who are making  substantial contributions to the process of educational reform.    We completed the technical discussions and began the formal  negotiating process, which ended in the approval of the terms of  the loan agreement, which must be discussed at senior levels of  the IBRD and the IDB, as well as at high levels of the Bolivian  state, specifically, in the legislature.    When all these agencies have approved the terms, the donor  countries will also contribute, and disbursements will begin  according to the schedules that support the various programs  provided for.    [PRESENCIA] Is the IBRD's pressure over content and form  real, or is this a myth?    [Ipina] I would say at present they are a myth. The IBRD  obviously has experience with educational reform in the various  countries that it has financed and when it begins to talk to the  Bolivian Government, it makes certain proposals. For its part,  the government sits at the same table and explains what it wants  to do.    In this way, a period of technical discussions begins, in  which each side presents its point of view. But there is no  pressure. The proof is that we were practically able to, I will  not say impose, but rather define our position with total  clarity, and the IBRD accepted our terms.    The IBRD's position on certain points also helped us. For  example, its concern for the self-sustaining nature of the  reform in future years, which assumes the existence of a scheme  of macroeconomic projections. It was a requirement of the IBRD,  and we had to work very hard on it. Antonio Sagasta prepared a  study that both the government and the bank found very  satisfactory. If the IBRD had not set that condition, we  probably would not have done it.    [PRESENCIA] Is it true that the IBRD requires a high degree  of consensus with the teachers?    [Ipina] Of course. Not only the IBRD but also the donor  countries and the IDB, who are also interested in the continuity  of the process.    One of the nicest things has been that for the first time a  bank like the IBRD has agreed to finance a project that is not  totally defined from the start, but that is conceived as a  project subject to modification as it evolves, something that it  has never accepted before.    [PRESENCIA] Who are the donor countries?    [Ipina] The Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden are the three.  Other countries might join in as the project develops. They were  undoubtedly waiting for the results of the negotiations with the  IBRD.    [PRESENCIA] How much money is involved?    [Ipina] Approximately $140 million. The IBRD will authorize  $42-45 million, the IDB $55 million, and the donor countries,  all together, $40 million.    To this must be added the national contribution, set at $36  million, which brings us to $176-180 million, which is the  financing for the start-up of educational reform, in its first  seven-year stage, destined basically to primary education in the  transformation stage and to secondary education in the  improvement stage.    After those seven years, we will enter into the preparation  and development of the transformation of secondary education.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  "We Want Opposition" </H5>   Suddenly, Enrique Ipina is asked about a fear that has  arisen: the danger that there might be a tendency toward  hegemony on the part of the government coalition and especially  of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] in the formation  of the basic territorial organizations, provided for in the  Popular Participation Law.    Ipina speaking frankly says that "if we were a one-party  government, we could talk about a desire for hegemony, but we  are not. We are well aware that, even if we did win 36-38  percent of the national vote, this is only a plurality, and we  have formed a coalition government with three other parties that  are very important. One of them, the UCS [expansion not  available], because of the number of votes it won; the other  two, for the quality of their political activity and of their  ideas. The MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] is a great party, beyond  its voting strength, and the same can be said of the MRTKL  [Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement of Liberation] to a  somewhat lesser degree."    He added that, because of "the way in which the work in the  Executive Branch and the Congress is being organized, one cannot  really speak of a movement toward hegemony in the heart of the  coalition. When decisions are taken, one opinion weighs as much  as another, and it is not a question of how many votes one has ,  but of how right one is."    Outside the coalition, Ipina insists that "no tendency  toward  hegemony exists there, either. On the contrary, we are very  concerned over the lack of a political opposition, due to the  problems that are affecting the MIR [Movement of the  Revolutionary Left] and the ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action],  because when the opposition no longer expresses itself  politically, it begins to express itself by other means."    This is becoming serious because, in his opinion, "it does  us  no good either that the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] itself  is suffering deterioration because of a lack of vision by its  leaders and a failure to adapt to changing times."    So that "in the absence of opposition parties and of a  creative labor organization, with whom could one discuss  problems that affect civil society? A political monologue could  easily develop, which is not hegemony, it is poverty, political  pauperization."    Ipina believes for these reasons that the government "would  like to have an organized opposition, find a leader with whom to  talk. The same is true of the labor movement."</p>

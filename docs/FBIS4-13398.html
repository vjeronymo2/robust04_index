			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jordan's Boycott of Negotiations Achieves </F> Objectives"]    [Text] Jordan's absence from the work of the multilateral  negotiations committees naturally affects the performance of  these committees and the feasibility of issues under discussion.    Any talk about regional cooperation in any field in the  post-peace phase will be meaningless without Jordan's  participation for reasons connected with Jordan's position with  all the meaning that this word implies, be it geographic,  political, or historical.    Therefore, Jordan's stand to boycott the multilateral  negotiations, on whose results the features of the post-peace  phase will be drawn up, has started to make its effect felt and  to drive home the message that methods of pressure and blockade  on this country to facilitate the negotiating process will be of  no avail.    It is certain that by sending only an observer to the Muscat  multilaterals, and hinting that the same thing will be done in  the upcoming negotiations in Doha, Cairo, and Rabat as long as  the blockade continues on al-'Aqabah Port and the pressure is  maintained, Jordan is demanding that those who say they want to  establish a lasting peace and a broad regional cooperation in  the Middle East reconsider their stands in light of the  Jordanian position which links a positive Jordanian role in the  negotiations with fair dealings and justice for both Jordan as  well as the Palestinian and Arab peoples who came under  aggression and injustice.    It is hoped that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's  expected visit to Jordan during his upcoming tour of the region  will carry with it a change in the U.S. stand on the blockade  imposed on Jordan's lone maritime lifeline. The United State is  aware of the extent of Jordan's commitment to its  responsibilities toward international resolutions and its  concern to promote the march of regional cooperation and peace  provided that this is done without any encroachment on its  national dignity, pan-Arab commitments, and its belief which was  reiterated on all occasions; namely, that genuine peace is one  based on justice, that it should be acceptable to people who  will coexist with and defend it to pursue the interests of their  future generations and draw benefits from it.    Based on such a premise, blockades and pressures will not  lead to such peace but will make the possibility of realizing it  remote and will prolong the suffering and pain in which the  peoples of the region have been living for decades.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Cadbury Schweppes picks again from family pack After a four-year gap there will soon be a Cadbury back in the chairman's seat at Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks firm. Dominic Cadbury, the 52-year-old chief executive, will take over as executive chairman from Sir Graham Day in May. Cadbury, who joined the family firm five years before its 1969 merger with Schweppes, has been chief executive since 1984, and is following his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, as well as his brother, Sir Adrian Cadbury, into the chairman's office. Although Cadbury Schweppes is no longer a family firm, and Dominic Cadbury's stake in the business is small, his elevation to the chairmanship could raise a few eyebrows. Unlike Sir Graham Day, who turns 60 in May, Dominic Cadbury will be an executive chairman and will have a group chief executive, David Wellings, 52, who has been running the confectionary business since 1989. However, Cadbury says that the two jobs are quite different. 'As chief executive I would be seen as very much a hands-on businessman, I would not expect to be that as chairman.' David Wellings will be the 'ultimate decision maker, it would not work otherwise'. As a full-time chairman, Cadbury expects to help share the heavy travelling and presentational burdens which fall on a ceo's shoulders. Wellings has spent less time at the top of Cadbury Schweppes than Frank Swann and Derek Williams, two other contenders for the ceo's job. Having started his career with Cadbury Brothers in 1962, he spent 18 years outside the group before rejoining in 1986 as managing director of Cadbury in the UK. David Lang, Henderson Crosthwaite's long-time Cadbury-watcher, is slightly surprised at the timing of Dominic Cadbury's promotion but believes that it is well-earned, nonetheless. 'He took over a company that was running out of gas and had serious problems in North America. He has reshaped it and fought off an unwelcome predator.' Despite the family connections, Lang describes Cadbury as a 'good team player' who has surrounded himself with 'successful people'.</p>

Several other, broad  market indicators surpassed record highs they reached last week.  </P> <P> The Dow finished July with a net gain of 220.60 points for its strongest  monthly performance since it soared 252.09 points in January of 1987.  </P> <P> Much of the day's gains came in two rounds of buying ascribed to activity by  professionals engaged in computer-program strategies involving stocks and  stock-index futures and options.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,054 up, 490 down and 462  unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.65 million shares, down from  180.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in  NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and  in the over-the-counter market, totaled 199.86 million shares.  </P> <P> Coca-Cola picked up 4 1/2 to 68 on word that investor Warren E. Buffett, who  holds a 6.75% stake in the company, is seeking clearance to buy as much as 15%  of the stock.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. rose 1/2 to 24 3/8. The company reported second-quarter earnings  of $1.46 a share, up from $1.45 in the like period last year.  </P> <P> Elsewhere among the blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained 1/2  to 40 5/8, International Business Machines rose 1 5/8 to 115, Philip Morris  jumped 3 1/2 to 158 1/2 and General Electric advanced 1 to 58 1/2.  </P> <P> The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index bounced back from Friday's losses and  closed at a record high Monday. The 225-issue Nikkei stock average gained  248.24 points, or 0.72%, closing at 34,953.87. It had declined by 79.65 points  last Friday.  </P> <P> Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer at Nikko Securities, said the index climbed  on the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and expectations of lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> Bank stocks were strong as well. J. P. Morgan rose 1 1/4 to 41 1/8; BankAmerica  1 1/4 to 32; Manufacturers Hanover 1 3/8 to 43 3/8; Bankers Trust New York 1  7/8 to 55 1/4, and NCNB 1/2 to 53 1/2.  </P> <P> Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,393 compared  to 3,846.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 2.03 to  192.41.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.37 to 395.68, and S&amp;P's  500-stock composite index was up 3.93 at 346.08.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 1.02 to  453.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at  376.56, up 2.05.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices headed higher and interest rates declined amid buying inspired by  widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will pursue a more generous  credit policy.  </P> <P> The Treasury's 30-year bond -- the credit market's benchmark bond -- added 1/2  point, or $5 for every $1,000 in face value after gaining nearly the same  amount on Friday.  </P> <P> The key bond's yield fell to 7.95% from 7.99% late Friday, marking the first  time the long-term bond's yield has closed below 8% since the spring of 1987.  The yield goes down when the bond's price rises.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 8 7/8%, down from 8 15/16% late Friday. The Fed controls the rate by adding  or subtracting banking reserves, and many economists believe that the Fed has  set a new target of 9%, down from 9 1/4%.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> Lower U.S. interest rates sapped strength Monday from the dollar, which fell to  springtime levels against major foreign currencies.  </P> <P> The drop in interest rates has wiped out the dollar rally that reached its peak  in June, taking the dollar back to levels of May against the British pound and  Japanese yen, April against the West German mark and March against the Swiss  franc.  </P> <P> The dollar's sharpest drop came against the yen, which has surged ahead  following the brief decline that occurred in the July political upheaval.  Traders said there was optimism that Japan's governing partner would select a  new prime minister shortly.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.6665 to buy  one pound, more expensive than $1.6455 late Friday. In New York, the pound rose  to $1.6655 from $1.6527 on Friday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 138.40 yen, down 1.05 yen from last Friday's  close of 139.45 yen. After opening at 138.90 yen, the dollar ranged between  138.15 yen and 139.10 yen.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents an ounce to close at $369.64.  </P> <P> Gold fell in London to a late bid of $368.25 from $369.20 on Friday. In Zurich,  Switzerland, gold fell to $368.25 from $369.75.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Coffee and soybean prices fell sharply Monday, with coffee sinking to  eight-year lows in New York and soybeans traded in Chicago settling at contract  lows for most delivery months.  </P> <P> CSCE spot September coffee fell 3.03 cents to close at 78.99 cents per pound,  and one broker said prices could fall another 5 cents before rebounding.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, CBOT soybeans futures sank under wave after wave of selling  following widespread rains over the weekend in key crop areas.  </P> <P> Adding to market pressure was the growing concern that lower-priced Brazilian  soybeans might pull demand from the U.S. market, floor sources said.  </P> <P> Contract lows were set in all but the lightly traded November, 1990, delivery.  Spot August soybeans settled at $6.245 a bushel, off 24.5 cents.  </P> <P> Energy futures posted gains as tropical storm Chantal neared the Gulf Coast.  Reports that an American hostage was slain in Lebanon also fueled buying in  energy futures.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 10  </P></p>

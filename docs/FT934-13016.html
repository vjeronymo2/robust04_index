			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac swaps tiles for bricks - Deal with Marley gives opportunity to rationalise over-capacity MOVES TO reduce substantial over-capacity in the brick industry were promised by Tarmac when it announced an asset swap with Marley, its rival building materials group. Tarmac, the UK construction group, is exchanging its Hawkins Tiles clay tile manufacturing business for three regional brick factories and Pounds 3m in cash. While representing a significant boost to Tarmac's production of clay bricks, the deal will enable the company to rationalise and take capacity out of the industry even though its overall brick capacity will rise from 220m to more than 300m bricks a year. This represents about 10 per cent of the UK brick market. Mr Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive, said: 'The exchange is very much in line with the group's signalled intent of working towards consolidating and rationalising the UK brick industry.' Tarmac has recently undertaken to dispose of non-core businesses to reduce its large borrowings and pave the way for new investment in housebuilding land. It also recently raised Pounds 215m in a 1-for-4 rights issue. UK brick stocks at present stand at about 1bn. About 45 per cent of the UK's clay brick production is sold into new housebuilding, mostly to the top 50 builders. This market is expected to increase by at least 5 per cent a year. The three Marley brick factories at Dorket Head in Nottinghamshire, Errol in Perthshire and Maltby in South Yorkshire, are operating at less than 50 per cent capacity. Tarmac plans to take advantage of this spare capacity to match growth in the housing market. Last year the three factories recorded sales of Pounds 6m and incurred operating losses of Pounds 3.2m. Excluding clay reserves, which Marley did not value, the businesses had net assets of Pounds 14.7m. The deal gives Marley a way out of the brick business which it has been trying to sell for several years. Its interests were acquired in 1987 and 1988 for Pounds 47.8m. However it will be forced by accounting rules to record an exceptional charge of about Pounds 33m in the current year. Hawkins Tiles, with net assets of Pounds 23.8m, is one of the three main clay tile manufacturers in the UK. Last year it reported a Pounds 860,000 operating loss on sales of Pounds 2.52m. Hawkins manufactures a range of clay roof tiles at its plant in Cannock, Staffordshire, which has an annual production capacity of more than 30m tiles and will complement Marley's leading position in concrete roof tiles. Mr David Trapnell, Marley's chief executive, said: 'This deal is good for both parties. We have each been able to move out of activities that no longer formed part of our core business in the UK and at the same time we have both strengthened our market positions in the areas where we wish to concentrate in the future.'</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / People: Rapid elevation for Watson at Olivetti in the UK Alan Watson's move to the top slot at Olivetti UK was sudden even by the computer industry's standards. Late in September he was still general manager of the company's customer support group, a position he had held since 1986. Two weeks later he had been elevated to control of the whole of the UK operations as Paulo Tosi, managing director for the past eight years, dashed back to Italy to take responsibility for Olivetti Systems worldwide, though he remains chairman of the UK operation. Watson, now 52, says the succession had been planned for some months but the timing had taken everybody by surprise. These are unpredictable times at Olivetti, however, as Europe's second largest computer-maker struggles with floods of red ink and ever fiercer competition. Watson's first job will be to deal with the complexities of the annual budget-making process - a baptism of fire for a new chief executive. Olivetti UK, however, is not in immediate need of succour. Indeed, it is a shining light in the Milanese gloaming. Under Tosi, it improved its market share and increased its revenues. Watson, as head of the fastest growing segment of the company, played a major role in Olivetti's advance. The group is now second only to Granada Computer Services as a supplier of third party maintenance services. Watson trained as an engineer in south London and spent some time with Gillette Industries before joining the then British Olivetti in 1967 as a mangement trainee. He has held a number of positions in the UK company and spent seven years based in Copenhagen running the engineering activities of Olivetti Scandinavia. He does not envisage making radical changes at Olivetti but argues: 'We can do a lot more with our present resources,' and has his eyes set on an award from the European Quality Foundation.</p>

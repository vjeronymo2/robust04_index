The report says that the continuous lack of the dialogue  between the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities on one side and the  leadership of the Albanians of Kosova on the other side, has  hindered the improvement of the situation in defined fields such  as the parallel system of the education of the ethnic Albanians.  Considering this question, the situation in the University of  Prishtina remains a source of tension. This is the third school  year during which the registration of the students, the  lectures, the exercises, the examinations and other activities  of more then twenty two thousand students and nine hundred  teachers of university are going on in private houses and  buildings. The continuous reports inform about the  discriminating acts of the Serbian police against ethnic  Albanians. The beatings and the tortures against them are  common.    The report mentions the declaration of the head of the  Prishtina Regional Court, who has supported the ill-treatment of  the prisoners from the police saying that "even if their  guiltiness is not shown by facts, they are implicated in the  crimes against the state." Considering the use of the brutal  force by the Serbian police, the report show the case of January  13, when the Serbian police confiscated gold and silver from the  shops of the Albanian owners in Prizren without giving any  explanation. On further more, as it is reported, the police  confiscated facilities and even passports of the ethnic  Albanians in the cross border between Serbia and FYROM [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. On further more, the  report writes about the illegal expel of the Albanian families  from their houses. In most of the cases, this is carried out  without any previous procedural law and on further more, their  houses are given generally to the Serbian families, underlines  the report, which adds that during January 1994 alone, the urban  office of Prishtina has given seventeen decisions to the  Albanians' families, who had absolute property and all the legal  documents which proved that they had lived for decades in those  buildings. The report also mentions facts which testifies for  arbitrary arrests and abuse of the right for a just and on one  sided court.    These abuses in particular have to do with a series of penal  processes against ethnic Albanians in Prishtina, Peje, Gjilan  and Prizren where Albanians have been accused for "putting in  danger the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia." Most of the  defendants are former officers of the Yugoslavia People's Army  or officers of the territorial defence of Yugoslavia, informs  the report of Mr. Mazowiecki published yesterday from the  Albanian press in Kosova.</p>

The militia of Hezb-i-Islami leader Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar suffered 43 dead and 50 injured after attacking state  forces and being repulsed, the radio said.    In another engagement with the Uzbek militia of General  Abdul  Rashid Dostam, allied with Hekmatyar, the pro-Rabbani forces  wounded 300 rebels in the Microrayan area of Kabul, the  broadcast said.    The radio said the Dostam militia has lost 1,000 men during  the month-long fighting, which erupted when the Uzbek warlord  launched an offensive on January 1, in cooperation with the  Hezb, to oust Rabbani from power.    Meanwhile, Afghan sources in the Pakistani border city of  Peshawar said a 100-member mission comprising mojhedin  commanders, religious scholars and elders had launched a new  initiative to end the bloodshed.    The mediation team, led by commander Jalaluddin Haqqani,  left  the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad Tuesday for Kabul for talks  with the warring sides.    Last month, more than 40 commanders from the Kabul area made  two attempts to bring about a ceasefire, but failed to bring  Rabbani and Hekmatyar to the negotiating table.</p>

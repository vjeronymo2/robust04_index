			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights fears encourage profit-taking THE STEADY flow of rights issues took the heart out of the UK stock market as the two week trading account came to its close yesterday. The equity funding call for Pounds 163m from Burton, the store group, was recognised as only the first of a queue of rights issuers expected to march through the market next week. With many gilt-edged market participants still licking the wounds inflicted by the turmoil surrounding this week's government funding and the unexpected cut in domestic interest rates, cash has become somewhat scarce in the stock market, albeit temporarily. Government bonds lost early gains yesterday, closing a shade off on the day as renewed pressures appeared in the ERM currencies and the dollar raced higher after an expectedly strong gain in December durable goods orders. Initial improvement in share prices was swiftly reversed when stock index futures were sold off heavily. The Footsie fell steadily on increased volume, and lost the 2,800 mark briefly at mid-session. However, a late rally by dollar stocks, took the FT-SE Index to a final reading of 2,807.2, for a loss on the day of 9.7. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed suit, losing 8.7 to 2,954.8. Non-Footsie volume represented 62 per cent of Seaq turnover of 773.1m shares; Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.45bn. The Footsie has gained 26 points this week, responding to the reduction in UK base rates to 6 per cent. Over the account, the Footsie has added 42.1 points or 1.5 per cent. Electricity generator stocks weakened on parliamentary proposals to subsidise Britain's coal industry. But oil shares improved and defence stocks responded strongly to the announcement of orders for 48 Tornado aircraft by Saudi Arabia. Profit-takers focused on the interest-related stocks which have outperformed this week. Breweries, food industry stocks, banks, stores and hotels were all out of favour, with rights issue worries adding to the pressure on food retailers. Among the mostly firm blue chip internationals, BAT Industries remained a weak feature beneath concerns over both the tobacco and insurance sectors of the group. Equity strategists have generally welcomed this week's base rate cut, and the possible move to 5 per cent rates at Budget time. But Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull remains convinced that base rates will be up to 8.5 per cent by the year-end, by when Warburg Securities also expects rates to be rising.</p>

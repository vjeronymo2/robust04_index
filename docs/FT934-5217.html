			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Hopes run high for tariff-cutting deal: Uruguay Round countries are pressing the US and EU for an accord An air of expectancy hangs in Brussels this morning as Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, meets Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, for the ninth time in as many months: after almost 10 months of cat and mouse, a mood of 'exceptional sensitivity' suggests the US and the European Union are poised to settle a tariff-cutting deal that could open the way to successful completion of the Uruguay Round of global trade reform. Both are aware of the mounting pressure from the other 114 participants in the Uruguay Round for them to settle differences. This comes not just from a 'hard' deadline of December 15 to complete the deal, but also from recognition that liberalisation will help to haul economies out of recession, create new jobs, and over the next decade boost world trade by at least Dollars 270bn (Pounds 180bn). In Geneva last Friday, Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, warned that the US and EU 'must at their meeting in Brussels reach a substantive result and place a decisive contribution on the table'. Such is the importance of the US and the EU in world trade that other countries can only make their own final market-opening offers when they have seen the shape and substance of a US-EU package. Optimism over today's talks has various roots: a virtual frenzy of preparation; the uncharacteristically tight-lipped mood of negotiators; the headway made in recent weeks, which has narrowed disagreements to a small number of issues. Talks begin early today, continue through a working lunch, and are expected to continue late into tonight. They will resume tomorrow, prospectively feeding straight into the special EU council meeting tomorrow evening. On the US side, Mr Kantor will be joined by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and perhaps also Mr Larry Summers, deputy treasury secretary, who is currently in Moscow. Sir Leon will be joined by a number of other EU commissioners, as well as top negotiators in services, procurement, anti-dumping and audio-visual services. All of these issues will be addressed, but the core of the talks - and the details most urgently awaited by negotiators in Geneva - will be market access in manufactured goods. The issues in hand are as follows: US tariff peaks, in particular those on textile goods, ceramics, and glass. Details of a deal on ceramics and glass products might be unveiled by the end of tomorrow, but the general feeling is that even if a textiles deal is agreed, it is unlikely to be unveiled publicly until the last minute, in order to minimise the exposure of the US administration to pressure from powerful local lobbies. EU tariffs on electronics (particularly semi-conductors), non-ferrous metals and wood and paper products. The US wants these cut to zero. They are important not just to the US, but to other Uruguay Round negotiators: south-east Asian governments see better access for their semi-conductor manufacturers as the key to their being able to improve offers to liberalise their financial services markets. Canada and Australia want better access for aluminium and copper exporters as a quid pro quo for fresh movement in the farm trade area. Deals could be made public here. EU tariff cuts on farm products, and the gradual replacement of import quotas with tariffs which would be reduced over time, are regarded as important not just by the US, but also by the Cairns group of 14 farm exporters. The EU has been resisting pressure to reduce protection for pork and barley, but may be poised to give ground if the US is willing to bow to European pressure to tweak the Blair House accord dictating cuts in subsidised EU farm exports. Such is the sensitivity of farm trade that a deal may be carefully veiled until close to December 15. As a measure of the urgency facing negotiators, Sir Leon will walk virtually directly from the negotiating room to the EU council meeting to report - and presumably seek approval - from EU foreign and trade ministers. Details will be relayed directly to Geneva, where bilateral negotiations will begin immediately with other countries on tariff-cutting pledges. That will leave for next week - the final full week of negotiation - the task of settling disputes on financial services, even-handed tax treatment, anti-dumping laws, audio-visual services, maritime services, and subsidies in sectors such as steel and aircraft. Even with success in Brussels, celebration over a Uruguay Round deal would still be premature.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa price fall gains momentum Cocoa prices slipped further yesterday as more pessimistic market trends dampened sentiment. The second position futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange fell Pounds 32 a tonne to Pounds 988 a tonne and New York prices lost Dollars 40 in early trading to Dollars 1,193 a tonne for March futures - the lowest point for over a month. Much of the sell-off in the market was based on technical chart analysis, but it also reflected the peaceful transition of power in the Ivory Coast - the world's biggest producer. The death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny a couple of weeks ago led traders to fear a power struggle that could affect cocoa deliveries. In addition, the Ivory Coast has also indicated that it may sell its mid crop of cocoa, which will be harvested in April to June next year, immediately rather than with the main crop, as happened this year. The mid crop is usually between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes compared with a main crop of 650,000 tonnes. Some of this has been damaged in transit this year and has not been exported. Traders were also taking profits this week ahead of the publication of the European Union's report - due at the end of the year - on cocoa butter substitutes in chocolate. That report could recommend increased use of substitutes. Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at GNI, the London brokers, said: 'I'm a long-term bull towards cocoa, but I think the market has got a bit ahead of itself and attracted a lot of speculative interest'. Mr Eagles said cocoa prices could slip further, to about Pounds 900 a tonne, but there remained strong buying interest in the market.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: NatWest Markets chief leaves to run fund Mr Mike Cornford, head of global foreign exchange at NatWest Markets, has left his post after less than three months in the job. Mr Cornford, who was poached from Swiss Bank in order to bolster NatWest's foreign exchange operation, has been invited to run a hedge fund by a group of investors. Mr Stephan Harris, managing director of global treasury at NatWest Markets, said Mr Cornford had left at his own initiative. 'There is no ill-feeling or cause for him to leave. It is just unfortunate that this opportunity came along when it did.' Mr Cornford is the latest in a number of leading City figures who have left banking jobs to join hedge funds - highly leveraged pools of speculative capital, where management fees commonly run to as much as 25 per cent of profits. NatWest are not planning to replace Mr Cornford immediately. Instead the day to day management of the foreign exchange operation will be handled by Mr Paul Winchester, Mr Frank Wong and Mr Hans Goehtz, the regional managers. Mr Harris will join these managers on a policy committee to supervise NatWest's foreign exchange operations. Mr Cornford was not available for comment and the identity of his backers is not yet known. It is understood, however, that the offer he has accepted had previously been on the table and was then revived once he had arrived at NatWest. Mr Harris said NatWest was 'very sorry to see him go'. He said Mr Cornford's view was that it would be less disruptive if he left now rather than when he was more established.</p>

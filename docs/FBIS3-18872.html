			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus who is in Nicosia, today began contacts in  the third round of the proximity talks on the  confidence-building measures. This morning Lamb had a one-hour  meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis. Lamb described the  meeting with Kliridhis as a very useful one during which they  discussed details related to the current phase of the talks.    Asked whether he brings new ideas, Lamb said that the United  Nations is working hard to make sure that the interests of both  sides are protected. I do not think, he said, that there is a  need for new ideas at the present stage. The U.S. special  coordinator said that he repeated to President Kliridhis the US  conviction that the confidence-building measures are positive  and useful and create the opportunity for progress.    Replying to other questions, Lamb said that during this  current phase the two sides will voice their doubts on how the  issues of Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will work out. He  described the reservations expressed as logical. He said that  the process is difficult but very important. Lamb also stressed  that there is a lot of skepticism on both sides as to whether  the other side is willing to proceed. However, he added, the  leadership of both sides have enough perception to be able to  see that these efforts can lead to an acceptable final  settlement.</p>

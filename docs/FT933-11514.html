			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Pesticide levels in drinking water rise MORE PESTICIDES and chemical residues were found in drinking water last year than in 1991, the second consecutive year to show an increase, the Drinking Water Inspectorate said yesterday. Overall water quality remained the same - 98.7 per cent of the 3.75m tests complied with the national standards, the inspectorate said in its third annual report. Mr Mike Healey, chief inspector, said: 'There is no evidence that where the standards were not met the health of consumers was endangered.' Last year 3 per cent of water supply zones failed to meet pesticide standards, compared with 2.8 per cent in 1991 and 2.1 per cent in 1990. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, said the rise in pesticide detection was partly because sampling had increased. Drinking Water 1992. Drinking Water Inspectorate, HMSO.

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Maddox sells distribution businesses Maddox Group has agreed to sell off its two electrical wire and cable distribution subsidiaries for Dollars 29.6m (Pounds 19.1m). Cables &amp; Flexibles and Seacoast Electric Company are to be sold via a US-based management buy-out. The disposals underline its decision to concentrate on the core computer maintenance business. Maddox will have the option to convert a loan note which will form part of the consideration into a 49 per cent equity interest in Lantek Electronics, the main buy-out vehicle, in three years' time. C&amp;F made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 277,000 in the five months to September 30 1991 while Seacoast made Dollars 893,000 profits in the nine months to that date.</p>

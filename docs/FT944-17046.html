			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Russia softens stance on CSCE Russia yesterday appeared prepared to back down on its proposal to transform the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe into the continent's most powerful security structure. Speaking at the opening of a two-month CSCE review conference in Budapest, Mr Yuri Ouchakov, the head of the Russian delegation, said the CSCE should be the 'major moving force in European security' but that there was no need to set up a 'hierarchical system'. Since May, Russian officials have proposed that CSCE become Europe's top security organisation, subsuming Nato and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The strengthened organisation would be headed by a United Nations-style 10-nation steering committee and would mandate Nato or CIS forces to intervene in regional conflicts. The idea to strengthen the CSCE, which includes European and CIS countries, the US and Canada, followed Russian concerns that its influence in Europe was being undermined by Nato. The proposal has been rejected by the west. Russia's back-pedalling on the CSCE comes at a time when Moscow has achieved a quiet, though possibly temporary, victory in the creation of a post-cold war world order. Although the west has made it clear that Russia will not be admitted to Nato in the forseeable future, Russian objections have also put a brake on the rapid entry to Nato of eastern European states. Mr Sam Brown, the US delegate, said Mr Ouchakov's statement showed flexibility on the part of the Russians and recognition that its proposals were not possible at present. He said the US would welcome the strengthening of the CSCE but it should remain one of a number of security structures.</p>

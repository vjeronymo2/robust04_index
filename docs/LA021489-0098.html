			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER URGES W. EUROPE TO PRESSURE NICARAGUA  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III is urging West European countries to put  pressure on Nicaragua by tying their economic aid to the Central American  country's internal political situation, a senior State Department official said  Monday.  </P> <P> Baker told the foreign ministers of Denmark and Norway -- North Atlantic Treaty  Organization allies that send aid to Nicaragua -- that the Bush Administration  wants to "give diplomacy a chance" to end the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war,  the official said.  </P> <P> In an unusual twist, he asked the two governments, which have been largely  sympathetic to the leftist Managua regime, to support U.S. policy by using  their aid as a tool to push the Sandinistas toward more internal democracy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Give Diplomacy a Chance'  </P> <P> Baker told the Scandinavians "that we would hope that (they) would help us give  diplomacy a chance . . . by at least having that aid addressed to . . .  democratization and freedom of religion and freedom of the press," the aide  said.  </P> <P> Norway gives Nicaragua about $16 million a year in aid. Among the NATO allies,  Denmark, Italy, France and Spain also have significant aid programs, consisting  almost entirely of food and other humanitarian aid. A total of $94.5 million in  West European aid reached Nicaragua last year, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cool Response  </P> <P> The immediate response from the Danish and Norwegian governments to Baker's  proposal was cool, a U.S. official acknowledged.  </P> <P> "For most of them," he said, "it is not a comfortable concept."  </P> <P> Aid to the Sandinistas is a publicly popular program in most European  countries, where governments have not campaigned against the Managua regime as  did the Reagan Administration. Washington supports the Contras, the Nicaraguan  rebels who are fighting the regime.  </P> <P> Baker's predecessor as secretary of state, George P. Shultz, frequently advised  European governments that he considered aid to Managua a mistake. But Baker's  proposal is believed to be the first that the U.S. government has made  suggesting the linking of European aid policy so closely to American pressure  on Managua.  </P> <P> Baker was in Denmark and Norway as part of a weeklong, 15-country dash through  the NATO countries, his first trip abroad as secretary of state.  </P></p>

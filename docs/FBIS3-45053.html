The  investment structure, which is the important driving force and  core of the cause of reform and development, and reform of this  structure, have again become a matter of great concern to senior  Chinese leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. On the basis  of carefully analyzing the course of history and the lessons of  reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years, we  should search for a general model for the reform of China's  investment structure in the light of the overall objective of  the reform to establish a socialist market economy system, and  we should work out short-term reform measures for realizing this  target model. This has become our pressing task in promoting  reform of the economic system as a whole.  <H3>  I. A Basic Appraisal of Reform of the Investment Structure  Over the Past 14 Years </H3>   In China, the term investment structure generally refers to  the operating mechanism and management system for activities in  fixed- assets investment. It mainly covers the activities of  investment entities, fund-raising methods, the ways in which  investment is employed, the process by which projects are  decided upon, the management of construction programs, and the  macroregulation and control system. China's investment  structure is basically one which has gradually developed in the  wake of large-scale economic construction shortly after the  founding of the People's Republic, and constitutes the integral  core of the traditional planned economy structure. The  experimental reform introduced in 1979 to replace government  allocation by bank loans for investment in capital construction  heralded the reform of the investment structure. Reforms carried  out in this connection in the 14 years since then have produced  a new investment structure:    First, the opening of multiple channels of investment in  diverse economic sectors has put to an end to the singular  channel of investment under the traditional structure, where  units owned by the whole people were mainly dependent on state  financial administrations, and this has greatly aroused the  enthusiasm of all quarters to invest in construction projects.  This plays an important role in the extensive and rapid raising  of nearly 500 million yuan of investment in the past 14 years.  [figure as published] By the end of 1992, the investment share  of state-owned units had dropped to 65 percent of the total from  95 percent in 1978. Of this, the financial investment weighting  (which forms a part of the state capital construction fund)  dropped from 80 percent to 11 percent. Investment raised by  local governments, departments, and enterprises accounted for 41  percent of the total. Bank loans and foreign investment, which  account for 22 percent and 11 percent respectively, have become  a major source of funds for the reproduction of fixed assets and  laid the foundation for the establishment of a new investment  and financing structure.    Second, a management model where multiple investment  entities  coexist and where each level exercises decisionmaking power has  taken shape. The situation of the central government being the  sole investment entity has been completely smashed. Local  governments and departments, particularly state-owned  enterprises and nonstate collective enterprises, township  enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, enterprise groups,  individuals within the country and foreign investors, have  become important direct investment entities. This has promoted  changes in the system by which projects are decided upon,  examined, and approved, and this has prompted the central  government to raise ceilings for projects submitted for  examination and approval and to simply examination and approval  procedures. However, reform in this respect is lagging behind  the new development of multiple investment entities.    Third, the compensated use of state investment, the  investment responsibility system, and the method of treating  government investment as a commercial undertaking have been  experimented with. In a sense, the "replacement of financial  appropriations by loans," the investment responsibility system  introduced in the early stages of reform, and the project  proprietor responsibility system introduced in 1992, are all to  solve the problem under the traditional structure where everyone  ate from the "big pot" of government investment and for  improving returns on government investment. In terms of actual  results, it is not entirely due to the drawbacks of these reform  measures that the original intentions of these reforms have not  been fully realized. Rather, it is mainly because the investment  responsibility system lacks the necessary foundation and exists  in name only. This is one of the greatest weaknesses of reform  of the investment structure over the past 14 years.    Fourth, in respect of project decisions and consultations,  feasibility studies, design, construction, and material supplies  management, a series of reform measures with the market  competition mechanism at the core have been introduced to reform  the assessment, bidding, and contracting of projects and to  establish a raw materials market. Reforms in these areas have  probably been the boldest and most effective in the reform of  the traditional investment structure. Of course, because the  market system is still not fully developed on the whole and  enterprises have not completely cut off their ties of  administrative subordination, it is still very difficult to  bring market mechanisms into play in place of construction  investment.    Fifth, attempts have been made to improve macroregulation  and  control of investment by economic means and indirect management.  The two major pillars of the traditional investment structure,  namely the mandatory investment planning system and the  administrative system for the examination and approval of  projects, have come under fierce attack during 14 years of  reform. Some reforms have been introduced, whether actively or  passively, consciously or unconsciously. These reforms,  including the narrowing of the scope of mandatory planning, the  introduction of guidance planning, the implementation of state  industrial policy, the levying of energy and transport fund  contributions and construction tax (later replaced by investment  orientation tax), and the application of differential interest  rates, "new charges for electricity generated by new plants,"  and other economic levers to regulate the flow of investment,  have produced some concrete results. However, in spite of these  efforts, the two major pillars of the traditional investment  structure still have not been fundamentally removed and a new  system of macroregulation and control has yet to take shape.  This is another great weakness in the reform of the investment  structure over the past 14 years.    Looking back at the reform of the investment structure in  the  past 14 years, our first conclusion is: As far as the total  abolition of the traditional model of investment structure and  the eventual establishment of a new investment structure under  the conditions of a market economy are concerned, the reforms  carried out in these 14 years have, in the process by which the  old system is being destroyed and the new system is being  established, played a role in exploration, experimentation, and  laying down a base. Most of the reform measures have actively  promoted the solution of existing problems and the development  of the productive forces. On the whole, the reform of the  investment structure in the past 14 years should be affirmed and  taken as a point of departure for further studies on ways to  deepen reform of the investment structure.    Looking back at the reform of the investment structure over  the past 14 years, our second conclusion is: Due to the  difficulty and complexity of the cause of reform, reform of the  investment structure is bound to experience mistakes either in  the planning of the program or in its implementation, thereby  affecting the progress and effectiveness of reform. If we  further assess the actual results of reform against the  principles of a market economy, we can clearly see that the  existing investment structure still bears the deep imprint of  the traditional investment structure and has many drawbacks. In  particular, a number of deep-level contradictions have yet to be  resolved. We will try to analyze these contradictions from the  following six angles:    1) Investment entities: Although multiple investment  entities have been developed, in essence, enterprises have not  totally renounced their role as appendages of government  departments. In particular, the majority of state-owned  enterprises still lack the ability to accumulate their own  capital. They are still subject to administrative control and  have not become truly independent investment entities.    2) Investment decisionmaking: The system of centralized  decisionmaking by the central government, which has "cage-like"  indices and unified policies as its distinctive features, is  still used in forming macroeconomic investment policies. For  most projects, there is a basic division of decisionmaking power  between the central and local authorities and among departments.  The simplification of examination and approval procedures has  not brought about a complete change in the system of examination  and approval by administrative departments.    3) Investment channels: Although there are now multiple  channels for investment and fund-raising, the utilization of  funds is still subject to direct government intervention and  control to varying degrees. What we have is a disguised form of  administrative allocation. It goes without saying that fiscal  funds are thus allocated. However, domestic bank loans and  funds raised through securities issues and foreign loans are  either allocated in blocks or handed down to specific projects  by the government. Investments by units with their own funds  are also arranged in blocks in accordance with aggregate targets.    4) Investment operations: Because there has been no change  in the administrative jurisdictional structure which poses  barriers between ministries and regions, the formation and  development of a long-term funds market has been sluggish and  investment liquidity continues to be poor. The movement of  funds between different industries and different regions is  particularly difficult. With the deployment of resources still  largely dependent on administrative orders and planning, the  positive role of the market has still not been fully brought  into play.    5) Investment management: Because the reform of the  investment planning structure began quite late and the reforms  have been quite passive, the functions, management means, and  objectives of various management departments concerned with  investment are still unclear. Administrative means still play  the dominant role in investment management, and a new system of  macroregulation and control has yet to take shape.    6) Investment responsibility: A strict system of  responsibility and legal constraints have not been instituted  for the whole process from investment decisionmaking to project  implementation. Effective measures have yet to be developed as  regards the bearer, scope and bearing of responsibility, and the  problem of state-owned units all eating from "the same big pot"  in investment still prevails to varying degrees.    Why is it that the distinctive features of the traditional  investment structure not only have not been thoroughly removed  from the existing investment structure but have produced  negative effects in obstructing reform and hindering development  to a greater or lesser extent? This is definitely not a natural  outcome of reform itself. Rather, it shows that in reform we  cannot expect to "get twice the result with half the effort."  As the saying goes, "a boat sailing against the current must  forge ahead or it will be driven back." Only by unswervingly  adhering to a clear direction of reform and by speeding up and  deepening the reform can we fundamentally eliminate the  drawbacks of the traditional investment structure. This is the  only way for China's investment structure to ultimately realize  the transition from a planned economy to a market economy.  <H3>  II. In Deepening the Reform It Is Necessary To Update and  Change Several Concepts </H3>   The scale of investment in China has seen more rapid growth  since 1992. This rapid growth has continued in 1993, and is  widely regarded as the main reason for the tense financial  situation as a whole, particularly the money supply, and is  deemed to be a possible cause of high inflation. Meanwhile, as  localities and enterprises continue their fervent call to  quicken development, the existing investment structure is seen  as an obvious stumbling block in more ways than one. Under this  historical backdrop, the question of investment and investment  structure has once again become a subject of great concern to  state leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. They have come  to the conclusion that while speeding up the transformation of  government functions, it is necessary to further reform the  planning, financial, and monetary systems, with the focus on the  investment structure. Over the past year, all kinds of  proposals and suggestions have been put forward for the reform  of the investment structure, but the views remain divided. An  important reason for this is that people still differ in their  concept and understanding of major issues in the investment  realm. Although we are all talking about reform, we are widely  divergent, even going in opposite directions on the goals,  targets, and measures of reform. In view of this situation, we  believe that when studying and putting forward proposals for  deepening the reform of the investment structure, it is  necessary to update and change from the high plane of theory  some of the customary formulations and concepts originated from  the traditional planned economy and understand afresh several  major investment issues in accordance with market economy theory.    1. The question of controlling the scale of  investment    In a modern market economy, macroregulation and control by  the government has four target areas, namely, the economic  growth rate, the employment rate, the inflation rate, and the  international balance of payments. The scale of investment is  an important economic variable. Changes in the scale of  investment are mainly due to the market situation and the  government's economic policies and are not the direct targets of  government regulation and control. In other words, under a  market economy, enterprises are the principal investment  entities and investment activities are enterprise activities.  The government cannot, and indeed should not, directly  determine and control the overall scale of investment. Thus, in  deepening reform of the investment structure, the state should,  in a clear-cut way, change the method of directly controlling  the scale of investment and cease the handing down of so-called  "cages" or annual plans on the scale of investment. Such plans  (particularly medium and long-term plans) may still be drawn up,  but these should only be used by the state as a base for the  formulation of macroeconomic policies and may be published as  economic forecasts. Some comrades have suggested replacing  regulation and control over the annual scale of investment by  regulation and control of the overall scale of investment for  projects under construction. In essence, this is still a  concept of direct regulation and control under a planned  economy. It not only goes against the principles of a market  economy but is difficult to implement and is not feasible.  However, the overall scale of investment for projects under  construction is still of significance as a leading economic  index unique to China.    Will there be a massive expansion of investment, as many  fear, if the state changes its direct mandatory controls on the  scale of investment? The conclusion we have drawn after summing  up the experience of market economies is quite the contrary.  Due to government intervention and influence in running the  economy through the use of macroeconomic policies (including  fiscal policies and tax policies, interest rates and exchange  rates), investors are very sensitive to market signals and  government policies. The fact that they are subject to strict  constraints of their investment responsibility also contributes  to the fundamental elimination of the causes of investment  expansion. Some comrades insist that there should be direct  controls on the scale of investment on the grounds that market  economy mechanisms and enterprise constraints have not yet been  developed. As soon as investment shows excessive growth, they  advocate a return to the old practice, that is, suppression of  the scale of investment, consolidation of existing projects,  control of newly launched projects, and strict mandatory  planning. This arbitrarily cuts off the natural course of the  transition from a planned economy to a market economy,  objectively prevents enterprises from truly becoming investment  entities, and fetters the development of the productive forces.  Actually, experience over the past 40 years and more has  demonstrated time and again that direct government control of  the scale of investment has never been truly successful in  keeping the scale of investment under control. Rather, we have  gone through a course of suppression--expansion-- further  suppression--further expansion. We can no longer follow this  course which simply has no future.    2. The question of the regulation and control of the  investment structure    The investment structure includes the investment ratio  between different industries and the investment ratio between  different regions. In order to ensure the optimum deployment of  resources between different industries and regions in accordance  with the principles of a market economy, the flow of investment  should be toward industries and regions with the best rate of  return, and this should mainly be achieved through regulation by  market mechanisms. In the past we have always been advocates of  the regulation and control of the investment structure through  the formulation of state industrial policies. However, it is  not in accord with the principles of a market economy to treat  industrial policies as mandatory policies. Industrial policies  themselves are for guidance only and should mainly be  implemented through various economic and technical policies, but  state laws formulated in accordance with state industrial  policies for specific industries and products are mandatory.  The fixed assets investment orientation regulatory tax  introduced in 1991 seems to be an economic means for indirect  regulation and control, but in fact it is not completely cut off  from the framework of an administrative means which embraces all  trades and professions and entails direct intervention. This,  complicated by how the tax revenue is distributed between the  central and local governments and the overelaborate way of  calculating how much tax should be levied, has made its actual  implementation very difficult. This deserves attention. In  future, the government should adopt necessary measures for the  indirect control of the investment structure. The following are  some of the major measures we should adopt: First, we should  rationally determine the ratio between government investment and  non-government investment in order to ensure that the government  will have sufficient funds for public utilities and  infrastructure construction. Second, we should correctly fix  charges for infrastructural services in order to ensure that  their revenues can at least cover operational costs. Third, we  should adopt a policy of financial equilibrium and support the  underdeveloped regions in their development of public utilities  and infrastructure. In this connection, speeding up the pace of  price reform and seeing to it that market mechanisms play their  role in providing correct guidance is one of the key steps. Of  course, the principles of a market economy do not completely  reject government involvement in the structural readjustment of  certain industries in the non-government sector through  macroeconomic policies (such as supporting priority industries,  supporting key projects, and promoting an export- oriented  economy). However, such support does not normally take the form  of direct investment. Rather, it is given through indirect  means, such as preferential policies, discounts on exchange, or  subsidized investment.    3. The question of preventing duplicate  construction    The concept of duplicate construction is entirely a concept  of the traditional planned economy. It means engaging in the  construction of similar projects in addition to those already  provided for in the state plan. They are generally regarded as  superfluous and unnecessary. According to theories of the  planned economy, we should expand the capacity of production in  proportion to need and launch projects within the limits of  funds and resources available. Thus, it is necessary to prevent  "duplicate construction." Under the principles of a market  economy, however, the prevention of duplicate construction is  not tenable whether in theory or in practice. The basic laws of  the market economy are: the law of value, the law of  competition, and the law of supply and demand. Without some  "duplication" in construction, supply and demand will be  perfectly balanced (which is unlikely in real life in any case),  and there will not be any competition. What this means is that  market mechanisms will have no place in the optimum deployment  of resources. More importantly, without competition and the  elimination of the inferior through competition, it is  impossible to increase efficiency and promote technological  progress, and economic and social development as a whole will  lose vigor and vitality. This was the situation which prevailed  in many of our industrial enterprises prior to reform.    Hence, the concept of duplicate construction in the  traditional sense can no longer be adhered to. If we find it  necessary to avoid excessive competition or low-quality  construction which wastes resources (duplicate construction in a  given sense) during a period of transition when a mechanism of  microeconomic constraints has yet to be developed, then rather  than devising a system for the prevention of duplicate  construction, we should make the best of the situation and  create a mechanism and environment that can truly encourage and  meet the needs of moderate competition between investors. Only  by truly unfolding market competition and encouraging the  movement of funds will it be possible to truly eliminate  low-quality, low-return, and unreasonable duplicate  construction. If we continue to resort to methods of planning,  we will only encourage the practice of "vying for more  investment and more new construction projects" and will have no  way of prohibiting duplicate construction. This has been the  situation in China over the past decades.    4. The question of the shortage of funds for key  construction projects of the state    In market economies, the scope of government investment is  usually clearly defined and mainly covers those sectors that are  monopolistic and are not predominantly profit-oriented, such as  public utilities and infrastructure. In the past, government  investment in China covered all areas. After reform, the scope  of government investment has been somewhat reduced and no longer  covers all trades and professions, but it still covers a wide  scope. Seen in terms of the key construction projects approved  by the state each year and in terms of construction projects  with state investment in different industries, the number is not  very high, but the number of industries covered is very  impressive. Such a state of affairs is not in accord with the  operational laws of a market economy. One of the problems that  can be directly attributed to this is the lack of congruence  between the capacity of the government to invest and its scope  of investment, and between its financial power and its  administrative power. This is also the problem of the capital  shortage for key state projects that we have been talking about  all these years.    One line of thought for the solution of this problem is the  planned economy approach. What this means is that we should  concentrate financial resources by all and every means, thereby  increasing the amount of funds directly controlled by and at the  disposal of the government. In other words, the government  should have greater financial power. According to the  principles of a market economy, however, we should focus our  efforts on reducing administrative interference and thoroughly  put an end to the situation where government intervention in  investment is both excessive and inefficient. In respect of  those projects which definitely need government investment,  apart from some public utility investment which will continue to  need funds allocated by financial administration, other major  social infrastructure projects should increasingly rely on the  absorption and mobilization of social capital (such as public  bidding and the issuance of bonds and shares). We should no  longer follow the beaten track of centralized funding and direct  allocation.    There are many other questions in the sphere of investment,  such as how to do things in strict accordance with construction  programs and overcome over-investment. If we look at  enterprises as genuine investment entities in accordance with  the concept of the market economy, we will be able to gain a new  understanding of and give new meaning to these questions. Only  when we have come to a consensus on these major theoretical and  practical issues will there be a solid foundation for the design  and implementation of investment structure reform.  <H3>  III. The Target Model and Overall Framework for Reform of  the Investment Structure in China </H3>   If we briefly sum up the traditional model of investment  structure as a direct management model based on mandatory  investment plans and administrative examination and approval of  projects, with government investment playing the dominant role,  then the target model for an investment structure that meets the  needs of the socialist market economy may be summed up as a  capital factor distribution mechanism and management system  based on market-regulated investment activities and decisions  made at the investors' own risk, with enterprise investment  playing the dominant role and the government exercising indirect  regulation and control.    The above-mentioned target model for reform of the  investment  structure may be described as the realization of the following  six fundamental changes:    1) Investment entities will change from entities with  government investment or government activities playing the  dominant role into entities with enterprise investment and  enterprise activities playing the dominant role. The scope and  ways of government investment will also be more clearly defined.    2) The market rather than the government will decide how  investment, as long-term capital, is to deployed. The law of  value and the law of average rate of profits will play a  fundamental and principal regulatory role in the deployment of  resources, while the government will only play a supplementary  role.    3) The microeconomic bases of investment activities will  change from enterprises which are no more than government  appendages in terms of their administrative jurisdiction and  which do not have complete investment decisionmaking power and  responsibility constraints, into true economic entities with  independent economic interests and clearly defined property  relations. These entities will work under tough responsibility  constraints and will make their own policy decisions, assume  responsibility for their own profits and losses, manage their  own affairs, and bear their own investment risks and  responsibilities.    4) The mechanism for the deployment of various capital  factors will change from one which relies on planned  distribution into one which works on fair competition. The  pricing of capital factors, such as interest rates, wages,  rents, and the prices of investment goods, will be determined by  the market and will be able to correctly reflect the scarcity of  resources and the relationship between supply and demand.  Capital factors will be free to circulate and will be naturally  pooled and centralized in projects with high returns through  fair competition.    5) The investment financing mechanism of enterprises and  the government will change from one which works on allocation in  accordance with planned targets into one which favors the  flexible and diversified use of both direct and indirect  investment, separates policy financing organs from commercial  banks, and manages government investment as an entrepreneurial  undertaking.    6) The means with which the government regulates investment  activities will change from administrative orders by governments  at various levels into the stimulation and constraint of the  interests of investment entities. Through its financial  policies, monetary policies, and various other economic levers,  the government will make targeted corrections of market signals,  thereby indirectly influencing (raising or lowering) the  anticipated rate of return on investments and realizing the  fixed macroeconomic goals of the government, while guiding  enterprises to pursue their own economic interests in their  investments.    The most essential characteristic of the target model for  reform of the investment structure is as follows: Enterprises  (including state-owned enterprises and other types of  enterprises) have become the principal investment entities.  They have a perfect investment and financing mechanism, have  full power to make autonomous decisions on projects, regulate  the movement of investment in accordance with the principle of  maximum profits and market laws, and independently bear  investment risks and responsibilities. The government's  function in investment management has completely changed into  one of macroeconomic management, indirect regulation and  control, and the provision of policy guidance, information, and  services.    The period between 1993 and 1995 will be a period for the  implementation of the near-term program for deepening reform of  the investment structure, while the "Ninth Five-Year Plan"  period could be a period for the implementation of a long-term  program. The overall framework for a long-term program could be  based on the following four tasks:    1) Defining property relations and restoring enterprises as  investment entities. This mainly refers to the introduction of  the shareholding system to state-owned enterprises, the  establishment of state-holding limited liability companies and  limited joint-stock companies with large enterprise groups as  the main form, and the separation of the economic management  functions of the government and the ownership management  functions of state-owned enterprises.    2) Improving management and operating systems for government  investment. This mainly involves the division of capital  construction funds into social public investment and industrial  development investment. Social public investment shall be  managed by the respective departments in accordance with state  plans, while industrial development investment shall be managed  by government investment companies. At the same time, a system  of indirect investment management by the government based on a  "state investment credit fund" and a "state long-term investment  bank" shall also be established.    3) Making clear the social division of labor between  different categories of investment entities. This mainly  involves efforts to clarify the scope of government investment  and divide investment between the central government and local  governments in accordance with the principle of regional  division of labor. There is no need to delimit the scope of  private investment in various types of enterprises and by  domestic and foreign investors.    4) Establishing an indirect macro-regulatory and control  system for investment. This is mainly about making full use of  investment policies, investment information, economic levers,  legal means, and necessary administrative intervention in the  indirect guidance and regulation of the activities of investment  entities.  <H3>  IV. Proposal on Near-term Measures for Deepening Reform of  the Investment Structure </H3>   Since the reform measures put forward in the target model  and  the overall framework of the long-term program for the reform of  the investment structure will take time to gradually be put into  implementation, the pressing nature of the reform makes it  imperative for us to seize the following breakthrough points in  taking substantial steps forward in deepening reform of the  investment structure. In accordance with the principle of  dovetailing with the target model and helping solve imminent  problems in real life, we should concentrate on the following  three areas in our immediate reforms.    1. Standardize and strengthen the constraints  mechanism on state-owned investment entities    State-owned investment entities comprise three major types  of  investment entities, namely, the central government, local  governments, and state-owned enterprises. Restricted by various  conditions at present, apart from extremely rare cases like the  Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, very few state-owned  enterprises can really be called independent investment  entities. However, as far as the orientation of reform goes,  state-owned enterprises will definitely become investment  entities with a decisive role to play in the development of the  national economy. The standardization of of investment  entities' activities mainly involves two aspects, namely  self-constraint mechanisms within investment entities and  mechanisms for the state and society to guide and restrain the  activities of investment entities.    1) Promote and improve the system of responsibility for  construction project proprietors. In our present endeavor to  invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we  must concentrate on resolving the problem of "the lack of  clarity in three respects," that is, the lack of clarity in  property rights relationships, the lack of clarity between  ownership and operating rights, and the lack of clarity between  government and enterprise functions. The fundamental way to  resolve this problem lies in the enterprises order at their  root, that is, carrying out reform of the decision making,  financing, and construction of projects. The establishment of  the system of responsibility for construction project  proprietors is an important measure in this reform, and efforts  must be made to speed up this stage of reform. Seen from the  trial implementation of this system on construction projects  over the past year or so, we can see that standardizing the  process whereby proprietors are generated, ensuring the full  implementation of the powers of proprietors, establishing a  mechanism of responsibility constraints and a mechanism of  interest stimulation for proprietors, as well as improving  relevant policies, laws and regulations and strengthening the  service functions of the government, are key links in deepening  this reform and producing actual results.    2) Reorganizing state-owned enterprises and clearly defining  property rights relationships.    Investment and financing rights are rights enjoyed by the  ownership principals in property rights relationships. In order  to turn state-owned enterprises into true investment entities,  it is necessary to grant them investment and financing rights.  To this end, it is necessary first of all to clarify who has  proprietary rights over the state-owned assets of enterprises.  China has a vast number of state-owned enterprises, and there  is a vast difference between the scale of enterprises and the  management level and quality of their leaders. If we stipulate  in general terms that factory directors or managers are  representatives of the owners of state-owned assets of  enterprises and give them full power of investment and  financing, the resultant over-decentralization of investment and  financing power and a host of poor policy decisions could  inflict heavy losses on state-owned assets. A desirable  approach is to reorganize state-owned enterprises by organizing  (or incorporating) most of state-owned enterprises making up the  "national team" into large or giant enterprise groups. In other  words, we should amalgamate or merge state-owned enterprises  around large or medium-sized enterprises with outstanding  performance on the basis of voluntary collaboration.  Medium-sized or small manufacturing enterprises with antiquated  equipment and poor performance which no enterprise group wants  may be declared bankrupt or sold to members of the public so  that the state can redeem their assets. State-owned public  utilities in localities may continue to be run by local  governments.    3) Establishing a personal responsibility system for  investment. There should be clearly defined property rights  relationships in all enterprise groups, with the board of  directors or management committee of each group exercising the  powers and functions of the ownership entity on behalf of the  state. Their responsible persons and principal members should  be selected and appointed by the state- owned asset management  department from among entrepreneurs. Enterprise groups are  primary-level corporate bodies. They are vested with investment  and financing power, assume responsibility for profits and  losses in their operations, and hand over a given proportion of  the profits to state-owned asset management departments.  Basic-level enterprises within the group are secondary-level  corporate bodies. They only have operating power and do not  have ownership rights or investment power. They hand over all  their profits to their enterprise group, which bears  responsibility for their profits and losses. Their responsible  persons only assume personal responsibility for operational  results. Thus, the principals of these investment entities are  the board of directors or management committees. Constraints on  their investment activities are based on contracts that combine  rights, responsibilities, and interests concluded on the basis  of the benefits principle. Although the state does not  interfere in their investment orientation, they must realize the  annual targets for profit and assets appreciation stipulated in  the contracts signed at the time of their appointment by the  state. The contracts should also make clear their personal  income, and promotion will be pegged to the overall performance  of their enterprise group. In order to ensure the  implementation of this system of personal responsibility for  investment, it is necessary to strengthen the system of  constraints and supervision on government investment managers by  making public servants stake their "political life" on their  investment decisions and management results.    4) Establishing an external mechanism of constraints for  state- owned asset investment entities. Although results  generated by different orientations of investment may assume  different forms, whichever way investment goes people expect  maximum results for the money they put in. Only in this way can  we make our limited state-owned asset investment yield maximum  results and fundamentally change the problem of serious wastage  in state-owned asset investment. Thus, all talk about  restraining the investment activities of state-owned asset  investment entities centers around returns. In other words,  constraints must have the improvement of investment returns as  their major objective and are intended to make state-owned asset  investment yield satisfactory results. In order to achieve this  goal, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the system of  scientific decisionmaking for investment projects, improve the  system of investment auditing and supervision, promote the  system of post-construction appraisal, and put the system of  investment information and engineering consultation on a sound  footing. In particular, we must speed up legislation in the  realm of investment to bring investment activities into an orbit  whereby investment entities' actions are standardized by law.    2. Improve and perfect the investment and financing  systems of the government and enterprises    Under the market economy, government investment and  enterprise investment differ greatly in target, scope, and form.  This makes it necessary to have separate investment and  financing systems for the government and for enterprises.    1) Enlarge the investment and financing mechanism in the  form of government shareholding. In the international arena,  participation in projects by way of share investment and  financing is a basic form of government investment and  financing. At present, expanding key construction funds by  gradually increasing the shareholding weighting in total  investment, practicing diverse share investment and financing  methods, and issuing shares to obtain new investment has become  an objective inevitability.    2) Put existing state-owned asset investment and financing  mechanisms on a sound footing. The irrational deployment of the  huge amount of existing assets in China often imposes serious  restrictions on the optimum organization of limited new  investment. China has state-owned assets worth nearly 2,000  billion yuan. Of these, about one-third either lie idle or  operate inefficiently. The irrational deployment of existing  assets not only results in the waste of a large amount of new  investment, but greatly restricts the scale of new investment in  key construction projects. Thus, it is necessary to do away  with "insulation" between existing assets and new investment and  to turn surplus assets into a new flow of investment which  covers key construction. At the present stage, the conversion  of existing assets into new investment may be realized through  the marketization of existing assets.    3) Strengthen the self-accumulation mechanism of  enterprises. In the development of enterprises, the forms and  channels of investment and financing are multifaceted. Seen in  terms of raising funds internally and drawing funds in from  outside, there are two major forms of investment and financing  by enterprises, namely, their own capital and borrowed  investment. The experience of developed countries clearly tells  us that in investment and financing, enterprises should focus on  the internal accumulation and expansion of funds rather than  drawing funds from outside. In raising of industrial capital,  enterprises in developed countries obtain most of their funds,  or at least half, through internal fund raising. The investment  and financing structure of Chinese enterprises is extremely  irrational. This is mainly manifested in imbalances in the  asset and liability structure of enterprises. When an  enterprise does not even have 20 percent of the funds needed and  uses loans to cover the other 80 percent of the funds necessary  to expand production, they will naturally have difficulty  expanding their scale of investment and financing. In order to  increase the ability of enterprises to build up their own  accumulation and develop, it is necessary to strengthen the  self- accumulation mechanisms of enterprises. On the one hand,  it is necessary to strengthen the replacement investment  mechanism of enterprises on the basis of accelerated  depreciation. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen  the mechanism whereby retained profits are turned into  additional investment for expanding production.    4) Establish a securities investment and financing mechanism  for enterprises.    As the present state of affairs in Chinese enterprises  shows,  there are imbalances in the raising and utilization of  construction funds: too much liability financing and too little  investment using their own capital, too much short-term  financing and too little long-term financing. A more salient  problem is that there is too much indirect financing and too  little direct financing. There are currently many barriers  preventing enterprises from entering the securities market. It  is medium-sized and small enterprises rather than large  enterprises that have been given permission to raise funds  through the issuance of bonds and shares. Today, bonds and  shares account for less than 10 percent of enterprises'  construction funds. Thus, it is necessary to gradually open  more channels of securities investment and financing for  enterprises and enlarge the scale of direct financing. This  will also be of great help to strengthening the self-restraining  mechanism of enterprises.    3. Establish and improve the macroregulatory and  control system for government investment    First of all, we must make clear the aim, object, means and  bases of the macroregulation and control of investment: 1) The  aim of macroregulation and control of investment is to sustain  rapid and healthy development under existing low levels of  inflation. The indirect regulation and control of the overall  scale and structure of investment serves this objective. In  other words, the aim of regulation and control is to arouse the  enthusiasm of all quarters for investment and promote economic  development, not to inhibit enthusiasm for investment. 2) The  object of the macroregulation and control of investment is to  promptly regulate and control the parameters of the investment  market and indirectly influence the investment activities of  enterprises. It does not seek to directly control the  activities of investors or to exercise decisionmaking power on  enterprise investment entities. 3) Means of macroregulation  and control of investment are indirect. This mainly relies on  economic means, supplemented by necessary administrative  intervention. It is of a guiding rather than a mandatory  nature, and is service rather than command based. 4) The bases  of the macroregulation and control of investment are threefold:  First, the establishment of a microeconomic investment  operational mechanism (mainly for enterprises), especially the  establishment of a mechanism of self-constraint; second, the  perfection of market development; and third, the support of  other institutional reforms, especially reform of the financial,  monetary, and pricing systems. These are the prerequisites for  the full implementation of various measures for the  macroregulation and control of investment.    The establishment of an indirect macroregulatory and control  system for investment involves a wide range of tasks. In the  near- term, we may focus on the following three areas in our  reform endeavors:    1) Fully activate and strengthen the financial means of  regulation and control. The financial means here refer to funds  (money) financing centering around bank credit. The principal  function of the financial regulatory and control mechanism is to  regulate and control total demand through the regulation of the  money supply. The common means include statutory reserve funds,  open market operations, and rediscount and relending rates. At  present, we should attach importance to the regulatory and  control function of the interest rate lever. The reason is that  in investment, the anticipated rate of return determines whether  or not an enterprise will invest, and the level of the  anticipated rate of return has a close bearing on the level of  interest rates and taxation. Thus, as a market parameter or  signal, it is obvious what effects interest rates will have on  investment. However, from the way the government's regulatory  means and indirect regulatory and control mechanisms exercise  regulation and control, we can see that the government is  obviously trying to affect interest rates by using its monetary  policy to regulate the money supply in the whole society, and  through this to indirectly regulate and control investment.  Hence, it is necessary to gradually delegate the power of  interest rate adjustment to the lower levels and rationally  structure deposit and lending rates so that the interest rate  lever can regulate investment activities in a flexible and  positive way.    2) Accelerate the establishment of a system of state  investment credit funds and organize a long-term state  investment bank. This state investment credit fund is a  long-term credit fund pooled by the central government in the  form of state credits from the public. It offers compensatory  payments in accordance with the principle of exchange at equal  value and is spent on fixed asset investments in line with the  policy objectives of the state. Our aim in establishing an  international credit fund and organizing a long-term state  investment bank lies in searching for and creating a flexible  and effective macroregulatory and control tool that not only  meets the needs of investment in a market economy but can  effectively guide the flow of non-governmental investment.    3) Replace the existing system of administrative examination  and approval with a system of project registration. We should,  in accordance with the principles of a socialist market economy,  reform the system whereby construction projects are decided.  Specifically, we should make clear the "three separations."    First, we should separate the making of decisions on  launching of projects from administrative management. How much  money should go into a project, where the investment should go,  when to invest, the form of investment, investment returns, and  so forth are all matters that must be taken into consideration  in making decisions on projects. In these matters, the decision  should be made by the investors themselves, and government  approval should not be required. The effects of projects on  town planning, land use, the environment, employment, safety,  and other points of public and state interest come under the  jurisdiction of administrative management and must be examined  and approved by government departments concerned in accordance  with the law.    Second, we should separate the investment function of the  government from the management function of the government in  investment. In the past, we were often told that government-  invested projects must be examined and approved by the  government. This measure was ambiguous and failed to separate  the two functions. It is also not conducive to making the  government concentrate its energy on strengthening its  investment management (particularly macroregulation and control)  function. Thus, the investment function of the government  should be handed down to enterprises that handle government  investment and project decisionmaking should be left to these  enterprises. The government may set production and profit  targets and leave construction and operations to the contracted  enterprises. As regards the small number of government-invested  projects with a vital bearing on national or regional  development, a system of review and decisionmaking by local  councils (people's congresses) may be practiced, as is done in  foreign countries.    Third, we should separate the system of project  decisionmaking from the system of project registration.  Following the establishment of a system where construction  projects are decided upon by investors themselves, it is  necessary to establish a strict system of project registration.  This will serve as a crucial foundation for efforts to ensure  the accuracy of the state's macroeconomic investment policies  and the effectiveness of its macroregulation and control.</p>

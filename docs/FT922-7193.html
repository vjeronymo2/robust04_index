			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Advertising industry presses on EC rules THE Advertising Association, which represents 26 leading advertising trade bodies, today steps up its lobbying of the government, MPs and members of the European parliament for further and wider deregulation within the European Community. In a document, The Spirit of '92, the association urges the government to promote 'the construction of a Europe without national restraints on trade or services, and to reinforce progress towards the acceptance of freedom in communications, and truth in advertising'. It calls on the government, during its presidency of the Council of Ministers, to press for: A declaration on the importance of advertising within the single market. Freedom to advertise across national borders. Full application of the principle of subsidiarity (giving member states leeway in implementing EC regulations). Promotion of self-regulation in advertising. Rationalisation of proposals affecting food advertising. Reconsideration of national restrictions on advertising. Continued resistance to a proposed EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;F shares suspended Shares in Bennett &amp; Fountain Group were suspended at 2 3/4 p yesterday at the company's request. The board of Bennett &amp; Fountain, the wholesaler and retailer of electrical goods being acquired by Marlowe Holdings, has expressed concern that its shareholders may have insufficient information to assess the merits of Marlowe's offer. In view of this, Marlowe has agreed to extend the closing date of the offer until two weeks after the announcement of B&amp;F's results.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEETING MEDICAL NEEDS OF REFUGEES;  </P> <P> HEALTH: WORKERS ARE GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR TO REACH OUT TO ELDERLY CAMBODIANS.  LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS HAVE LEFT SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES WARY OF  MODERN MEDICINE.  </P> <P> Nem Norn is almost always tired. A refugee from Cambodia, Nem, 53, saw two of  his children killed by the communist Khmer Rouge before he fled to the United  States five years ago. Today he shares a small apartment in Long Beach with his  wife and four surviving children where, suspecting that his constant state of  exhaustion stems from the longstanding depression of his past, he struggles  through his days with little help.  </P> <P> Yoth Yoeung, 45, has a lump in her throat. Once she went to a doctor, but the  doctor could not speak her language. So Yoeung, also a Cambodian refugee, does  the best she can without much comprehension. "I never understand what the  doctor says," she explained through an interpreter who recently visited her  apartment.  </P> <P> That interpreter was part of a new program that already has served about 350  elderly Southeast Asians in Long Beach, either by luring them to health  education classes or by providing translators for their appointments with  doctors. Sponsored by St. Mary Medical Center and United Cambodian Community  Inc., its aim is to reach Southeast Asians 45 and older, particularly Cambodian  refugees, whose language barriers, cultural values, fear or general alienation  often prevent them from seeking or using much-needed medical care.  </P> <P> "It's an uphill battle," said Lillian Lew, project director, "but I'm sure that  we can make an impact on this community."  </P> <P> In the seven months since the program began, she said, it has sent teams of  bilingual health workers door-to-door in central-city apartment complexes known  to be inhabited by large numbers of Southeast Asians. The teams also have been  stationed at a local Cambodian Buddhist temple where many elderly Cambodians  spend much of their time.  </P> <P> The service is delivered in two basic ways, Lew said. First, health workers  introduce themselves, distribute leaflets bearing the program's telephone  number and interview people regarding the general state of their health. And  second, she said, they organize "health fairs" at the temple or in the  apartment complexes to provide health education and such basic health-care  screening as blood pressure checks, diabetes tests and vision exams.  </P> <P> When health problems are discovered, Lew said, project workers make  appointments for the refugees with doctors of their choice or at St. Mary. If  necessary, she said, they even provide transportation to the doctor's office  and may act as interpreters during the appointments.  </P> <P> Eventually, Lew said, she hopes to expand the program into Asian markets where  health workers will give lectures on nutrition and provide demonstrations on  healthful methods of cooking.  </P> <P> Diet is a key reason for the program, according to Lew, a Chinese-American who  is a registered dietitian with degrees in sociology and cross-cultural  education. Among other things, she said, traditional Southeast Asian culture  encourages the consumption of fatty meats, which contributes to a high  incidence of strokes and cardiovascular disease; pickled or fermented foods,  which doctors suspect of causing stomach cancer, and foods high in sodium,  which contributes to hypertension.  </P> <P> Many of the refugees' general health problems were made worse by their  experiences under Pol Pot, when food was scarce, and by life in refugee camps,  where conditions were primitive.  </P> <P> Although no data exists on the health status of Southeast Asian refugees, Lew  said, they seem to suffer from high rates of hepatitis B, perhaps caused by  unsanitary living conditions; malnutrition, which is probably a result of the  war years, and diabetes, which may be diet or stress-related.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, many older Cambodians suffer from serious mental health  problems, resulting both from the trauma of their past experiences and their  current difficulties in adapting to a new culture.  </P> <P> One of the goals of the new health project, Lew said, is to collect some of the  missing data on the health needs of older Southeast Asians. The task is  difficult because they are wary, she said.  </P> <P> "The Southeast Asians have a different world health view," Lew said. "They have  their own underground health culture."  </P> <P> Among the features of that culture is the perception of a hospital as a place  one goes only to die. Having come from a society in which medical techniques  are an average of 30 years behind those in the United States, Lew said, many  refugees utilize herbal cures, spiritual healing or over-the-counter medicines  rather than seek the advice of trained physicians.  </P> <P> It was to help provide alternatives to those practices that the FHP Foundation  -- a Long Beach-based organization dedicated to supporting health-care  education, research and services -- recently awarded a $140,000 grant to the  Southeast Asian Health Project that runs the new program. The money is being  used, Lew said, for printed materials, health fair personnel, and to pay the  salaries of the teams of bilingual health workers.  </P> <P> Most of the refugees encountered during a recent visit to their apartment  complex seemed to appreciate the personal attention.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy if someone comes to knock at my door," said Lach Kheng, 57,  who, speaking through the interpreter, had complained of "hot" feeings inside  his stomach. "It's a help. I don't know where to go or what to do. At least now  I can discuss it."  </P></p>

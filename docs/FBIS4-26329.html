			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Resolutely Implement the Strategy </F> of Giving Priority to the Development of Education -- Hailing  the Close of the National Education Work Conference"]    [Text] The national education work conference convened by  the party Central Committee and the State Council has ended in  triumph. This is an important conference to mobilize the whole  party and all of society to further implement the strategy of  giving priority to the development of education, and to  seriously carry out the "Program for Education Reform and  Development in China" in a new situation, in which the  establishment of the socialist market economy structure and  modernization are being accelerated in China. The meeting  certainly will have a great influence on the realization of the  strategic goal of educational reform and development in China in  the 1990's, and on promoting reform, opening up, and  modernization.    The rise or decline of a country is determined by education.  This is particularly true of our country, which has a population  of nearly 1.2 billion, with relatively insufficient resources  and relatively backward economy and culture. One thing that has  a decisive significance for the attainment of the magnificent  goal of socialist modernization is to shift economic  construction into the orbit of depending on the progress in  science and technology and of improving the quality of laborers,  and to raise the entire nation's level of ideology, ethics,  science, and culture. It is precisely because of this that the  CPC Central Committee has decided to put education in a  strategic position, in which priority is given to its  development. This is a far-sighted strategic policy decision,  and is a matter of fundamental importance in the realization of  modernization in our country.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, the broad masses of educational workers have worked  industriously under the leadership of party committees and  governments at all levels. They have rapidly developed the  cause of education in our country, gradually carried out reform  in education, made remarkable achievements in educational work,  improved the quality of the people, trained large numbers of  qualified personnel, and made an important contribution to our  country's economic construction, scientific and technological  progress, and social development. At the same time, we also  should be aware that education in our country is still  relatively backward, educational reform still lags behind the  demands of the establishment of the socialist market economy  structure, and educational development still cannot meet the  needs of modernization. The phenomenon of neglecting education  -- and of neglecting basic education, in particular -- still  exists to varying degrees in some localities and departments.  These localities and departments lack a sense of urgency in  educational reform and in practical work, and have not  completely put education in a strategical position in which  priority is given to its development. This situation demands  prompt solution.    The most important thing in implementing the spirit of the  national educational work conference and to carry out the  "Program for Education Reform and Development in China" is to  make great efforts to understand and implement the two words  "giving priority" in "giving priority to the development of  education." We should not just talk about "giving priority,"  write about it on paper, and discuss it at meetings, but should  implement it in work and in deed. As far as planning and the  arrangement of funds are concerned, party committees and  governments at all levels, in studying and formulating  development plans and annual plans, should ensure that priority  is given to the development of education; in making arrangements  for financial budget and spending, should ensure that priority  is given to the needs of education; and in increasing wages for  staff members and workers, should ensure that priority is given  to raising the wages of teachers. As far as the arrangement and  inspection of work are concerned, party committees and  governments at all levels should give priority to the study and  arrangements for educational work, and should give priority to  summing up and inspecting educational work. As far as the  appraisal and use of cadres are concerned, party committees and  governments at all levels should give priority to the appraisal  and use of cadres engaged in educational work and to the  appraisal of how cadres at lower levels exercise leadership over  educational work. They should give priority to promoting cadres  who attach importance to education and have made achievements in  work in leading posts in education. As far as commending and  awarding the advanced is concerned, party committees and  governments at all levels should give priority to commending and  awarding advanced individuals and collectives that have worked  industriously for the reform and development of education, have  made selfless contributions, have obtained remarkable results in  work, and really have made major attainments. For sometime to  come in the future, we should make greater efforts, from top to  bottom, to create the public opinion of "giving priority to  education," to think of practical moves to "give priority to  education," to do solid work to "give priority to education,"  and to get actual results in "giving priority to education." We  should make unremitting efforts over a period of time to enable  the strategy of giving priority to the development of education  to strike root deeply in ideological concepts and in actual  work. We should turn "giving priority to education" into the  ideological habit of the people and the conscious demand in the  arrangement of work, so that "giving priority to education" can  become a common practice in society. In this way, our country  and our nation will be full of promise.    Ideology is the guide to action. To do a good job in  implementing the spirit of the recent educational work  conference, we must seriously study Comrade Jiang Zemin's  important speech at the conference and Comrade Li Peng's theme  report. In particular, we should seriously study and understand  a series of expositions on education made by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas on education are the  theoretical basis for our party to formulate the educational  principles and policies for the new period, and are a powerful  ideological weapon guiding educational reform and development.  At the last national educational work conference nine years  ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made an important speech entitled:  "Seriously Grasp Education Work." (See Volume 3 of  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.) He pointed out: "A  leader who neglects education is a leader who lacks  far-sightedness, is not mature, and is not able to lead  modernization." Comrade Xiaoping hopes party committees and  governments at all levels will grasp education work and will  "not indulge in empty talk, but do more solid work." That  speech was very good and what he said is still applicable to  reality, even today. We suggest that leading comrades at all  levels restudy it properly.    The key to revitalizing education lies in leadership. As  long as the leadership of party committees and governments at  all levels really implement the strategy of giving priority to  the development of education, a new situation in which education  in our country develops even more vigorously certainly will  emerge!</p>

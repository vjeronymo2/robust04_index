			<p>BFN     [Text] At the talks conducted in Kiev between the Ukrainian  Government and an economic delegation from the U.S., Ukraine  suggested that part of the $350 million allocated by the U.S.  should be used as security for receiving credit from a major  foreign bank. As Ukraine's Economics Minister, Roman Shpek,  said during the talks, Kiev is not prepared to "use $350 million  in the near future."    The leadership of Ukraine's Cabinet criticized Washington  for  having advanced too many conditions for granting concrete  economic aid. According to Deputy Premier Valentin Landik,  under American proposals the granting of $95 million to support  private enterprise will become possible only if leasing as a  means of privatizing property is given up.    According to American experts, leasing may hinder the  "voucher privatization," which they view as the most progressive  method of reforming property.    Landik urged members of the U.S. delegation to refrain from  advancing conditions for the granting of aid, and to stop their  calls for "starting reforms."    As he said, the lowering of inflation to 5.7 pct and the  start of privatization indicate that reforms in Ukraine have  already begun, and that concrete support for them is necessary.    During the talks American negotiators also insisted that  Ukraine should introduce a market rate for its karbovanets in  relation to hard currencies. Landik for his part declared that  the state will continue to regulate the karbovanets rate till  the crisis is overcome.    The two delegations are led by the Ukrainian Deputy Premier,  Valentin Landik, and by Nicholas Burns, a senior official from  the U.S. National Security Council.</p>

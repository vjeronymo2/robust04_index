			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RABIN, MUBARAK DISAGREE OVER ARAB DELEGATION  </P> <P> Israel's defense minister told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today that  Israel would accept an Egyptian-sponsored dialogue with Palestinians, but the  two leaders disagreed on the composition of the Arab delegation.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mubarak aired their disagreement publicly  after meeting in Cairo for more than three hours.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Rabin said Israel advocates negotiations only with  Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since 1967.  At a separate news conference, Mubarak insisted that Palestinians from outside  the territories be included as well.  </P> <P> But both leaders voiced cautious optimism about the current Israeli-Egyptian  exchanges on a scenario for overall settlement of the Palestinian problem,  which has kept the Middle East in turmoil for four decades.  </P> <P> They said their two countries will have further high-level talks.  </P></p>

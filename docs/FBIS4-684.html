			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit: "Top Communist Says SACP Is </F> Fighting for the Soul of the ANC; `Unique Communism' Planned for  South Africa"]    [Text] The struggle for "the heart and soul" of the ANC  begins immediately after voting day. It will be a fight between  the South African Communist Party [SACP] and anticommunists, a  battle to influence the ANC on its future direction. This was  said by a member of the SACP's politburo, Mr. Jeremy Cronin.    Mr. Cronin, widely regarded as the party's chief ideologist,  commented in an interview with RAPPORT on the SACP's aims and  the accusation that the SACP controls the ANC. It is not true  that the SACP manipulates the ANC, according to Mr. Cronin. I  can truthfully say that a struggle is looming "for the heart and  soul" of the ANC after the election. The SACP aims to persuade  the ANC to broadly accept and carry out the principles of  communism so that a unique form of communism can be applied in  South Africa.    "The best features of the systems adopted in the Soviet  Union, Cuba, and Red China should be included. The ANC and the  SACP do not differ over short term issues, but we obviously have  a long-term socialist perspective not shared by everyone in the  ANC. We are unashamedly in favor of communism in South Africa  as a medium and long-term solution. The best chance of applying  socialism is to persuade the ANC on the issue. Some of our  opponents, however, have a different agenda. They want to  transform the ANC into a sort of social-democratic party. This  means that it would be difficult to distinguish between the NP  [National Party] and the ANC's policies, the free market system  will remain, and the main parties will take turns governing."    But the SACP is fighting tooth and nail so that the process  of "democratization" does not to come to a halt, and for the ANC  not to just accept some form of neoliberalism -- for this reason  the struggle will be waged for the heart and soul of the ANC,  according to Mr. Cronin. "We are standing on the eve of a very  long and complicated struggle on the direction of change in  South Africa. A time could arise when the alliance with the ANC  could cost us more than it is worth and then we could take an  independent course. There is nothing in the ANC's policy that  the SACP wants to change, but there are worrying tendencies  within the ANC against which we wage an open battle."    On calls for the ANC to distance itself from the SACP, Mr.  Cronin says: "The alliance has frightened off some people, but  it has attracted far more. The SACP has given the ANC  legitimacy in its struggle, in convincing some of its supporters  that it is not selling out to government, and in this way it has  been able to maintain unity within the ANC."    Mr. Cronin emphasizes that no one should suspect the SACP of  plotting to establish an undemocratic government in the country.  The party is committed to a multiparty system, a human rights  charter, an independent judiciary, free press -- all the  characteristics of true democratic government. "We will raise  the Red flag, but in a constitutional way."  <H5>  Change in Stance </H5>   "The SACP has indeed changed its stance on many issues long  associated with communism and should get the credit it deserves.  Social and economic problems, however, should be addressed  through a process of democratization." This democratization  means greater powers to workers in, among other sectors,  industry and agriculture. It does not necessarily mean the  nationalization of industry and the expropriation of farms, but  could include this. He has no problem with private ownership  rights "on a small scale" but is nevertheless in favor of  collective farming, according to Mr. Cronin. Through, for  example, labor legislation and pressure on financial  institutions, farmers can also be forced to grant more  concessions to their workers.    The South African Communist Party is not ashamed of the  history of communism, even though it has "significantly" failed  in the Eastern Bloc, and though huge faults were made under the  banner of communism, says Mr. Cronin. "We believe that we are  interpreting Marx more correctly that the former Soviet leaders.  Besides, did Christians reject the Sermon on the Mount, for  example, because apartheid was applied in the name of  Christianity?"</p>

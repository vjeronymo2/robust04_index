			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to put a price on gold Sir, We want to correct a point made by Richard Waters on the subject of gold and inflation (Global Investor, August 1). The column summarised some of the results of our gold price/future inflation model presented in Bear Stearns' Global Spectator, The Golden Challenge, July 26. Waters writes that Bear Stearns' chief economist, Wayne Angell, argues that 'for a stable price environment, the Federal Reserve would have to target a (gold) price of Dollars 220 an ounce'. This is not true. The Dollars 220 an ounce price is derived from our inflation-gold price regression, assuming a zero per cent inflation rate. However, we clearly said 'this is not to say that the Fed should target Dollars 220 gold' because: index number problems could mean that price stability is associated with 1/2 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent inflation; there is uncertainty over the statistical relationship, especially at low inflation rates; and the disinflation path should be gradual. We do not take our regression results seriously enough to suppose that they can tell us the price of gold that is consistent with price stability. What is clear, however, is that the current price of gold is too high. Not only is Dollars 380 an ounce inconsistent with price stability but actually signals a rising inflation rate to the 3 1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent area in 1995. A good first step for policy, however, would be for the Fed to get the price of gold back into the Dollars 320 to Dollars 340 an ounce area, signalling that the US economy is back on the disinflation path.

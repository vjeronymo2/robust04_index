			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KURT SANDERLING BRINGS TRADITION OF OLD WORLD TO THE PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> There are many Los Angeles Philharmonmics these days.  </P> <P> There is the blank, eminently professional ensemble that cranks out concert  after concert for a numbing variety of hastily departing guest conductors at  Hollywood Bowl. There is the neat and efficient orchestra that gives its  dutiful best, even in lackluster repertory, for Andre Previn. There is the  super-precise community of musicians that responds so alertly to the baton --  or is it a scalpel? -- of Pierre Boulez. There is the heartily generous  Philharmonic that produces fastidiously exciting sounds at the urging of Simon  Rattle.  </P> <P> We cannot be quite sure what sort of a Philharmonic will emerge when Esa-Pekka  Salonen finally comes to town and takes over. In the meantime, those who value  warm, spacious, sensitive music-making that springs from a nearly extinct  Old-World tradition can take comfort in the continuing visits of Kurt  Sanderling.  </P> <P> His, admittedly, is a strange case. German born and trained, he sidelined what  might have become an international career when he emigrated to the Soviet Union  in 1936. In 1960, he became a semi-secret weapon of the East German regime,  focusing his activities on the inaccessible side of Berlin and in distant  Dresden.  </P> <P> During the 1970s, he began to travel better-beaten paths. London has seen a lot  of him. He has served as guest conductor with several American orchestras, most  notably San Francisco and New York. Now 77, he earns decent respect wherever he  goes, but in this age of monstrous egos and quirky personality cults, he is  hardly considered a superstar.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he has commanded -- and deserved -- all-out reverence in Los  Angeles since 1984. There must be something special, and something elusive, in  the chemistry between this pensive, no-nonsense maestro and the collection of  receptive, versatile players at his command here.  </P> <P> Audiences and musicians in other centers regard Sanderling as a solid  practitioner of his craft. Southern Californians cherish him, with good reason,  as the most enlightened exponent of the mellow Germanic tradition to regularly  grace our podium since the golden days of Bruno Walter. He belongs to an  endangered species.  </P> <P> Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he opened the concert with a  festive yet fervent performance of Mozart's "Zauberflote" overture, the hints  of charm counterbalanced by muscular solemnity. After intermission, he presided  over a monumental reading of Beethoven's "Eroica."  </P> <P> It began with agitation that took the Allegro con brio marking quite literally,  slowed for a profoundly moving funeral march, flexed muscles without  compromising grace in the Scherzo, and capped the closing passages of the final  Allegro with a daring ritard -- a liberty that added romantic majesty to the  inherent heroism. Under his gentle urgings, the Philharmonic mustered the  breadth, the unanimity of phrasing, the dynamic flexibility, the balance of  choirs and delicacy of nuance that identify a great orchestra.  </P> <P> In the centerpiece of the program, Haydn's C-major Cello Concerto, Sanderling  enforced poise and intimacy as a frame of reference for the solo exertions of  Ronald Leonard. The principal cellist of the orchestra played with passionate  fluency, commanding bravura and lean, elegant tone, all of which made the  nearly inevitable pitch problems seem nearly irrelevant.  </P></p>

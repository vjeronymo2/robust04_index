			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / BBC makes 'final' offer in dispute The BBC yesterday unveiled its 'final' offer to resolve its industrial dispute with staff. The three unions concerned said they would give their response by Tuesday. The BBC presented the package after four days of discussions with the unions at the offices of Acas, the conciliation service. Union negotiators told the BBC they wanted to consult their officials before deciding whether to ballot staff over the offer or reject it and resume a series of one-day strikes. The BBC said in a statement that it had been 'constructive' and had sought 'to address the unions' concerns'. The BBC insisted yesterday it had not backed down on its two main objectives, which are to devolve conditions of service agreements to lower levels of management and to maintain the link between pay and performance. If the unions reject the corporation's offer plans for further stoppages next Thursday and Sunday remain in place.</p>

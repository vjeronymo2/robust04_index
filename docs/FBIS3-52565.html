The letter concerns bilateral relations  between the two countries and ways of giving them impetus and  bolstering them in all spheres on the basis of the progress of  the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council], the situation in the Arab  and international arenas, and issues of mutual concern.    Before leaving Abu Dhabi earlier today, Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad  al-Jabir stressed that Kuwait would not attend any Arab summit  conference that may be convened to bring about Arab  reconciliation unless the causes of Arab disputes had been  removed first.    In a statement to some Arab correspondents, he said that  Kuwait's stance vis-a-vis Arab reconciliation had not changed,  stressing that reconciliation may be discussed once the main  cause that has created the Arab dispute had been resolved.    The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister  stressed  that there were no differences in perception among GCC states  with regards to reconciliation. He pointed out that the GCC  states' stance emphasized the need for any reconciliation to be  preceded by confronting the wrongdoings committed.    In his statement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir stressed  that the GCC was the mainstay of security in the region. He  said that agreement was reached at the Riyadh summit to develop  the strength of the Peninsula Shield force and increase the  number of its troops in order for it to become a shield for  protecting the region's countries. [passage omitted]    The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister  reaffirmed Kuwait's welcome of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement  as an initial step toward a just and comprehensive peace. He  denied that there were contacts between Kuwait and the PLO.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Beleaguered Schneider files for bankruptcy: Vanished entrepreneur's empire to be liquidated The Jurgen Schneider group, the German property empire plunged into crisis last week after the disappearance of the company's founder and chief executive, gave up its fight for survival yesterday and declared itself insolvent. The formal bankruptcy application for Jurgen Schneider AG, the company at the heart of the vanished entrepreneur's property interests, was lodged yesterday morning at the company's request in Konigstein, the town near Frankfurt where Mr Schneider used to run his operations from a 19th-century castle. The application, which will lead to a creditors' meeting scheduled for May 17, came the day after more than 40 banks owed more than DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) by the group convened for the first time to discuss the crisis. They decided that the group had no viable future and pledged to undertake an orderly liquidation of its property portfolio. It emerged after the banks' meeting that unpaid debts to contractors and other trade creditors amounted to an estimated DM250m. That is significantly smaller than early estimates of several billion, but still threatens the existence of hundreds of small businesses and thousands of jobs throughout Germany. The Economics Ministry in Bonn said that so far 50 companies in the construction sector, employing 1,000 people, had said they were affected. The company's cash resources are limited to DM5m. Simultaneously, the Treuhand privatisation agency for former east German state concerns said it would foreclose on debts of DM53m owed by Schneider. Mr John Morgan, a property consultant advising three of the bank creditors on behalf of DTZ Zadelhoff, said all the banks involved may face a total loss of DM1.5bn. He added: 'This is highly provisional, as there is no clear picture as yet. Some properties can be sold at more than their book values but others can only be got rid of at a substantial discount.' The picture yesterday was one of confusion as bankers sought to justify the scale of their loans to Mr Schneider while politicians fought to limit the effects of the collapse on the small business sector, especially sensitive during an election year. Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, called on banks to help small companies overcome the crisis. Bankers, however, emphasised that they wanted to limit the impact of the company's failure on jobs and small businesses, while insisting that they had no direct responsibility for the exposure of small businesses to Schneider. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor with an exposure of more than DM1bn, said on a radio programme that trade creditors had made good money from working for Schneider in the past and that Deutsche was not responsible for their plight.

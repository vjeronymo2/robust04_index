			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.N.: "Pongracz Opposes State Guarantees to </F> Banks"]    [Text] A mood of pogrom arose against the State Property  Agency [AVU] and the State Property Management Corporation  [AVRT]; the program of some politicians consists merely of  attacking privatization, or rather, the two institutions, State  Secretary Tibor Pongracz told MAGYAR HIRLAP.    However, he emphasized, these are not the only institutions  for privatization. In his opinion, it is here that one can find  the most reliable data both about the size of the property and  the process of privatization. He finds it strange that no one is  requesting data about the size and the fate of property in the  hands of local governments, the treasury property manager, or  the cooperatives. Incidentally, at its latest meeting, the board  of directors of AVU decided to prepare for parliament the list  of state firms privatized up to now, as requested by Zoltan  Kiraly.    Tibor Pongracz drew attention to spontaneous privatization  that started at the time of the previous government, and noted  that in order to see clearly one should give an account to  parliament and the public about that process, as well. He noted  that AVU was established by the Socialists, but they never drew  up a property list.    The state secretary regards privatization as a fundamental  issue for the economy, and as he put it, "if politicians during  the campaign turn it into a prostitute, it will be difficult to  turn it into a nun in a few months."    The state secretary does not agree with the latest proposal  by the board of directors of the AVRT, namely that in the second  segment of providing the banks with capital the state should  supply them not with money, but with guarantees. As he said,  this would lead to a process in which the banks would completely  exploit the firms, drive them to ruin, and then hand in the bill  to the government.</p>

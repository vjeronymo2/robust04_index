			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 29 March reports  intensified fighting in the following areas:    As the announcer in the studio reports, quoting  correspondent  Enes Musovic, "since 0515 this morning the aggressor's artillery  has been firing a shell every second at the defense lines and  the civilian quarters. The attacks are particularly  concentrating in the region of Gradina on the right bank of the  Drina River, from the direction of Foca and Cajnice." As  correspondent from Gorazde Fahrudin Bekcic then reports, "eight  injured and one killed is the final outcome of the chetnik  rampage over the last 24 hours. The artillery attacks that had  started yesterday stopped briefly just after midnight, to be  continued with even greater ferocity at 0510 this morning. More  than 2,000 shells of various calibers have landed in a matter of  only a few hours. The aggressor is displaying the most intense  attacks in the direction of Cajnice. They are attacking the  entire defense line on the right bank of the Drina River between  Osanica and Ustipraca with howitzers, tanks, mortars of all  calibers, antiaircraft machine guns, self-propelled antiaircraft  artillery, and hill guns. Another 10 trucks with fresh enemy  forces arrived in this area at approximately 0500 hours.  Perfectly reliable information claims that there are numerous  Montenegrin reservists and mercenaries among them." As Bekcic  continues to report, "the situation is equally dramatic on the  other side, in the part of the battlefield toward Rogatica and  in other directions." He concludes that "according to the  reports from the field, this is the most powerful attack in this  region" so far.    A report by Smajl Terzic from the information service of the  7th South Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army claims  that "the aggressor has been attacking the defense lines in the  zone of responsibility of the 7th South Operative Group from all  available arms overnight. The situation was the most stormy  near (Buzno Groblje) and (?Plane), where the united units in a  counteroffensive pushed the chetniks back and conquered  domineering elevations from which the enemy had been pounding  the free territory day and night. Plenty of ammunition and arms  were seized in this action. In retaliation for numerous losses  in manpower and military hardware, the chetniks shelled the  civilian targets in Mrkotic where one woman died. They are  constantly attacking the Pejici-Bandera defense line, as well as  (Krh and Svijakovac) from Dedovo Brdo."</p>

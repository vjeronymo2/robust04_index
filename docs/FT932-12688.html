			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Moulinex tumbles into the red MOULINEX, the French manufacturer of kitchen appliances, fell from a net profit of FFr171m (Dollars 31.5m) in 1991 to a loss of FFr115m last year because of difficult economic conditions in Europe and adverse exchange rates. The group, which two years ago took on heavy debts in acquiring Krups, the German electrical goods producer, plans to seek new capital in an attempt to return to profit 'within two or three years'. For months Moulinex's management has been split over the recapitalisation plan. But last month the group began negotiations with its banks after Mr Gilbert Torelli, its deputy chief executive, raised his stake in Societe des Fondateurs, the group's parent, from 35 to 44.9 per cent. Moulinex, which also owns the Swan and Girmi brand names, has been under pressure in the European electrical goods market where it faces fierce competition from the giant multinational consumer electronics groups. Last year, these general problems were aggravated by the slowdown in consumer spending in its key French, German and UK markets. Sales fell to FFr8.22bn from FFr8.36bn in 1991 But it was also hit by the strength of the French franc after the September currency crisis, which cost it an estimated FFr125m in lost income. Operating profits plummeted to FFr235m from FFr499m in 1991. Results were also hit by the restructuring of Krups, which cost FFr45m last year. It has cut the Krups workforce by 800 since the takeover.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THERE'S A BABY IN THE BOSS' FUTURE  </P> <P> Rock superstar Bruce Springsteen and his girlfriend, Patti Scialfa, are  expecting a baby, USA Today reported today.  </P> <P> USA Today said Columbia Records confirmed the pregnancy but did not say when  the baby is due or whether the couple will marry.  </P> <P> Officials at New York-based Columbia Records could not be immediately reached  for comment today; the telephone was answered with a recording because of the  Martin Luther King holiday. Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, did not  immediately return a call seeking comment.  </P> <P> Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, his former backup singer, revealed their romance  publicly in the spring of 1988, after Springsteen and his wife, actress  Julianne Phillips, split up. He had married Phillips in 1985; the couple had no  children.  </P> <P> Springsteen is known for such hits as "Born in the U.S.A.," "Hungry Heart" and  "Born to Run."  </P></p>

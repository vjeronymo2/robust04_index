			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHEAPER DOLLAR MAY NOT HELP A LOT OF U.S. EXPORTERS  </P> <P> With the dollar plunging against the Japanese yen, Hannah Kirschner would love  to be shipping her U.S.-made men's neckties across the Pacific.  </P> <P> The fine silk ties produced by her firm, Los Angeles-based Jacobs &amp; Roberts  Ltd., should be more of a bargain than ever for Japanese buyers -- and thus  more appealing.  </P> <P> But Kirschner has looked into the export business, only to decide that "it's  just too much hassle." In particular, though the dollar's slide may give her a  price advantage, she has found that "the Japanese look for brand names only" --  so price often becomes meaningless if you aren't selling a well-known name.  </P> <P> Kirschner's experience illustrates why the dollar's steep decline isn't the  export panacea that it is frequently touted to be these days. As the dollar  reaches near-record lows against the yen and other major currencies, many Bush  Administration officials and private economists are practically cheering the  slide, arguing that it will spark a new American export boom.  </P> <P> Yet the drop in the dollar so far isn't translating into immediate new business  for many exporters, especially small and mid-sized companies. Many of those  firms in Southern California say they expect to benefit over the long term, but  they don't anticipate the easy business that some economists seem to see.  </P> <P> "We'll see it (the benefit) more in 1991 -- if the trend keeps up," says Mark  Ryvola, manager of international business for communications equipment maker  Emulex Corp. in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> In theory, the American exporter's advantage from the dollar's sinking value  should work like this: At the start of the year, it took 1.69 German marks to  buy one dollar. Now, it takes only 1.50 marks, as currency traders' faith in  the United States economy -- and in our investments -- has plummeted.  </P> <P> Say an American firm was selling a product in Germany for a price of 1.69 marks  early this year. Each sale thus brought the exporter $1 when the firm exchanged  currencies. Today, if the exporter sells the product for 1.69 marks in Germany,  it reaps $1.13 when it exchanges currencies, because each mark buys more  dollars.  </P> <P> Rather than take the windfall, the firm could cut its product price in Germany  to 1.50 marks, and still bring home the same $1 it received early in the year.  The advantage in cutting the price, of course, is that it should gain market  share over competitors.  </P> <P> But the pricing equation rarely is that simple, experts say. Stanley Epstein,  who heads American Export Trading Co. in North Hollywood, says the immediate  benefit of a falling dollar goes to "the items that the U.S. has been strongest  in -- the items not available from other countries." For example, aerospace  companies may gain because a dollar-driven cut in prices could attract buyers  who have long wanted certain products but couldn't afford them.  </P> <P> The majority of U.S. manufacturers, however, face a much tougher time  exporting, even with the lower dollar, Epstein says. His firm has been  assisting exporters for years, and he says many American businesses still don't  understand the highly competitive nature of world markets. Prices that American  companies think are fair won't fly in many markets, he says.  </P> <P> "We are pretty much of a screwed-up nation when it comes to export," Epstein  says. "We still think in terms of being the sole source for the world," when  that simply isn't true anymore.  </P> <P> Even savvy exporters face tall hurdles today, despite the dollar advantage:  </P> <P> * Many companies are unsure how frequently they ought to be changing prices,  fearful that the dollar could backtrack on them. Personal computer maker AST  Research in Irvine has stuck with a quarterly price-change system because "in  the short term it's very difficult to adjust prices to the dollar's  fluctuations," says Chief Executive Safi Qureshey.  </P> <P> Even then, many companies are at the mercy of overseas middlemen-distributors,  who may pad their own pockets by paying less for U.S. products as the dollar  falls -- without cutting the price to their retail buyers.  </P> <P> "It happens," says Qureshey. "Sometimes the middlemen say there is no need to  cut the price."  </P> <P> * Consumer-product exporters often face the same aggravation that Jacobs &amp;  Roberts experienced with its neckties: Foreign buyers can be extremely  brand-conscious, not responding to price. That's particularly true in Germany  and Japan.  </P> <P> * Currencies of some of the most aggressive young exporters -- such as Hong  Kong and Taiwan -- move in concert with the dollar. Thus, those competitors  never worry about American firms gaining a price advantage.  </P> <P> What's more, given the potential for more manufacturing to shift to  low-labor-cost markets, such as China and Eastern Europe, Epstein questions  whether any currency advantage will be enough to make many U.S. firms  competitive. "How cheap can we make the dollar?" he asks.  </P> <P> Still, many Southland companies are eager to sell more of their lines overseas,  and more than a few are succeeding. For them, the falling dollar can only be a  plus in the long run, they say.  </P> <P> Emulex's Ryvola expects a boost for the firm's most competitive  computer-communications products in Europe in 1991. The bulk of them are made  in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Charles Malouf, licensing director of beach clothing maker Sideout Sport in  Pasadena, says a big European distributor has decided to have more of his line  manufactured here for shipment to Europe, thanks to the cheaper dollar. The  merchandise would have been manufactured in the Far East, Malouf said.  </P> <P> And AST Research should benefit directly from the dollar's slide if one of its  new computer systems -- which combines Japanese kanji characters and English --  takes off in Japan. The system will be made here for sale there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE DOLLAR: AN UNEVEN SLIDE WORLDWIDE  </P> <P> The dollar is down more than 10% so far this year against most major  currencies. But against currencies of most young U.S. trading partners in the  Far East, the dollar is higher or unchanged -- a result of those countries'  exchange-rate control strategies.  </P> <TABLE

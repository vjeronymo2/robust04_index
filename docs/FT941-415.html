			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Governance which displays apathy and inertia Sir, One has to question whether the chairman of the Building Societies Association does his members a service by arguing for the status quo in relation to the corporate governance of building societies (Letters, March 22). He is, of course, correct in pointing to the need for members' approval for the adoption of new powers and the part played by members in the election of directors. The message your readers are meant to draw is that the current system of building society governance is alive and well. One wonders, what proportion of members vote, either for resolutions or directors? Since the current legislation was introduced in 1986, how many societies' boards have been constrained from operating any new powers through their resolutions being rejected? How many directors nominated by existing boards have been initially appointed since 1986? How many directors nominated by members have been elected in that time? The answers to such questions would provide perspective and add some factual basis for the accountability debate. What they will point to is a system of corporate governance which exhibits apathy and inertia among the vast majority of members, with boards almost without exception getting their way. Effectively, it is a corporate governance vacuum. And where a vacuum exists, something will fill it. The Building Societies Commission has already had one go at trying to apply Cadbury's plc-based recommendations to building societies and is now reconsidering the issue. The Treasury is currently considering building society legislation as part of its deregulation initiative. In this regard, some societies have welcomed proposals which would lead to even lower levels of member participation. Most members who have ever attended the typical building society AGM couldn't tell the difference between its orchestrated proceedings and those of a Tory party conference. If that is what is to pass as evidence of effective accountability and good corporate governance in practice, some people are easily pleased. Trying to perpetuate an unadulterated system based on largely 19th century ideals of mutual self-help is a delusion. Societies are running the risk that the vacuum might be filled with something they will not like and surely would not have designed for themselves.

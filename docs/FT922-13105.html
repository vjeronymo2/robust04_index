			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE decline puts pressure on Eurobond dealing EUROPEAN bond markets would be among the most seriously hit if the collapse in Tokyo equity prices halts the flow of Japanese investment into overseas financial markets. Traders already report net selling of UK government bonds by Japanese investors, taking advantage of the rally which followed the general election last week. Views are mixed, though, on whether this will turn into sustained selling. Whereas Japanese investors directed much of their cash during the 1980s into US government bonds, the past two years has seen a shift in emphasis, with European markets benefiting far more from the Japanese capital surplus. US dollar bonds still account for the bulk of Japanese investors' overseas financial assets: roughly Dollars 400bn, according to Mr Mark Cliffe of Nomura Research Institute in London. However, net new investment overseas is increasingly being diverted elsewhere. The chart records a fall-off in net new US bond investment from the peak of 1989, and a simultaneous growth in European investment. The quarterly figures for 1991 - shown on an annual basis - exaggerate the fall in the US, since they reflect in part a seasonal investment pattern. However, the shift in favour of European bond markets is clear. The trend is even more exaggerated if Eurodollar investments are excluded. According to figures produced by the Japanese Securities Dealers Association, Eurobond investments - mainly in Eurodollar instruments - last year totalled Dollars 32bn. Leaving these aside, the Japanese made roughly the same net investment in UK and US bonds, of Dollars 13bn each. The extent of Japanese repatriation of capital has been modest so far, most traders say. Japanese banks and life assurance companies find themselves in very different positions. For banks, with a pressing need to shrink balance sheets, selling foreign bond holdings appears attractive. However, as Mr Cliffe of NRI points out, such holdings are among the highest-yielding assets the banks hold. The pressure to improve margins means they would be loathe to sell. Although insurance companies may not be directly hit by the Tokyo stock market collapse, as providers of subordinated loans they have in the past provided one of the props to banks in times of capital need. If life companies are still willing and able to provide subordinated debt to banks - and if they choose to finance it through the sale of foreign investments rather than depressed Japanese ones - overseas selling could follow. Whether or not the Japanese sell bonds, they are unlikely to buy so many new ones in the months ahead. The gilts market could suffer more than most.</p>

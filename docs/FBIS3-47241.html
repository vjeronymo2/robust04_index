			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pak Che-kyun] </F>   [Text] It is estimated that because of the damage caused  by the cold weather last year in North Korea, the harvest of its  major grains, including rice and corn, has decreased by 15-20  percent compared with the average crop of 5.10 million tonnes.  In the case of steel production, however, due to reinforcement  of facilities at the Chollima steel mill in Nampo city and the  Hwanghae steel mill in Songnim city, production has increased by  about 200,000 tonnes.    At the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National  Unification Committee on 10 January, the National Unification  Board [NUB] reported on trends in North Korea based on recently  obtained information. The following are trends in North Korea  in the political, economic, military, and social fields, as  reported by the NUB.  <H5>  Politics </H5>   It seems that while strengthening the unity centered on the  two "leaders" Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, the "Kim Chong-il  era" will be formulated on a full scale. At the 8 November 1993  journalists congress, North Korea called President Kim Il-song  "the great leader," and Kim Chong-il, chairman of the National  Defense Commission, "the sagacious leader of our party and  people."    Nevertheless, dissatisfaction over Kim Chong-il is  increasing  among the North Korean people. There are rumors of discontent  by the people saying: "Rice and meat were sufficient in the  seventies but our lives became difficult from the time the  "thoughtless child" Kim Chong-il started to carry out politics."  Therefore, the North Korean authorities are strengthening  surveillance of the people through the State Security Defense  Department, which has been placed under the control of Kim  Chong-il.  <H5>  Economics </H5>   During the early part of last year the volume of trade with  China, North Korea's largest trading partner, increased 39  percent compared with 1992. Export was $120 million and import  was $310 million. However, the volume of trade with Japan  decreased by 2.6 percent compared with 1992. Export was $110  million and import was $110 million.    In 1992 North Korea established a series of laws to lure  foreign capital, such as the foreign investment law.  Nevertheless, in 1993 only three joint venture companies were  set up. Among the 120 joint venture companies established in  North Korea, only 20 remain at this time.    The provisions North Korea imported from Thailand, Canada,  China, and other countries from January to August last year  amounted to 645,000 tonnes. It is expected that the crude oil  North Korea imported during the first half of the last year  amounted to 1.1 million tonnes. It seems that the electric  power situation in North Korea has worsened. It has been  learned that the operations of large plants and power stations,  including the Sunchon vinalon complex, Sariwon potash fertilizer  plant, and Tongpyongyang thermal power station, have actually  stopped. It has been reported that to overcome such an economic  difficulty, the party has transferred the task of working out  economic policy to the Administration Council.  <H5>  Military </H5>   North Korea has constantly built up war potential by  deploying additional large-caliber long-range guns along the  front line and by reinforcing district commands. By deploying  170-mm self-propelled artillery with a range of 54 km and 240-mm  multiple rocket launchers with a range of 70 km along the front  line, North Korea brings Seoul and Suwon into target range. In  addition, North Korea has augmented the three division-level  district commands of Yanggang Province, Chagang Province, and  North Hwanghae Province into corps level.    Setting up last year as the "year to complete war  preparations," North Korea has stockpiled war supplies large  enough to conduct war for three or five months without external  supplies. It has also reinforced underground facilities.  <H5>  Society </H5>   Capitalist concepts are flowing into North Korea through  foreign students, traders, diplomats, and Chinese compatriots.  Western-style fashions are spreading among youth. Youth with  long hair have been appearing in Pyongyang City since 1987.  Since 1988, youth have enjoyed listening to rock music and  disco dancing in secret. Blue jeans and bell-bottomed trousers  have been catching on among youth since 1990.    As a result of life difficulties, phrases, such as "Let us  live together," "Let us share things equally," and "Let us make  an arrangement," are catching on among residents. Even slang --  calling thieves "life coordination committees," calling  robberies "redistribution of wealth," and calling stolen goods  "life coordination committee's goods" -- are spreading.    Since 1989, private loan businesses have been frequent among  black-market merchants in North Hamgyong Province districts. The  Korean card game, "go-and-stop," has been spread in North Korea  by Chinese compatriots and Chinese emigrants.</p>

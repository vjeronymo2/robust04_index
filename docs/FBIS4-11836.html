			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Mar (MENA)--Sudanese Foreign Minister  Husayn Abu-Salih held a news conference today in which he  described his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  as friendly. He added that they agreed to work together to  straighten out bilateral relations. He noted that Minister Musa  expressed readiness to meet him in Khartoum. They will agree  upon a date later. He said the problem of Hala'ib can be solved  through negotiations between the two countries, not through the  media. He stressed that Sudan would allow nothing that would  harm Egypt's security.    Abu-Salih pointed out that Sudan held talks with the rebels  in the south to find a solution to the problem, adding that  Sudan cannot agree to the right of self-determination for the  south. He noted that the Arab states' position on the south is  that they are against any attempt to separate it from the north  and that they support Sudan's unity and territorial integrity.    The Sudanese foreign minister pointed out that resolving the  inter-Arab differences requires courage, a strong will, and a  mechanism. The Arab League secretary general, he added,  proposed a mechanism for resolving these differences and  restoring true Arab solidarity. He noted that Sudan wants its  relations with all the Arab countries to be normal, so that  solidarity can be restored, differences eliminated, and things  restored to normal.</p>

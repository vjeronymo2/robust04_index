			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S PARTY TIME FOR METRO RAIL;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: BUILDERS OF THE SUBWAY SPONSOR A CELEBRATION TO CHEER UP  CONSTRUCTION-WEARY MERCHANTS ALONG A RESTORED 7TH STREET STRIP.  </P> <P> Builders of the Metro Rail subway system threw a party Monday for merchants  along a two-block strip of 7th Street, an affair intended to celebrate the  district's freedom from three years of construction fences, earthmoving  vehicles, hard hats and, most important, a construction-related slump in  business.  </P> <P> Even with a 30-piece brass band, clowns and hard-working mimes, few store  owners at the "Street Restoration Celebration" were in a festive mood: They  have been freed from the machinations of Metro Rail construction just in time  to enter a Christmas shopping season threatened with recession.  </P> <P> "Everybody hopes this season isn't as bad as it's being forecast," said Sieg  Lindstrom, owner of Fowler Brothers bookstore. "All we can do is hope. That's  all we could do for the last three years."  </P> <P> Since late 1987, the chaos caused by the $48-million construction of Metro  Rail's first station kept customers away, forced delivery trucks to maneuver  around earthmoving vehicles and allowed burglars and vandals to use the  barricades' nocturnal cover to commit crimes. Three stores closed.  </P> <P> It was not until last month that subway workers began removing the jutting  fences that had turned sidewalks into narrow pathways and leisurely lunch-hour  strolls into acrobatic feats.  </P> <P> "It became a real hassle," said attorney Bari Vaughn, who works nearby. "The  maneuvering, the noise, the dust. Every time I came around the corner, I had to  calculate where I was going so I wouldn't bounce into someone."  </P> <P> On Monday morning, Vaughn managed to make it to the Roosevelt Pharmacy without  worrying about whether her heels might break. This was no small concern.  Vaughn, who had been used to going to 7th Street as many as four times a week  before the construction, had ventured there no more than once a month over the  last few years. Behind the counter, Ron and Neva Dashjian, the pharmacy's  owners, said that they are just beginning to see the return of old customers  such as Vaughn.  </P> <P> "We are slowly seeing faces we haven't seen in more than two years," said Ron  Dashjian, who has owned the pharmacy at the 7th Street site for 15 years.  </P> <P> The Dashjians estimated that their business dwindled by 20% to 25% over the  last three years. They said they complained often about the narrowed and  darkened walkways outside the pharmacy, but received little sympathy from  subway officials.  </P> <P> At one meeting, Dashjian recalled, a construction superintendent told him they  had no intentions of deviating from their contract despite the merchants'  complaints. "He just said there was nothing he could do," Dashjian said, "and  that was that."  </P> <P> Six months ago, the county Transportation Commission took over administration  of the project from the RTD and, according to some merchants, began to show  some leeway, widening the sidewalk slightly. By then, many merchants had  already had enough.  </P> <P> Laurent Quenioux, chef and owner of Seventh Street Bistro, became so angry that  last December he filed suit against the agencies involved in the Metro Rail  project, claiming that he was owed $800,000 for his business losses.  </P> <P> "I can't even imagine how much I've lost since then," Quenioux lamented as he  prepared the menu for his lunch-hour crowd. Like other merchants, Quenioux said  it may be a year before he sees all of his old customers return.  </P> <P> Along 7th Street, some merchants joined transportation officials in their  determination to hold a party despite a gray horizon and a steady drizzle. As  merchants distributed free marking pens, candy and plates of penne with  mushrooms to reacquaint customers with their wares, Neil Peterson, executive  director of the Transportation Commission, declared that 7th Street "has been  revitalized in time for the Christmas holiday."  </P> <P> Nearby, commission spokeswoman Robin McCarthy acknowledged that transportation  officials have learned much from their mistakes.  </P> <P> In future Metro Rail construction projects on Wilshire Boulevard, Vermont  Avenue and in Hollywood, McCarthy said, sidewalks will be wider, warning signs  will be more plentiful, delivery trucks will have better access and merchants  will have better lines of communication to subway officials.  </P> <P> Sieg Lindstrom of the Fowlers bookstore is not so sure. When subway officials  visited recently to strongly urge him to give discounts for the Monday  celebration, Lindstrom bridled at the notion. "Here they were, imposing again,"  he said.  </P> <P> A customer, overhearing Lindstrom's complaint, liked the discount idea. "Do I  get one?" he asked.  </P> <P> "Sure," said Lindstrom. "Tell you what I'll do. I'll double the price on any  book you want and then sell it to you half price. Well?"  </P></p>

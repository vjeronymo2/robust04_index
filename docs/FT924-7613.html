			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UN general tries to win halt to fighting west of Travnik THE UN'S military commander in Bosnia, Gen Philippe Morillon, was yesterday trying to obtain a halt to fighting west of the city of Travnik, writes David White in Split. However, UK officers said a controversial proposal by Gen Morillon to use British troops to rescue wounded refugees fleeing from Serb attacks now appeared unnecessary. Using British forces in this way would have meant a widening of the UN's military role in Bosnia. The proposal came after hundreds of Moslem refugees from the Karaula area near Turbe, west of Travnik, passed through Travnik on Saturday night on foot or in horse-drawn vehicles with household belongings, sheep and cattle. A number were believed to have been wounded as their route between Karaula and Turbe was attacked. The Moslem commander asked the British for help on Saturday but yesterday withdrew his request. Twelve hundred evacuees left Sarajevo yesterday in two convoys of women and children, the old, the sick and the wounded, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Seven hundred Serbs left on board 10 buses on the short but perilous journey along 'Sniper Alley' to the airport and across the runway to Lukavica, and then north to Belgrade - the Serbian heartland. Later, 500 Croats and Moslems crowded on to five buses for their journey west through the lines of the Serb besiegers to Kiseljak, 30km away.</p>

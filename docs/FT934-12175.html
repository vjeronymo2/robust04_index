			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Anti-EC group forms in Norway A faction of Norway's ruling Labour party yesterday announced it had formed an organisation to keep Norway out of the European Community, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. The new organisation, called Social Democrats against the EC, said it would seek to strengthen the domestic anti-EC movement so that a referendum on membership, to be held by 1996, would reject the move. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, refused to comment on the announcement, as did Mr Torbjoern Jagland, the leader of the Labour party.</p>

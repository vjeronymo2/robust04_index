			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: New Philadelphia market The Philadelphia Stock Exchange yesterday announced it is forming a new market that will allow investors to customise currency options contracts to their particular needs. The PHILX, the world's busiest exchange-based market for currency options, is hoping that its new forum - called the United Currency Options Market - will bridge the gap between listed currency options markets and the much larger over-the-counter options market. The bulk of the currency options business is conducted away from exchanges where banks and securities firms design contracts to customers' specifications. The UCOM is the PHILX's attempt to win some of that business from the over-the-counter market. The PHILX described the UCOM as a 'flexible trading environment' that will allow users to employ tailor-made trading and hedging tools in a regulated environment.</p>

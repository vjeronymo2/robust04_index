			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EURYTHMEUM STUTTGART: VOCABULARY OF DANCE  </P> <P> Imagine a stage awash with performers shrouded in yards of colorful, diaphanous  fabric. They move in stately, fluid patterns under ever-changing colored lights  to live music or to the rise and fall of the spoken voice. The spectacle  combines something of the sensuousness of a '60s light show with the  spiritualistic aura of early 20th-Century modern dance.  </P> <P> This is eurythmy, a form of movement envisioned by its creator, Rudolph  Steiner, as "a continuation of divine movement" in which speech and music are  "made visible."  </P> <P> Last seen in Los Angeles in 1981, Eurythmeum Stuttgart -- the West German  company Steiner founded in 1924 -- is at the Wadsworth Theatre tonight on the  first stop of a three-city U.S. tour.  </P> <P> Else Klink, 82, is the troupe's artistic director and choreographer. Born in  New Guinea to a Polynesian mother, Klink was 7 when her German father deposited  her in the Waldorf School that Steiner founded in Stuttgart (the first of what  was to become a worldwide network of private schools dedicated to his  teachings).  </P> <P> A couple of years earlier, the Austrian-born philosopher had developed eurythmy  -- with actress Marie von Sivers -- and founded the Anthroposophical Society, a  group dedicated to the belief that the human intellect can make contact with  the spiritual world.  </P> <P> "Children loved Steiner," Klink said last week from a small town in southern  Australia where the company was on tour. "If he (observed) classes, we felt  free, with no pressure. He was not like a guru!"  </P> <P> Although a foot injury a few years later put an end to her hopes of becoming a  ballet dancer, Klink was an eager student of eurythmy, part of the Waldorf  School curriculum. She eventually joined the stage troupe at the Goetheanum in  Dornach, Switzerland, the "school of spiritual science" Steiner founded in  1913, and became co-director of Eurythmeum Stuttgart in 1935.  </P> <P> Among the works that the 16-member touring section of the troupe will interpret  locally are an excerpt from Klink's "Peer Gynt" (based on Henrik Ibsen's  verse-drama, with incidental music by Edvard Grieg), Shostakovich's Cello  Sonata in D minor, one of Brahms' Hungarian dances and such musical desserts as  Debussy's "Golliwog's Cakewalk."  </P> <P> Klink explained that eurythmy comes from Greek words meaning beauty and  harmony. Further clarifications tended to bog down in jargon and linguistic  confusion. Hampered by speaking in English, a language not her own, Klink  tossed out phrases like "the soul spreads out in movement" and "dance becomes  an impulse from soul-wisdom" -- and balked at decoding them.  </P> <P> Eurythmists dance as the spirit moves them -- the spirit as interpreted by  Steiner's dogma, that is. Believing that every sound in speech is actually an  invisible gesture, Steiner proposed that aspects of sound -- including pitch,  rhythm and dynamics -- could be interpreted by specific movements or areas of  the body. The sound "oh," for example, requires the arms to embrace space; the  collarbone is the unlikely spot at which a performer supposedly experiences a  tonic chord.  </P> <P> At times, however, performers break away from interpreting the separate sounds  of the text or music to reveal what eurythmists call its "mood of the soul" --  such states of mind as grief, merriment or reverence.  </P> <P> "If you speak and move," Klink said in her slow, measured voice, "in these  movements (are embodied) thought, feeling and will." Depending on its emphasis  and rhythm, a gesture moving outward from the body may convey sympathetic  feelings or willfulness; inward-turning gestures may reflect the state of  thought or the feeling of distaste.  </P> <P> Performers walk or run on half-toe, using their arms and hands to interpret the  specific sound qualities. The gossamer, airborne cloaks the eurythmists wear  help focus the audience's attention on flowing gestures rather than the  specific body that creates them.  </P> <P> In addition to the vocabulary of gesture, eurythmy also involves constantly  changing lighting patterns that portray, Klink says, "the color of the mood of  soul," as reflected in the particular passage of text or music. A red light  denotes anger; sadness is conveyed with green and blue.  </P> <P> Absorbing the complex rules of eurythmy involves a four-year basic training,  with three to five years more study for those who want to pursue stage careers.  (Others choose to teach or to become movement therapists for the mentally ill.)  But the payoff is that a performer can continue almost indefinitely.  </P> <P> "It's not an art form which stretches the body to its utmost extent," said  Klink -- who still performs short pieces on occasion. "It mobilizes very  different forces in you."  </P></p>

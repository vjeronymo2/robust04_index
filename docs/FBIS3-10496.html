Last week, during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the  rest of the ministries and the Central Bank, government  representatives assessed the commitments Brazil will assume and  the strictness with which it will have to implement the terms of  the aforementioned document.    The Uruguay Round agreement will not only require the  amendment of laws but also a change of attitude by the  government bureaucracy such as the following:    The subsidy and compensatory payment code must be improved,  especially because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural  trade must be efficient, agile, and cautious to avoid mistakes  such as the one that caused Brazil to lose a case within the  GATT to the European Union (EU) regarding the application of the  compensatory rights to powdered milk importers.    Marques Porto [chief of the International Trade Policy  Department of the Foreign Ministry] said that the codes must be  in keeping with the GATT procedures.    The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry will have to be  alert not to increase obstacles to foreign companies in the area  of financial services because the country will assume the  commitment to freeze at the current level the restrictions for  access to the market. That requirement will also be demanded  from officials of the Transportation Ministry.    The improved regulations of the Brazilian customhouse must  be  ready before the enforcement of the commercial agreement of the  Uruguay Round which is scheduled for mid 1995 goes into effect.    Brazil needs to have "a corps of specialists" in the GATT  and  in the European Union as well as an independent internal  organization to deal with issues such as the compensatory rights  and "anti-dumping" measures.    Until 12 April Brazil will no longer make any concessions to  its Uruguay Round partners unless it receives some benefit.    It is said that the hope is that there will be no reduction  in the U.S. quota for additional imports of orange juice and  shoes.    The multilateral agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round  which Brazil will sign in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 12 April will  require the government to make a great effort to adapt them to  the country's domestic laws. Last week, the Foreign Ministry  called the attention of other ministries and the Central Bank to  the need to improve mainly the codes on compensatory rights and  subsidies because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural  trade must be agile and careful at the same time.    Joao Gualberto Marques Porto, chief of the International  Trade Policy Department of the Foreign MInistry, explained: With  the approval of the "peace clause" included in the agreement on  agriculture which restricts the complaints by the partners of  the European Union -- which are committed to the elimination of  their agricultural subsidies in nine years which is how long the  clause will be in effect -- Brazil will be able to begin an  investigation against the Europeans but it will have to "put it  on hold" and, if possible, before charging them before the GATT,  negotiate with them.    For example, if Brazil feels threatened by subsidized  exports, it would be advisable first to get the Europeans to  increase the prices of their products instead of immediately  suing them for compensatory rights or anti-"dumping," said  Marques.    The Brazilian failure in the powdered milk case was a lesson  when Brazil lost in a "panel" (special committee of experts of  the GATT) late last year a case on the request of the European  Union which demanded the payment of compensatory rights on its  export products. Marques Porto said Brazil will still appeal  GATT's ruling because it continues to believe that the European  Union subsidizes its sale of powdered milk, but it also  recognizes that the terms were not respected and that this gave  room to the European accusation that GATT procedures were not  complied with.    Marques Porto said: "We have to reestablish a capable  bureaucracy for a quick and effective defense that cannot be  questioned: we must have the ability to detect the "dumping" or  subsidy and establish the degree of damage with the application  of adequate taxes. But it is essential that this be done in  accordance with the procedures advocated by the GATT."    Another key issue was raised at the meeting between  Brazilian Foreign Ministry representatives and those from other  federal administration agencies: Brazil's commitment to freeze  at current levels its restrictions on foreign participation in  the supply of services. Brazil had offered to maintain the  "status quo" in this particular field which means that the  Central Bank and especially the Finance Ministry must take great  care not to increase red tape to make sure the country does not  get punished. Marques Porto said: "Brazil cannot restrict  access to its market any further."    It has been decided to follow Japan's suggestion on  financial  services and new negotiations will take place six months after  the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round go into effect --  somewhere in mid 1995 -- "taking into account the new  conditions," to see whether the the GATT principle of most  favored nation applies to this issue. This principle recommends  that benefits granted to one country should be granted to all  other member countries as well.    Marques Porto explained: "The Central Bank and the Finance  Ministry will have to keep their eyes on the international  situations to find out to what extent Brazil can improve its  access to foreign markets and establish whether it is worthwhile  to make a better offer." Marques Porto believes that the  Uruguay Round will have a "significant impact" on the Brazilian  economy.    At the meeting with representatives from other ministries  that took place at the Foreign Ministry, Marques Porto also  mentioned that Brazil needs to have a "group of experts" with a  good grasp of the GATT and the EU, a group capable of dealing  with issues such as compensatory rights. This would have to be  an independent group, free from political pressures, and able to  help Brazilian exporters who may be accused of unfair practices  and to determine the extent of domestic harm inflicted. Marques  Porto added that customs services will have to adjust to GATT's  new standards.</p>

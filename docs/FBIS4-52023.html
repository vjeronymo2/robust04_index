			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 2 May, Japan and the United States agreed to  form a working group composed of officials from both nations to  settle problems related to the U.S. military bases in Japan in  the near future. Among the problems is the return of the  Yomitan auxiliary airfield on Okinawa as a result of scaling  down the size of U.S. Forces in Japan. This was disclosed by  several government sources.    The accord was reached because the United States has  indicated its positive position on resolving problems. It was  also disclosed that the United States has indicated its  intention to return the 190-acre Yomitan auxiliary airfield in  particular. If the working group should make any progress in  its consultations, it is most likely that some of the U.S. bases  will be returned in the near future. This is a hope that the  residents of Okinawa Prefecture have cherished for a long time.    The pending issues related to U.S. military bases on Okinawa  are: 1) return of the Naha naval port; 2) return of the Yomitan  auxiliary airfield; 3) suspension of live-firing exercises  across Prefectural Highway Route 104.    Taking into account the fact that the Okinawa residents have  strong hope for settling the above-mentioned three problems, the  Japanese Government has repeatedly requested the United States  to resolve them on various occasions, such as the Japan-U.S.  defense chiefs talks.    The United States has indicated its understanding in  principle. However, for various reasons, no accord has been  reached. For example, the United States is concerned that the  accord may affect its military training.    However, officials concerned from the diplomatic and defense  authorities of both Japan and the United States met recently to  talk about measures for settling these problems. As a result,  they unanimously reached the decision that the Yomitan auxiliary  airfield may be returned to Japan. And they agreed in principle  to form a working group to work out concrete measures to settle  these issues in the future.    The formation of this working group is scheduled to be  announced as an official agreement as early as by the end of  May. The group is expected to be composed of Japanese officials  from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Facilities  Administration Agency and also American officials from the U.S.  Embassy in Japan and the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan.    With the purpose of eventually returning the Yomitan  auxiliary airfield, the working group will study specific issues  that the United States has requested. For example, the U.S.  communication facilities should be maintained, and another site  for parachuting exercises should be secured to replace the  original airfield.    Moreover, it was decided that the group will also study  measures to have the Naha naval port returned and live-firing  exercises across Prefectural Highway Route 104 suspended. Thus,  following the return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield, there is  a possibility that the other two pending issues may be settled  in the future.</p>

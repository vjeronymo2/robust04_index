			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HAIR-RAISING FINISH FALLS SHORT FOR CLU IN 7TH LOSS IN A ROW  </P> <P> With Steve deLaveaga sporting a new crew cut Tuesday night, it would have been  fitting had the Cal Lutheran men's basketball team adopted a new look as well.  </P> <P> But unfortunately for the Kingsmen, deLaveaga's haircut was all that was new or  different about Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen squandered an early lead, then staged a late rally before falling,  83-79, to Fresno Pacific in a Golden State Athletic Conference game at Cal  Lutheran. It was the Kingsmen's seventh consecutive setback since Dec. 17.  </P> <P> With the loss, Cal Lutheran dropped to 6-11, 0-3 in GSAC play and dropped even  further out of contention for the conference title.  </P> <P> "I'm elated," Fresno Pacific Coach John Moore said. "I kept saying to myself,  'When are we going to be done with these guys.' DeLaveaga is such a great  player he just scared the pants off me whenever he got the ball."  </P> <P> The Kingsmen's rally in the last 5 minutes had both Moore and the Sunbirds  worried. After trailing by 10 points midway in the second half, Cal Lutheran  closed to within a point in the final 3 minutes. Fresno Pacific padded its lead  to 5 points before Cal Lutheran again rallied.  </P> <P> After DeLaveaga's 3-point shot from behind the free-throw line cut the deficit  to 81-79 with 14 seconds left, the Kingsmen were forced to foul and Donnie  Johnson, who scored a team-high 21 points, made 2 free throws to give Fresno  Pacific its winning margin.  </P> <P> "We pushed it to the end, but we could not execute on a couple of our big shots  when we needed to," said deLaveaga, who led all scorers with 31 points. "We dug  such a deep hole for ourselves that we could not get out of it."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran jumped ahead at the outset and held a 7-point lead midway in the  first half. The Sunbirds moved in front, 33-32, with 3:19 left in the first  half and never trailed again.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran was behind by only 4 points at halftime, 38-34, but could not  overcome that deficit as both teams scored 45 points in the second period.  </P> <P> Three Kingsmen scored in double figures, including Mike Demeter with 18 points  and Charles Jackson with 10. John Liddell had 19 points for Fresno Pacific  (12-4, 3-0) and Troy Brown added 14.  </P> <P> Fresno Pacific remains undefeated in conference play along with Westmont  College and Southern California College.  </P></p>

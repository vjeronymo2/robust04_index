			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUIPMENT FAILURE SHOWS RISE IN AIRLINE CRASHES  </P> <P> Air accident figures for the first six months of 1989 show a rising incidence  of mechanical failure that caused nine of the 26 accidents this year in which  606 people died, Flight International magazine reported Thursday.  </P> <P> Reviewing half-year figures relative to the decade as a whole, the magazine  said that 1989 has been a poor year for airline safety. The figures appearing  in the magazine's latest issue do not take into account the United Airlines  DC-10 crash Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa.  </P> <P> Flight International said 1985 held the decade's worst half-year with 913  deaths and 21 accidents.  </P> <P> The number of deaths in 1989 compare with a decade half-year average of 439 and  the accident count of 26 against a decade half-year figure of 17. This takes  into account a 40% rise in the number of passenger journeys since the early  1980s.  </P> <P> "If the 1989 first half-year figures are factored to accord with 1980 flying  rates, the fatalities would have totalled 433 and the number of accidents would  have been 19," the magazine said.  </P> <P> Of the fatal accidents in 1989, 9 involved mechanical failure, 6 involved bad  weather and pilot error was a factor in the remaining 14.  </P> <P> "The mechanical failure figure is higher than usual," the magazine said. The  threat of terrorism to airlines subsided in 1989, but whether this was a result  of better security at airports or because terrorists had left aviation alone  was unclear, it added.  </P> <P> Britain tightened security at all major airports after the December bombing of  a Pan Am Boeing 747 in Scotland, in which 270 people died.  </P></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Labour says it is being sold short Financial services - John Authers investigates claims, counter claims and allegations of scare tactics Labour's 'tax bombshell' has been a boon for the marketing brains teams of the financial services industry. The Conservative onslaught on Labour's proposals has done a lot of the work for them. 'Act now to beat the tax man,' urges Abbey Life, the life assurance group in a circular to customers. It goes on to warn: 'It is no secret that a future Labour government would abolish a number of the tax planning opportunities that currently exist'. Hardly surprisingly, such tactics have not pleased the Labour party. Earlier this week, Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's city spokesperson, complained to Lautro, the industry's regulator, claiming that Abbey was trying to 'panic customers into making important financial decisions on the basis of unfounded speculation about what a future Labour government would do'. Abbey Life hotly denies that the letter was a scare tactic. Every February it sends out letters about tax-planning to alert clients about the Budget and the end of the tax year - traditionally the 'harvest season' for the financial services industry. Abbey says the letter was not politically biased and adds that many other companies had used similar tactics. Mowlam may not be convinced by the first bit, but she will probably accept that Abbey is not the only offender. Most of the industry has been using the spectre of a Labour government to chivvy investors into various politically sensitive investments. One advertisement from Murray Johnstone Investment Trusts says 'Elect for a PEP . . . While you've still got a vote]' It goes on to say: 'Another general election is coming - and one of the parties has already announced that it may abolish all future PEPs as soon as they take over the reins of office'. Another advertisement, from the brokers Hargreaves Lansdown, carries the words 'What if . . . a major upset to your investments?', next to a photograph of Neil and Glenys Kinnock outside No 10, Downing Street. There are no specific rules on political bias in financial advertising. The Securities and Investments Board says that all advertisements should be adequate and fair and inform customers of the risks involved. The finer details are delegated to self-regulatory organisations, such as Lautro. Many investment managers and advisers have published guides to pre-election tax-planning. General enquiries are up from last year, but sales have not yet increased significantly. Over the next two months, marketeers will try to convert vague political neuroses into hard sales. This affects not only advertising and promotional material, but also product design. One of the most sweeping tax reliefs now available is the tax-efficient Personal Equity Plan. Thanks to an obscure tax loophole, investors can benefit most from investment trust shares (popular with small savers) - if they move the shares to a PEP within 42 days of the launch of the trust. With the election due soon after the end of the tax year, fund managers scent rich pickings. Several fund managers are now floating investment trusts, timed so that investors can put the shares into a PEP both this tax year and next. The timing is deliberate. The most striking launch comes from M&amp;G, the UK's largest unit trust manager, which is spending Pounds 3m on promoting its new Recovery Investment Trust. It expects to raise Pounds 300m, but is prepared to accept 'considerably more'. M&amp;G's launch has all the trappings of privatisation campaigns - mailshots have been sent to 4m homes and around Pounds 500,000 is being spent on television advertising. The launch closes on March 27, the latest possible date to allow investors to put money into PEPs for both this tax year and next. This timing has brought complaints from some brokers that the launch is marketing-led and does not make investment sense. M&amp;G denies this and points to the strong long-term performance of its Recovery unit trust. According to Bryan Jennings of M&amp;G: 'Our view is that this is the right thing to do in investment terms. But the 2-year PEP element is marketing-led. That is an opportunity given us by the political situation.'</p>

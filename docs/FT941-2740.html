			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Arafat likely to meet Peres soon Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres are expected to meet on Sunday in Cairo if, as seems likely, the United Nations Security Council today passes a motion condemning the Hebron massacre. The decision to hold the meeting came on the same day that Mr Peres joined the growing chorus of Israeli ministers calling for the evacuation of all Jewish settlers from Hebron. Mr Peres' change of heart followed new evidence that Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein may have been aided by a second settler in carrying out last month's killings in a Hebron mosque. With the PLO demanding protection from radical settlers as a precondition for returning to formal Middle East peace talks, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin also indicated for the first time that he might be coming round to the idea of removing the Hebron settlers. Well over half the ministers in Mr Rabin's cabinet have publicly backed the evacuation of the settlers from their three small enclaves in the centre of the city - a move that would go some way towards meeting PLO demands for protection and seems to have made it possible for Mr Arafat to agree to meet Mr Peres this weekend. Three weeks after the massacre of at least 30 Palestinians inside Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, and with the Middle East peace process disintegrating, Mr Peres yesterday threw his weight behind the call, declaring the Hebron settlers were a grave security problem. While outnumbered at the cabinet table, Mr Rabin has consistently refused to consider removing the Hebron settlers. But interviewed in Rome yesterday, after the first ever meeting between an Israeli prime minister and the Pope, Mr Rabin launched a fierce attack on settlers and recalled that, during his first term as Israeli premier in the 1970s, he had prevented Jews moving into Hebron, 'because I knew what the result would be'. In Jerusalem the Israeli judicial commission investigating the massacre heard testimony from soldiers who were on duty at the Cave of the Patriarchs on the morning of the killings that Goldstein, an American-immigrant settler, had not carried out the massacre alone. Flatly contradicting the army's previous version of events, three soldiers testified that Goldstein entered the mosque carrying an M-16 rifle and that, five minutes later, a second settler entered, carrying a Galil rifle. Army ballistics experts have reported that all 110 bullets fired inside the mosque came from one Galil rifle. The new testimony throws open the question of whether Goldstein, who was beaten to death by worshippers was even the main perpetrator of the massacre. Some witnesses earlier spoke of at least two men firing, others of a settler throwing Goldstein fresh magazines. One soldier, Sgt Kobi Yosef, admitted yesterday he fired two shots inside the tomb, but insisted they were fired into the air. 'I thought at first an Arab was shooting,' he said. He also admitted closing the nearest exit from the mosque.</p>

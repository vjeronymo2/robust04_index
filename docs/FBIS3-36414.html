The  same fate befell the proposal of Deputy Vadim Kolesnichenko, who  proposed that Yuriy Meshkov be granted the appropriate powers to  carry out his election promises (entry into the ruble zone, dual  citizenship, payment of pensions in karbovantsi, and so on).    A debate only developed during the examination of the  resignation statement of Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean  Supreme Council. His resignation was not accepted. It was  decided to examine this issue only after Nikolay Bagrov returns  from his vacation, which he took when he lost the struggle with  Yuriy Meshkov for the presidential seat.</p>

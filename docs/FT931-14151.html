			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: Aids enters the office - Barbara Harrison explains how US companies are learning to deal with HIV-positive employees Frank Deloisio, a sales representative at Digital Equipment Corporation, the second largest US computer maker, knew for nine years that he was HIV positive before he revealed his condition to colleagues at work. 'I was too scared,' he says now, to disclose that he was infected with the virus that causes Aids. 'I read about cases of people who would lose their jobs and (health) insurance. They would basically be left out in the cold. I didn't want that to happen to me.' Luckily for Deloisio, Digital's management was one of the corporate pioneers in instituting an enlightened education and advisory programme on HIV and Aids. Begun in 1987, the programme includes seminars that explain the disease. Employees are told, for example, that they will not be infected by using the same tools, telephones, computer terminals or toilets. By 1991, Deloisio felt confident that the myths and fears about HIV and Aids had abated sufficiently among his colleagues to disclose his condition. His departmental managers responded by restructuring his job to take account of his need for medical treatment. Paul Ross, Digital's manager of its HIV/Aids programme, believes that alleviating the fears of infected and uninfected alike is crucial to avoid workplace problems. 'We made a conscious effort to manage our response to the epidemic instead of having it manage us.' Company officials concede, however, that some fears or intolerance are not diminished by education. But Digital's approach is as farsighted and praiseworthy as it is uncommon. Over the past decade, most businesses have ignored the epidemic. Or they have sought to rid themselves of employees they knew or suspected were infected - a practice made illegal in the US last year under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But about 1m Americans are infected with Aids, which is the second biggest cause of death for men aged 25-44 and the sixth leading cause for women aged 25-44. And that age group comprises more than 50 per cent of the US workforce. More than two-thirds of companies with between 2,500 and 5,000 employees and nearly one in 12 companies with fewer than 500 employees have had an employee with HIV or Aids. In response, the US Centres for Disease Control launched a 'Business Responds to Aids' programme last month. The programme, backed by companies such as Levi Strauss, Polaroid, Federated-Allied, Coca Cola, and MGM/UA Communications, urges firms to join an education and prevention effort. The CDC has prepared a manager's kit and a labour leader's kit to provide step-by-step guidance on how to develop an HIV/Aids policy and an education programme. The kits contain advice on health insurance issues as well as counselling and educational resources. It also features a section on the 'do's and 'don't's under the ADA. For example: Companies cannot refuse to hire an applicant with HIV or Aids because their insurance costs may rise. Job applicants cannot be required to take an HIV test. Companies cannot dismiss employees with HIV or Aids if they are able to perform the 'essential functions' of a job given 'reasonable accommodation' of their disability. The CDC's effort to help businesses educate their workforces, and in so doing help prevent the spread of the disease, may be laudable, but it is expected to be an uphill battle. Lee Smith, former president of Levi Strauss's international operations and now chairman of the Washington-based National Leadership Coalition on Aids, an educational organisation focusing on business, recommends that, given staff turnover and transfers, Aids awareness programmes run continuously and be updated with new information. But he warns that Aids education 'is not an easy sell. There are terrible barriers around this disease,' says Smith, who noted that one in 25 people in Levi Strauss's San Francisco workforce was HIV positive. He said managers, the majority of whom are heterosexual men and some of whom are homophobic, deny it's a problem and believe it won't affect them. Smith says he first attempts to persuade managers to institute an Aids education and prevention programme on moral grounds. If that fails, he argues the case on the basis of costs, comparing the small amount required for a programme with the high cost of treatment. For US companies, which face soaring health care costs, such arguments are compelling. Insurance premiums increase if an employee becomes infected with HIV, as is the case with any serious long-term illness. At Digital, which is self-insured, Ross believes that the Aids programme has helped contain health care costs through early treatment and through helping to stem the spread of the disease. With average costs for treatment from diagnosis to death running at about Dollars 100,000, 'if we've saved 10 from becoming ill, we've saved a Dollars 1m,' he said.</p>

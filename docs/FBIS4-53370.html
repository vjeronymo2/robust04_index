			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by So Song-u, researcher at The Institute for </F> Peaceful Unification]    [Text]  1. Mythicizing Birthplace    Kim Chong-il has consolidated his position so much that,  despite the fact that Kim Il-song is still alive, the present  period in North Korea may be called "the Kim Chong-il era."    Lately Kim Il-song himself has ordered all North Koreans to  be loyal to the Kim Chong-il leadership and in response people  have been continually holding various events throughout North  Korea to renew their pledges to faithfully uphold the Kim  Chong-il leadership.    Along with these events, a propaganda campaign has been in  progress among the North Korean population to idolize Kim  Chong-il, highlighting his leadership capability and his  greatness.    This campaign for a cult of personality is being waged on  the same level as that for Kim Il-song. It was not until Kim  Chong-il was named to such key posts as Political Bureau  Standing Committee member and member of the Military Affairs  Committee at the Sixth WPK Congress in October 1980, thereby  securing his mantle as future successor, that the idolatry  campaign moved into high gear.    Below I will examine the substance of each pattern in the  propaganda campaign being waged among the North Korean populace  to idolize Kim Chong-il in terms of his "leadership quality and  greatness" by looking into specific examples.    The idolization of Kim Chong-il began with the falsification  of his birthplace.    Kim Chong-il was born on 15 February 1942 [date as  published] in a small village called (Vatskoy) near the Amur  River basin in the Siberian tundra region. But, in the early  part of the 1980's, a myth was concocted claiming that Kim  Chong-il was "born in a secret camp on Mt. Paektu" and endowed  with the spirit of that mountain.    The claim that he was born on Mt. Paektu, despite his actual  birth in the Soviet Union, is of great significance.    Mt. Paektu is known as our nation's holy mountain, as the  origin point of our race. It symbolizes the spirit of our  nation, cherished by all our people. That is why Kim Il-song  refers to Mt. Paektu each time he talks about his revolutionary  activities against Japan. He embellishes his achievements with  the words "the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu."    North Korea fabricated the story that Kim Chong-il was born  in a secret camp in the forests of Mt. Paektu that reverberated  with the gunshots of the armed struggle against the Japanese.  The purpose of this myth was to suggest that he was destined to  succeed Kim Il-song and thus produce the propaganda effect of  highlighting the legitimacy of his leadership and authority, as  well as his image as the leader of not just the North Koreans  but of all our nation.    To back up the false claim about Kim Chong-il's birthplace,  North Korea, beginning in the early 1970's, expanded or  remodeled the 30 or more of the revolution's historical  battlefields in the Paektu mountains and other places such as  Pochonbo, Musan, Samjiyon, and Taehungdan. At the same time,  North Korea created various relics to substantiate the myth  surrounding his birth--the story that in the middle of the  guerrilla war Kim Il-song was waging, Kim Chong-il was born in a  "log cabin" in one of the numerous secret camps in the Paektu  mountains, and bears the spirit of Mt. Paektu.    These symbolic relics, known as "the revolution's historical  sites of Paektu secret camps," include the sites of 10 or more  secret camps, including "the Changbaek Mountain secret camp,"  "the Kowon Mountain secret camp," "the Kabaek Mountain secret  camp," and "the Sajabong secret camp"; more than 40 log cabins;  the more than 200 "camp fire sites" that North Korea claims have  been recently uncovered; and thousands of trees bearing slogans.    Typical of these symbolic relics supposedly associated with  Kim Chong-il in particular are the Paektu Mountain secret camp,  in which North Korea claims he spent his childhood, and what  they call "Chongilbong" in the Paektu mountains. In this way  North Korea fabricated stories about Kim Chong-il's birth and  childhood in order to embellish them to the highest possible  degree. This fabrication and embellishment is part of the  campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il without regard to the facts.  <H5>  2. Process of Change in Titles </H5>   Since Kim Chong-il came of age, the focus of propaganda has  been on his leadership quality and greatness.    First of all, the flowery titles preceding his name have  changed. At the Sixth Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee  in December 1972, North Korea tentatively chose Kim Chong-il as  future successor to power. Subsequently, the Seventh Plenum of  the Fifth WPK Central Committee in September 1973 named Kim  Chong-il as party secretary in charge of organization and  propaganda and agitation and as candidate member of the party  Political Bureau. From then on North Korea called him "the Party  Center," and has used more than 30 titles to describe him for  these past 20 years.    To be more specific, from September 1973 North Korea used  the title "the Party Center" for Kim Chong-il until June 1975,  when it designated his birthday as an official holiday and began  to call him "the unitary leader." North Korea did not bring Kim  Chong-il's name to the forefront, however.    Beginning in 1980 Kim Chong-il's titles took on a feature  distinctively different from previous ones. From that year on  Kim Chong-il's stature rose in terms of his titles by one peg on  each succeeding birthday. In most cases, various flowery words  describing the perfect features a leader should have were placed  before the honorific "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il" to emphasize his  greatness.    The titles used in those days include: "the Helmsman," "the  Supreme Commander," "the Father of the People," and "the Great  Guide."    Beginning in the early 1990's, titles comparable to those  previously reserved for Kim Il-song appeared for Kim Chong-il,  suggesting that the latter is at the zenith of power in North  Korea. To give some examples of these titles: "the Leader of  the Revolution Responsible for the Fate of our People," "the  Great Leader," and "the Dear (and Respected) Father."    The idolatry campaign under way as part of a scheme to  enhance the image of Kim Chong-il's leadership quality and  authority includes propaganda about various instructions given  during his "on-the-spot guidance" tours as well as tributes to  his achievements through studies of his writings.    Beginning with his May 1981 visit to the Mt. Myohyang area  development project, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il  visited major project sites to give what they call "practical  guidance," during which he gave various instructions. Beginning  in the latter part of the 1980's, the words "on-the-spot  guidance," which had theretofore been reserved only for Kim  Il-song's inspection tours, began to be used for Kim Chong-il's  inspection tours also.    Until recently Kim Chong-il conducted more than 60  on-the-spot guidance tours. More than 60 percent of them were  concentrated on the light industry sector and public service  facilities associated with the people's daily lives. This, it  seems, is aimed at highlighting his image as the benevolent  "father of the people" who is concerned about improving the  living standard of the people.  <H5>  3. 1,600 Poems Written </H5>   To illuminate Kim Chong-il's image as "the leader with  ideology and theories," North Korea has released or published  writings attributed to him and stepped up a campaign to explain  these writings through various propaganda media and discussion  meetings. For instance, North Korea mobilizes cadres at party  cadre training centers and various other  organizations--publishing educational, scientific, literary, and  art works--throughout the country to organize national seminars  to praise the contents of his writings in each field or sends  out party cadres and propaganda and agitation functionaries to  various organizations and groups at all levels to explain and  publicize his writings in the form of question-and-answer study  sessions, explanation sessions, and discussion meetings. The  main focus of the idolatry campaign centering on his writings is  the theme that Kim Chong-il has inherited and developed Kim  Il-song's ideology and theories. This puts the spotlight on Kim  Chong-il's achievements in party building efforts and in the  cause of the revolution.    In addition, North Korea is publishing reams of books and  literary works paying tribute to Kim Chong-il's "greatness" and  his "brilliant achievements" and is popularizing songs praising  him in a big way. It is also encouraging ordinary citizens to  write poems paying tribute to Kim Chong-il. According to North  Korean propaganda, more than 1,600 poems were written for the  six-month period between April 1992, the month Kim Chong-il  became a marshal, and October 1992.    Recently, on the second anniversary of Kim Chong-il's  appointment as supreme commander of the Korean People's Army  [KPA], efforts were being made to write literary works designed  to publicize Kim Chong-il's military leadership capability.  North Korea is also concentrating its effort on idolizing Kim  Chong-il through its education system.    Courses on collected materials idolizing Kim Chong-il are  given in schools at various levels. A course named "chinhyokkwa"  (short form for the course on the history of the dear leader Kim  Chong-il's revolutionary activity) has been created in teachers  colleges to provide special education regarding him.    The following are school subjects at different levels of  education designed to idolize Kim Chong-il: At the primary and  secondary school levels, students in primary schools are  required to take 152 hours of lessons in a four-year period of  the course titled "the childhood of the dear master Kim  Chong-il". Students in higher middle schools in a six-year  period are required to take 112 hours of lessons in the course  titled "the revolutionary activities of the dear leader Kim  Chong-il" and 110 hours of lessons in the course named "the  history of the dear master Kim Chong-il."    The contents of textbooks include materials idolizing Kim  Chong-il in almost every subject, including the Korean language  and mathematics. Thirty four out of the 236 credits in Korean  language and Korean literature courses, and 26 of the 169 songs  in music textbooks, have something to do with the idolization of  Kim Chong-il.    In higher education, the History Department of Kim Il-song  University used to offer "the history of the revolution course,"  but the course is now divided into two parts, namely, "the Kim  Il-song course" and "the Kim Chong-il course," presumably as  part of the effort to highlight Kim Chong-il's greatness.    Beginning in 1987, the "Chinhyokkwa" course was created in  teachers colleges, including Kim Hyong-chik Teachers College.  Only 20 to 50 students from each school are allowed to enroll  for the "Chinhyokkwa" each year. The education department of  each county people's committee selects students for this course  from among discharged KPA soldiers who are sound in ideology and  have more than three years of social experience. In the  selection process, more weight is given to family background  than to ability. The first graduating classes of August 1991  became guidance workers in party or government organizations  dealing with organization and guidance or propaganda and  agitation or in provincial or county chapters of the Leagues of  Socialist Working Youth, whereas ordinary teachers college  graduates just became teachers. Graduates of the "Chinhyokkwa"  course concentrate their indoctrination efforts on government  employees and factory and other workers to idolize Kim Chong-il.  <H5>  4. 12 Revolution's Historical Sites </H5>   North Korea is waging a campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il not  only through teachers but also by means of various symbolic  media. The latter category includes: creation of the  revolution's historical sites; fabrication of slogan-bearing  trees; publication of collected legends and Kim Chong-il  anecdotes; and carved words from Quotations from Kim  Chong-il and inscription of his name on the rocks on Mt.  Kumgang and other famous mountains.    As part of the Kim Chong-il cult, North Korea has fabricated  the revolution's historical sites. Beginning with the  fabrication in 1982 of "our historical site of the revolution,"  where Kim Chong-il is said to have grown up, North Korea built  12 historical sites. They are mostly associated with Kim  Chong-il's birthplace and the places where Kim Chong-il took  refuge during the Korean War, where he camped when he was a  student at Kim Il-song University, or where he gave guidance in  the countryside.    Each year 100,000 to 200,000 people are mobilized to visit  these historical sites. Visitors plant commemorative trees as a  token of their loyalty to Kim Chong-il and hold meetings to  publish songs of loyalty and recite poems.    As for slogan-bearing trees (During the anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle, partisan fighters stripped trees to  write slogans on their bark), North Korean propaganda claims  that it began to uncover these trees in a big way beginning in  May 1987. Recently, slogan-bearing trees have been used actively  in Kim Chong-il's image making. North Korea claims that more  than 200 such trees have been uncovered that are associated with  his "birth."    The publication of collected legends is aimed at fabricating  legends and anecdotes on a par with those associated with Kim  Il-song as part of the effort to offset Kim Chong-il's total  lack of "revolutionary experience" similar to the guerrilla  warfare waged by Kim Il-song.  <H5>  5. History Research Center as Fabricator </H5>   The History Research Institute under the Academy of Social  Sciences, the veritable delivery room for campaign materials  used in the idolization of Kim Chong-il, is the place where his  anecdotes are fabricated. This institute fabricates legends and  anecdotes about Kim Chong-il's birth and upbringing. These  legends and anecdotes circulate first by word of mouth by  functionaries responsible for such publicity, and after a  certain interval a full-fledged propaganda campaign is launched  through propaganda media. Recently, books on these legends and  anecdotes have been compiled.    The stories titled Selected Legends of the Paektu  Bright Star are full of such absurd stories as: Kim  Chong-il "captured the four Taedong River dragons, which used to  cause damage to Pyongyang residents, and built the West Sea  Mirim Floodgate with them"; "South Korean flood victims cooked  two potfuls of steamed rice with a handful of rice out of the  relief rice package sent from the North in 1984"; and "a  resident in a village of cardboard homes in the suburbs of Seoul  planted the rice he had received as a relief item, and one of  the rice plants grew into a huge rice-bearing tree, from which  he harvested 10 bags of rice."    "The Kim Chong-il flower" besides Mt. Chongilbong is  considered a major symbol in idolizing Kim Chong-il. It was  introduced for the first time on the occasion of his 46th  birthday in February 1988.    The owner of a Japanese flower garden is said to have  succeeded in developing this flower after a long period of  experimentation, and presented it as a gift. It is even called  the flower of immortality.    While publicizing this flower on a grand scale, North Korea  encouraged its cultivation and proliferation. In this process  North Korea created the Song of the Kim Chong-il Flower and is  now engaged in an all-out campaign to popularize the song among  its people everywhere, not only in factories and enterprises but  even in buses and trains. Singing sessions are being held to  explain the words of the song, to memorize them, and to sing it  in chorus.    As "a symbol of the firm determination of our people to  admire and follow our leader, who has accumulated immortal  achievements for our times and for the cause of revolution,"  North Korea has carved words from Quotations from Kim  Chong-il and his name on the liffs and rocks of Mt. Paektu,  Mt. Kumgang, and other famous mountains as part of the idolatry  campaign. It is sending large groups of workers, students, and  residents to the places where these carvings were done to  organize explanation sessions, meetings on the sands [morae  moim], and loyalty meetings to pledge full loyalty to Kim  Chong-il.    To cite some examples of such carvings: the words  "Chongilbong" on Mt. Paektu; on Mt Kumgang, the words "Kim  Chong-il, the honor of Korea, the pride of the nation," "Kim  Chong-il, chuche-based lodestar," and "Dedicate Mt. Kumgang, the  scenic masterpiece, to Kim Chong-il," etc.    The propaganda campaign on Kim Chong-il's great successes  and achievements is not limited to North Korea, but expands into  overseas.    The main propaganda formats used in the overseas propaganda  campaign on Kim Chong-il since the Sixth WPK Congress in  October 1980 are: propaganda through foreign press media;  overseas publication and dissemination of writings of Kim  Chong-il; naming of foreign roads and buildings after Kim  Chong-il; and having pro-North Korean writers publish articles  in praise of Kim Chong-il. In addition, various events are  organized overseas through pro-North Korean groups to praise Kim  Chong-il. The press plays the key role in overseas propaganda  campaigns to idolize Kim Chong-il. The following describes the  depth of such overseas propaganda campaigns as publicized by  North Korea:    On 5 December 1989 the North Korean Central Broadcasting  Station said that newspapers, magazines, and other publications  in 85 countries had printed articles featuring the greatness of  Kim Chong-il over a five-year period. And NODONG SINMUN on 9  March 1992 claimed that more than 420 publications in 80 or more  countries introduced Kim Chong-il's achievements in honor of his  50th birthday.    As the main themes of propaganda conducted through  newspapers, broadcasts, and other media, "What kind of person is  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people?" and  "His Excellency Kim Chong-il, the source of inspiration for the  Korean people" may be mentioned.  <H5>  6. Over 400 Pieces of Propaganda Literature </H5>   North Korea is pushing the overseas publication and  dissemination of Kim Chong-il's writings on a grand scale. It  claims that on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's 50th birthday in  February 1992, more than 400 of Kim Chong-il's writings were  compiled in book form and tens of millions of them have been  published overseas. They include: On Some Questions  Arising in Indoctrination in the Chuche Ideology (July  1987) and Let Us March Forward Vigorously on the Road of  Socialism and Communism Holding High the Banner of the  Anti-Imperialist Struggle! (September 1987), in addition  to Selected Works of Kim Chong-il, Vol. I.    Pro-North Korean organizations, such as "study groups for  research into Comrade Kim Il-song's chuche ideology" and  "chuche Ideology research centers" are mobilized to hold forums  and seminars on Kim Chong-il's genealogy and other subjects.    Some of the roads and buildings in African and Latin  American countries have been named after Kim Chong-il. Most of  these roads and buildings were constructed with North Korean  aid. For instance, Pabo Street in (Koriberton) in Guyana is  renamed as "Kim Chong-il Street"; an Indian library building as  "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il Library"; and a ninth grade class in  the Kudus School in Tunisia as "the Kim Chong-il classroom."  Such cases are said to total more than 20.    North Korea also has pro-North Korean foreign writers create  literary works depicting the greatness of Kim Chong-il and  other pieces and publish them on occasions like his birthday.    The purpose of the overseas campaigns on Kim Chong-il is not  aimed at propaganda effects overseas but rather is intended for  the feedback of the "fabricated results" gained through the  process of such campaigns and publicize them at home so that  they may give the North Koreans the impression that Kim Chong-il  is also recognized overseas as a capable leader.    One thing that we can not omit in noting the thrust of the  campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is the false claim that "the  South Korean people admire Kim Chong-il."    Beginning in 1987, as part of the measures to consolidate  the Kim Chong-il leadership structure, North Korean  intermittently published false reports that "the South Korean  people" also admire and respect Kim Chong-il. Recently, the  frequency of such reports has shown a tendency to rise.    In the past North Korea carried such reports mainly through  Radio Pyongyang, a propaganda radio beamed to South Korea. But  recently domestic news media such as the Central Broadcasting  Station--the domestic radio station--and newspapers like NODONG  SINMUN and MINJU CHOSON also have been making similar claims.  North Korean media claim that contrary to the past, South Korean  people in all strata and all walks of life, including  intellectuals, workers, artists, and students, now respect and  admire Kim Chong-il.    North Korean propaganda stresses that South Koreans are  saying that "it is fortunate for our nation to have Kim Chong-il  as future president"-- a claim designed to drive home to the  North Koreans that the South Korean people view Kim Chong-il's  succession to power as an accomplished fact.    As you see, the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il has been  pushed on an extensive scale and in various forms.    This phenomenon culminated in unprecedented happenings for  all ages and countries, such as Kim Il-song sending a gift of  Chinese poems to Kim Chong-il praising his own son and Yi In-mo  writing a poem in praise of Kim Chong-il.    In the future the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is  expected to intensify in conjunction with the consolidation of  his leadership.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Rose on a mission impossible - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) As he nears the end of his year-long term as the world's most visible peacekeper, General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, is a paradoxical figure: a daredevil soldier with a cautious view of peacekeeping, an intellectual with some colourful swear words in his repertoire. The fact that he has lasted in the job for the full 12 months is itself a formidable achievement. He is the only man to have stayed the full course in a post which could be designed to turn the holder into a whipping boy for all sides. His predecessors - a Canadian, a Frenchman and a Belgian - all left Sarajevo early, admitting their inability to cope simultaneously with the Neanderthal brutishness of the Serb forces and the devious strategems of their enemies. Yet General Rose, a youthful 54-year-old with ice-blue eyes, has stayed the course, despite a whispering campaign against him in Washington, and endless abuse from Moslem politicians in Sarajevo, where no less than eight political parties have banded together to demand his removal. The British officer, a veteran of more clear-cut military campaigns in Ulster, the Falklands and the Gulf, has been excoriated by US newspaper columnists for his reluctance to call in air power against the Serbs except as a last resort. But the general - acutely sensitive to criticism when he believes it to be ill-informed - has retorted that he is in the business of peacekeeping, not the imposition of peace by force. 'I work for peace and the people of this country, not for extreme propagandists or politicians,' he indignantly declared after Bosnian Moslem legislators demanded his removal. His tasks in Bosnia - to keep 'safe areas' safe, broke and monitor truces, and ensure the delivery of aid - are ones that have repeatedly placed him on a collision course with local power-brokers, military and political. If they were praising him, that would be a sign that something was wrong. In the latest blow to its mission, the UN has seen hundreds of its men detained for varying periods by the Bosnian Serbs, prompting even the most sympathetic observers to wonder how long the UN mission can continue. For his first few weeks in Sarajevo, General Rose was hailed as a local hero, after knocking heads together and bringing an end to the siege of the city. But since that brief honeymoon period, his task has been a thankless one. Where his mission works well - for example, in stopping any recurrence of fighting between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia - the world hardly notices. His failures - especially the recent failure to stop the Serb encroachment on the enclave of Bihac - attract heaps of derision. So the general, a tough-minded and sharp- tongued man who has often let his exasperation with Bosnia's warlords show, will doubtless be relieved to pass the baton to his successor, Major-General Rupert Smith. General Rose is an intellectual among army officers. He studied politics and economics at St Edmund's Hall, Oxford and learnt to speak fluent French at the Sorbonne. Yet he has devoted much of his life to the application of force at its most spectacular and surgical. He made his career in the Special Air Services, the British army's elite commando regiment, and he enjoyed the reputation of a tough-talking hawk in both the Falklands war of 1982 and in Northern Ireland. Before coming to Bosnia, his best known achievement was masterminding the April 1980 operation to free 26 hostages from the Iranian embassy in London. With the television cameras of the world looking on, a squad of SAS men under his command killed five of the Arab terrorists who had seized the building. The rescue earned Rose the esteem of Margaret Thatcher, who was Prime Minister at the time; it made such a welcome contrast to the fiasco which befell the US air operation to rescue hostages from Tehran. In recent weeks, the general has expressed astonishment that his erstwhile admirer has lent her support to the arming of the Bosnian Moslems and mounting tougher air strikes against the Serbs. In the general's view, these moves would rebound against his soldiers: Lady Thatcher's comments are just one more brickbat for the stoical SAS commander to endure.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE PUZZLES PROSECUTION;  </P> <P> ACTRESS' SON ADMITTED KILLING HER, ATTORNEY REVEALS  </P> <P> Puzzling the prosecution, a defense attorney revealed during a murder trial  Tuesday that a 25-year-old Encino man had confessed to slaying his mother,  actress Susan Cabot -- a confession the prosecution was unable to use.  </P> <P> Timothy Scott Roman told police he and his mother had been arguing on the night  of Dec. 10, 1986, when she came at him with a scalpel, Detective Philip  Quartararo testified in Van Nuys Superior Court.  </P> <P> Roman told police he took the scalpel from his mother and hit her on the head  with a dumbbell in self-defense, Quartararo said. "He said he didn't remember  how many times he hit her," he testified.  </P> <P> Quartararo's testimony came during cross-examination by Roman's attorney,  Chester Leo Smith. It was the first time in the week-long trial that a witness  testified that Roman had admitted the slaying.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone said outside the courtroom that Roman's  confession was not used by the prosecution because it was offered after the  defendant had asked to speak to an attorney, which under court rulings made it  inadmissible.  </P> <P> Stone said he could not explain why Roman's own attorney would want to put the  confession on the record, unless it was for some unknown tactical reason.  </P> <P> Smith could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Last week jurors heard a tape recording of detectives interviewing Roman about  the slaying of his 59-year-old mother, a leading actress in 1950s action  movies. During the 90-minute interview, Roman denied killing his mother. "I had  nothing to do with it. I swear to God!" he shouted to his interrogators.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treated at Hospital  </P> <P> At the conclusion of the interview, Roman asked to speak with an attorney.  </P> <P> Under Smith's questioning, Quartararo testified Tuesday that after Roman was  interviewed by police he was taken to Humana Hospital-West Hills, where he was  treated for minor injuries he said were sustained during a fight with a  burglar.  </P> <P> Police testified earlier that officers found no evidence that anyone had broken  into the house.  </P> <P> Quartararo said Roman admitted killing his mother after they left the hospital  and were returning to the Encino home the defendant shared with his mother. At  the house, Roman showed police where he hid the weapons used during the fight,  Quartararo testified. The scalpel, a knife and a dumbbell were found inside a  detergent box in the laundry room, Quartararo said.  </P> <P> Charged with first-degree murder, but without the special conditions that could  bring the death penalty, Roman faces a possible life term in prison.  </P> <P> He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If he is convicted, his  insanity claim will be heard by the same jury.  </P></p>

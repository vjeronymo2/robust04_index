			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / France divided on Arab links: The reformulation of a 'ball and chain' relationship FRANCE has appeared much more sympathetic to the engineers of the coup which two months ago interrupted Algeria's first multi-party elections since the recent visit to Paris of Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the Algerian foreign minister. It has underlined this support by increasing a revolving line of credit, granted in 1990, from FFr3bn (Pounds 300m) to FFr4bn. However, such gestures cannot conceal the very contradictory reactions of the French political establishment to events in Algeria. This confusion stands in contrast to the reactions of some leading French industrialists and of the former prime minister Raymond Barre. Mr Barre believes that France should consider a bold gesture, such as deferring payments on Algeria's FFr33bn French state guaranteed debt for two years. This would give the country breathing space at a time when a 74 per cent debt service ratio is throttling its economy. According to Mr Barre: 'We (France) could play an active role, together with the Japanese, who are Algeria's second largest creditor, and the IMF to help the Algerians implement the economic reforms aimed at liberalising the economy and creating jobs which they have already set in motion.' However, France's leaders are facing the most serious domestic crisis in a decade and President Francois Mitterrand appears disinterested in foreign affairs beyond Europe. The authorities are further hamstrung by the growing popularity, in the run up to next Sunday's regional elections, of the extreme right-wing National Front led by Mr Jean Marie Le Pen, who was an active fighter for the 'Algerie Francaise' 30 years ago and makes no secret of his anti-Arab feelings. The illusion that France still had an 'independent' Arab policy was shattered by the war which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 18 months ago. Recent events in Algeria have underlined how important it is for France to reformulate what can only be described as the 'ball and chain' relationship it maintains with its former African colonies. Nowhere is that need more urgent than with regard to Algeria  - yet with no country is it more difficult. A love-hate relationship, born of a 132-year history, encompassing a cruel war of independence which toppled the French Fourth Republic in 1958, makes it difficult for the French to treat Algerian issues on their merits. It was Mr Mitterrand, then Minister of the Interior, who ordered that the Algerian 'rebellion' of November 1954, be ruthlessly suppressed. Many of his ministers were among the 2.5m French officers and conscripts sent out to fight a war to 'maintain order'. French officials and businessmen are, however, split into two camps. Some evoke the rank France holds in the world in words which sound like Gaullism writ small. They strongly resent what they feel is the intrusion of Italy, Spain, Japan and the US into their former colonies. Others are convinced that now is the time, with Algeria in desperate need of support, that France should be lending a helping hand. Leading French companies such as Total and Peugeot are convinced that the stability of Algeria, one of the few middle-ranking third world countries where French attitudes might influence other leading western players, is vital to French strategic interests. For the other camp, the French ambassador to Algiers, Mr Jean Audibert, four months ago publicly dismissed Italy's decision to refinance its state-guaranteed debt with Algeria as akin to a 'diplomacy of trinkets'. Italy's action enabled Algeria's policy of refinancing its Dollars 23.9bn foreign debt rather than rescheduling it to get off the ground. Mr Audibert's views reflect that of an older generation in France, some of them former colonial administrators, who appear to regret the days when France ruled the roost. A younger generation of officials and France's larger and more successful companies have no such worries. They recognise that France must work with Italy and Spain to promote Mediterranean interests in the EC as Germany will fight for the east European countries. They feel that North Africa is as important to southern Europe as Mexico is to the US. They know that Algeria has not been an easy customer, but are convinced that if France succeeds in formulating a more focused regional approach, it will avoid the kind of sudden crisis it is all too prone to in its relations, notably with Morocco and Algeria. The so-called Five plus Five meetings, which bring together south European and north African countries, were launched a few years ago, at France's initiative, but it is only recently that other European participants have begun to see a French desire to break with the past. French businessmen are mindful of Algeria's vast reserves of natural gas, and the fact that, if economic reforms meet with even partial success, the Algerian market in cars, pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs is well worth fighting for. Nor are they unaware of the presence in France of at least 1.5m north African immigrants and of the strong pressure to emigrate from a country where unemployment among the 16-24 age group is running at 48 per cent. They accept that deferring some of Algeria's debt payments will not be cheap but suspect it might be a lot less expensive than the fall-out which economic breakdown in North Africa's largest country would produce.</p>

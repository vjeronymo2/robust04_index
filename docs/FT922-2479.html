			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government to support Delors' reappointment THE GOVERNMENT indicated yesterday that it will agree to the temporary reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president in order to boost the chances of a more acceptable candidate winning in two years' time. Mr John Major told MPs that 'no firm decision' had been taken by the UK. Downing Street officials pointed out that there might be tactical advantages in backing an extension of Mr Delors' term of office until 1995. The prime minister wants to be in the best position to ensure a candidate more attuned to his views - such as Mr Rudd Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, or Sir Leon Brittan, the UK commissioner - when the choice of president is made again in two years' time. Presidents appointed to serve from January 1995 will have five-year terms rather than the present two. Such tactics may help appease Tory Euro-sceptics who have complained about the reappointment of Mr Delors. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night publicly backed the prime minister's line on pushing forward with the Maastricht treaty. Mr Portillo's attendance at a meeting of Euro-sceptics had fuelled rumours of a cabinet split. It is unclear to what extent Mr Major will be able to win the support of other EC leaders for a deal over the presidency at the Lisbon summit later this month. Mr Major again emphasised that one of Britain's priorities during its EC presidency from July 1 would be to 'clarify speedily the practical application of subsidiarity' - the principle by which decisions are taken by the lowest appropriate level of government. That may include an addendum to the Maastricht treaty. Meanwhile, Labour's European strategy appeared to be shifting when Mr Neil Kinnock reopened the option of his party's backing a British referendum. His comments will encourage Tories who have been seeking a referendum. In Lisbon yesterday, he said: 'It would be foolish to exclude the possibility of a referendum at some stage on ratification and on Britain's role in the Community, especially in the circumstances following the Danish referendum.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pontedilegno, Italy, April 2 (AFP) -- Northern  League leader Umberto Bossi Saturday [2 April] rejected Silvio  Berlusconi, his erstwhile electoral ally, as a candidate for the  post of prime minister.    Speaking from this northern Italian town where he is taking  a  few days holiday, Bossi said his federalist party was insisting  on one of its members becoming premier.    "We cannot give in on this point. I repeat, Berlusconi  cannot be president of the Council (prime minister)," he said.    But he did seem to allow for a way out to the dispute  between  the three parties which emerged victorious from last week's  general elections, by saying: "If it is not possible to find a  solution to the problem of making a square out of a circle, the  League can do many things, such as offer external support  without entering the government."    Bossi, who did not take part in initial talks Friday in  Milan  between his own party and Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia  (Go, Italy) party, said he would attend the next meeting  scheduled for Wednesday.    "The League must be in a position to influence and easily  foster change," Bossi said.    The Northern League and Forza Italia are in a fragile  alliance with the right-wing National Alliance.    But the National Alliance, led by the neo-fascists, favours  greater central control while the Northern League wants greater  autonomy for the rich industrial north of the country.</p>

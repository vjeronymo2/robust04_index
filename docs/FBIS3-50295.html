			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 4 January issue of the Zagreb weekly  DANAS in Serbo-Croatian publishes on pages 22-24 an article on  the founding of Bosanska Posavina. DANAS states that the local  Croats established the province despite the opposition of the  Herceg-Bosna leadership. The weekly explains that the  Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which called for only a small portion of  Bosanska Posavina to be given to the Bosnian Croat republic, was  the greatest motive for the establishment of Bosanska Posavina's  autonomy. Every Bosanska Posavina resident will agree with this,  DANAS states, adding that in comparison to the Vance-Owen plan,  the Owen-Stoltenberg plan "was the sheer destruction of one of  the most compact Croatian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina."  In contrast to the Vance-Owen plan, which called for the  Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Bosanski Samac, and Orasje municipalities,  as well as parts of the Derventa, Doboj, Modrica, Gradacac, and  Brcko municipalities, to be included in the Croatian-majority  province, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan gave the Croats only  two-and-one-half municipalities, DANAS observes. This is why  the Posavina residents decided at a general assembly recently  held in Slavonski Brod to "return to a kind of Vance-Owen plan."  The assembly made the decision to establish the province of  Bosanska Posavina incorporating the municipalities of Bosanski  Brod, Bosanski Samac, Derventa, Modrica, Odzak, and Orasje and  parts of Brcko, Doboj, and Gradacac. According to the 1991  census, Croats were a majority in this region, with 59.6 percent  of the population, followed by Serbs with 20.5 percent and  Muslims with 15.5 percent. Other nationalities made up 4.4  percent of the population. "Now that the plan for the union of  Posavina municipalities into a special territorial-political  body has become a reality, its supporters are not pleased to be  compared to Fikret Abdic," DANAS states, adding that the reason  for this is not because the founding of their province is  different from that of the Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia, but because they do not want to be viewed as the  creators of a conflict among the Croatian people similar to the  intra-Muslim conflict in the Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia. The essential difference between the two is that the  Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia has hostile relations with  the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo, while Bosanska Posavina  intends to maintain equally good relations with Alija  Izetbegovic and Mate Boban, DANAS concludes.</p>

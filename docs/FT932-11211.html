			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: German banks in co-operation venture BHF-BANK, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, is set to forge a co-operation agreement with the Dusseldorf-based IKB Deutsche Industriekreditbank, an institution which specialises in providing long-term finance to small and medium-sized businesses. The agreement, announced after the stock market closed yesterday, is to coincide with a share swap agreement under which BHF has taken a 10 per cent stake in IKB whilst the Dusseldorf institution will acquire 3.5 per cent of BHF's share. No price was given for BHF's share purchase, but it is likely that it paid about DM190m (Dollars 118m) for the IKB holding. The move is the bank's second large expansion move within months, following its Pounds 235m (Dollars 361.9m) agreement to buy jointly a 90 per cent stake in Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank with Credit Commercial de France. The German banks said that the agreement is to focus on a number of business areas including the provision of credit for companies, export and credit financing, as well as mergers and acquisitions and other types of corporate finance advisory work. BHF increased group operating profits by 6.9 per cent last year to DM366m. Group business volume is DM54bn compared with DM37bn at IKB. The two banks have for the past 10 years worked together via a jointly-owned property leasing company. At the same time, the two banks said IKB and Credit National, its French co-operation partner, would be taking a 5 per cent cross-holding in each other with the aim of intensifying financing business for Franco-German investment.</p>

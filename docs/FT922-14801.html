We do not foresee drastic changes in the near future. The undertone of the black pepper market was easier because of the growing selling pressure from the Far East (Malaysia and Vietnam). The spot European price for grade 1 black pepper was Dollars 1,175 a tonne, while that quality could be obtained on shipment basis at about Dollars 1,100 a tonne cif.</p>

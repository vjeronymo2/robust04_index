			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Congressmen in Brazil likely to face expulsion Brazil's Congress yesterday finished three months of hearings into an alleged corruption network and looked set to recommend expelling 10-30 congressmen tainted by the scandal. Mr Roberto Magalhaes, in charge of writing the investigation's final report, is expected to release the document at the weekend. As well as recommending expulsion or suspension of affected congressmen, the report is likely to suggest several changes to the law and further investigation into non-congressional figures who have been implicated. These include three state governors and several ex-ministers. The hearings, which at times brought proceedings in the capital Braslia to a virtual standstill as more politicians were named, stemmed from allegations of corruption affecting the framing of the government's budget. It is alleged that, under the scheme, congressmen received 'fees', mainly from construction companies, in return for approving government spending on construction projects. Investigation of the bank accounts of implicated politicians also led to the discovery of other influence-peddling schemes. It is still unclear whether the most senior politicians to be implicated will be expelled from Congress. The investigation won wide public support but lost momentum in recent weeks as no significant new evidence appeared.</p>

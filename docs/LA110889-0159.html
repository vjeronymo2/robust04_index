			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'THE SCHWARZENSHRIVER' AND OTHER EXPECTATIONS  </P> <P> THAT GRAND actress Sigourney Weaver and her director-hubby, Jim Simpson, are  expecting their first child in the early spring. They have been married for  five years.  </P> <P> Down in D.C., the "Charlotte's Web" gossip column of the Washington Star says  Kelly McGillis, acting with the Folger Library repertory company, and her  businessman-husband, are also expecting for their very first time.  </P> <P> Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has never been a daddy before, expects any minute  via Maria Shriver of NBC and the Kennedy family. Arnold now refers to his  coming heir as "The Schwarzenshriver!"  </P> <P> HAVE A FLASH -- one of the world's best-known, most prolific novelists says he  is going to hang up his typewriter after he finishes his current one, "The  Piranhas," for Simon &amp; Schuster. This will mark the 20th work of fiction to  come from Harold Robbins, who wrote such best sellers as "A Stone for Danny  Fisher," "Where Love Has Gone" and "The Carpetbaggers."  </P> <P> THEY ARE trooping up the gangplank to get aboard the good ship "National" with  captains Frank Deford and Peter Price at the helm. The lures these publishers  are holding must be wonderful ones indeed. The gang now includes the New York  Daily News' star Mike Lupica, the New York Times' Peter Alfano, the Washington  Post's John Feinstein, the L.A. Times' Scott Ostler. And get this -- when The  National daily sports newspaper bows in January, they'll have a gossip  columnist. Smith grad Kim Cunningham, formerly of World Tennis and US magazine,  will write a column called "Eagle's Eye."  </P> <P> IT HAS taken Freddie Fields five years to bring his crowning glory, a movie  titled "Glory," to the big screen. This epic tribute to the first all-black  fighting regiment in U.S. history, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry,  has been a labor of love. Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington and Morgan  Freeman are the marvelous stars of this story of how blacks helped turn the  tide for the Union Army in the Civil War.  </P> <P> Fields has already distinguished himself in many areas of entertainment. He  founded one of the world's biggest talent agencies, CMA, now ICM. He was  production chief at MGM/UA. He has managed the careers and presented such stars  as Judy Garland and her ilk. I'll be rooting for Freddie when "Glory" bows on  Dec. 10 at the Ziegfeld in New York for the American Film Institute.  </P> <P> I NEVER cease being amazed at how articulate and witty Sylvester Stallone is  when most people think he goes around yelling "Yo!" In the new M mag, Stallone  says this about image vs. reality: "I entered this business as an actor, not as  an icon, not as a rough-and-tumble guy, right-wing, jingoistic, sociopathic --  that's not me. I'm subject to the whims and perceptions of a fictional  character. I am a verbal person and 'Rambo' is an Elizabethan dumb show, almost  a mime. It isn't as if I'm in the gutter drinking Woolite, but it has jaded and  distorted the image of who I am."  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (15): Airlines and hotels can count the beans - Emerging destinations / South Africa The most tired cliche in South Africa is that the country is enjoying a post-election honeymoon period. As far as the business community goes, it is a phrase of some substance. Political reform in South Africa has ushered in an era of enthusiastic courtship between foreign businessmen, investors and bankers, and the local business community. But while there has been much holding of hands, and some knots have been tied, it remains early days. There has been little inward flow of investment to talk of. For airlines and hotels, though, it is not too early to count the beans. The runway at Jan Smuts airport in Johannesburg testifies to a forest of new visitors. The foyers of the larger hotels have a cosmopolitan buzz which was absent as recently as a year ago. For those businessmen who have still to put their toe in South African waters, there is not too much to be concerned about. Perhaps the country's biggest disadvantage is that it is a long-haul destination, certainly so far as any other major business capital is concerned. On the other hand, this is offset, at least for European visitors, by the fact that there is little time difference. With most flights overnight, it is also quite possible to leave at the end of one business day and do business in South Africa the following morning (and vice versa). Most of the world's main carriers fly into South Africa on a fairly frequent basis, with British Airways and South African Airways both offering daily flights, and more, from London. If anything, there are indications that supply might not yet have caught up with demand. Regular visitors from the UK say that business and first class are normally very heavily booked, and it is not always possible, at short notice, to get on a flight. On arrival, the visitor will discover that South Africa's best face is not immediately obvious. Jan Smuts airport, which is currently being upgraded, provides a satisfactory, rather than a good, service. Immigration and baggage services are adequate, rather than accomplished. For the purposes of getting around, public transport is a non-issue - at least so far as getting to the places that businessmen are interested in. This leaves the option of taxis, hire cars or a chauffeur service. Taxis are available but not always reliable, and the cars tend to be a bit run down. The hire car fleet is in good shape, roads are excellent, and the geography is very manageable, so hiring a car is a feasible choice. First prize, though, is to have a chauffeur service, because this means you do not have to worry about parking. When it comes to accommodation, mainstream hotels range from Pounds 40 to Pounds 110 a night. So far as Johannesburg goes - and it is the nub of most business visits, though Cape Town also attracts a fair share of visitors - the Sandton Sun and Towers hotel is a firm favourite. Bankers and businessmen can enjoy the bracing frisson of rubbing shoulders with the competition in the foyer. The Towers extension, opened in 1993, is arguably the hotel best adapted to the business visitor, offering such facilities as chauffeured limousines, cellular phones and a business centre. Unsurprisingly, it also comes at the top of the price range. One regular English visitor says the hotel is 'a notch off top quality', but offers good value in an international sense. He adds: 'I would be happy to transport that hotel elsewhere.' There are, off course, many other options. The Rosebank hotel is a middle-of-the-road favourite in the suburbs, while the Carlton keeps the flag burning in town. While there is no gainsaying the trend towards staying in the suburbs, the Carlton clearly makes more sense for businessmen visiting banks, mining houses, stockbrokers and lawyers, all of whom still tend to be concentrated in the central business district. The concern likely to be most to the fore in the mind of the novice visitor is safety. The good news is that levels of political violence have fallen dramatically since the elections. The bad news is that there is still a lot of crime, much of it violent. That said, visitors are likely to be pleasantly surprised. Mr Tony Hicks, chief executive of the UK-Southern Africa Business Association, and a frequent visitor, comments: 'Crime is a bigger issue in the minds of newcomers to the region than it should be. It is a very safe country to be in. A businessman is absolutely safe, providing he is sensible.' A US bankers notes: 'Central Johannesburg is worse than mid-town Manhattan, but no worse than the bad parts of downtown Manhattan.' A UK compatriot adds: 'I don't feel any more exposed than I would in parts of Los Angeles, Chicago or Detroit.' The actual conduct of business ought not to be too difficult. For a start, after years of isolation, South Africa tends to welcome visitors. English is the language of business, telephone and fax services are good (cellular phone services were recently introduced) and there is competent professional back-up in areas such as law and accountancy. For the businessmen with a few days to kill, there is a surfeit of leisure opportunities. The jewel in the crown is probably Cape Town, a two-hour flight from Johannesburg, and the surrounding western Cape region. Try to visit the game parks in the Eastern Transvaal, five to six hours by car, but shorter if you fly. If you are pressed for time or like golf, nip off to the Sun City complex, two hours' drive from Johannesburg.</p>

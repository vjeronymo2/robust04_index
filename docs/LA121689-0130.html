			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Lamb &amp; Lion Records -- A story Friday about the emergence from Chapter 11  bankruptcy by Lamb &amp; Lion Records, a Christian record company in Burbank  owned by entertainer Pat Boone, was mistakenly cut and as a result omitted  important details of the terms of the agreement with its creditors.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the agreement, Lamb &amp; Lion has made a $30,000 payment on  the loan and will make additional monthly payments of $2,500 for nearly two  years. The balance of the loan is to be paid after that period, according to  court papers, and Boone is personally guaranteeing the loan.  </P> <P> As a result of the agreement, a lawsuit filed in late 1987 in San Mateo County  Superior Court by Bell Savings &amp; Loan that accused Boone of fraud has now  been dropped. Boone has denied the allegation, contending that he had been a  good customer in making payments to Bell and was treated unfairly.  </P></p>

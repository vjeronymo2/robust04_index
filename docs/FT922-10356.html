			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Statoil profits cut to NKr800m STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, said first-quarter net profit nearly halved to NKr800m (Dollars 124m) from NKr1.5bn last year due to lower crude oil prices and pressure on operating margins. Statoil warned that based on market trends so far, profit for the year as a whole could be lower than in 1991 when it reached NKr2.75bn at the net level. Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, explained that last year's first quarter was greatly enhanced by higher crude oil prices per barrel which were pushed up on average by Dollars 3-Dollars 4 to Dollars 21-Dollars 22 mainly due to the effects of the Gulf war. Mr Woldsdal pointed out that a high and steady level of oil and gas production in this year's first quarter contributed to maintaining profits at a relatively high level in spite of the oil price fall. Group operating revenue dipped to NKr19bn from NKr19.8bn while operating profit declined NKr1.4bn to NKr4.4bn. ELKEM, the troubled light metals producer, plunged into a first-quarter pre-tax loss of NKr116m from a NKr76m profit in the same period last year, but forecast rising demand for its products in 1992. However, last year's profit included a NKr179m gain on the sale of the company's shareholding in Alcoa Nederland Holding. Elkem's first-quarter performance nevertheless exceeded analysts predictions and the A shares closed 10.3 per cent higher at NK96.50. Group first-quarter net sales were lifted NKr106m to NKr1.988bn as operating costs rose NKr82m to NKr1.893bn.</p>

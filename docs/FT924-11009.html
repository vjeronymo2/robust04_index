			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Health reforms 'failing' THE GOVERNMENT'S health care reforms are failing to create an internal market as planned, according to a survey from accountants Arthur Andersen released yesterday. Nearly 80 per cent of hospital chief executives and unit general managers did not believe the National Health Service objective of creating an internal market are being achieved. More than 70 per cent, however, said the reforms had resulted in improvements in overall efficiency, quality of service, average length of occupancy and waiting lists. The survey questioned senior executives from 50 hospitals across England in July, and spanned those from existing trusts, non-trusts and units applying for trust status. About 70 per cent said that community relations had remained the same or worsened since the reforms, and a third said staff morale had deteriorated. The most significant problems in implementing the reforms included the adequacy of information, the timetable established, relationships with purchasers, quality of management and internal resistance. The survey suggested there was less sharing of information with other hospitals than in the past. NHS reforms - Impact and Implications. Arthur Andersen, 1 Surrey St, London WC2R 2PS.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: F&amp;C Smaller Cos considers issue Directors of Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller Companies, the investment trust, said they were considering an issue of C shares to raise additional capital. Any offer would be structured to ensure there would be no dilution of the net asset value of the existing shares. Any such issue would also include an open offer to existing shareholders. At September 30 net asset value per share stood at 162.6p. That represented an increase of 19.5 per cent over the 136.1p standing at end-April 1993.</p>

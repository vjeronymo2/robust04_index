			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: UK House prices up by 1.2% last year, says Halifax - At a glance House prices in the UK rose on average by 1.2 per cent last year, the first increase since 1990 and the highest annual rise since 1989, according to Halifax, the largest mortgage lender. However, the annual increase was less than half that reported by Nationwide building society, the second biggest lender, which found that prices last year had risen by 3.3 per cent. Prices fell by 0.5 per cent in December compared with November according to Halifax but Nationwide reported a 0.8 per cent rise. Both societies expect the recovery to strengthen in 1994 and Halifax predicts house prices to rise by about 5 per cent over the course of the year.</p>

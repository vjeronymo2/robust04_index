			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR, FIRE, WATER AND EARTH  </P> <P> I may have to reevaluate my opinion of Governor Deukmejian based upon his  support for a statewide trash separation and recycling law. What a great idea!  </P> <P> Of course all Californians could voluntarily recycle glass, metal, paper and  yard trimmings now. As consumers we are responsible for much of the problem,  thus we must be part of the solution. But many citizens will never be motivated  unless the state steps in.  </P> <P> BRUCE NOLTE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn [no date as received] (DPA) -- Refusing an  entry visa to the Russian right-wing extremist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy led to an unexpected aggravation today. The  Federal Government has officially refused to tolerate insults  and threats Zhirinovskiy made yesterday when he was informed in  Sofia that his visa application had been turned down. The  Foreign Ministry confirmed reports from witnesses of  Zhirinovskiy's behavior in Sofia.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann, however, could  not  confirm a report from Sofia which reached DPA. It alludes to  personal murder threats by Zhirinovskiy against German diplomats  who explained the refusal. [passage omitted]    A consular official from the [Sofia] embassy had informed  Zhirinovskiy about the refusal to grant the visa at the Sofia  airport. Zhirinovskiy, as the ministry has now confirmed, then  made derogatory statements about the Federal Republic, made  threats about future German-Russian relations, and "personally  insulted" the German diplomat. The Foreign Ministry said this  was "strongly rejected. These statements were a further reason,  in addition to his previous statements, to disqualify  Zhirinovskiy as an interlocutor."</p>

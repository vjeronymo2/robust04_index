			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (7): Rigorous checks - Sweden: Financial services regulation THESE are grim days for Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority, the country's main financial services regulator. With the banking sector groaning under the strain of huge credit losses, the FSA has been forced to introduce more rigorous - and more frequent - checks on Sweden's financial institutions. Combined credit losses among the banks, finance companies, mortgage institutions and securities houses grew by a staggering SKr30.3bn to SKr48.1bn in 1991. The banks account for the lion's share with SKr35.6bn in credit losses (equivalent to 2.9 per cent of total outstanding loans), compared with SKr10.8bn in 1990 and SKr2.8bn in 1989. Concern over the scale of the credit losses, mainly in relation to the real estate sector where prices have plummeted, has prompted the FSA to introduce new reporting standards. Lenders already had to outline details of large loans (those exceeding 10 per cent of their capital base) every six months and provide monthly balance sheet statements. Now, they also have to provide monthly details of their non-performing loans, defined as loans where there has been no interest payment for 60 days or a lower-than-agreed interest payment. 'The reporting of non-performing loans provides the regulators with a better view of the market,' says one financial analyst who follows the Swedish banking sector. In cases where real estate is used as security for a loan, the lender has to obtain independent professional valuations for the property. With effect from January 1992, these figures have to be published in the lender's annual report. The FSA points out that by requesting independent valuations for property used as collateral, the real estate is less likely to be valued too leniently in today's falling market, although Mr Kjell Arvidsson, head of the FSA's financial markets department, emphasises that none of the banks is in the situation of having to sell properties at present. Nevertheless, the feeling remains that many of the banks have been too reckless in their lending. 'They chased after borrowers irrespective of their creditworthiness as soon as the restrictions on lending were lifted during the second half of the 1980s,' says one banking analyst. The FSA says banks were not careful enough with their credit analyses in many cases, and did not make sure that the borrower was sound. In addition, some banks discovered subsequently that their back office work was so poor that when problems arose they had no idea whether they were legally in a position to take over property which they had assumed was their collateral. So far, the problems have arisen mainly in the commercial real estate sector, but some bankers are worried that if unemployment continues to rise in Sweden, the incidence of private debt and mortgage defaults could rise sharply. The outlook certainly remains gloomy. 'As it looks now, there will be big problems, but maybe the market will have to take it,' warns Mr Arvidsson.</p>

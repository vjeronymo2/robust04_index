			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 May (PL) -- Today's issue of GRANMA  describes as insulting U.S. President William Clinton's message  on 20 May on the occasion of one of the most lamentable moments  in Cuban history.    Under the title of "Pharisaism," journalist Felix Pita  Astudillo recalls that on the day the United States installed a  government in Cuba following military intervention, and now, 92  years later, this country intends to maintain annexationist  ideas "with the intention of annexing us into its new world  order at any cost."    After pointing to the crudeness of the message's content,  which seems more like an electoral diatribe directed at Miami --  in November, Floridians will go to the polls -- Pita Astudillo  assesses in detail each of the four paragraphs that "the  arrogant superpower produced to express its opinion about  today's Cuba and to disseminate the unsolicited opinions of its  government."    The Cuban Government daily cites statistics that reflect the  situation in the country prior to the 1959 revolutionary  victory, and it notes that the Cuban people are not interested  in the freedom advocated by the United States "because it is  inhuman and belongs to the every-man-for-himself philosophy."    Further on, the journalist notes that the wishes expressed  by  Clinton do not take into account "the right to life, work,  education, food, health, or housing" in Cuba or in its  neighboring Latin American countries.    "There is no reference, at all, to the eradication of  poverty, which requires well-balanced economic development and a  better distribution of wealth because it only deals with age-old  and worn- out references to individual civil liberties with a  vague mention of the state of law," Pita Astudillo adds.    The article describes the argument in the third paragraph as  cynical because it defends the blockade, a blockade that "is  aimed at making it impossible for the people of Cuba to attain  prosperity and satisfy their basic needs as well as making us  surrender through hunger."    President Clinton's message, the journalist adds, indicates  that Cuba and the United States "have a long history of  cooperation and admiration." It is indeed long, Pita Astudillo  remarks, but filled with voraciousness and disdain toward the  "immoral dwarfs," as the North Americans used to describe Cubans  in the last century.    Describing it as having the nerve to refer to Jose Marti as  someone whose ideas are consistent with Clinton's policy, Pita  Astudillo recalls that it was precisely Marti who, 105 years  ago, wrote: "The United States has never viewed Cuba as anything  but a savory possession whose only inconvenience is its people,  whom they view as impetuous, lazy, and loathsome."    After noting that President Clinton had an opportunity not  to  endorse this shameful part of history, the journalist emphasizes  with certainty that "there is something between us," adding that  two different worlds separate us: one of policies of conquest  and annexation and one of policies of friendship and hospitality.    "We are an educated, friendly, and hospitable people, who  also can be fierce and intransigent when our most beloved  symbols are insulted with the language of pharisaism, and this  is the language used in this message," Pita Astudillo concludes.</p>

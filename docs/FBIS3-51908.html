			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Saavedra Durao: "Number of Unemployed in </F> Country Drops"]    [Text] Rio de Janeiro--The rate of open unemployment in the  country's six metropolitan areas (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo,  Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Recife, and Porto Alegre) in November  was 4.57 percent, down from 4.89 percent in October and 5.82  percent in November 1992, it was reported yesterday by the  Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).    Of the six metropolitan areas surveyed by the institute,  Recife was the only one showing an increase: unemployment there  was 8.28 percent in November, compared to 7.93 percent in  October, and 8.77 percent in November 1992. Unemployment dropped  in the other areas: to 5.30 percent in Salvador (5.42 percent in  October), 3.40 percent in Belo Horizonte (3.84 percent in  October), 3.56 percent in Rio de Janeiro (3.90 percent in  October), 5.08 percent in Sao Paulo (5.45 percent in October),  and 2.82 percent in Porto Alegre (3.56 percent in October).    That almost general trend toward a lower rate of open  unemployment in the six metropolitan areas was accompanied by a  rise in the average rate of activity in those regions--to 61.09  percent, compared to 60.29 percent in October--meaning that more  jobs were available.    All sectors of economic activity experienced less  unemployment in November, examples being the processing industry  (5.97 percent compared to 6.11 percent), construction (5.25  percent compared to 5.86 percent), commerce (4.61 percent  compared to 5.10 percent), and services (3.51 percent compared  to 3.64 percent).    The IBGE also announced an increase in the employed  population in the six metropolitan areas (15,474,639, compared  to 15,428,279 in October), meaning that 46,360 people entered  the labor market.    Despite that, the number of employees with work cards fell  by  2 percent in the labor market, while the number of "cardless"  workers grew by 5 percent, thus confirming the growth of the  informal labor market.  <H5>  Average Real Incomes </H5>   The average real income of employed individuals last October  was up 14 percent over October 1992. The outstanding increases  were in commerce (average real wages up 22 percent), the  processing industry (16 percent), and services (14 percent).  Self-employed workers experienced the largest increase in real  income in October 1993: up 27 percent over the same month in  1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Reports from across the country indicate that  large-scale massacres of innocent citizens continue unabated.  [passage omitted]    The Republic of Tanzania too has expressed its serious  concern over the situation in Rwanda and indicated that it is  planning to convene a meeting between the Rwandese Patriotic  Army and Rwanda Government forces in Arusha this coming weekend.  [passage omitted]    For the record, the response of the Rwandese Government  Forces to the above [cease-fire] conditions has been negative.  Much has [word indistinct] in the outside world may hope from  negotiations between the Rwandese Patriotic Army and the  Rwandese Government Forces, it is doubtful that the negotiations  between the two forces under the current circumstances would be  of any use, if at all possible. What is the point, some ask, of  such dialogue with the Rwandese Government Forces when large  parts of that army have joined hands with the Presidential Guard  and other murderers in committing acts of genocide. Of what use  are negotiations with the Rwandese Government forces as long as  the Rwandese Government Forces still obstinately refuse to agree  to the disbanding and punishment of the Presidential Guard,  after all the carnage and destruction which the Presidential  Guard has caused. Is there any hope of an [word indistinct]  agreement with the Rwandese Government Forces when they still  refuse to disassociate themselves and deny legitimacy to the  self-styled provisional government extremists which (?usurped)  political power and is masterminding the ongoing atrocities.  And what moral rights or legal rights does the  40,000-plus-strong army have to demand negotiations to determine  the future of this country while they have stood by and still  stand by on the fence, after two weeks, while hundreds of  thousands of defenseless (?people) are slaughtered? Is there  any hope of (?resolving) this conflict with the Rwandese  Government Forces while they allow free rein to the clique of  extremist murders who have [words indistinct] power, who use  government resources, including arms and weapons [words  indistinct], in exterminating whole sections of the population  and boast about it in public as Mbonampeka Stanislas, (Donate  Murego), Justin Mugenzi and Mathieu Ngirumpatse were doing the  whole of yesterday on state radio.</p>

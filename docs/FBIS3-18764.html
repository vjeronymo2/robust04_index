			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "Al-Qaysi Meets With </F> French Foreign Ministry Official"]    [Text] Paris -- Daniel Bouchard, head of the Middle East  and North African Department at the French Foreign Ministry,  yesterday received Riyad al-Qaysi, director of international  affairs at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, who also met with  Jean-Piere Lavon, director of the UN office at the Foreign  Ministry.    Al-Qaysi's visit comes before the Security Council's  reexamination in mid-March of the international sanctions  imposed on Iraq. French sources have said that Iraqi officials  are seeking to persuade Paris to intervene with its allies to  lift the sanctions, especially as the Iraqi side "interpreted  the French position as unrealistic." French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe spoke of progress in Iraq's implementation of the  international resolutions. However, he urged the Iraqi  authorities to recognize the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border demarcation  and Kuwait.    The sources also said that al-Qaysi's visit comes after a  visit by an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation which left Paris after  a series of meetings with representatives from the two companies  Totale and Aquitaine, but it does not mean that France has  abandoned its position of stressing the implementation of the  Security Council resolution.    The sources said that Juppe does not receive Iraqi officials  because relations are severed between the two countries. The  sources pointed out that if Rolf Ekeus, head of the special UN  committee, decides that Iraq has complied with the Security  Council resolutions, [Iraq] can then enter the trial period  [al-marhalah al-ikhtibariyah], which has not yet begun, for the  long-term inspection of its weapons.    French officials stress that the embargo against Iraq would  be lifted when the Security Council resolutions are complied  with and the trial period -- six months -- begins. While the  United States adopts a more hard-line position. The U.S.  Administration has not specified the duration of the trial  period. It says that for a period of time -- it may be long --  Iraq must show its willingness to implement all the  international community's demands, beginning with implementation  of the Security Council resolutions through to respect for human  rights.    Despite the frequent visits to Paris by Iraqi officials --  including Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, the Oil Ministry  delegation, and al-Qaysi -- and the opening of an Iraqi  interests office in France, run by Dr. Ahmad al-'Izzawi, who  arrived in Paris recently, the French position on the embargo  has not changed, nor will change as long as Iraq has not  embarked on the trial period or fulfilled the requirements with  regard to its recognition of Kuwait and the border demarcation.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHAMBER ON RIGHT COURSE  </P> <P> You recently published an article regarding the proposed golf course in the Big  Tujunga Wash area. The article reported that the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of  Commerce supported the plan, but that the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents  opposed it.  </P> <P> One of their groundless fears is increased traffic. Assuming maximum  utilization, with golf foursomes starting at 10-minute intervals from 6 a.m. to  6 p.m., the total number of golfers would equal 288, and obviously they would  not all arrive or leave at the same time.  </P> <P> As a resident whose home is directly above the golf course site, I agree with  the Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> We have seen floods, people dumping trash, people shooting the wildlife, and  infrequently a horse rider or a hiker.  </P> <P> The golf course would protect the environment and preserve the wildlife and the  plant life while protecting the community against floods.  </P> <P> JEANNE KOSINSKI  </P> <P> Sunland  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. VIOLATED CABLE FIRM'S RIGHTS, U.S.  JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> A federal judge has ruled that the cable television franchising system set up  by the city of Los Angeles violated the 1st Amendment rights of a company that  sought a franchise in 1983, officials said this week.  </P> <P> In a decision released last week, U.S. District Court Judge Consuelo Marshall  ruled that the city had violated Preferred Communications' 1st Amendment right  to offer service to city residents.  </P> <P> In the ruling, Marshall invalidated the city's requirement that cable  television companies provide public access channels and a minimum channel  capacity, said Rob Bramson, an attorney for Preferred Communications.  </P> <P> Company attorneys hailed the decision as having nationwide importance by  further limiting the control that cities have over cable television. But an  attorney for the city, Larrine S. Holbrooke, said that outside California  federal judges have tended to favor the right of a city to franchise cable  television.  </P></p>

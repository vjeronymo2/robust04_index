			<p>BFN     [Text] A Malawian journalist has confirmed the presence of  Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] personnel at Renamo [Mozambique  National Resistance] bases in Niassa Province. THE MONITOR's  (Clement Mthambuli) was in Mozambique recently, having  interviewed Renamo and MYP officers. The MYP is the armed wing  of President Banda's Malawi Congress Party [(MCP].    A Renamo officer, who identified himself as Alberto Carlos,  told THE MONITOR that MYP members are being looked after and  will return to Malawi once Malawi Minister of State John Tembo  requests them to do so. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that  the MCP and the MYP provided varied assistance to Renamo during  the Mozambique war.    The Mozambican Government accused Renamo of sheltering MYP  members at its bases, but that has been denied by Afonso  Dhlakama's movement. Alberto Carlos told THE MONITOR that it  was John Tembo, the number two in Banda's cabinet, who asked  Dhlakama to look after MYP members and give them all the  necessary assistance and training so that they fulfill their  national duty. Alberto Carlos did not elaborate on what he  meant by national duty, but apparently the MYP is getting ready  to wage guerrilla warfare should Banda's party lose at the polls  on 17 May 1994.</p>

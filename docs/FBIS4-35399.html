			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit in Aden by </F> MBC announcer Antoine 'Awn in London -- live]    [Text] ['Awn] Tawfiq, good evening. We have heard the  latest reports that fierce battles are waging about 20  kilometers from Aden and that the northerners have confirmed  that they have taken control of al-Waht, so that Aden is now  within range of their artillery. What information do you have?    [Jazulit] First of all, as you might have heard, there is a  batch of tanks leaving their base in the direction of the  al-'Anad area. As for the information you have, I cannot  confirm it either way. All we know is that fierce battles are  continuing on all the fronts, with the exception of the Abyan  axis. If it is true that this area has fallen, we will visit it  tomorrow to confirm it.    ['Awn] Some Yemeni officials have been touring the Gulf  states. The most recent has been by Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas to Qatar. Is Aden expecting recognition from the Gulf?    [Jazulit] First of all, I wish to tell you that Engineer  Haydar al-'Attas arrived at Aden airport this evening at around  2130 Aden time. He was accompanied by 'Abd-al-Qawi al-Makkawi,  who is considered a member of the Presidential Council in the  new state here in Aden. He was received by the vice president  and a group of Yemeni Socialist Party members. Upon his  arrival, I spoke to him. He confirmed two facts: First, that the  Arab Gulf states understand very well the crisis Yemen is going  through. He also affirmed that he is expecting recognition of  their new state soon by the Arabian Gulf states.    ['Awn] As you know Tawfiq, the members of the Security  Council are holding consultations tonight to stop the fighting  in Yemen and find a formula for a solution. What does Aden  expect the international community to do for it?    [Jazulit] I think that Aden believes international  interests, and Western ones in particular, will soon be in  danger since the war has now developed into a war of attrition.  Proceeding from this perspective, I know that Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Dali, who was accompanying the southern Yemeni prime minister  during his tour of the Arabian Gulf states, did not return to  Aden but left directly from Qatar for New York to participate in  developments in the United Nations' corridors. The new prime  minister here in Aden told me that they are very optimistic that  a resolution will be issued stipulating the need to stop all  fighting in Yemen.    ['Awn] Tawfiq, thank you. We will stay in touch with for  further details.    [Jazulit] Thank you.</p>

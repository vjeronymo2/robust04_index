			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The participants in the fourth congress of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Presov have sent an  open letter to Slovak President Michal Kovac. More from Martin  Dorazin:    [Dorazin] We ask you to reassess your membership in the  HZDS,  states the letter addressed to Michal Kovac. Among other  things, the letter from the congress of the strongest Slovak  opposition party recalls that the current president used to be a  leading representative of the HZDS, which nominated him to the  Federal Assembly, later on as the assembly's chairman and then  as president of the Slovak Republic.    The congress regrets having come to the conclusion that  Michal Kovac has interrupted the continuity of the HZDS program.  The HZDS can no longer support Kovac in the office of president  of the Republic because of the way he carries out his  presidential duties, because of the attempt to cause the HZDS's  disintegration, and because of an unjustifiable attitude toward  the government that founded the state, and for other reasons.  This is all in the open letter. [passage omitted]</p>

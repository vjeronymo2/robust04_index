			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Caught in a double bind: A lack of capital for small businesses in the UK could lead to a joyless economic recovery Rarely has it been so uncomfortable, in business, to be small. That much is clear from the huge provisions announced over the past fortnight by the British clearing banks against their lending to small companies. While British Gas was able to raise Pounds 400m in the bond markets this week at the drop of a hat, small borrowers lucky enough to have survived thus far in the recession have been warned, in a recent speech by Midland Bank's chief executive Mr Brian Pearse, that they are a poor commercial proposition for the banks. Given that small firms play a disproportionate part in job creation, bankerly restraint in the sector could point to a joyless economic recovery. In the UK, small firms are suffering a far worse fate than in the recession of the early 1980s. Then, the squeeze was transmitted through an overvalued exchange rate, so that the recession was largely confined to the tradeable goods sector of the economy. Today, in contrast, the damage has been done by high interest rates, as well as by the exchange rate, with the result that purely domestic businesses in the service sector have been savaged as well. Now that rates have fallen and sterling has come out of the European exchange rate mechanism, many small businessmen complain that they are being squeezed in other ways, as the banks increase charges for each and every service. In an emotive debate, marked by claim and counter-claim, banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland have not helped their case by offering bonus schemes for employees who find ways of burdening clients with new fees. But the more fundamental question is whether a credit crunch in small business poses a wider threat to the economy. A credit crunch is a controversial concept. Bankers are usually reluctant to admit that they are turning down creditworthy customers. They are prone to ask: how can credit be scarce if interest rates are falling? That rhetorical question does not, of course, preclude the possibility of a crunch in individual sectors of the economy; and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that in the over-indebted economies of the US, Britain and Japan there has been a real constraint on lending to property and small business. It should, nonetheless, be common ground that bankers are nervous about the pricing of their loans both to property and small business in relation to the perceived risks. They also feel an urgent need to rebuild their capital after the huge losses they have incurred in these areas. That need is made more pressing by the new capital ratio requirements of the Bank for International Settlements - the introduction of which could hardly have been worse timed for recovery. Similarly, it is beyond dispute that the response of both consumers and businessmen to an overhang of debt is one of extreme caution before borrowing further. The result is that corporate finance has become polarised as never before between big and small companies. The cost of capital is now falling sharply across the developed world as bond prices soar, causing yields to fall (see chart). The equity markets are following suit; and in the English-speaking economies, big companies are enthusiastically raising fresh equity and debt. Since they are often more creditworthy than their bankers, it also pays them to issue short-term IOUs directly in the markets instead of borrowing from banks. In contrast, small businesses, which are excluded from the capital markets, are caught in a double bind. Not only are the banks disenchanted with them. The property collateral that underpins so much small firm borrowing is shrinking because property is the other big source of bankerly disenchantment. The message in this for the UK is that a credit crunch will not be a constraint on any export-led recovery, since it is the larger manufacturing companies that spearhead the export effort. But there will certainly be a problem for job creation, because higher productivity in manufacturing means that jobs are less easily generated there than in services. Normally, the higher disposable incomes generated by productivity improvement in manufac-turing would benefit the service economy. But if the banks have pulled in their horns, the benefit will be less than it should be. In one sense, this is simply a new version of an old British problem. When the Bolton committee produced its report on small firms in 1971, it found that the small business sector in Britain was in a deeper decline than in any other industrialised country. Things appeared to improve in the 1980s when there was a sharp upturn in small business formation and much talk of an entrepreneurial culture. And indeed, between 1980 and late 1992 the service sector, which includes most small businesses, was the exclusive generator of new employment in the economy, producing more than 1.5m net new jobs. During that time small business increased its share of all employment from 59.6 per cent to 71.6 per cent, while manufacturing declined from 30.3 per cent to 21.2 per cent. Within that shift, Whitehall estimates that small business created around 1m jobs in the second half of the 1980s. Yet on closer examination, the striking thing about the figures is that the service industries that generated the biggest job growth were not ones in which small business was obviously predominant. Banking, finance and insurance produced the largest number of jobs (see chart) at 1.1m, which owes much to the sharp growth in tradeable financial services in large institutions in the City of London. Healthcare, chiefly the National Health Service, was the next biggest identifiable sub-sector, accounting for jobs growth of a further 500,000. Only in the next fastest-growing sector - hotels and catering  - which added 390,000 jobs, did the small business sector make a significant contribution through family-owned hotels and restaurants. This looks paltry when compared with the US, even allowing for the fact that the US economy is six or seven times bigger at today's exchange rates. There, new start-ups alone created 12m jobs in the 1980s and the service sector produced 20m jobs overall. In continental Europe, small business has long been more vibrant than in the UK. The Mittelstand, Germany's small to medium-sized business sector, is the backbone of its tradeable goods sector. Private Italian family business is a principal component in Italy's export success. It seems probable that in Britain in the 1990s the banking constraint is squeezing a sector that remains weak by the standards of the rest of the developed world. What can be done to mitigate the damage? The obvious immediate remedy is to follow the US precedent, whereby the Federal Reserve has helped restore the profitability of the banking system by encouraging banks to expand their holdings of government bonds. If the yield curve is reasonably steep, with a large gap between short-term money market rates and longer-term bond rates, banks can borrow cheaply and invest profitably in Treasury paper at a higher rate. This has already put much of the US banking system back on its feet and helped restore bank capital. The trouble with this approach in Britain is that the yield curve is not as steep as the banks might wish and the risks are higher. The US banks are borrowing short and lending to the government a little longer. This, in bankerly argot, constitutes maturity transformation: the mismatching of the respective maturities of assets and liabilities. If short-term interest rates rise unexpectedly, the banks would incur losses. The risk has not been great in the US because the Fed clearly indicated that the enhancement of bank profits was an implicit goal of its monetary policy. But in Britain the Bank of England, unlike its US counterpart, regards the government's own debt as carrying an element of risk for the purposes of calculating bank capital ratios. And not without justice, particularly today, when monetary policy is in such a muddle. Conflicting signals emerge from Number 10 Downing Street, the Treasury and the Bank of England, and the markets show the utmost scepticism about all official pronouncements. As yet the banks and building societies still hold only 6 per cent of the outstanding stock in the gilts market. While the figure seems likely to rise, it will probably take significantly lower short-term rates to make the yield curve look more tempting to the banks. Even then, it seems unlikely that British bank holdings of government paper will approach US levels because the risks are simply too high. It follows that other approaches will need to be explored. Mr Pearse of Midland Bank has put forward a thoughtful agenda, which includes proposals for reducing small companies' overdependence on short-term debt and encouraging the provision of more equity capital to small business. It is hard to quarrel with either point. As the chart shows, the financial problem for British businesses is not that balance sheets are overburdened with debt. British companies borrow less than most - although the government's loan guarantee scheme has encouraged smaller businesses to overborrow. The trouble is that, whenever a promising generation of businesses emerges, an exaggerated boom-bust cycle always wipes out the potential equivalent of Germany's Mittelstand. All history suggests that the only sensible way to make financial plans for a small business in Britain is to assume that, when Mr Major next reshuffles his cabinet, he will find a worthy successor to Maudling, Barber and Lawson to embark on yet another dash for growth, and that the next grinding change of monetary gear will take place in the second half of the 1990s. Against such a background, overdraft finance leaves businesses too vulnerable to panicky bankers. Hence the case for longer-term financing. Equity, meantime, provides a cushion against monetary volatility. The snag is that small business entrepreneurs are notoriously reluctant to permit outside interference in their business and equally unhappy to cede any degree of control over the equity capital. So it will take a big change in small business attitudes, as well as a change in financing habits, to deal with this Achilles' heel of the British economy. A stable monetary environment would be infinitely preferable to a panoply of government loan schemes, fiscal incentives for equity investment and the rest. But Britain's remaining small businesses will doubtless feel, by now, that such stability is too much to hope for.</p>

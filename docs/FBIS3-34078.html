Sources close to the Rafsanjani wing have said that the  Iranian president was hoping that the amnesty -- coupled with  new measures to ease the restrictions imposed on cultural  activities -- would help Iran to improve its image with regard  to its human right records. But its seems that Khamene'i took  the advice of hard-line factions opposed to any "sign of  weakness."    Rafsanjani suffered another setback yesterday when the  Majles  Financial Committee announced its disapproval of the  government's proposal to increase petrol prices from 250 riyals  to 600 riyals -- an increase of 22 cents.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has left on a  three-day official visit to Moscow as part of regular  Greek-Russian political contacts. During his visit in the  Russian capital, the Greek foreign minister will meet with his  Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, and discuss the improvement  of bilateral trade and economic relations, the Bosnian crisis,  and the Balkan situation.    Shortly before his departure from the eastern terminal of  Ellinikon Airport, the foreign minister told correspondents: I  can only stress once again the importance of this visit. Our  relations with Russia are excellent. I believe that we have  quite a few questions on bilateral relations to discuss in a  positive context and promote them. Mr. Papoulias added: I  refer to natural gas and the oil pipeline. If we reach an  agreement on these, and I am certain that we will, they will be  two important projects for Greece's economy as well as for  Greek-Russian economic relations.    The foreign minister added: Of course, Russia is playing a  pioneer role in the peace process for the former Yugoslavia.  Many of our own positions are similar to those of Russian  foreign policy. I believe that we will hold detailed discussions  and that we will probably undertake joint initiatives, such as  convening again the five-member conference between the United  States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the European Union's  troika, which was held in Geneva on 13 May.</p>

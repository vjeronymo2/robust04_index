			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Nonfunctional Parliament"] </F>   [Text] Vranov nad Toplou -- The developments leading to  the dismissal of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet, the causes of the  dismissal, and the current political situation in Slovakia were  the topics discussed by Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], at a rally with  the citizens of Vranov nad Toplou yesterday.    He said that the Meciar government could not concentrate  forces on completing its program because, among other things,  "Slovak President Michal Kovac complicated the situation by his  speech in parliament [on 9 March] when he confused his  jurisdiction and started enforcing a tough policy."    The NRSR chairman went on to say that, with one or two  exceptions such as the law on levying a value-added tax of 26  percent on selected types of goods, which has been prepared by  Jozef Moravcik's government, the laws being currently adopted in  parliament were mostly prepared by Meciar's cabinet. He  stressed that the current parliament is no longer able to make  unanimous progressive decisions and that conflicts and  disagreements prevail in it.</p>

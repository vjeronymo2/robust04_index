			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Josefa Bussi] </F>   [Text] The highest government and party leaders have said  that 1993 was the most difficult year for our country. The lack  or absence of basic products and services and the excess of  currency, among other problems, affected the people and boosted  black market activities, discouraged people from going to work,  and created an overall high degree of social indiscipline. As a  result of this and other problems, by mid 1993 the difficulties  worsened and crime, in all its forms, increased, as did enemy  activities and vandalism. In light of this situation, the  mechanisms of the Sole Surveillance and Revolutionary  Combativeness System were reactivated at all levels.    In Havana, where more than 30 percent of the crime occurs,  more than 2,700 citizens were arrested, representing more than  84 percent of the cases brought to trial. One of the most  frequent crimes that affected the people the most was the  stealing of bicycles. The number of these crimes has dropped  significantly, especially in Havana Province, City of Havana  Province, Sancti Spiritus Province, and Matanzas Province.  According to specialists of the National Revolutionary Police  General Directorate, the number of crimes, such as assaults,  forceful entry, and cattle rustling, and other economic crimes,  has dropped. Likewise, homicide and assaults have decreased.    Although, after analyzing some of the statistics resulting  from the work done by the Sole Surveillance System with the  support of the people, we cannot say that there has been a  decrease in crime, I do agree with the specialists that criminal  activity has been curbed and that the people are more secure.    We are beginning 1994, a year in which the causes for crime  will continue. Therefore, it has become necessary that in  addition to the preventive and coercive measures being  implemented, the causes for crimes be pinpointed and alleviated  so that the revolutionary and hard working Cuban people will  remain secure, something to which they have been accustomed for  the past 30 years.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Tory Euro-rebels snub ministers' appeals MR JOHN MAJOR was braced for two days of frantic campaigning yesterday after forecasts from Tory Euro-sceptics and independent bodies found some 35 rebels still pledged to oppose him or abstain in Wednesday's Maastricht debate. The findings underlined the uncertainty of the outcome in what is increasingly being seen as a crucial test of the prime minister's credibility and his ability to command party respect. Several loyalist Tory MPs have publicly expressed broad agreement with Labour that Mr Major's authority would be critically damaged if he loses the debate - even if the government goes on to win a confidence vote. If all 35 potential rebels vote against the motion, Mr Major would face the real possibility of defeat. However, it would only need a few rebels to abstain for the government to win by a narrow margin. After a weekend of frenetic behind-the-scenes activity by government whips, the crisis atmosphere was fuelled yesterday by dire warnings from cabinet ministers and a ferocious row over tactics between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Early yesterday, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, used an interview with TV-am to insist that Conservative MPs would be 'playing with fire' if they put the government at risk. His message was repeated by Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary. In a clear warning to the rebels, he said: 'If they think the government can just be defeated on Wednesday and everything will just settle down the following day  -it won't' Meanwhile, Labour was raising the pressure on the Liberal Democrats by warning that their support for the government would rebound when public expenditure cuts are announced next week. In a statement, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, warned that voters would not forgive the Liberal Democrats if they 'propped up' the prime minister. 'If he wins next week's vote, John Major will have a mandate to go ahead with the public spending cuts which he denied would be made,' she said. The charge drew a furious retort from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who described Labour's decision to oppose the Maastricht motion as 'a tawdry deceit'. Claiming the Liberal Democrats were putting the interests of the nation first, he argued that if the government was defeated it would immediately win in a confidence motion. 'So we would be left with the worst of all possible worlds - no general election and no future for Britain in Europe either,' he said. The idea of Britain working in collaboration with Europe was the main message of Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as both attempted yesterday to stress the importance of ratification for the economy. In an article in the News of the World, the prime minister claimed that Community membership had brought 'a tidal wave of job-creating foreign investment', adding that it would be a disastrous mistake for Britain to walk away from it. Leading Tory Euro-sceptics, however, were confident there was no erosion of their support. Mr James Cran, an unofficial 'whip' for the rebels, said that 37 MPs remained ready to oppose the government's motion. 'They have been subject to a lot of pressure in their constituencies and elsewhere, but they are not prepared to move,' he said. A BBC poll of 70 possible rebels found that 36 MPs are ready to oppose or abstain. Page 8 Tory rebels firm on vote Business backs Maastricht agreement Editorial Comment Page 16</p>

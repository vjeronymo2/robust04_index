			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Mandarins try to please the critics The Treasury has traditionally been the most powerful - and most often criticised - of all government departments. For many its role in economic policy-making is both outdated and inefficient. Seen in that light yesterday's proposals are the mandarins' attempt to redefine their role for the modern era, before less sympathetic members of the government do it for them. The department has always been a peculiarly British institution, with a monopoly on all aspects of national economic management not seen elsewhere. Most other countries tend to divide economic policy-making between a finance ministry, an economics ministry and a separate budget office for the control of public spending. The Treasury combines all three roles, as well as managing civil service pay, regulating financial services and preparing economic forecasts. There has been a long-running debate about whether so much power should be concentrated in the hands of one ministry. Mr Harold (now Lord) Wilson, for one, attempted to hive off some of its functions to a new Department of Economic Affairs in 1964 but was eventually forced to return to the old system after vigorous Treasury resistance. In spite of the Treasury winning these and other battles with individual governments, three broad criticisms of its performance have refused to go away. The first is that its power has given it much of the responsibility for the damaging 'boom and bust' cycles of UK economic activity since the early 1970s. Two humiliating events are particularly associated with Treasury mistakes - the recourse to the International Monetary Fund in 1976 and sterling's departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in September of 1992. Second, business leaders and others complain of the Treasury's 'anti-industry culture', blaming Treasury tax and spending decisions for the declining competitiveness of UK manufacturing. Third, and perhaps most relevant to yesterday's review, is the accusation that the Treasury has a penny-pinching, short-termist and interfering approach to the work of other government departments. Losing control of public spending in the 1970s was a scarring experience. Many officials drew the lesson that they would have to involve themselves more deeply in every layer of government to ensure that public spending never again spiralled out of control. The upshot, however, is that the Treasury now tries to shadow officials in other departments, duplicating their activities unnecessarily and, according to many civil servants, too often meddling in their decisions. If sterling's exit from the ERM cast doubt on the Treasury's capacity for macroeconomic management, the civil service reforms of the Major government have put a question mark over the Treasury's capacity for this kind of microeconomic supervision. Yesterday's proposals indicate that the department has seen the need to reappraise its activities in light of recent experience. The increasing decentralisation of public-sector pay bargaining and the more powerful position which the Bank of England has acquired in the past two years might mean that the Treasury cannot hope to continue performing all its traditional functions. But Sir Terry Burns, its permanent secretary, believes the Treasury's more all-encompassing conception can be defended. The department must change, but Sir Terry believes that reform need not imply a pared-down ministry along the lines of a Continental-style finance ministry. He believes that, in spite of recent events, the Treasury should not remodel itself as merely the finance department of UK plc. Rather, it must remain the head office for the economy. Sir Terry outlined this vision of the Treasury in a speech given earlier this year. The great advantage which the Treasury had, he said, lay in its freedom from outside pressures in its analysis of government activities. 'Most departments have their own special interest groups and serving those groups can inhibit them in their attitude to change. The Treasury, by contrast, serves no special interest group, which gives it the freedom to promote change and to protect the dispersed interests of consumers and taxpayers.' Yesterday saw the Treasury apply both these precepts to its own activities. It remains to be seen whether the new arrangement will satisfy the critics.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina under the heading "Contacts": </F> "The Border as a Region of Cooperation: That Is What the Border  Guards of Russia and China Want"]    [Text] Local Russian contacts between border guard  districts and military and border guard structures in the  People's Republic of China regarding protection of the state  border, underway for several years already, now require the  involvement of central ministries. Resolution of the political  and professional matters that have arisen in the process of  establishing a system for protection of the state border was the  subject of an initial visit by a delegation of senior members of  the General Staff (the agency which, together with the PRC  Ministry of Public Security, deals with border protection  matters) to Moscow, where talks are underway with the Russian  Federal Border Guard Service.    At a joint press conference held at the conclusion of the  first stage of the Russo-Chinese talks, Col. Gen. Andrey  Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of border guards and head of the  Russian Federation Federal Border Guard Service, and Maj. Gen.  Kui Fulin, assistant chief of the General Staff, Chinese  People's Liberation Army, were unanimous in the opinion that  "the borders between the great countries of Russia and China  must become a region of peace and cooperation." In order to make  that wish a reality it will be necessary to sign bilateral  agreements at the level of border guard agencies and  governmental structures in both states (primarily at issue is  protection of the eastern sector of the Russian border and the  Kirghiz and Tajik sectors of the CIS border). The Russian side,  according to Col. Gen. Nikolayev, is prepared to present its  packet of proposals during a visit to China by Russian head of  government Chernomyrdin. The Chinese delegation, elaborately  noting the "great amount of time required for documents to move  through official agencies in China" is not at all inclined to  link its efforts with that high-level guest's visit to China.    The main focus of concern for border guard administrations  in  both states should be the establishment of a "civilized" border  guard regime along the so-called first and second lines, i.e. at  the border crossing level, with the number of crossing points  commensurate to the region's economic needs. Consideration  should also be given to professional contacts between Russian  and Chinese border guard structures in the Russian Federation's  Pacific, Far Eastern and Transbaikal border guard districts and  China's corresponding border guard provinces with regard to  interdiction of violations of the state border, for the purpose  of combatting organized crime in both countries.    In the opinion of Andrey Nikolayev the negotiations on  reduction of arms and armed forces and on confidence-building  measures and demarcation work along the Chinese-Russian border  that are being conducted between diplomatic ministries in the  Russian Federation and the PRC attest to the normal relations  between our countries, and Russia's border guards are prepared  to reinforce and expand those diplomatic successes. It did not  seem that their Chinese colleagues had any objection to doing  so, either.</p>

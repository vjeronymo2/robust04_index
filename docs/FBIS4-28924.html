			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam is emerging as a potential competitor to  Thailand in attracting investment in production facilities by  auto manufacturers looking for countries to relocate to, an  analyst said.    Thailand may lose its competitive edge to Vietnam due to the  latter country's low property and labour costs, and the abundant  natural resources there.    The analyst suggested that Thailand will have to develop its  auto industry in order to maintain its competitiveness.    "The development of manpower technology and marketing, for  continuous growth in this industry, needs to be taken seriously  if Thailand is to remain the largest auto production base in  Asean," the analyst said.    Vietnam has the potential of be coming a very large market  as  the country has a population of 70 million people but only  200,000 cars. The increasing buying power of the Vietnamese will  present a great marketing opportunity for Thailand, he continued.    At present, Thailand's auto industry is more competitive  than  ever after the lifting of the high tariff on imported cars by  the government in 1992. The lowering of the tariffs awakened  local producers after 30 years of protection to the fact that  they have to fight to keep their market, which in turn has led  to healthy competition.    The liberalization the country's auto industry has  benefitted  Thai consumers, as they now have a larger selection of cars to  choose from at more competitive prices.    When the tariffs first came down domestic auto makers seemed  uneasy with the government's measures, but they've managed to  adjust themselves to the changing environment.    In the past few years, we've also seen changes in the  automobile industry as a whole. Giant auto makers such as  General Motors, are planing to invest in production plant here  again; General Motors left Thailand in 1978.    The American auto maker, in a joint-venture, is planning to  build the largest auto plant in Asia, reflecting the market  potential of Thailand.    The Japanese auto makers, not to be outdone, are also  planning to invest in assembly plants here with a combined  production capacity of up to 600,000 cars a year by 1996, which  is considerably higher than the current 460,000 cars per year.    Toyota is also planning to turn out 200,000 cars per year by  1996 with a new plant located at the Gateway Industrial estate.  The plant will be the company's largest one outside Japan and  will require an investment of Bt [baht] 1 billion.    These manufacturers recognise the potential growth in the  country's automobile industry, but for Japan the relocation is  partly due to the strength of the yen against other currencies.    The growth of the domestic auto market stemmed from the rise  of the middle-classes and the lack of a mass transit system in  Bangkok.    Auto sales in 1992 totalled 456,000, a jump of 26 per cent  from the previous year. Experts say sales growth targets are  expected to decrease but the sale of 500,000 cars is not an  unattainable goal, even though interest rates and gasoline  prices are on the rise.    Auto makers are planning to make Thailand an export base,  but  exporting won't be easy since they will have to produce at least  one million cars per year in order to achieve sufficient  economies of scale to reduce production costs. Korea had  developed the capacity to produce two million cars when it first  began to export.    In order for Thailand to become an export base, the industry  needs to develop its manpower, technology and supporting  industries, such as electronic parts production and plastic and  aluminum production, as these are all needed by the automobile  industry.</p>

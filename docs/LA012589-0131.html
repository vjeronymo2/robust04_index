			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Richard V. Rupp's habit of picking up trade publications and other reference  materials in the insurance field has led to another new business -- an  insurance library.  </P> <P> Rupp decided recently to get out of his risk management consulting business in  Costa Mesa to become a full-time employee of Earthquake Mutual Insurance Co.,  which he formed a year ago to provide low-priced earthquake insurance coverage.  </P> <P> But he had to do something with the 1,200-square-foot library he had built up  over the years. So he formed Rupp Risk Management Resource Center, which will  operate under the direction of his wife, Coleen A. Mulhern.  </P> <P> The library contains about 90 trade journals, 900 reference books, 26 principal  insurance subject categories with more than 2,500 specific subject files,  special reports and access to a computer information retrieval system.  </P> <P> The library, which Rupp believes is the West Coast's largest library devoted to  insurance matters, will handle research for insurers, large corporations,  accountants, lawyers and other risk management consultants.  </P> <P> Rupp hopes to attract professionals to the library with annual subscriber fees  of $600.  </P></p>

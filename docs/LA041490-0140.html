			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DROWNED WOMAN HAD DIED 2 HOURS BEFORE BODY FOUND  </P> <P> A 36-year-old woman found at the bottom of a back-yard swimming pool Thursday  had been dead for about two hours before a neighbor discovered her body,  officials said Friday.  </P> <P> A 2-year-old boy, who was secure in a floating ring, was in the pool at the  time Martha Munoz-Lemus drowned, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson  said.  </P> <P> The boy's cries drew the attention of a neighbor, who looked over the fence and  saw Munoz-Lemus on the bottom of the pool behind the two-story residence in the  25000 block of Owens Lake Circle in El Toro. The neighbor called 911.  </P> <P> An autopsy revealed that Munoz-Lemus of Mexico died about 4 p.m. Thursday, more  than two hours before paramedics were called. She was found wearing a shirt and  shorts, not swimming attire, a coroner's deputy said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's investigators consider the case closed. "As far as we're concerned,  it's a nonsuspicious death," Olson said.  </P> <P> Mark Burnett, the owner of the house, said Munoz-Lemus was a friend of the  family who occasionally cared for his 2-year-old son.  </P></p>

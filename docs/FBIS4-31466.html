			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 9 (CTK) -- Deputy Chairman of the  coalition Christian Democratic Party [KDS] Vaclav Benda  considers speculation about his possible expulsion from the  party or dismissal as deputy chairman "inflated and  unrealistic." In an interview with CTK today, Benda said he did  not believe that by his statement on NOVA Television in which he  described Augusto Pinochet as a "brave man" he had harmed the  interests of his party. "Moreover, because of this statement new  people have joined our party," he said.    Benda said he had invited General Pinochet for lunch with  the  awareness of the KDS Political Council and that "not one  objection against such an approach was raised" at a council  meeting, he added. "When I told the meeting that if I were  chairman I would recommend a meeting with Pinochet, KDS Chairman  Ivan Pilip said in a very resolute manner that he was naturally  also for Pinochet and had no objections whatsoever against such  a meeting," Benda said, when asked whether he had discussed the  whole matter with Pilip.    Benda said he had realised from the very beginning the  "political risk of the whole operation" and had chosen such an  approach out of moral rather than political reasons. He said he  had expected at least 83-percent disapproval and was pleasantly  surprised by the extent of support and solidarity he was  receiving from individuals and organisations.    Benda admitted that the KDS Executive Committee would  discuss  the matter at its meeting on Saturday and did not rule out that  some kind of stand would be taken there. He said that the  course of the meeting would show the level of support he enjoyed  among KDS members.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Europe's changing cities: Dreams of leaving Lisbon's slums - The government and the city council have agreed a plan to rehouse all shanty-dwellers Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses, sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi-storey shopping centre. Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug-takers looking for supplies. One long-standing resident, Mrs Maria Leonor, 32, lives here with her family of seven in a one-room dwelling made by her husband, a street vendor, by nailing rough pieces of timber to wooden struts. The city council gave them the boards and nails after a fire destroyed their previous shanty home in 1985. Mrs Leonor is out of work and has never learnt to read or write. She points up stone steps strewn with rubbish to the tap where she fetches water. Three men facing a nearby wall look round furtively as they inject themselves in the forearms. This is Casal Ventoso, acknowledged by Portuguese officials as one of the worst slums in western Europe. Mrs Leonor's home is just one of 38,000 shanty dwellings in Portugal, housing an estimated 43,000 families. Most of them share one ambition: 'I just want to move out into a home that is safe for my children.' Little has been done to alleviate the plight of shanty dwellers since bairros de lata - 'tin-can quarters' - first appeared in Portugal almost a century ago. But the centre-right government is now embarking on an ambitious Es270bn (Pounds 1bn) programme to eradicate shanty towns and rehouse their occupants before the end of the century. 'The shanties prick at the conscience of the whole nation,' says Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and telecommunications. 'No other country at the same level of development as Portugal suffers from this shameful problem.' Under the plan, the government will pay for the construction of new homes and local authorities, most of which are controlled by the opposition Socialist party, will administer them and subsidise rents according to the occupiers' means. Most shanty dwellers pay no rent and low, if any, utility bills. Migration from the rural interior to Lisbon and Oporto produced many of the existing bairros de lata in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the workers who built Lisbon's April 25 suspension bridge, which opened in 1966, still live in nearby shanty towns. Others, like Pedreiro dos Hungaros to the west of Lisbon, are populated by immigrants from Portugal's former African colonies, mainly the Cape Verde islands. The atmosphere is more convivial here than in Casal Ventoso, but conditions are just as bad. Several factors foment the building of shanty towns. Portugal has no pool of low-rent, state-owned housing. The private rent market was undermined by a 40-year rent freeze that discouraged owners from renting out properties and is only now slowly being re-animated. And taxes amounting to more than half the cost of a house help put buying a home beyond the reach of many low-wage earners. More than 5,000 shanty dwellings have been destroyed in Lisbon since a coalition of Socialists and Communists won control of the city council in 1989. This month, the government and the council agreed on a Es72bn programme to build 11,129 houses to rehouse all the families in the city still in shanty towns. Most will be moved into apartment buildings. And surveys among residents dismiss as sentimental myth the opinion that they will miss the open-air life, vegetable plots, chicken runs and community spirit of the bairros de lata. 'We're not aware of a single person who would rather stay in a shanty town than move into a flat,' says Mr Vasco Franco, the Lisbon city councillor responsible for the rehousing programme. But Mr Franco fears that the pressures that led to the growth of the shanty towns will continue and possibly increase. Many construction workers will be attracted to the capital by an extensive infrastructure programme, including the building of a new bridge over the Tagus river, the Expo '98 international exhibition and the housing programme itself. The city council demolishes every new shanty dwelling that appears, currently at a rate of four of five a day. But other forms of cheap accommodation are taking their place. 'There are small apartments in Lisbon where up to 20 people sleep in rows of bunk beds, paying by the night,' says Mr Franco. 'The only lasting solution to the problem is for the state to invest in building a large pool of accessibly-priced homes.'</p>

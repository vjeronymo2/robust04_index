			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: SE looks at small companies THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday announced a 16-person working party with a wide brief to look at all aspects of how small companies raise capital. The group has been assembled following the decision last month to keep alive the Unlisted Securities Market for smaller companies for a short period, rather than close it this year. The group has been asked to 'define the scope of the financing problem, assess potential investor interest and recommend whether or not an alternative market is the right solution,' the Exchange said. It will be headed by Mr Ian Macpherson, a member of the Exchange's board and chairman of Low &amp; Bonar and Watson &amp; Philip, both listed companies. It includes a number of members of the City Group for Smaller Companies, a pressure group of financiers, brokers and others whose efforts have been instrumental in persuading the Exchange not to close the USM immediately. Mr Macpherson said that his group would look at all aspects of capital raising by small companies.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Error to abolish House of Lords - but reform another matter Sir, Roland Rudd's article advocating the abolition of the House of Lords is misconceived ('Time to go, m'lords', August 25). The great advantage of the House of Lords is that its members are free to speak their minds and are mostly not politicians. It is not an 'accident' that such a group is often better informed and makes wiser decisions than the House of Commons. To abolish such a valuable institution for reasons of prejudice would be a grave error. But reform is a different matter. To make it completely democratic all that is needed is a modest adjustment to the voting system used in the upper house. Each peer would have a number of 'shares' which would be the total number of votes cast for his or her party at the last general election, divided by the number of peers who are members of that party. The votes of abstainers would be divided equally between the independent peers. This would combine the benefits of proportional representation with the advantages of an independent-minded and knowledgeable second chamber, using a system familiar to all shareholders and company directors. Combined with the nostalgic appeal for ennobled former trades union leaders, its attractions should be irresistible. Nicholas Beale, 3 Berkeley Square, London, W1X 5HG</p>

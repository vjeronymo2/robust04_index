			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: A history lesson in contemporary paint - Two intelligent exhibitions which claim for art a conscious political and social position Two stimulating London shows complement each other neatly, perhaps because each is the work of that very smart curator, Maureen Paley. In Symptoms of Interference, Conditions of Possibility at the Camden Arts Centre, she has brought together work by Ad Reinhardt, Joseph Kosuth and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, offering a history lesson which provides a valuable foundation from that to explore Wall to Wall, a three-venue show of wall painted works that opens at the Serpentine Gallery. The Camden show illustrates the interrelation between three generations of radical American artists. In the two years before his death in 1967, Ad Reinhardt, America's first purely abstract artist, famous for his 'Black Paintings', met Joseph Kosuth, born in 1947 and one of the first conceptual artists, who acknowledged his formative influence just as Felix Gonzalez-Torres, born in 1957 and too young to have known Reinhardt, acknowledges that of both. All three share a belief in the power of art to make profound, and profoundly political, statements. Ad Reinhardt's was the dissenting voice as abstract expressionism triumphed in the US after the war, arguing that art should be generated in and of itself, following its own laws and disdaining the pressures of the market. Reinhardt's intellectual purism was grounded in political radicalism: during the 1940s, he drew cartoons for the socialist publications The New Masses and PM. 'People are blocked from understanding and enjoying modern art because someone, somewhere, got the notion that an 'artist' was a 'picture maker'', the cartoon entitled 'How to look at an artist', drawn for PM in 1946, declares. He proved his point with the 'Black Paintings', three of which, from 1953, 1962 and 1966, are shown. Here are 'pictures' of nothing, their beauty the delicate interplay of black against black. For Kosuth, life was more complicated. The relative simplicity of Reinhardt's oppositional stance was no longer effective in the 1960s against an art market capable of transforming the most radical art into desirable commodities. Kosuth began to experiment with ways of making the questioning of the artistic process part of the way an art work is perceived. He began to make art out of words. Simple at first, photocopied extracts from dictionaries, for example, the works became more and more complicated, the range of source material spreading from philosophy to the popular press. At Camden, Kosuth shows 'the Thing in-it-self is found in its Truth through the loss of its immediacy' an installation made with blown up photographs of newspaper clippings. First shown at Leo Castelli in New York last year, it has been reworked to include texts from English newspapers, hung head high around a room, juxtaposed with cartoons, photographs and quotations from Kafka. Walking into a room lined with words and blurry blown up newsprint images, the effect is surreal: their increased scale and careful grouping demand a more searching scrutiny than the swift scan that is their usual lot. Now, the crazy cast, which could have been dismissed with an uncomfortable glance as the page was turned (dead drunk Serbian snipers, Lorena Bobbit the penis severer, Boy George in a hat adorned with horns shaking hands with Yitzhak Shamir), gaze out in silent witness that meaning is something that must be constructed, not simply as-sumed. Gonzalez-Torres has the lightest touch. His politics seem more personal, his inclusion of the audience more gentle - he piles up sweets on the gallery floor in 'Untitled (Public Opinion)' and invites them to help themselves, stacks blank black photocopies in a pile and calls it 'Party Platform', makes small, black, pictures-with-words like miniature Kosuths where names and dates - Pol Pot 1975, Prague 1968, Robocop 1987 - wait for the viewer to make the connection, the human response that brings the meaning alive. The spectator is also required to be alert at the Serpentine, where in Wall to Wall the most successful pieces work like installations, making the fullest use of the space. Lothar Baumgarten's 'Imago Mundi', 1988-89, is best, a political message about the effects of colonialism on the perception of other cultures spread across the elegant entrance hall in juxtaposed names of countries and colours. Michael Craig Martin overwhelms with his wonderful colour, the solitary, carefully painted everyday objects - chair, filing cabinet, book - seeming to hover before their separate walls of vivid blue, green or pink. The rest are weaker stuff, both in concept and execution. Neither show is easy, and each is of the kind - subtle, cerebral, serious in purpose, claiming for art a conscious and engaged social position - now so readily mocked. Tough old Ad Reinhardt, best of the lot, knew how to deal with that sort of thing. One of his cartoons shown at Camden includes two cherubs in conversation. The first says, 'I don't know anything about art but I know what I like.' The second replies, 'Yes, isn't it nice that the obligation to be intelligent doesn't extend to the field of art.' That's telling them, Ad. Symptoms of Interference, Conditions of Possibility; until March 6, Camden Arts Centre, Arkwright Road, London NW3 6DG. Tel 071 435 2643. Wall to Wall, until February 17, Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens, London W2 3XA. Tel 071 402 6075. Continues, with different artists, at Southampton City Art Gallery and Leeds City Art Gallery.</p>

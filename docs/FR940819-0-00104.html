			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Supplemental Carriers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coalition stated that the median flight attendant salary at supplemental air carriers is $18,461. The commenter indicated that this estimate may be high because it represents the average salary at supplemental carriers that have a collective bargaining agreement with their flight attendant workforce. The commenter also stated that the FAA assumed that the rule would lead to the hiring of 6,000 flight attendants at supplemental carriers, and that the additional cost for these new hires would be $1,107,600. The FAA received revised salary information from the commenter stating that the average salary of a flight attendant working for a supplemental carrier is $24,552, which includes $6,092 in benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulatory evaluation assumes that, in the case of supplemental operators, each flight attendant works 150 duty periods, and that a carrier's cost per duty period is $163.68. Therefore, the cost of 6,000 additional duty periods would be $982,100. To the extent practicable, this cost estimate for supplemental operations was used in developing the final regulatory evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Irregular Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delta Air Lines stated that the proposed rule would cause the air carrier to incur costs associated with irregular operations. The air carrier estimated that it would have to hire 36 flight attendants at an annual salary cost of $1.3 million for irregular operations. Other costs associated with hiring additional flight attendants to meet the requirements of the proposed rule, if adopted, would total $2.86 million in the initial year. The recurring annual cost of the proposed rule, if adopted, would be nearly $2.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter stated that, based on operations in June/July 1992 and January/February 1993, 62 flight attendants working together did not meet the requirements of the NPRM and would require crew replacement. The commenter typically schedules flight attendants for 3-day city pairings with an average flight attendant crew of six. Because most of the replacements that were needed were on domestic flights, the commenter used an average of four flight attendants. These results showed that 744 additional duty days would be required. The commenter calculated that an additional 36 flight attendants would be needed because a reserve flight attendant is available to fly an average of 20.5 days per month. Given an average monthly salary of almost $2,500, plus monthly hotel, meal, and transportation expenses of almost $650 for irregular operations, the cost for a flight attendant would be about $3,100 per month, or $1.3 million annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also stated that they do not have a deplaning period. That is, pay and expenses cease at the block-in time of the last flight in the duty period for the trip. This commenter calculates that the cost of a 15-minute deplaning period would result in the hiring of 20 additional flight attendants. The cost would amount to $749,000 annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the commenter provided information documenting the carrier's one-time cost of computer software changes, including recordkeeping. The only additional information is that the cost of programming and testing per man-hour is $40. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received clarification from the commenter stating that ``An Ad Hoc Computer Program was developed to search through our crew tracking systems to identify irregular operations that had occurred that would have required crew replacement under the NPRM.'' The commenter also stated that the NPRM ``Would require crew replacement.'' Finally, the commenter stated that they used an average crew of four flight attendants in their calculations, which implies that they were replacing their existing crew. This leads the FAA to assume that the commenter did not consider crew augmentation. However, the FAA did use some of the salary and cost data provided by the commenter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to hiring additional flight attendants for a 15-minute deplaning period, the FAA notes that there is no new requirement in this rule concerning deplaning; deplaning of the aircraft is a current requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Small Operators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sun Country Airlines operates a fleet of 10 aircraft with 520 employees, 170 of whom are flight attendants. Based on 1992 operations, the proposed rule would have required the commenter to hire 34 additional flight attendants, which would have increased operating costs (i.e., salaries, benefits, costs of training, hotels, meals, deadhead travel, and general administrative overhead) by $2.6 million in 1992. However, this air carrier stated that, by applying crewmember flight, duty, and rest requirements to flight attendants, the air carrier would need to employ 20 additional flight attendants rather than 34 additional flight attendants, with increased operating costs of $1.75 million rather than $2.6 million. However, these lower costs still exceeded the entire 1992 new profit for this carrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Airline Association stated that the proposed rule would either require an additional jump seat in the cabin for which there is insufficient space or it would require that a passenger seat be set aside for the additional flight attendant. This commenter stated that daily or routine loss of a revenue seat on a fleet of regional aircraft with 20 to 50 seats would be enormous. It also pointed out the added costs associated of layover lodging, meals, and per diem, and the significant incremental weight of an added crewmember. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Air Carrier Association stated that the proposed rule would impose costs of approximately $372,000 in additional flight attendant staffing, and approximately $50,000 in recordkeeping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received additional clarification from Sun Country indicating that the proposed rule would cost $2.6 million. The annual cost to deadhead flight attendants to their domicile would be $832,000. In addition, hotel accommodations would be $842,000, added per diem cost would be $308,000, initial and recurrent training would be $10,200, and administrative costs would be $58,000. Because this commenter does not have any interline agreements, it would have to pay the added costs for deadhead tickets. This commenter estimated that these costs would be $579,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon this cost estimate, the cost per added flight attendant would be about $76,500 per flight attendant ($2.6 million divided by 34 additional flight attendants). If this commenter did not have to incur the costs for deadhead tickets, then the added cost would be $60,300 per flight attendant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Menton Shehu: "Questions About Haxhi Lleshi and </F> Sabit Brokaj's Visit to the City of Debar, in Macedonia"]    [Excerpts] At a time when some "blockmen" [high-ranking  members of the former Albanian Workers Party] are being tried in  court for appropriating and squandering the people's wealth, the  newspaper DITA INFORMACION publishes an interview with the  former puppet of the Enver Hoxha government, Haxhi Lleshi. It is  a dirty piece of writing, full of lies and absurd accusations  against democracy and President Sali Berisha. On the basis of  the penal code and the law on the press, this newspaper is being  sequestered while the author of the article, Haxhi Lleshi,  profiting from the indifference of the executor of the law,  leaves the country for Debar. [passage omitted]    After throwing mud, in such a base manner, at the Number-One  figure in the Albanian democratic state, why did Haxhi Lleshi go  to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], specifically, to the city of Debar? From the reports of  well-informed and reliable eyewitnesses, we learn that Haxhi  Lleshi was accompanied on his trip to Debar by an active member  of the extreme left, a member of the leadership of the Socialist  Party, Sabit Brokaj.    During his stay in Debar, Sabit Brokaj kept out of sight,  far  away from the meetings and out of the view of the residents of  Debar. At the wedding of a cousin of H. Lleshi's, where people  were having a good time and Haxhi Lleshi tried to get them to  sing partisan songs and songs in honor of Enver [Hoxha], Mr.  Brokaj was off in a room by himself, far away from the wedding  guests.    Also, during Haxhi Lleshi and Sabit Brokaj's visit to that  city, there was movement of individuals supporting H. Lleshi, in  the direction of Gostivar, Tetovo, Skopje, and Belgrade. Nevzat  Halili, the Macedonian card in the anti-Albanian policy in  Macedonia, was fired. During this time, the Albanian Socialist  Party did not say a thing about the problems and activity of the  PPD [Party for Democratic Prosperity], because, it appears,  things were going just as they had planned in their strategy in  support of the Macedonian social-communists.    The silence was broken and the strategy failed with the  exposure of the Nevzat Halilis, the elements who were sabotaging  the Albanian cause in Macedonia.    In this crisis, specific circles in Macedonia are working  with intensity in two directions. This cannot be done without  the help of others, especially traditional friends. First, with  subversive elements, to extend the crisis of the splitting up of  groupings, to obstruct the rapprochement as long as possible so  as to make it difficult to hold the Congress prior to the  general census which will be held in Macedonia. Therefore,  divide and conquer. Second, to put in the elected forums of the  PPD branches, upto the PPD leadership, Macedonophiles,  supporters of the former UDB [Yugoslav State Security  Administration] in the guise of Albanian nationalism (who, until  now, have remained in the shadows) and who, tomorrow, will  continue the anti-Albanian policy of the Nevzat Halilis.    The PSSh [Albanian Socialist Pary] leadership has a clear  and  concrete political strategy in regard to the ethnic issue in the  Albanian regions in Macedonia, Kosovo, and elsewhere. based on  the political strategy of Enver Hoxha, which it has never  abandoned but which it claims is a taboo in its practice. Haxhi  Lleshi, the son of Halil Lleshi, a sworn Serbophile and  anti-Albanian, is facilitating the progress of the Macedonian  anti-Albanian policy.    There is no shortage of collaborationists to work with the  lynchers of the Albanians. They have been and still are people  without personality, people with narrow interests who, for  various nefarious reasons, have fallen into the swamp of  treason. The people recognized them even though they were  camouflaged and they gave them hatred and contempt as  recompense. The attitude of the citizens of Debar, etc., toward  Haxhi Lleshi, that compromised figure of Enver Hoxha's regime,  is proof of this.</p>

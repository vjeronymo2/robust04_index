			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK utilities The UK water sector currently yields an average 5.8 per cent, a full 1.6 percentage points above the electricity sector. That is because electricity stocks have had such a good run in recent months, outperforming the market by nearly 25 per cent since May. Some investment houses have used the difference in yield to justify recommending their investors to switch from electricity to water. Some shareholders even seem to have heeded their brokers' advice. At the end of last week, the water sector was up 1.7 per cent on the previous Friday's close. The electricity sector was down 3.4 per cent. Such arguments only take into account present yields, not future growth. On that basis, the outlook for the regional electricity companies is better than that for their water counterparts. With ungeared balance sheets, the Recs are looking for ways to hand back their excess cash. There could be further share buy-back schemes or even one-off bumper dividends. The proceeds from next year's National Grid sale could also be redistributed to shareholders. Shares could be marked up in preparation for the end, early next year, of the moratorium on mergers and acquisitions in the sector. In the short term, as the Recs move into the closed period during which they cannot announce share buy-back schemes, their shares look set to underperform. In the long-term, the electricity groups look live-wires, the water stocks stagnant by comparison.</p>

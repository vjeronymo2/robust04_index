			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO BALLOT MEASURES;  </P> <P> FOUR PROPOSITIONS COULD CHANGE FACE OF THE CITY  </P> <P> Unlike several high-profile statewide propositions, the highly visible  governor's race and several unusually tough local races, San Diego voters have  been hearing relatively little about four city ballot propositions that will be  decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> But, despite the low-key campaigns, three of the ballot propositions, if  approved, would have a dramatic effect on San Diego.  </P> <P> * Proposition B would amend the City Charter by increasing the number of seats  on the City Council to 10, up from the current 8. The proposition was placed on  the ballot as part of an agreement that settled a lawsuit brought by the  Chicano Federation.  </P> <P> * Proposition C would create a one-time waiver of the four-year minimum between  reapportionments. If approved, it would provide a one-time waiver to the City  Charter.  </P> <P> * Proposition D would extend a Gann spending-limit waiver passed four years  ago. Most observers believe the proposition, which would not raise taxes, is  the most important ballot issue facing San Diegans because, without it, the  city would be forced to slash spending.  </P> <P> * Proposition E would allow the city to use $25 million in bonds to replace  outdated and overloaded communications systems used by the police and fire  departments. Most opponents tend to agree that the system is needed, but they  argue that the system should have been funded in the upcoming council budget,  not through bonds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gann Limit Waiver  </P> <P> In theory, voters should have relatively little reason to oppose Proposition D,  the Gann spending limit waiver. But, if history is any indication, theory alone  won't help win its battle.  </P> <P> The city's first attempt at winning a Gann spending limit waiver squeaked by  four years ago with just a 510-vote margin, giving the proposition 50.2% of the  vote.  </P> <P> "It won very, very narrowly then, and it's by no means a shoo-in this time,"  said Alice B. McCauly, president of the League of Women Voters of San Diego.  "It's most important, given the budget shortfall, that the city be allowed to  spend what it's (legally) allowed to collect."  </P> <P> McCauly and others have suggested that the low-key local campaign might in part  be related to the fact that state Proposition 111 would amend the state  constitution to make the waiver formula more responsive to growth and  inflation. But "Prop. 111 doesn't do everything," McCauly said. "The league  still believes you need to (pass) Prop. D."  </P> <P> San Diego isn't the only California city bumping up against the Gann barrier.  Since the hurdle went up in 1979, 213 cities, counties, school districts and  other government agencies have sought waivers, according to statistics  collected by the Sacramento-based California Taxpayers Assn. A strong majority  of those waiver campaigns were successful, according to the group.  </P> <P> Supporters are quick to argue that the so-called Gann Waiver would not increase  taxes. Rather, it would adjust the Gann limit, which, since its inception in  1979, placed a "ceiling" on the amount of tax revenue that the city can spend  each fiscal year.  </P> <P> As proposed, the waiver would increase the city's appropriations ceiling by  $273 million beginning July 1, 1992, up from the $592-million limit now in  place.  </P> <P> The waiver is needed, proponents argue, because San Diego's revenue sources,  including property taxes, sales taxes and hotel room taxes, are growing faster  than the Gann limit, which is determined by a formula based upon the national  Consumer Price Index.  </P> <P> Without the waiver, the city will lose an estimated $36 million in general fund  revenue during the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $46 million during the  fiscal year beginning July 1, 1993, according to Jack D. Farris, a city  economist. Estimated losses would jump to $57 million in 1994 and $70 million  during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1995.  </P> <P> That much lost revenue would dramatically harm the city's already strained  general fund, which finances many services, including fire and police,  recreation, the library and social services.  </P> <P> No organized opposition to the Gann waiver has surfaced, mainly, proponents  said, because the waiver will not increase taxes. For example, no one even  bothered to write an argument against the proposition in the registrar of  voters' sample ballot.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Taxpayers Assn., which remained neutral on the Gann waiver  vote four years ago, is supporting the proposition, even though "council did  what we feared last time, which was take 'one-time' money and build it into  operations," said Taxpayers Assn. Executive Director Jim Ryan.  </P> <P> The Taxpayers Assn. would be more comfortable with the waiver if the council  were to "specifically earmark (Gann-related funds) for capital projects," Ryan  said.  </P> <P> What has surprised some observers is the low-key campaign being waged to ensure  passage of Proposition D.  </P> <P> Supporters of the waiver have created San Diegans for the Gann Waiver, which is  being directed by Chris Crotty, most recently a staff member of Councilwoman  Linda Bernhardt. But the pro-waiver organization's campaign chest is woefully  low. A fund-raising effort by developer Mike Madigan, a chairman of the Chamber  of Commerce's local government division, has reportedly raised only $2,000 or  $3,000.  </P> <P> Although the waiver has won support from all members of the San Diego City  Council, individual council members and Mayor Maureen O'Connor have remained  "unusually silent" on the issue, according to F.P. Crowell, chairman of the  Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> That silence might be golden, according to Wayne Raffesberger, executive  director of San Diegans Inc., because too many San Diegans might vote against  the limit waiver rather than turn more funds over to a council that "looks  silly . . . (because of) flipping and flopping" on recent attempts at raising  revenue through ballot measures.  </P> <P> That image "might prompt an anti-council vote rather than a pro-Gann vote,"  Raffesberger said. "You could get the opposite vote than you're trying for."  </P> <P> Other observers suggested that the council has remained low-key about the Gann  waiver because the city will have other chances to win passage if it fails on  June 5. The council could decide to place a new proposition on the November  ballot, and, if needed, on next June's ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bigger City Council  </P> <P> Proposition D isn't the only low-key campaign.  </P> <P> Proposition B would expand the size of the City Council to 10, up from the  current eight which was adopted in 1965, when the total was increased from six.  </P> <P> The Chicano Federation, which won a place for Proposition B on the ballet, has  limited funds to conduct a campaign, according to its chairman Jess Haro, a  former San Diego councilman.  </P> <P> Consequently, the campaign for Proposition B has been largely limited to  mailings and media coverage of the court fight that led to Proposition B being  placed on the ballot.  </P> <P> Opponents, including City Councilman Bruce Henderson and the Chamber's Crowell,  are focusing on the simple argument that an increased number of council members  will raise the cost of government. "It simply isn't needed," Crowell said. "The  Chamber is strongly opposed to an expansion."  </P> <P> Estimates vary on how much it would cost to implement Proposition B. Opponents  cite a city manager's report setting the cost at $2 million a year. But Haro  argues that existing council staffs could be cut back to provide funds for the  new staff members.  </P> <P> The lure of opponents' arguments will be powerful, Haro acknowledged. "Any time  people say something is going to cost more money, it catches people's  attention. Coupled with that is the fact that the public generally holds public  officials in low esteem."  </P> <P> Haro described Proposition B as a logical step for San Diego, which recently  went to district elections for City Council seats and is drawing up new maps  for those districts. "It's not diluting power," Haro said. "It's giving more  direct representation" to residents who are not well-served by the existing  eight council members, he said.  </P> <P> Simple arithmetic, Haro argued, underscores the need for more council members.  San Diego's council members now represent at least 110,000 citizens, Haro said,  far more than the 20,000 to 60,000 citizens represented by council members in  other cities in the county.  </P> <P> "We're the exception to rule," Haro said. "Santee, Encinitas, Poway, National  City, they all have not less representation but more representation."  </P> <P> Proposition B is supported by the League of Women Voters, because "the vast  increase in population (since 1965) calls out for better representation,"  McCauly said. "The population is getting more and more diverse, and the council  should represent that diversity."  </P> <P> Raffesberger said the council increase might appeal to San Diegans who "see it  as an anti-incumbent vote . . . it could be people saying, 'I'm going to dilute  the power of council members,' " Raffesberger said. "They could be saying let's  water down what the hell's going on down there" on council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Communications  </P> <P> Even opponents tend to agree that Proposition E, which would finance most of a  new police and fire communications system, is sorely needed. "We don't say it  isn't needed," Ryan said. "But we're opposed to having pet projects like (a  proposed Housing Trust Fund) included in the budget."  </P> <P> Ryan argued that the police-fire system should be part of the budget and not on  the ballot.  </P> <P> "We're talking about some of the most antiquated equipment you've seen," said  Jeff Frazier, a member of the San Diego City Fire Fighters Union's board of  directors, who spent two years working in the existing communications center.  "I've worked in operations, and I've been at some pretty challenging fire  incidents, but I've never (experienced) as much stress as with the  (communications system)."  </P> <P> "The communications system was originally proposed to last through 1983, and  then it was updated to last through 1987," said Proposition E supporter Murray  Galinson, chairman of San Diego National Bank. "The question in my mind is just  when it's going to be so antiquated that we'll have a life-threatening  situation and will not be able to respond."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reapportionment  </P> <P> Proposition C is perhaps the least understood of the four citywide  propositions. It would allow for reapportionment to occur before 1993, if 1990  census figures turn out to be faulty. The proposition calls for a one-time  waiver to the City Charter, which calls for the next reapportionment to occur  in 1993.  </P> <P> The San Diego County Taxpayers Assn., which is opposing the other city  propositions has elected to support C because "it's not going to increase taxes  and it's not setting anything in motion," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Haro described Proposition C as a "companion" measure to Proposition B.  Although the two are not necessarily tied together, "if the 10-member council  is approved, it would have an impact" on how the reapportionment occurs, Haro  said.  </P></p>

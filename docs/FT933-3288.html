			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Unions warn of 'chaos' over public pay stance: Clarke says salary bill will be frozen at 1992-93 levels LEADERS of Britain's 5m public sector workers threatened widespread industrial action yesterday after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a virtual freeze on pay and warned that job losses would follow 'excessive' settlements. Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, the biggest union, said the government 'should be in no doubt that it faces enormous industrial chaos and unrest'. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called an emergency meeting of public sector unions to co-ordinate protests. The TUC also demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Clarke. In a statement to the pay review bodies, which make pay recommendations for 1.4m public sector workers, the chancellor said 1994-95 pay increases must be funded by productivity improvements. He said the government salary bill would be frozen at 1992-93 levels to force departments to set pay 'at levels no higher than necessary' to recruit, retain and motivate staff. 'We have to break the inflation psychology that in the past has led to expectations of pay increases every year unrelated to efficiency improvement or the ability of the employer to pay,' he said. Mr Clarke also warned the pay review bodies that the government would refuse to dip into its contingency reserve to finance pay settlements regarded as excessive. 'Higher pay costs not funded by efficiency savings would therefore lead to reduced spending on services or reduced employment in the services and professions concerned,' he said. The announcement places a question mark over the future of the pay review bodies, which were set up 12 years ago to distance the government from sensitive sectors such as nursing and the armed services. It also means the government is prepared to face the political impact of cash limits, believing the unions will be blamed for job losses which result from excessive pay increases. The government's aim is to prevent a round of 'catch up' pay settlements after the end of its successful 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector pay in 1993-94. The announcement is also intended to mollify rightwingers angered by Mr Clarke's insistence that tax increases remain an option for the November Budget. Rightwing MPs reacted favourably. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, said the announcement would be 'welcomed by private industry'. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was 'wholly unfair of the government to seek to penalise teachers, nurses, fire-fighters and others in the public sector to pay for their own economic mismanagement'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said he supported a measure of public sector pay restraint, but added: 'I see no reason why the public sector should be picked out as a scapegoat by the government in order to appease its right wing.' Mr Clarke's announcement is broadly in line with calls for pay restraint from the Confederation of British Industry. However, the Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of councils, said it was likely to lead to big job losses. The TUC emergency meeting, likely to take place next week, is expected to announce a day of action. However, cautious officials warned that militant public sector union action could revive anti-union feelings, in spite of the government's unpopularity.

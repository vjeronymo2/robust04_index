			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais The French government faces a delicate task in the rescue of Credit Lyonnais. It must not alienate outside investors to the point where privatisation becomes impossible. Equally it must not show so much favouritism that it upsets the rest of the French banking community. So far few details have emerged, though it is clear that tomorrow's deal will involve the transfer of non-performing property loans to a shell company. Precedent suggests this is one way of limiting the immediate bad debt provision - and therefore the capital injection from the government - but there is a cost in the form of future income forgone. If it follows the established pattern, Credit Lyonnais would lend the shell company enough to buy both the bad debt at its value after provisions and sufficient zero coupon bonds to finance eventual repayment of the borrowing. But Credit Lyonnais would not receive interest on its loan to the shell company. Since debt transfers to the shall company could exceed 2 per cent of its loan book, that implies a drag on net interest income for years. Credit Lyonnais would thus find it harder in the recovery to reach the absolute levels of profitability established by other French banks. But its own recovery will be more pronounced simply because its provisions have been higher. And since the bank is trading at a 25 per cent discount to stated 1992 net assets, the market has priced in the risks.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Warning on Scots EC membership MEMBERSHIP of the European Community would not be automatic or easy for an independent Scotland, Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned yesterday while campaigning in Edinburgh. 'Scotland could not slide out of the United Kingdom on Monday and sidle into the Community as the thirteenth member state on Tuesday,' he said. 'The lawyers would have a series of field days. There could be many months or years of dispute and uncertainty.' Many European countries could put obstacles in Scotland's path as they would be reluctant to set a precedent for their own potential break-away regions, he said. Destroying the union would be 'an act of unparalleled vandalism', said Mr Hurd. He also attacked Labour's plans for devolution while retaining the level of Scottish representation at Westminster as 'overwhelmingly self-serving'. Mr Hurd lunched at Scottish Life assurance, one of the Scots life business that has expressed fears over independence for Scotland. At the Eric Liddell Centre, Mr Hurd's polite interest in babies did not sway a group of mothers. 'I'm voting SNP,' said one after he left.</p>

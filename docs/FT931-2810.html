			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Delors takes a gamble in Washington MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, has taken a gamble in pressing for a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington today. The Frenchman's feelings about America have always been ambiguous, a mixture of envy and admiration. With trade disputes simmering on aviation and steel subsidies, and now on Buy America/Buy European legislation in government procurement and telecommunications, some of Mr Delors' fears about Big Brother appear to be coming true. If the US carries out its threat to block European companies from certain federal contracts next Monday, it will look like a calculated snub. In Brussels yesterday, EC officials remained unsure if Mr Delors, 67, intends to show the charm which at times wrong-footed Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, or whether he might repeat his recent remark about Mr Clinton's 'need to preen in front of the mirror to make sure that his muscles are still firm'. The White House meeting was long planned, although at one stage a miffed Mr Delors was told he could have only 15 minutes, according to one EC official. Delicate negotiations have apparently succeeded in extending the session to 90 minutes, offering him a chance to present his most important message to Washington: whatever its present economic and political difficulties, the European Community must be treated as an equal. Mr Delors never quite managed to persuade the Bush administration of this, even at the high point of his powers in the late 1980s, when he pushed through the single European market and laid the groundwork on European monetary and political union in the Maastricht treaty. Although the US briefly treated Maastricht with a reverence extended to the Philadelphia convention, the Bush administration soon realised that talk of an emerging European superstate was premature. In Brussels, all talk now is of a fresh start in transatlantic relations built on the two leaders' common political outlook, which ranges from environmental and industrial policy to a mistrust of the free-market deregulation of the 1980s. More tentatively, EC officials mention common humble roots: Mr Delors rose from peasant stock to become mayor of the Parisian suburb of Clichy and finance minister in the first Mitterrand government, while Mr Clinton's escape from Hope, Arkansas, is already the stuff of American folklore. Yet differences remain. Despite his intellectual prowess, Mr Delors remains instinctively suspicious of the US. His behaviour in the Gatt trade talks is characteristic: even if charges that he is a surrogate of a protectionist French government are wide of the mark, the man known as Mr Europe still explodes at what he sees as the US tendency to bully, notably on farm trade. Last October, at the height of the Gatt negotiations, Mr Delors did a passable imitation of Charles de Gaulle when he declared: 'If Europe is to become adult, it must be able to say No to Big Brother.' It is fashionable to speak of him as a spent force at the European Commission, where his mandate runs out next year. But General Jacques believes there may be life after Brussels, and is quietly plotting a re-entry into French politics, where some think he is the likeliest man of the left to beat a right-winger in a presidential election. That would be in 1995. If Mr Delors were to achieve the improbable, he would be seeing a lot more of Mr Clinton. Perhaps that is why insiders say they would dearly like Mr Delors to drop his less than perfect English and let rip en francais through an interpreter; but so far they are too afraid to ask.</p>

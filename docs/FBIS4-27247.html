			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Delegation of the National Assembly and </F> Royal Government of Cambodia" following the conclusion of the  roundtable with the Party of Democratic Kampuchea in Pyongyang;  dated 28 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. Respecting the lofty idea of His Majesty  Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC],  the two national institutions of the KoC, namely the National  Assembly and Royal Government of Cambodia [RoC] sent a  high-ranking delegation led by Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the  National Assembly; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first  prime minister and co-commander in chief of the Khmer Royal  Armed Forces [KRAF]; and Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister  and co-commander in chief of the KRAF, to attend, at the king's  Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang, a round- table meeting with  Khieu Samphan, head of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] or  Khmer Rouge, on 27 May.    II. The participation by the high-ranking KoC delegation,  which is the legal and legitimate representative born from the  will of the people and in line with the Constitution dated 25  September 1993, constitutes a symbolic gesture and displays;    A. The respect for the idea of the king, father of the  nation, who has always strived to seek peace for the Cambodian  people with whom he has always sympathized.    B. The political will for peace of all KoC national  institutions desiring to achieve peace and national  reconciliation, without thinking of their superiority in power,  so as to enable all national forces to jointly strive to develop  the country for the well-being of the people in general, for the  prestige of the KoC, and for ensuring national and territorial  unity, sovereignty, national independence, and territorial  integrity of the KoC.    III. Immediately after the meeting began, the high-ranking  representatives of the KoC totally and unconditionally agreed  with the lofty idea of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman,  that is:    1. They voiced support for and firmly pledged to follow the  policy of peace and national reconciliation of our revered king,  to maintain national and territorial unity without territorial  division and seceded zones, to preserve and defend the  territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national independence  (?recognized internationally).    2. The top representatives of the KoC, namely the National  Assembly and royal government, fully accepted the king's  proposal for a cease-fire on the spot to begin at noon on 15  June with monitoring by an inter-Cambodian committee on this  cease-fire.    IV. Unfortunately, the king's proposal of the cease-fire  schedule, which has been accepted unconditionally by the KoC's  national institutions, was rejected by Khieu Samphan despite an  energetic appeal by the king and repeated pleas by the two  supreme patriarchs and Venerable Patriarch Mongkoltepeacha and  Venerable Patriarch Khousananda.    V. The king, venerable patriarchs, and the KoC national  institutions time and again expressed their fervent desire to  achieve national reconciliation and peace most longed for by the  Cambodian people, but the Khmer Rouge representative only came  to the roundtable, sitting before the face of the king and in  the presence of monks from the two Buddhist sects, in order to  continue his maneuvers to continue the war and shed the blood of  fellow Cambodians by raising the same old argument, such as  calling on the foreigners whom he has always opposed to arrange  peace for Cambodia. This runs counter to the will of the people  and the king, who correctly realize that the problem among the  Cambodians can be resolved among the Cambodians themselves  without need for help from foreigners.    [Dated] Pyongyang, 28 May 1994</p>

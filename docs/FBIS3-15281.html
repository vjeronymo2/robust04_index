Speaking at an enlarged meeting of the Russian Government in  the Kremlin on Friday [4 March], Shumeyko said "society is no  longer held together by nation-wide interests. It gets  increasingly differentiated", which exacerbates the crisis in  the country.    Shumeyko believes that many a law is not enacted at the  local  level, "the farther from Moscow, the lesser the enactment."  This is caused by the lack of nation-wide interests, which  leads to the discreditation of authority, he said.    Emphasising the importance of strengthening authority in the  country and restoring order, Shumeyko said the fashioning of a  concept of national concord will invigorate authority and  contribute to taking the country out of the crisis.    The Federation Council chief is of the opinion that the  government now is not in a position to adhere to nation-wide  interests because it is being pressured by various lobbyist  groups.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi de La Guaird] </F>   [Text] An Itamaraty source reported that Brazilian foreign  policy's political priority is to obtain a permanent seat on the  UN Security Council. The government is negotiating a virtual  Brazilian candidacy -- parallel to the candidacy of countries  such as India, Japan, and Germany -- but keeping in sight that  "the regional component is the most sensitive one."    Venezuelan Foreign Ministry sources told this newspaper that  they are only supporting the Japanese and German candidacies for  the new permanent seats that may be created in the UN Security  Council. So far, Brazil is not a Venezuelan Foreign Ministry  favorite.    Argentina, the main Brazilian partner in the region, prefers  to support Japan instead of favoring the Brazilian aspiration.    The issue, however, requires that diplomats be careful not  to  offend partner countries. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim does not  want to comment on the Argentine position. He only notes that  the issue was "frankly" discussed during his meeting with  Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion in Brasilia a few days  ago. Amorim added: "Camilion said the issue must be dealt with  carefully because it is not ripe and this is understandable. We  are trying to talk matters over and reach understandings."    According to the minister, the ideal thing would be not to  have permanent UN Security Council members. "In the world,  however, there are five countries (the United States, France,  the PRC, Russia, and England) that will not give up being  permanent members. The world has changed. The council will have  to be expanded. Brazil believes this expansion will not increase  the current imbalances and does not want to see only certain  types of countries receiving privileges. This would not be good  for the Security Council," Amorim says.    According to the foreign minister, the adoption of similar  positions by Latin American countries that will be represented  by Brazil in the UN Security Council -- Brazil's name has been  raised by the UN secretary general, and "whenever the issue is  discussed, its name crops up naturally" -- may, however, run  into difficulties, particularly regarding Argentina.    There is still some animosity in the region about eventual  Brazilian hegemonic attitudes. A diplomatic source explained to  this newspaper: "The issue lies in how our neighbors will take  the idea." The Foreign Ministry's assessment, however, is that  during the second stage, when discussions for expanding the  number of UN Security Council members reaches the point of  defining these new members, Argentina will support Brazil's  candidacy.    The idea of expanding the UN Security Council was raised two  years ago and is supported by the United States, which even  accepts the inclusion of more than five members without veto  power. The voting is scheduled to be held during the 1995 UN  General Assembly that will be attended by 184 UN members. But  Article 108 of the UN Charter establishes that all Security  Council decisions must be approved at the national level by each  of the five permanent UN Security Council members that can block  the decision.    Brazil hopes to have the support of all five member  countries. Moreover, as Foreign Minister Celso Amorim informed  this newspaper on 4 March, Brazilian diplomacy does not hide its  satisfaction at receiving a letter a few days ago from U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher praising Brazil's  participation in the discussions on the former Yugoslavia.  Amorim noted that Ronaldo Sardenberg, the Brazilian ambassador  to the United Nations, heads the Security Council's Sanctions  Committee. Brazil, like Argentina, has been participating in  the council for a two-year period as a rotating member.    According to Ambassador Jose Viegas Filho, under secretary  of  the Foreign Ministry Political Planning Department, the General  Assembly has established a working group that already has held  two sessions. The UN Security Council's expansion aims to reduce  regional imbalance. Except for China, the five members with  veto power are almost all developed countries. There are no  representatives from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, or  Africa.    Brazilian diplomacy has been working on several fronts to  spread the image that Brazil is a reliable country and "a center  of stability" in the region, where it shares borders with 10  countries and has no disputes. A Foreign Ministry source said:  "Brazilian nuclear policy today is viewed as reliable and no  country is asking us to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty." Last week, President Itamar Franco promulgated the  nuclear safeguard treaty signed by Brazil, Argentina, the  Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC),  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that was  approved by Congress.    Brazil also has signed the treaty proscribing weapons of  mass  destruction such as chemical and biological weapons, and  actively participated in drafting new amendments to the  Tlatelolco Treaty on the denuclearization of Latin America and  the Caribbean, but the Senate has yet to approve it. In 1993,  Brazil headed the Vienna Conference on Human Rights.    Although the foreign minister alleges that "Brazil cannot  nominate itself," and that its name was mentioned because of its  size and importance -- "Brazil has a face turned to Africa; it  shares borders with many Latin American countries, and it has a  tradition of the peaceful solution of controversies" --  Brazilian diplomatic circles believe that "its upholding of  Western diplomatic values and understanding of the problems  affecting other developing countries" are a plus in favor of  Brazil.</p>

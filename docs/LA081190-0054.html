			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CITING ATTENDANCE AND HANDLE DROPS, ARLINGTON CUTS PURSES  </P> <P> Citing declines in average daily attendance and handle, officials of Arlington  International Racecourse announced Thursday cuts in the value of five graded  stakes races.  </P> <P> They also announced the cancellation of the $25,000 Perrault Handicap on Oct.  8, the final day of Arlington's 134-day meeting.  </P> <P> Three $100,000 races -- the Equipoise Mile, the Arlington Matron and the  Arlington Oaks -- were lowered to $75,000. The $150,000 Washington Park  Handicap was cut to $100,000, while the $75,000 Swoon's Song Handicap was  downgraded to $50,000.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, Arlington officials cut the value of several other stakes  races by a total of $120,000.  </P> <P> A 5% across-the-board overnight purse cut was put into effect at that time, and  track president Ken Dunn said Thursday that another purse cut was being  considered.  </P> <P> Through the first 74 days of the meeting, Arlington averaged 10,196 in on-track  attendance and $2,501,232 in overall handle.  </P> <P> During 1989's 95-day meeting, daily attendance averaged 12,616 and the average  handle was $2,572,584.  </P> <P> Many explanations have been offered for the decline. They include the opening  of two dog tracks that are running concurrently in neighboring Wisconsin, major  roadwork on highways near Arlington and the overall lackluster performance of  the economy.  </P></p>

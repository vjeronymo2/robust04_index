			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Friedrich Kuhn: "Right-Wing Extremists Step Up </F> Cooperation"]    [Text] Bonn -- According to the German security  authorities, some 25 German right-wing extremists, mainly  neo-Nazis, are fighting in Croatia and Bosnia as volunteers  against the Serbs. This proves that there are efforts by  right-wing extremist circles in Germany to intensify connections  with like-minded people abroad.    Another example that has been mentioned are the more  frequent  joint appearances of the head of the German People's Union  [DVU], Gerhard Frey, and the Russian right-wing extremist  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In a meeting with Frey in August 1992,  the latter declared that his party would bring its influence to  bear "to solve the East Prussian question in Germany's favor."  Since then German right-wing extremists have been seen to be  supporting the settlement of Russian Germans in East Prussia.    According to security experts, German right-wing extremists  met with like-minded people in Vellexon, France, Diksmuide, in  West Flanders, Naumburg (Saxony Anhalt), and Madrid. Contacts  with U.S. citizen Gary Rex Lauck, who smuggles Nazi propaganda  material to Germany from Lincoln, Nebraska, are regarded as  particularly dangerous. That way, Lauck spares the German  right-wing extremists the risk of prison terms of several years  for producing the material in Germany itself. Several German  publishers of right-wing extremist material now have their  newspapers, leaflets, and books printed abroad.    According to the Cologne-based Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, signs of a "networking" of  right-wing extremist tendencies in Germany have become "more  obvious" in the last year. The right-wing extremists are trying  to overcome the fact that they are divided into many groups  through "means of communication." "Organizational structures are  being replaced increasingly by specific interlinking through  technology," sources form the Office said. The use of  information technology through coded information via mail boxes  and mobile telephones enables the right-wing extremists "to  mobilize on a federal level within a short time and to react  flexibly in each individual case." This has also benefited  Hamburg neo-Nazi Christian Worch, who is trying to establish a  network under the name of "Anti-Antifa" [anti-antifascist]  Direct control over the approximately 5,600 militant right-wing  extremists in the entire FRG has not yet been observed. At the  moment, 1,500 right-wing extremists are organized into 27 groups.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool This weeks British interest rate reduction, and its accompanying currency disturbances, have had not had the effect of enlivening wool textile trade. There is more interest in how prices may have been affected, but not to the point of placing business. The firming effect is very slight because of continuing difficult and competitive conditions throughout Europe. Australian and most world wool values meanwhile only manage to drift along without clear trend. The AWC market indicator was down to 502 cents a kg. on January 27, compared with 509 a week before.</p>

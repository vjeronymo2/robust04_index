			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BALLOON SHOW IS HARBINGER OF RESIDENTS' REDUCED VIEWS;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION BY HYPERION ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT OF THE PLANT'S PROPOSED  EXPANSION IN EL SEGUNDO  </P> <P> It was balloon day Saturday at the Hyperion Treatment Plant, but few homeowners  in the hills in nearby El Segundo found any cause to celebrate.  </P> <P> Officials at the sewage treatment plant near Imperial Highway and Vista Del Mar  Boulevard raised 50 large weather balloons about 100 feet into the air to  demonstrate to residents how much of their ocean view would be obstructed by  the proposed construction of 12 sewage processing tanks.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it when when I saw the balloons this morning," said Elroy  Tatge as he stood on his patio looking at a row of balloons that partially  blocked his view of the water.  </P> <P> Tatge, 57, and his wife, Ana, moved into the house in July. Before buying the  house, he said, he asked officials at El Segundo City Hall whether Hyperion had  proposed any construction plans that would hamper his view. He said they told  him no such plan existed.  </P> <P> "Frankly," he said, "if I had known the view would have been blocked, it would  have been a deciding factor in buying the house."  </P> <P> He called the plan "not acceptable."  </P> <P> If approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and the city of Los Angeles,  the dozen tanks, known as digesters, would each stand 105 feet above ground  level and 85 feet in diameter, according to Walt Naydo, division engineer for  Hyperion.  </P> <P> Naydo said the proposed tanks would be lowered about 30 feet into the ground  but could not be lowered further because they would encounter ground water.  Hyperion currently uses smaller digesters, but Naydo said larger units are  needed to provide the necessary capacity.  </P> <P> Some of the balloons raised Saturday represented the height of an additional  dozen tanks that Hyperion officials are considering building at the facility  later, he said.  </P> <P> The digester tanks -- resembling large eggs -- would each hold about 2.5  million gallons of solid sewage, which would be partially consumed in a process  using artificial bacteria, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 18 Tanks Operating  </P> <P> Hyperion, which treats sewage for most of the city of Los Angeles, has 18  digester tanks in operation, but Naydo said the facility needs to expand its  capacity to meet the city's growing needs. Hyperion processes about 440 million  gallons of raw sewage a day, and by the year 2010, the plant is expected to  process about 570 million gallons, he said.  </P> <P> If everything goes as scheduled, Naydo said, construction of the digesters  would begin in mid-1991 and be completed by late 1993.  </P> <P> Naydo said Hyperion officials have held three public hearings on the matter and  have sent several letters to residents to inform them about the planned  expansion. But he said few residents attended the meetings or responded to the  letters.  </P> <P> "We have been trying to get the people to be responsive to what we see as a  potential impact," he said. "But we've had very little luck."  </P> <P> He said the balloons were raised in hopes of prompting residents to respond.  The plan worked. The balloons were raised at about 8 a.m., and by 9:30 the  telephones in the Hyperion administrative offices were ringing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Standing in Yards  </P> <P> By 10:30 that morning, several residents in the middle-class, single-family  neighborhoods above the plant were standing in their front yards discussing the  proposed expansion.  </P> <P> "It's upsetting to us because we bought the house partly for the view," said  Hilary Murphy, a teacher's aide in El Segundo who moved into a house on  Hillcrest Street in April.  </P> <P> Murphy said she and her husband, Michael, spend a great deal of time watching  the sunsets on the ocean from their patio. Now, she said, the view will be  ruined by the large tanks.  </P> <P> "It's awful what progress does," she said.  </P> <P> John Teleso, who has lived for 10 years with his wife, Sandi, and two daughters  in a house down the street, agreed.  </P> <P> Teleso, an aerospace worker, said the tanks would obstruct his view and lower  the value of his house. He said he has talked to his neighbors and has  contacted an attorney to see what legal recourse he has.  </P> <P> Teleso, like several of his neighbors, said homeowners in the area are planning  to join to fight the proposed project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bring Everyone Together'  </P> <P> "This is the one thing that is going to bring everyone together to fight it,"  he said.  </P> <P> El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson and Councilman Scot Dannen joined some residents  on Hillcrest Street to discuss the matter. Jacobson said the city of El Segundo  does not have the power to reject the project because the Hyperion plant is  located just outside the city's border and within the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He said, however, that city officials have been meeting with Hyperion officials  to discuss alternative methods to increase the plant's capacity, such as  building underground tanks.  </P> <P> Said Dannen: "The more noise the residents make, the more mitigating measures  they may add."  </P></p>

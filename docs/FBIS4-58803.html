			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, May 8, INA -- Deputy head of the  Information Department at the Popular General Conference Party  in Yemen 'Abd-al-Karim al-Khamisi has emphasised that what is  happening in Yemen now is not but a rebellion against legitimacy  and democracy and violation of the national invariables on whose  foundations the yemen unity was founded.    In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH daily of Baghdad during his  stay in Baghdad he said the political crisis in Yemen was a  perilous action but not of the volume leading to a bloody  military confrontation. He made it clear that what the media  hostile to Yemen unity were mentioning in that what was going on  in Yemen as fighting between the north and the south or conflict  between the conference and the Socialist parties was groundless.    What is true, the Yemeni political official said, is that  confirmed by the tangible reality affirming that the conflict is  now beteen the unionists and their enemies and between  legitimacy and illegitimacy. The proof is that all the national  forces believing in the issue of unity and democracy of various  political affiliations throughout Yemen are now standing abreast  to encounter the rebellion in defense of the people's will that  emerged in the elections of April 27, 1993 and clearly appeared  on May 22, 1990, the day when the unity was declared.    He has added that one of the more significant of the  constants on which the unity has been built is democracy,  political plurality and peaceful exchange of power.    On the strength of these invariables the Yemeni people have  gone to ballot boxes to choose the pursuit it accepts. And  prior to the day of balloting all the political parties and  organisations publicly announced that they would abide by  outcomes of the elections, Mr al-Khamisi added.    He elaborated that following a short period there emerged on  the surface indicators denoting that some of those who abided by  the nation arbitration were not sincere in their commitment.  And hence the crisis has begun and which in the beginning was  putting on the mask of modernisation and reform. But this mask  has fallen down in Amman after the conclusion of the document of  pledge and agreement and then the world realised who was sincere  and who was hesitant. The Yemeni official maintained that the  secessionist intentions were disclosed and the political and  military events speeded up till they have reached the current  painful military confrontation. Mr 'Abd-al Karim al-Khamisi  has further pointed out that those who backed up the tyrannous  conspiracy on Iraq were the same today standing behind the  militay mutiny against the legitimacy in Yemen. He asked all the  Arab unionists to resolutely stand against any conspiring on the  Yemen unity. It is considered, he further added, a prominent  pan-Arab accomplishment in our contemporary age because setback  of the unity constitutes a painful blow to the Arab dream  aspiring for a prosperous Arab future.    Mr al-Khamisi also called upon all Arab countries to defend  the Yemen unity against any conspiracy.</p>

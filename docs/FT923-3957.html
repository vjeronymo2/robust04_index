			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei extends its losses as investors take profits PROFIT-taking by investment trusts and dealers, combined with a lack of new buyers, depressed share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 157.76 easier at 18,282.42. It rose to the day's high of 18,756.32 on arbitrage-related buying and speculative short-term trading, but fell later to a low of 18,279.41 on profit-taking. Traders said activity was led by arbitrage-linked trading ahead of this Friday's settlement of September futures and options contracts. Volume remained flat at 400m shares, against 402m. Declines outscored advances by 713 to 290, with 145 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 18.70 to 1,391.86, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 2.49 to 1,117.94. Individual investors took profits on short-term holdings, while institutions remained inactive. 'Prices have moved too fast recently,' explained a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life. Traders said the upward momentum in share prices seemed to have come to a temporary halt, although underlying sentiment remains firm. Last week, long margin positions continued to increase, reflecting bullish sentiment. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said the balance of long positions on the stock exchanges in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya increased by Y93.5bn last week to an outstanding Y1,754.9bn. Margin selling rose by Y48.4bn to Y573bn, as some investors became cautious after the recent sharp gains. Banks were easier on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y30 to Y2,930 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y1,800. Brokers were also weaker, with Nomura Securities off Y10 at Y1,720. Individuals and dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Nippon Zeon, the most active issue of the day, gained ground on the 'Aids' theme in the morning session, but finished a net Y3 down at Y767 on profit-taking. Some issues remained firm on margin buying, Meiji Milk Products adding Y10 at Y1,140 and Green Cross Y10 at Y1,730. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y14,000 to Y585,000, falling for the third consecutive day. Traders said investors who had bought the issue at lower prices were realising gains. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 198.13 to 19,936.49 in volume of 20.6m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y100 to Y10,700. Roundup LOCAL issues dominated trading among the region's markets yesterday. TAIWAN fell heavily on news that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Mr Oung Ta-ming, head of the Hualon Group. The group controls a number of speculative stocks, which fell steeply, dragging the rest of the market down. The weighted index weakened 93.89, or 2.4 per cent, to 3,758.38 in turnover of TDollars 21.07bn. Sentiment was also hit after a number of banks said they would reduce lending to electronics companies. SYDNEY lost further ground to close at its lowest level since June 1991. The All Ordinaries index, which fell below 1,500 in early trade, closed 13.1 down at 1,501.8 in turnover of ADollars 209.8m. Banks again led the market lower, with Westpac and ANZ under pressure following a broker's downgrade. Westpac shed 3 cents to ADollars 2.80 while ANZ declined 10 cents to ADollars 2.98. HONG KONG firmed ahead of today's resumption of talks between China and the UK, aimed at breaking the deadlock over the financing of the new airport. The Hang Seng index moved forward 36.18 to 5,700.59 but turnover fell to HKDollars 1.14bn from HKDollars 1.32bn. Hopewell Holdings appreciated 15 cents to HKDollars 5.15 prior to releasing better than expected final results after the close. SEOUL was subjected to profit-taking, the composite index ending 4.24 lower at 553.35 in turnover of Won365.15bn. Companies with links to China gained, following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Falls outnumbered rises by 514 to 271, with 105 issues unchanged. MANILA closed little changed following light trading. The composite index lost 0.80 to 1,412.90 in combined turnover of 216m pesos. Oil shares firmed in late trading in anticipation of the start of commercial drilling at the West Linapacan oil field next month. KUALA LUMPUR extended its gains ahead of today's national holiday. The composite index put on 1.77 to 586.61 but volume remained low, while SINGAPORE was dominated by trading in Malaysian companies as the Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.61 to 1,377.20 in turnover of SDollars 64.7m. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index finished 14.65 weaker at 1,472.78 in low turnover of NZDollars 12m. BOMBAY's BSE index fell 25.06 to 3,201.46.</p>

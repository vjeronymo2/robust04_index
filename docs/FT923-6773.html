			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: MAS rights issue to go ahead MANAGEMENT at Malaysian Airline System (MAS) overcame a shareholder revolt over a rights issue yesterday, and will now go ahead with a one-for-one issue of 350m shares to raise MDollars 1.75bn (Dollars 700m) to buy aircraft. Minority shareholders rejected proposals for the rights issue, arguing that the MDollars 5 price was too high, but they were out voted in a poll of shareholders with more than 10 per cent of the equity, said Mr Zain Azraai, chairman.</p>

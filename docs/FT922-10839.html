			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: French chemicals group wins Czech deal RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals producer, yesterday beat its US and European competitors to win majority control of Chemlon, the Czechoslovakian state-owned group which is central Europe's largest maker of artificial fibres. Mr Jean-Marc Bruel, Rhone-Poulenc's director general, signed a letter of intent with Chemlon and Mr Jan Holcik, the Slovak industry minister, to form a jont venture. It will be 52 per cent controlled by the French state-owned company, rising rapidly to 63 per cent. The deal followed a year's negotiations against many other leading western producers, Rhone-Poulenc said. No price has been given, but Rhone-Poulenc plans to invest FFr500m (Dollars 89.76m) over several years to improve the competitiveness of its FFr750m turnover partner. Rhone-Poulenc's fibres and polymers division made sales of FFr13.5bn last year. This is Rhone-Poulenc's largest investment in central Europe and the largest French investment in Czechoslovakia since BSN, the food and drinks group, teamed up 12 months ago with Nestle, the Swiss multinational, to take control of Cokoladovny, Czechoslovakia's largest food company. The joint venture will own Chemlon's plant in Humenne, Slovakia, which makes 61,000 tonnes per year of polyamid yarn, used for textiles, carpets and industrial fibres. The deal will reinforce Rhone-Poulenc's position in polyamid yarns and give it an industrial base to develop its business across central Europe, said the group. Its other investments in the region include a fibre transformation plant in eastern Germany, two plants in Hungary and two in Poland, making animal feeds, health products and agrochemicals. The final accord for Chemlon should be signed in the next few weeks, said Rhone-Poulenc.</p>

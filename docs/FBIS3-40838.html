The Andhra Pradesh Government  faced acute embarrassment as the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao was greeted by hostile demonstrations almost  everywhere he went during a day long tour of his Nandyal  constituency on Thursday.    Perhaps, it was the for the first time that the motorcade of  a Prime Minister was forced to retreat when a 200-strong defiant  mob of extremists blocked his way, taking the strong posse of  police by surprise. The incident occurred near the Municipal  office in Nandyal as the Prime Minister was proceeding to  address a public meeting.    These anti-Dunkel demonstrators, undeterred by the  lathicharge, chased the Prime Minister's convoy as it was  retreating to a guest house. The incident forced postponement of  the public meeting by two and half hours and a worried Chief  Minister, M. K. Vijayabhaskara Reddy tendered an apology for the  security lapse.    The day's schedule of the Prime Minister began on an unhappy  note with a group of villagers waving black flags at Mr. Rao's  first public meeting at Atmakur, demanding lift irrigation  schemes from Srisailam main canal. Atmakur area is the centre of  extremist activity in Kurnool district.    Demonstration by women: Yet another show of protest under  the  very nose of the police was one led by Ms Sandhya of Progressive  Organisation of Women who contested against the Chief Minister  in Panyam Assembly constituency. She organised a group of women,  flaunting empty pitchers near the R &amp; B Guest House where the  Prime Minister was staying, demanding drinking water for Nandyal  town.    This was followed by a noisy demonstration by Rayalaseema  Paper Mills Staff and Workers Union while Mr. Rao was  inaugurating a flyover on the town outskirts. Angry at the Prime  Minister turning a deaf ear to their demand for reopening of the  sick mill, the workers went on a rampage in the town, burning  Congress(I) flags, pulling down arches and banners and damaging  the vehicles en route. About 3,000 men and women marched towards  the venue of the public meeting but were chased away by the  police. This incident too caught the district administration off  guard because a CITU (Center of Indian Trade Unions) delegation  led by Mr. N. Prasada Rao, its State Secretary, was allowed to  meet the Prime Minister.    Bullet proof enclosure: In response to these demonstrations,  the Prime Minister explained the Government's stand on Dunkel  proposals but did not refer to either the water scarcity in  Nandyal or the paper mill workers' demands. For the first time  in Nandyal constituency, Mr. Rao addressed public meetings,  standing behind a bullet proof glass enclosure.    Specific questions relating to the needs of Nandyal  constituency dominated the press conference that Mr. Rao  addressed at the guest house but his replies were vague. He  expressed happiness over the pace of developmental activities in  his constituency during the 25 months since his election but  refused to draw comparisons with Amethi, represented by late  Rajiv Gandhi. The press meet was a brief seven-minute affair.    Water schemes launched: Mr. Narasimha Rao's fifth visit to  his constituency was marked by the launching of two protected  drinking water schemes involving an investment of Rs.[rupees]3.5  crores and benefiting 31 villages, seven lift irrigation schemes  costing Rs. 1.30 crores, inauguration of a Scheduled Caste  housing colony and a Rs. 4.81-crore road bridge in Nandyal. He  also declared open a low power TV transmitter at Atmakur, the  only Assembly segment in his constituency, which did not have  this facility.    The Government media managers took pains to project the  progress in the constituency and circulated brochures  highlighting development activities at the press conference. But  the spate of demonstrations and the memoranda submitted to the  Prime Minister indicate that the expectations aroused in the  wake of his election still persist.</p>

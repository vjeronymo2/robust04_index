			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana plan 'a Pandora's box' PRESIDENT Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras yesterday said the European Commission would be opening 'a Pandora's box' by imposing a new European Community-wide quota on Latin American bananas of 1.4m tonnes. This would cut the Latin Americans' current market share by 1m tonnes and cost the struggling democracies in the region thousands of comparatively well paid jobs. The commission's proposal, intended to benefit banana exporting countries in the former European colonies, would require a waiver from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the president said on a visit to Washington yesterday. That would set a precedent for a barrage of waivers from countries wanting to protect sensitive farm sectors, particularly in the event of farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round. President Callejas said he had requested President Bush's support yesterday for denial of the Gatt waiver to the Community. Mr Bush's response was an enigmatic promise to 'be supportive of all decisions within the framework of Gatt'. The Hondurans argue that the proposed regime, like the existing regime, is inconsistent with the Gatt because it contravenes international commitments calling for the most complete liberalisation possible of trade in tropical products. It would undermine, rather than support, the economies of the developing countries at a time when their other agriculture products were facing severe market conditions. 'Coffee is at the lowest price in years,' President Callejas said. 'Our terms of trade are going against us.' Eventually, he said, the EC would have to change its policy. The inefficient countries, which had continued to produce bananas because of special treatment by the community, would have failed to develop alternative exports for which they were more suited; the Latin American countries would have suffered environmental damage by switching to inappropriate crops like maize. President Callejas expressed his determination to pursue free trade policies. On May 12, the first steps will be taken towards establishing a Central American free trade zone, initially including Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras, and later Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Honduras is hoping to join the Gatt in May. In 1996, it is planning to agree on a free trade zone with Mexico and in the same year it will pursue a free trade agreement with the US.</p>

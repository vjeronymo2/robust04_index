			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Auditing guidance on Cadbury planned THE AUDITING Practices Board is to produce guidelines for auditors on scrutinising big companies' statements about their compliance with the code of corporate governance recommended by the Cadbury committee. Such statements will be included in quoted companies' annual reports after June 30 this year. The guidelines are designed to support the recommendations in the Cadbury committee last December for auditors to comment on a company's compliance with the code. The board also plans to improve the consultation it carries out on auditing issues, according to its first annual review published yesterday. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman, said the board would establish new standards, but also called for other organisations to make changes to help widen the scope of auditing. His comments come after the board launched an ambitious examination of the future development of auditing. The board's work programme commits it to producing by the end of the third quarter a final draft of a technical standard on auditors giving a second opinion on another professional's work. It will also develop guidelines on reporting to regulators. Review of Activities. Auditing Practices Board, PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ. Free.</p>

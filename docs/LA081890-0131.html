			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> ANTI-GANG GROUP PLANNING CARWASH  </P> <P> On the southern edge of Anaheim, bordering Stanton and Garden Grove, is a tiny  neighborhood filled with old single-story, wood-frame houses. The neighborhood  is home to a decades-old gang, which for years has been part of conflicts  involving rival gangs from surrounding cities.  </P> <P> Dannue Mayo watched this longstanding dispute for the past three years and  decided to do something about it. In something of a one-man effort, Mayo set up  shop for his program, the Golden Opportunity Youth Assn., inside the Anaheim  Independencia Community Center in the heart of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> In the back room of the center, he is beginning to "break the ice" with  residents and show youths that in GOYA there an alternative to gang  involvement.  </P> <P> GOYA offers young people the use of weight-training facilities, job workshops,  counseling about how to prepare for interviews and field trips to learn about  life outside the barrio. The group plans a carwash today, for example, to raise  money for a trip to Sea World in San Diego.  </P> <P> In the month since the program began, about two dozen gang members have become  regular participants.  </P> <P> "I try to show them another way," said Mayo, a former counselor for the Turning  Point youth program who works as a shuttle bus driver in the Disneyland area.  </P> <P> In September, Mayo plans to start the county's first education program in which  young people can learn about civic and state laws that govern their  neighborhoods. In addition, he hopes to begin college preparation workshops in  September.  </P> <P> The group operates with money from donations and other fund-raising activities.  The city decided against funding GOYA, saying it duplicates services offered by  Turning Point. That youth counseling organization hit financial troubles and  closed last month.  </P> <P> GOYA's carwash today will be held outside the community center on Katella  Avenue between Brookhurst Street and Magnolia Avenue.

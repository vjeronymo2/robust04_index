			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter U Tuk-chong] </F>   [Text] The financial market is rapidly recovering from the  "nuclear shock" as evidenced by the quick rebound in the  composite stock exchange index to over 900 on 16 June from the  steep two-day plunge in the wake of the North Korean declaration  of its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The cash in the market was returned to the banking institutions  in the amount of 210.7 billion won and 42.3 billion on 13 and 14  June respectively, thus decreasing the cash currency rate from  9.2 percent to 9 percent last week. With the recovery of the  stock market, the financial market returned to a normal track.    The stock market, which plummeted as much as 32.3 point for  two days on 14 and 15 June as the general public investors  massively dumped their stocks, rebounded on 16 June as the  institutional investors bought stocks heavily as soon as the  stock market opened that day. The composite stock exchange  index increased by 10.16 points to 901.08 points.    The recovery came as the authorities tried hard to assuage  people's worries which abated considerably upon hearing of the  one-month grace period which would be applicable to sanctions  the United Nations may take against North Korea. The report on  the government plan to ease restrictions on the stock market,  such as the release of future deal items for the stock exchange  index and the abolition of the institutional investors' deposit,  also contributed to a recovery with the blue chips taking the  lead.    The stock experts say that although general public investors  are not yet completely relieved of their worries, institutional  and foreign investors are actively buying stock, and therefore,  the strength to support the stock market seems to be sufficient.    The currency in the market is following the pattern of  "supply on weekend and returning at the start of the week."    On 10 June, 470 billion won was issued for soldiers'  salaries  and 70 billion won went into the market fund for the weekend,  but 273 billion won returned to the banking institutions for two  days on 13 and 14 June. This is an amount larger than the 264.4  billion won that returned on 7 and 8 June after the 5-6 June  holiday.    On 14 June, 771.6 billion won--566.3 billion won of demand  deposit, 205.3 billion of savings deposit--returned to the  banking institutions. This is an amount similar to that  returning under ordinary circumstances. Therefore, the cash  issuance decreased to 12.6 billion won and 42.3 billion won on  14 and 15 June respectively.    The price of gold remained the same 41,200 won per Korean  ton  (3.7565 grams) since 10 June. Only the black market dollar  price rose from 820 won to 835 won per dollar on 14 June, but it  remained static on 15 June.</p>

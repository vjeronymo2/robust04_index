This was stated by  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at a meeting with the  heads of administrations of Russian krays and oblasts, when he  was summing up the results of elections to local bodies of power  that had been held in a number of regions.    According to Boris Yeltsin, "the elections were normal,  though not everywhere was their quality good." In June there  will be elections in the rest of the regions. "We must continue  work to truly provide a real division of power," stressed Boris  Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / DTI concludes investigation into Suter THE DTI investigation into share dealings by conglomerate Suter and its chairman Mr David Abell has found no evidence that these and other parties acted in concert, but has strongly criticised Mr Abell and several associates. The 147-page report calls into doubt some of Mr Abell's evidence, describing it as 'inconsistent' or seeking 'to mislead'. The report also questions the timing of private share purchases by Mr Abell in Suter's potential bid targets, and accused Suter's non-executive directors of failing in their duty to shareholders. However, the DTI - which ordered the report in July 1988 - said no further action would be taken. 'There are not sufficient grounds to take action as a result of this report,' it said. The DTI also declined to comment on a separate investigation into insider dealing. Suter confirmed yesterday it knew such an investigation had taken place but because of DTI rules on confidentiality, the outcome of the investigation is not known. The concert party investigation stemmed from a Channel 4 programme in December 1987 which alleged Mr Abell and connected individuals acted in concert in taking stakes in a number of companies in the mid 1980s, when Suter was growing rapidly through acquisitions. Mr Abell is suing Channel 4 for libel over the allegations, which he denies. The six companies studied by the inspectors included Metal Closures, an industrial holding company in which Suter built up a 21.3 per cent stake, and James Neill Holdings, a toolmaker. The inspectors found no evidence in any of the cases of parties acting in concert, although they brought attention to the close relationship between Mr Abell, his stockbroker Coni Gilbert and Sankey (CGS) and other individuals, described as the 'David Abell fan club', who followed Mr Abell's business ventures and occasional tips. 'We do not consider there to be evidence to suggest this fan club overstepped the mark and became a concert party,' the report said. But the inspectors express severe reservations about Mr Abell's actions in the Metal Closures case. Mr Abell acquired 100,000 shares in this company, the final purchase being made on 8 January 1987. Later on the same day, Mr Abell authorised the purchase on behalf of Suter of 350,000 Metal Closures shares. Suter was told by its financial adviser Robert Fleming that the shares held by Mr Abell should be sold at no profit to him. This advice was rejected by the Suter board, however, and the shares were sold at a profit of about Pounds 23,500. The inspectors further allege the shares were sold, by CGS, to a 'friendly' pension fund manager, Textilose Pension Fund Trustees. Suter welcomed the publication of the report yesterday. But Mr Nigel Blyth-Tinker, company secretary, said the inspectors made 'a number of errors'. Background, Page 16</p>

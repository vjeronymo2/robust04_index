			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Australia raises rates to 7.5% Official interest rates in Australia were raised by a full one percentage point to 7.5 per cent early today, the third upward adjustment since August. The Reserve Bank of Australia made its move at 9.30 am local time, as markets opened. The action was widely expected a week ago, following the regular meeting of the RBA board, and acknowledgments by both Mr Bernie Fraser, the RBA governor, and Mr Ralph Willis, the nation's treasurer, that the surge in the Australian economy needed to be moderated before it threatened the country's inflation rate. Economists, puzzled by last week's inaction, welcomed today's move, but suggested that a further increase might still be necessary in the first quarter of 1995. Figures published two weeks ago showed that the Australian economy grew by a rate of 6.4 per cent, year-on-year, in the September quarter, and by 7.3 per cent if the drought-depressed farm sector was excluded. This is the fastest rate posted by any OECD country in the current global recovery. Most economists believe that growth rates in excess of five per cent will be destabilising in the medium-term, although the nation's inflation rate remains under 2 per cent at present. Ahead of today's move, the RBA had already lifted official interest rates by a total of 175 basis points over the past four months - the first move coming in August and the second, in late-October. Mr Willis said today's rate rise reflected the government and Reserve Bank's commitment 'to maintain a low inflation environment and encourage further significant and sustained reductions in unemployment'. The government has also hinted recently that it may use fiscal means to depress demand. Earlier this week, in Sydney, Mr Willis indicated that higher taxes might be considered as part of the mid-year review in January, although he gave no hints about the type of changes which might result.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Autobahn etiquette - Judy Dempsey takes to the road in eastern Germany Planning to do business in eastern Germany that requires a lot of time on the road? Then get up early and hit the autobahn at 5am. If you don't, you will end up sitting in traffic jams. Just like the capital Berlin, the roads in eastern Germany are virtual building sites. Teams of diggers, bulldozers and cranes stretch along the motorways to Leipzig, Dresden, Rostock and Erfurt. More than DM80bn (Pounds 31bn) is being spent on upgrading the region's infrastructure. By 1996, it should be bliss to drive in eastern Germany - but that is of little comfort to those using the roads today. There are three golden rules for road users to remember, and some local habits to bear in mind. First, listen to the radio. The local radio stations for Berlin, Brandenburg and all the other eastern states provide the best travel information. Their traffic service people often fly over the motorways in helicopters, relaying news of the latest accident or roadworks. Take them seriously: they will tell you which side roads to take. The side roads run through small, cobble-stoned villages and towns. The only problem is that, without warning, you are likely to come across a small yellow sign with black lettering saying Umleitung, or diversion. These diversions are a bit like a long German sentence. You have to drive miles for the verb. If you have time, you can get an extraordinary glimpse of rural eastern Germany: the slow pace of life has no comparison in the west. You will also see a great deal of construction taking place, with former owners, ossies (east Germans) and wessies (western Germans), renovating the houses. The second rule is adhere to the speed limits. West Germans, brought up with no limits and fast cars, must be heavily subsidising the eastern road-building programme from the fines meted out to them. There are few cameras monitoring speed - except for a few miles outside Berlin and particularly on the two-lane motorway from Berlin via Magdeburg to Wolfburg, the headquarters of Volkswagen. But don't be deceived. The police are uberall. Unless you have a hired car, sooner or later a summons will land on your desk. And the penalties are stiff. You are fined DM1 for every kilometre over the speed limit, and DM1 for every kilometre of the speed limit. If you exceed the maximum 130km per hour, your licence could be confiscated. The third rule is to leave enough time. Do not believe your colleagues when they say it will take only two hours to reach Rostock, or less than three hours to reach Dresden from Berlin. Stretches of motorway are often reduced to single-lane or narrow double-lane traffic, and even these roads are bumpy. The speed limit is often 60km an hour, sometimes even 40km, and lasts for about 25km. Even if you have a trouble-free drive, it can take an hour to get from the motorway to the centre of some main cities. A case in point is Leipzig, Saxony, which is set to become one of the most prosperous cities in eastern Germany. As you turn off the E51, or number 9 motorway, towards the centre, you will see that hardly a patch of grass has been left unturned. Investors, with their armies of construction workers, are building shopping centres, garages and factories. This has attracted an unprecedented amount of traffic - and Umleitungen. Unless you really know the small side roads and streets into the centre, follow the signs. Whether you should also follow the local driving traditions is another matter. West German drivers are not known for their patience or courtesy. They rarely give way. They have little time for the ossies driving their two-stroke engine Trabants. If you take pity on a Trabby driver, who has been waiting an era to pull out of a side street, the chances are the BMW driver behind you will hoot loudly, flash the lights, and speed past you at the first opportunity with a snarl. One of the few former East German laws that have been incorporated into new regulations is that you do not have to stop at traffic lights leading right on to a main road, if there is a little green arrow beside the lights. The trouble is that west Germans still wait at the lights, while the ossies behind quietly fume. Perhaps a hoot is in order? Despite all these drawbacks, there are many positive aspects to driving in eastern Germany. Apart from the scenery - particularly through the lush plains of the northern state of Mecklenburg-western Pomerania - you actually see the progress being made. For example, the roadworks at Zehlendorf, the former border crossing from west Berlin into eastern Germany, have finished. And the stretch of motorway along the E13 just before Dresden is complete. Above all, once you reach your destination, you'll no longer have to face the drab, communist-style hotels, where receptionists said they were full when they were empty, and waitresses said the restaurants were packed as the loud band played to a few weary travellers. You'll no longer have to wonder about the availability of phones and faxes. In fact, it will almost have been worth setting out at 5am.</p>

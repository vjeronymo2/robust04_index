			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Fishing: In the steps of the master I DOUBT if there has been a cleverer, more clear-sighted trout fisherman than the dry-stick legal eagle, G E M Skues. The initials stood for George Edward Mackenzie, but he wasn't the sort of chap you hailed with: 'George, old man, how's it going?' Emotionally he kept himself to himself, lived with his sisters in Croydon, south London, worked for the same firm of solicitors for 60 years, and devoted whatever passion he had to a Hampshire chalk stream and its residents. Skues first fished the Itchen as a boy at Winchester, and I find it a consoling thought that he caught nothing at all for four months. Its pellucid water, emerald weed and highly scholastic trout gripped his intellect and imagination and never slackened. His great gift was to see through the surface, into the water. He observed, analysed, calculated, produced solutions. He was not, I think, a writer of the first rank, for his sympathies were narrow and he did not concern himself with the humanity and philosophy of the sport. But he was a stylist, in his dry, precise way, with a lawyer's sense of humour. And he was a brilliantly original thinker about fishing. As such, Skues made enemies among the English, who treasure mediocrity and conventionality. Without going too far into the abstrusities of fly fishing theory, it is enough to say that he stood the sport on its head. His great discovery was that chalkstream trout gained more of their diet from eating insects below the surface, than from snaffling those on it. It hardly sounds earth shattering, but the chalkstream code was built on the dogma that the only way to catch a trout was with an imitation of the floating fly. This code was long on hypocrisy, myopia and snobbery; distinctly short on commonsense. But its devotees, the English sport-loving gentry, clung to it with all the fierce, obstinate prejudice of their breed. And Skues, a thousand times brainier than they, and just as obstinate, danced rings round them in argument. I had long cherished the hope of fishing the stretch of the Itchen on which Skues developed his theories and practice, and from which he was eventually driven by ill feeling. It is called Abbots Barton, and lies on the outskirts of Winchester, where the roar of the bypass traffic competes with the chimes of cathedral bells where Isaak Walton's bones lie. No one could pretend that it is a place of untouched, sylvan loveliness. But between the road, and the housing estate, and the factories and warehouses looming through the trees, are spread the water meadows much as they were in Skues' day, dotted with copses and spinneys and intersected by the Itchen and its carriers. The fishing is still good, though not as good as in that golden era. The hatches of fly are comparatively plentiful, the water is pure, the fish are wary, and the condition of the place first rate. Much of the credit for this goes to a man as unlike the old-style Itchen stuffed shirt as it is possible to imagine. Roy Darlington is unmistakeably a Midlander, square-jawed, blunt speaking. When he came to Abbots Barton, it was derelict. Moved by the spirit of Skues, and with much help from his brother, Ron, and a band of companions, he set about clearing the little streams, shifting the silt, allowing the crystal water to move once more. He directed me to the main river that same evening. As I strolled across the meadow, I was thinking about the old ways, when a system of irrigating ditches led the flood water of winter to soak the land. I was wondering what had happened to these ditches when suddenly I fell into one. Squelching on to the river, I passed by the seat dedicated to Skues. Not a trout rose in earnest, until directed by a kind fellow angler I came upon cluster of them, feeding on a sparse hatch of bluewinged olives. Oh Skues of blessed memory, I thought, as I knotted an an Orange Quill. He it was who discovered that this fly, with its hot orange body, could pass itself off as the BWO in the late evening. The first fish I covered took it like a lamb, and fought like a tiger. When darkness fell, I made my way back through the meadow, with my two-and-a-quarter pounder in my bag and raised my hat reverentially to the shadow of a great fisherman.</p>

The traitor Kim Yong-sam showed up at the "Seoul City  office"  on February 7 and, talking about "the complexion of the recent  demonstration", blared that "violence against police would never  be tolerated" and that the "home minister" and the "police  agency director" must "counter violence relentlessly".    Recalling this, the news analyst says:    How can a democratic and peaceful rally and demonstration  intended to prevent the treacherous rice market opening and  defend the nation's dignity and right to existence be called  "violence"?    It is the "civilian" fascist group, not the innocent  peasants  and citizens, that became riotous in actuality. When a  demonstration of peasants and citizens broke out, the traitor  Kim Yong-sam branded it as an "impermissible violence" and  issued a ruthless repressive order, bruising many demonstrators.    As stark facts show, the real violence is the brutal  crackdown of the fascist clique which fired multiple tear gas  and brandished the sword against the barehanded peaceful  demonstrators, and the chief culprit in it is the traitor Kim  Yong-sam himself.    The traitor Kim, a puppet, has sold off to the United States  the rice market on which he had staked his "presidency" in  return for the "international cooperation system" intended to do  harm to fellow countrymen. He is, indeed, a rare traitor who  deserves a stern punishment by the nation for his arch crimes.    Suppression is by no means almighty. Fascist suppression  will only result in digging his own grave, being an act of  self-destruction.    The Kim Yong-sam group must stop cracking down on the  righteous struggle of peasants and other sections of people  against the rice market opening, promptly release the arrested  peasants and other demonstrators and step down without delay as  demanded by the South Korean people.</p>

Chairman of the association N.T. Mawema stressed in his  report that the Korean people achieved great success in  socialist construction, pushed aside the anti-DPRK and the  anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and renegades of  socialism and firmly defended the sovereignty of the DPRK under  the tested guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il last  year. He called for conducting the active solidarity movement  for defence of socialist Korea.    The general meeting discussed the question of significantly  celebrating the 82nd birthday of the great leader President Kim  Il-song and a series of measures for firm solidarity with the  Korean people in their efforts to solve the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula through the DPRK-USA negotiation.</p>

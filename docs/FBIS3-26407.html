NAFTA countries have a  population of 360 million, GNP of $650 million, and an annual  export volume of around $600 billion. In terms of economic  strength and market scale, NAFTA exceeds the EC and ranks first  in the world. Hence, it is bound to affect the economy of other  parts of the world, including Asia.    The reaction of Asia, particularly East Asian nations and  regions, to establishment of NAFTA is relatively complicated.  On the one hand, as trade volume between the United States and  East Asia accounts for one-third of each side's exports and the  United States is one of the main investors in East Asia, the  economic benefits brought by the free trade area to North  America will also benefit Asia. On the other hand, the  establishment of NAFTA will have an adverse influence on Asia's  economy in the near future. According to the provisions of the  NAFTA agreement, tariffs for most of the commodities of the  three North American countries will be abolished within 5 to 10  years while that of a small number of sensitive commodities will  be abolished within 15 years. However, countries outside NAFTA  have no right to enjoy such preferential treatment. This  objectively produces a discriminative effect. The agreement  also stipulates that over 65 percent of the component parts of  the commodities enjoying preferential treatment must be produced  within NAFTA countries. Such a provision concerning place of  origin will restrict exports by other countries to the U.S.  market. The development stage of Mexico's economy is similar to  that of many East Asian countries. As it is adjacent to the  United States and also enjoys favored tariffs for place of  origin, it will be in a better position in competing with Asian  products. Moreover, the United States will inevitably reduce  its quotas to Asian countries in order to give more  consideration to NAFTA. This will produce a great impact on  Asian countries and regions, particularly the four "small Asian  dragons" and ASEAN, which depend on the United States for their  export trade. Their textiles, garments, toys, electronics, and  other labor-intensive products will face a stern challenge in  the North American market. As there are bright prospects for  profits made in NAFTA, and Mexico has cheap labor and enjoys  preferential treatment within the area, it will naturally  attract some of the capital from the United States and even  Europe and Japan. A number of traditional investors in Asia  have transferred their investment from Asia to North America.    In the face of the new situation and challenge, Asian  countries have also adopted relevant measures.    To bypass trade barriers, Japan and the newly rising  industrial countries and regions in Asia are making use of  preferential NAFTA policies to expand direct investment in the  three North American countries, master scientific and  technological information, and assimilate advanced U.S.  scientific and technological achievements through enterprises  there. While the NAFTA agreement was still under deliberation,  Japan had already started making investment and running  factories in the southern part of the United States. The  Republic of Korea and other countries are also considering  investment in Mexico so they may also have a foothold in the  North American market. Apart from continuing their investment  in the United States, East Asian countries will also increase  their investment in Canada and Mexico.    The establishment of NAFTA will stimulate the readjustment  of  the industrial structure which is under progress in Asia, and  impel Asian nations to offer more cheaper and better quality  competitive products to take part in competition in the North  American market. Japan will focus more attention on developing  high-tech industries and industries that meet domestic needs.  The "four small dragons" will mainly develop information and  technology-intensive industries, making preparations for a new  leap in their economies. Taking the opportunity of the  production transfer in Japan and the "four small dragons," ASEAN  nations will vigorously import capital and technology from these  countries to develop intensive processing of primary products  and other manufactures, and further realize industrialization.    A number of Asian nations and regions will promote pluralism  of their economic ties and open up new channels of foreign  capital and trade. With a drastic cut in U.S. investment, the  Philippines will try to attract investment from Japan and other  countries. East Asian nations will also adopt measures to  gradually expand lateral exchanges within the region.    The establishment of NAFTA will also stimulate economic  cooperation within the Asian region. The six ASEAN nations have  decided to complete establishment of a free trade zone within 15  years, the first free trade zone in Asia, which will reduce  tariffs among the members to below 5 percent before the end of  the century. The ASEAN has also decided to organize an "East  Asian Economic Forum" as early as possible, which will exchange  and explore a wider range of economic cooperation. Because of  the diversity and varying development level of the Asian  countries, the conditions for carrying out cooperation in a wide  range and at a high level and for attaining economic integration  are not yet ripe. Therefore, maintaining an open, flexible, and  practical Asian economic consultation mechanism is obviously  better than establishing a closed type economic group.    The establishment of NAFTA will further promote pluralism of  the world economy and bring new opportunities and challenges for  Asia's economy.    Thanks to the advantages of its domestic market and cheap  labor, China's economy will not be affected in the short run.  From a long- term point of view, however, the challenges must  not be ignored. Meanwhile, East Asia, which includes China, is  the region with the most dynamic economy in the world today.  Hence, the establishment of NAFTA cannot change the focus of  the world on East Asia.</p>

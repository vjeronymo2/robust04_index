			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ivax pays Pounds 22m for Waverley WAVERLEY Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned contract manufacturing company, has been acquired by Ivax Corporation, the US chemicals and pharmaceuticals group. Waverley's owners have been paid about Pounds 22m in non-tradeable stock for the group which in 1991 had turnover of Pounds 9m and trading profits of Pounds 650,000. Mr Ian Black, Ivax's vice president international, said the company would continue to pursue companies throughout Europe in an effort to expand its marketing network and product range. The group already has expertise in tablet, capsule, injectable and aerosol delivery systems. It develops and manufactures both patented and generic medicines. 'This move will help us achieve our aim of becoming a fully-integrated pharmaceutical manufacturer with the capability to produce all dosage forms,' Mr Black expl-ained. Waverley, which specialises in blow-filled seal technology used in respiratory medicine, opthalmology, surgery and contact lens care, sells nearly all its products in Europe. Ivax has no previous experience in the technology, involving plastic containers which are blow-moulded, filled with product and sealed in one continuous sterile operation. The number of blow-filled seal units manufactured in the UK has increased from 6m in the mid-1980s to more than 300m last year. Waverley produces about half of these which it supplies to Ciba Vision, Boehringer Ingelheim and Boots. Waverley said it would use the additional resources provided by Ivax to develop and expand its manufacturing operations.</p>

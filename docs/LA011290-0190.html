			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'ROSEANNE' GETS A PEACEMAKER  </P> <P> A producer who specializes in handling hot-blooded talent has been brought in  to smooth relations between Roseanne Barr and the producers of her top-ranked  ABC-TV comedy series, "Roseanne."  </P> <P> Jay Daniel, a former producer at ABC's "Moonlighting," joined "Roseanne" with  the title of executive producer for Carsey-Werner Productions, David Brokaw, a  spokesman for the company, said Thursday.  </P> <P> Barr reportedly has wanted her character to express more anger than the  producers and writers would agree to. She had the show's creator and original  executive producer, Matt Williams, fired, and recently asked to get rid of his  successor, Jeff Harris.  </P> <P> "We're looking to make Roseanne happier," said Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner.  "Roseanne feels she needs another person to listen to her. So whatever we can  do to make her happy we'll do. The shows are wonderful, so whatever Roseanne  has to go through to get there, in the end, results in great television."  </P> <P> At "Moonlighting," Daniel was credited with settling problems between the  production company and Cybill Shepherd, who starred in the show with Bruce  Willis.  </P></p>

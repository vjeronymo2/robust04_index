			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> STREET REPAIR, MORE POLICE ARE BUDGETED  </P> <P> Major street repairs and an additional police officers are included in the  1990-91 budget adopted this week by the City Council.  </P> <P> The proposed budget of $16 million is up more than $289,000 over last year's,  City Manager Darrell Essex said.  </P> <P> "We are in good financial shape," Director of Finance Richard Storey added.  </P> <P> The additional police officer will be funded in January through the drug  asset-forfeiture fund only if the monies are available, Essex said.  </P> <P> Street repairs of more than $390,000 were approved by the council. A majority  of the projects will be in the northern part of the city, Director of Public  Works Robert Beardsley said.  </P> <P> Several long-range projects were also included in the budget. City officials  are developing a waste-reduction program which eventually will require all  residents to recycle.  </P> <P> Funding was provided for an overhaul of the city's record-keeping operation.  "We are in desperate need of modernization," Essex said.  </P> <P> More revenue is expected over the next few years when several redevelopment  projects, including the Sorrento Homes housing development and the addition of  a major hotel, are finally finished, Storey said. Also, the amount of money the  city receives from the Los Alamitos Race Course is anticipated to increase as  the new owners continue to improve the track.  </P></p>

The commission, which is responsible for providing premises  for the State Duma, is headed by the Federal Assembly's Chief of  Staff Vladimir Podoprigora.    The need for the meeting arose after the commission sent to  the president its official conclusion that the building (36 Novy  Arbat Street) and the adjacent Mir Hotel, set aside for the  State Duma, are unfit for normal parliamentary activities.    After hearing the arguments offered by the administration,  the commission believed they were unconvincing and unanimously  adopted its previous decision. In the summing-up document the  commission took into consideration the assurances that the  commercial structures, such as Mosbank, the International  Monetary Fund and others would vacate the building of the former  Mayor's Office by February 1. Also taken into consideration was  the administration's promise to finish the repairs and fit the  building by March 1. The commission said, though, that deputies  would not have normal working conditions in the building. The  above conclusion is to be considered today, at 19:00, at the  meeting of the Organizing Committee headed by Sergey Filatov.</p>

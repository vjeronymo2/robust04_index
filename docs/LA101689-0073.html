			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK VALLEY;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS WITH PRIVATE FUNDING OPEN FIRST  </P> <P> Officials in the Saddleback school district are finding that when private  developers and homeowners pay, new schools get built. When the state pays,  construction waits.  </P> <P> Two new elementary schools were scheduled to open in the fall, but only the one  paid for directly by local residents will open on time, officials say.  </P> <P> Construction on Eastlake II Elementary in Rancho Santa Margarita is expected to  begin this month, paid for by a special school tax in that neighborhood.  Construction of Pittsford Elementary in El Toro, to be paid for by the state,  is on hold until state money is available.  </P> <P> More than $75 million in new elementary schools and an intermediate school are  planned for opening in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District by 1994.  Most will be paid for directly by the residents who live in new housing  developments and pay a special school tax as part of their property tax.  </P> <P> The tax district was established in an agreement with the area's home builder,  the Santa Margarita Co., before residents moved into the new community, said  Bill Manahan, the district's business director. To provide schools, the school  board sold bonds, which will be paid off through the additional tax to  community residents. The tax charged to each depends on the value of the  property.  </P> <P> Schools paid for by the state are on hold because money from a $400-million  school bond approved by California voters in 1988 ran out in July. With $700  million in school buildings waiting to be funded statewide, the state may ask  voters to approve a $1-billion school bond next year, Manahan said.  </P> <P> NEW SADDLEBACK VALLEY SCHOOLS TO OPEN BY 1994  </P> <P> * EASTLAKE II ELEMENTARY  </P> <P> Location: Rancho Santa Margarita, Avenida de los Fundadores.  </P> <P> Open: September, 1990.  </P> <P> Cost: $5.5 million in Mello-Roos funds.  </P> <P> Students Now Attend: Trabuco Mesa Elementary.  </P> <P> * FOOTHILL RANCH ELEMENTARY  </P> <P> Location: Foothill Ranch development, north of Trabuco Road, west of El Toro  Road, adjacent Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro.  </P> <P> Open: September, 1991.  </P> <P> Cost: $10.7 million in Mello-Roos funds.  </P> <P> Students Now Attend: No students at present.  </P> <P> * NELLIE GAIL ELEMENTARY  </P> <P> Location: Nellie Gail Ranch, bounded by Red Corral Road, Mustang Drive, and  Nellie Gail Road.  </P> <P> Open: September, 1991.  </P> <P> Cost: $7 million in developer fees and proceeds from the sale of a portion of  the property.  </P> <P> Students Now Attend: Lomarena, Valencia and Linda Vista elementary schools.  </P> <P> * PITTSFORD ELEMENTARY  </P> <P> Location: El Toro, Pittsford and Northcrest drives.  </P> <P> Open: Originally scheduled September 1990.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us now listen to the reaction of the French  foreign minister to the killing. Alain Juppe spoke to Farida  Ayari a few minutes ago, as soon as he arrived in South Africa:    [Begin recording] [Juppe, in progress] ...my outrage at this  odious killing. We immediately took the necessary steps with  the Algerian authorities. Our ambassador has been received by  Prime Minister Redha Malek. As you know, we had taken  significant security measures, but of course, because the French  community in Algeria is so scattered, no security system is 50  percent efficient, or even 40 percent, as I said earlier.  Unfortunately, this was proven true the hard way.    [Ayari] Will you be taking other steps?    [Juppe] Of course. In particular we are going to try to find  out how we can reduce the number of staff at our official  facilities, so that civil servants are exposed as little as  possible. [end recording]    Asked whether France would close its consulate in Algeria,  Alain Juppe answered, I quote, we have not reached that stage  yet.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Keating has to reshuffle cabinet AUSTRALIAN Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle forced on his government by the resignation last week of his most powerful and influential strategist, Senator Graham Richardson, reports Emilia Tagaza in Canberra. The reshuffle, though minor, is another setback for Mr Keating. One of the ministerial posts was filled by someone who is likely to unseat another of his staunchest supporters in parliament, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Leo McLeay. The new minister for consumer affairs, Miss Jeanette McHugh, has represented a seat which was recently abolished in a redistribution ahead of the next election. Most voters in her constituency were moved to Mr McLeay's electorate. It is understood Miss McHugh is determined to get the seat back from Mr McLeay. Senator Richardson resigned last week after reports that he might have supported a relative's shady activity in the Marshall Islands. He was instrumental in delivering votes to Mr Keating in his leadership challenge to former Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke last year. His resignation, together with an increased budget deficit, threaten whatever political gains Mr Keating made in the last four months. Senator Richardson's former position as minister for transport and communication has been filled by Mr Bob Collins.</p>

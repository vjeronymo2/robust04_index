			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Li acquires HKDollars 500m Pacific Concord note MR LI Ka-shing's flagship, Cheung Kong, has increased its potential shareholding in Pacific Concord, through the subscription of a HKDollars 500m (USDollars 65m) convertible redeemable note. Cheung Kong already owns 8 per cent of Pacific Concord, a diversified industrial company which manufactures watches, cosmetics, and has retailing interest in China. If it converted its latest note, its shareholding would rise to 17.55 per cent. Cheung Kong said the deal strengthened its ties with Pacific Concord; the latter said the capital raised would allow it to develop its retail interests in China. Mr Li, whose company is cash rich, has taken a number of minority interests in local Hong Kong companies over the past year. The strategy seems to be to raise the rate of return on surplus funds, rather than anything aggressive. The latest Pacific Concord note pays 6 per cent, compared with money market rates of over 4 per cent. Last week Cheung Kong made a cash bid for the EIE Development which valued the company at HKDollars 1.7bn. It is also interested in buying assets from Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Great Southern at Pounds 5.24m Great Southern, the USM-quoted funerals group, yesterday announced a 12 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.24m. Turnover rose from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 29.6m. The shares improved 6p to 334p. Mortality rates decreased by a further 8 per cent in London and by 6 per cent in England and Wales during the past winter, significantly reducing the overall number of funerals and cremations. However, in spite of the decline the profits contribution of the core division, funerals services, was slightly higher at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.44m) because of tight cost control and further added value to the businesses. A recommended final dividend of 7.4p (6.7p) makes an 11p (10p) total. Earnings per share rose 2p to 24.4p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ole Mathismoen: "European Financial Aid for the </F> Kola Peninsula"]    [Text] The European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) will give 185 million kroner to make the  nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula safe.    Yesterday the board of the bank approved a detailed  investment plan for the Kola power station and two other Russian  nuclear power stations. A decision in principle to give money  was reached last year.    Certain negotiations with Russian authorities remain before  the work can start. In return the EBRD wants the Russians to  shut down some of the oldest and most dangerous reactors. On  the Kola Peninsula one possibility is shutting down one of the  two old reactors earlier than planned. Russian authorities have  announced that they will shut it down in the year 2000.    The money will come from the special fund for making safe  nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union  which the G-7 countries set up in 1992 and which has since grown  to sizeable proportions. Last year the Nordic area,  Switzerland, the Netherlands and the EU [European Union]  Commission joined the fund. The fund currently contains around  1.2 billion kroner. Norway has paid in 16.5 million.    The largest and most important of the planned investments in  Polyarnyye Zori on the Kola Peninsula is an emergency cooling  system. Today the power station would only be able to stand a  cooling system breakdown of an estimated six hours before the  reactor core in one of the four reactors would melt.    "The danger of accidents would be reduced as a result. The  employees would have much longer time for repairs," assistant  director Torbjorn Norendal of the Foreign Ministry said. He is  Norway's representative on the board of the bank.    Other elements in the investment plan are new and better  fire  equipment, instruments which are able to give operators more  rapid warning that an accident is taking place, equipment for  measuring radioactive emissions outside the power station  itself, a number of safety values, and other surveillance  equipment. Everything will go out to international tender. The  board bank will decide on the final allocation of funds at its  July meeting.    Norway has already donated equipment worth 20 million kroner  to the power station. It is Norendal's view that the money from  the EBRD will increase the safety of the power station  considerably.    It is planned that the investments will be made in the  course  of 1995 and 1996. The other two power stations which will  receive similar help are Sosnovyy Bor near St. Petersburg and  Novo-Voronezh south of Moscow.    Bellona [Norwegian environmental organization] was among the  first to raise the alarm about the state of affairs at the  nuclear power station only a few miles from Norway. Expert  Frederic Hauge is skeptical toward the EBRD's investment plan.    "This money does not solve the biggest problem. The main  threat is that the workers at the power station are not being  paid. It is now a month and a half since they were paid, and  last week there was a phone call with an anonymous threat that  reactor 4 would be set on fire if wages were not paid," Hauge  said.    He believes that it would have a great effect if Finland  stopped importing electricity from the power station.    "I would also have liked to have seen how much progress  would  have been made if the 180 million had been spent on energy  saving measures and the development of local gas power," he said.    A united Nordic area in the EU could mean large-scale  economic and expert support for the nuclear cleanup in the  north, Bettina Lorz of the EU's Environmental Directorate  (DG-11) said. She has played a central role in the EEA  [European Economic Area] negotiations and the negotiations on  membership for the Nordic countries. Yesterday she took part at  a seminar in Oslo on the EU and the environment.    She received the support of the EU's ambassador to Norway,  Aneurin Rhys Hughes: "As yet the EU has not allocated money to  the Kola Peninsula problems. This is something that will change  radically when Norway becomes a member," he said.    Bettina Lorz told AFTENPOSTEN that there are some  significant  funds in the EU which are to be used for important environmental  measures in Eastern Europe. Today they are being used to make  safe nuclear installations, primarily nuclear power stations, in  the immediate vicinity of today's EU countries.    "Even though the EU is of course already involved in what is  happening in the Barents Sea region, its involvement would  increase dramatically if Norway, Sweden, and Finland join. The  Kola Peninsula would then become the EU's closest neighbor in  the north," she said.</p>

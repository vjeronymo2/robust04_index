			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The estimated annual energy consumption is expressed in kilowatt-hours per year. It is the product of the input power and the representative average use cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The lamp efficacy is a ratio of lamp lumen output to total input wattage as determined by the use of the measurement procedures in Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;9&hyph;1988, LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982, LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991 or LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Color Rendering Index (CRI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Color Rendering Index is referenced in Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984 which the Department is incorporating by reference. This guide discusses several techniques for assessing light source color appearance. The relationship between color appearance and light source spectral power distribution is discussed, along with the systems for classifying color appearance. The basics of spectroradiometry and colorimetry are covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Color Rendering Index is determined by measuring the degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by a light source as compared with the color of those same objects when illuminated by a reference source of comparable color temperature. This index is determined pursuant to the International Commission on Illumination Publication 13.2&hyph;1974 which the Department is incorporating by reference. The method uses spectroradiometric measurements and a detailed calculation procedure. It is applicable to most general purpose lamp types including general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps and compact fluorescent lamps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spectroradiometric measurements and equipment setup follow the guidance in Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;58&hyph;1983 which is being incorporated by reference. This guide describes the equipment used in making spectroradiometric measurements, the procedures to be followed in using the equipment, and the precautions that should be taken to obtain consistently valid results. The methods are applicable to all lamp types, and are based on the measurement of the complete spectral power distribution of the source. Data presentation and error analysis are discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Number of Units to be Tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act specifies that applicable fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps shall meet the standard. Furthermore, the Act requires that the certification report include the lumen output and wattage consumption for each lamp type as an average of measurements taken over the preceding 12 months. The Department believes that the sampling plan for fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps provides a sound statistical basis for measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is adopting at &sect;430.23(r) a sampling plan based on a 99 percent confidence level for testing general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and medium base compact fluorescent lamps. The sampling provisions the Department of Energy is adopting today require testing a minimum sample of 20 lamps. The manufacturer must randomly select three lamps per month for any 7 of the 12 months required to determine the average. If there are less than 7 months' production, the manufacturer may divide the minimum sample of 20 as evenly as possible into each month of production. The provision for less than 7 month's production is to cover production runs of special or limited lamps which are subject to regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same sample of 20 lamps which were used for lamp efficacy testing shall be used for measurement of the Color Rendering Index. The Department believes that this testing requirement will satisfy the standard which calls for lamp efficacy and color rendering index measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes these provisions promote the objectives of the Act while minimizing the burden on manufacturers. Manufacturers and other interested persons are encouraged to comment on this sampling approach, as well as the underlying assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Jerry Brown takes up protest vote baton: New voice of national alienation It looks as if 1992's baton of political protest is changing hands. As, bit by bit, Mr Patrick Buchanan's Republican challenge to President George Bush fades, so that of Mr Jerry Brown to the Democratic frontrunner, Mr Bill Clinton, gathers steam. Election night in Illinois and Michigan saw Mr Brown, the former governor of California, promising 'to win the soul' of the Democratic Party back from the 'decrepit' and 'corrupt power elite'. His mission, he declared, was Jeffersonian, to ensure that a privileged few did not grow fat off the labours of the many. This is pretty much what Mr Buchanan has been saying all year on his conservative crusade - which now seems on the wane, albeit with lots of brave talk of the great battle to come in 1996. The question is whether Mr Brown on more or less the left will have any more luck than Mr Buchanan did on the right. There is a lot of truth to Mr Clinton's charge in their stormy debate confrontation last Sunday night that Mr Brown 'reinvents himself every year or two'. It certainly is the case that in 1976, when governor of California, he donned the clothes of the establishment to try and stop another southerner, Jimmy Carter, winning the nomination: precisely the reverse of his position today. There is also a tendency to remember Mr Brown as 'Governor Moonbeam', which roughly translates as a soft-centred, sometime visionary. This was reinforced in the 1980s by his sojourn with Mother Theresa in Calcutta and his study of Zen in Japan. This year's reality is completely different. He has proved opportunistic, sensing a national alienation in need of a voice; he is totally unscrupulous, as the Sunday debate showed, willing to play fast and loose with the facts and wildly misquoting the Washington Post article on Hillary Clinton's Arkansas law firm in order to drag Mr Clinton down; and, not unlike Mr Buchanan, he sounds like a xenophobe. Thus he constantly inveighs against the export of jobs to Mexico, to the point that his occasional qualifiers that he has nothing against Mexico per se get lost in the wash. He would leave only 1,000 US troops in Europe, cynically adding that a like number of European troops should be stationed in the US as 'exchange students'. Any attempt to discuss aid to the former Soviet Union is instantly reduced by Mr Brown into the greater need to create jobs at home. His family is intensely political: his father preceded Ronald Reagan as governor of California and his sister, Kathleen, is currently state treasurer. His political genes have clearly taught him to do whatever is necessary to win. His grab-bag of policy positions, often little more than slogans, strike a certain chord in an uncertain country, and did so with a vengeance in Michigan on Tuesday. Flat rates of tax, environmental activism, enterprise zones, public works on a grand scale, disengagement from most things foreign, have the beauty of simplicity. As the opponents of Mr Clinton have fallen by the wayside, and with Mr Paul Tsongas now barely competitive, Mr Brown has forced himself into the Democratic Party's considerations. Party leaders want him to go away, just as the Republican hierarchy has been urging Mr Buchanan to give up, because they know he is also not electable in November. They certainly do not want him to be the beneficiary of any subsequent scandal that really engulfs Mr Clinton. This is why Mr Tsongas, faute de mieux, will be privately urged to stay in the race. But his messianic perversity could see Mr Brown taking his insurgent troops with him on a third party candidacy in the election proper, as John Anderson did in 1980; or, almost as bad, that he will not be reconciled with the nominee, particularly if it is Mr Clinton, and keep them at home. He lifted few fingers for Jimmy Carter in 1976 and California, of which he was then Democratic governor, voted Republican. Yet the hard facts of primary politics, which Mr Brown sometimes does acknowledge, could also leave him with only the same alienated share of his party that Mr Buchanan commands among Republicans. He could do well in Connecticut next Tuesday and in New York two weeks later, while Wisconsin, which also votes on April 7, has been notoriously fickle in the past. But the increasingly impressive Clinton machine will now take some stopping. If it is derailed, it will be because of another 'character' controversy. Mr Tsongas, a decent man, will not have the taste to exploit it ruthlessly, but Mr Brown would.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           MICHIGAN AND ILLINOIS PRIMARY RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Jerry   Brown   Paul     Pat      George                          Brown  Clinton Tsongas Buchanan   Bush  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Illinois                  15%     51%    26%      22%      76% Michigan                  26%     51%    17%      25%      67% Delegates won Tuesday     48     181     66        0      147 Delegates won to date    129     947    430       46      707  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Democratic delegates   4,288   Total Republican delegates   2,209  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I am convinced that the Russian side is not  interested in aggravating relations or exploiting the so-called  Crimean card. Anatoliy Zlenko, minister of foreign affairs of  Ukraine, stated this in an interview for journalists. In his  opinion, it is in the interest of Crimeans and in the interest  of Ukraine as a whole to keep everything as it was prior to  these elections. I believe, the head of the foreign policy  department of our state emphasized, that politicians and those  who took part in the Crimean presidential elections will have  enough sense and strength of will not to complicate the  situation.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED FOR FIRING AT TEENS  </P> <P> A Rancho Palos Verdes man has been placed on three years' probation after  pleading no contest to a charge of firing a handgun into a carload of  teen-agers on a scavenger hunt.  </P> <P> Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook also ordered Carl Faulkner, a  44-year-contractor, to pay a $500 fine and to turn over his gun to authorities  to be destroyed, according to Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Ron Geltz.  </P> <P> Faulkner was charged with shooting into an occupied vehicle last June after he  allegedly fired one shot into a car carrying three Rolling Hills High School  students, slightly injuring a 16-year-old boy.  </P> <P> The May 28 shooting occurred after the students had gone to the home of the  school's varsity baseball coach, Gary Poe, to take Poe's license plate as a  prank.  </P> <P> Poe, alerted by his daughter that someone was outside their house, aborted the  prank, sheriff's investigators said. As the youths sped off, Faulkner, a  neighbor of Poe's, fired a shot at the vehicle, investigators said. Faulkner's  home had recently been burglarized.  </P> <P> Even though Faulkner pleaded no contest to a felony charge, Shook reduced it to  a misdemeanor, which carries less severe probation violation penalties, Geltz  said.  </P></p>

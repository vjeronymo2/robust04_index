			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Taha al-Basri: "Pelletreau's Allegations"] </F>   [Text] It has become obvious to political observers that  the U.S. Administration's repetition of the discordant tune that  Iraq is still threatening the Gulf states and that it has not  abandoned its ambitions to dominate the region is backed by  Zionist and Masonic elements which use people like Pelletreau,  U.S. assistant secretary of state for foreign affairs; Anthony  Lake, Martin Indyk, and others, as tools which they manipulate  whenever they want to create a state of tension in the region  that will ultimately serve U.S. and Zionist interests.    It is clear that Pelletreau's statements during his current  tour of the Gulf about the possibility of Iraqi rearmament are  intended to scare the Gulf states and to guarantee continued  U.S. domination of these states, the conclusion of more arms  deals with them, and therefore the gradual plundering of their  wealth.    This is because Pelletreau and the others know very well  that  Iraq, which fought grinding battles in the confrontation against  Iranian aggression for eight years, is not an element of threat  to the Arab Gulf states or to the security of the region, but is  a basic factor for ensuring the requirements of security and  stability for the region, as proven in the past when Iraq  protected, with the blood of its sons, the Arab Gulf states from  the greed and evils of expansionist Iranian policy. Were it not  for that brave Iraqi stand, these states would be in a different  situation today. Therefore, drawing a parallel between Iraq and  Iran today is a clear twisting of historical facts.    By his allegations, Pelletreau only tries to tell and  convince the Gulf states that they are in continuous need of  U.S. protection through the conclusion of joint defense pacts  and the purchase of surplus arms from U.S. arsenals, which they  do not need to defend their security.    This is because what is threatening the Gulf is not Iraq but  the U.S. presence, which is continuously seeking only its  interests, without being concerned about any other interests, as  past experiences have proven in various parts of the world. The  United States will definitely leave the region once it finds  that its interests no longer require its continuous presence in  it, as has happened in several cases.    It is natural for Pelletreau not to warn the states of the  region about the real danger threatening them, namely, the  danger of the expansionist regimes the United States itself has  helped create, as well as the Zionist danger, which is directed  not only against them, but against all the countries of the Arab  nation. This is because Pelletreau is manipulated by his  Zionist overlords as one of its obedient tools.    Pelletreau ignores that real danger and frightens the Arab  Gulf states with an imaginary danger he claims to be coming from  Iraq.    We must not forget that the U.S. Administration always  creates a false uproar whenever the UN Security Council is about  to review the unfair blockade on Iraq. The United States is  determined to shuffle the cards and create tension this time,  having realized that the initiative is no longer solely in its  hands, as was the case during the previous review.    It is no secret to anyone that the motives behind such U.S.  allegations are not to achieve security and stability in the  region, but to plunder its oil resources and serve Zionist aims.    The U.S. Administration was behind the ignition of the  Iran-Iraq War, the arrival of Khomeyni and the supply of arms to  his regime. The Irangate scandal is only one piece of evidence  branding the United States with collusion.    The United States, and no one else, creates terrorist  regimes  to disturb security and stability so it can deploy its forces  and fleets, occupy the region, and violate all international  conventions and norms as well as human rights which it falsely  claims to uphold.    So, it is not strange for statements to be released from  time  to time by dirty characters such as Pelletreau, Lake, and Indyk  who, as our Arab people know, are just tools manipulated by  Zionism and Freemasonry whenever they wish.</p>

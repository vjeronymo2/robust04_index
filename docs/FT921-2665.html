			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Decline reported in engineering orders MORE THAN a third of engineering companies in the west Midlands saw orders fall between November and last month, according to a business survey of the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands, issued yesterday. The survey, covering 455 companies in the British region most dependent on manufacturing, underpins national statistics which yesterday showed a 0.7 per cent fall in manufacturing between December and January. The proportion of companies experiencing fewer orders fell compared with the three months to November. Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the EEF West Midlands, said: 'Whilst more companies indicated a decrease in orders over the period than reported an increase, the gap has narrowed. Thirty-four per cent of respondents experienced an improvement whilst 37 per cent showed a decrease.' Mr Botterill expects only 'a slow, selective and rather tentative recovery from the present unacceptably low base'. The severity of the recession for manufacturing was emphasised by a report on business conditions by Staffordshire County Council, which said 46 per cent of companies in the county worked below 80 per cent capacity in December, compared with 39 per cent in September.</p>

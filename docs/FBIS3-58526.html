It has  not been forgotten by America. After a year of negligence, the  American President has now paid his reverence to Europe.  Although Bill Clinton's tight agenda bears resemblance to his  fellow citizens' package tours -- it is Tuesday, it must be  Prague -- it does fulfill an important purpose. A disheartened  continent gets support and, what is more decisive, it  experiences the first signs of political determination. Thus,  the doubts about this President's priorities in foreign policy  should be cleared for the time being.    Is America, thus, no longer banking on the "Pacific future"?  Is American politics returning to "Eurocentrism," of which  Secretary of State Christopher warned as recently as last  November? Still, all compliments and oaths of loyalty made by  Clinton cannot conceal where he sees his main challenges -- at  home, for the social and economic renewal of his country. Apart  from that, with its dynamic national economies and huge markets,  Asia remains an object of American hope. Europe, instead, only  creates interest at the other side of the Atlantic as a nuisance  factor [preceding two words in English], or a problem child.    Thus, for his trip, the President has neither been inspired  by compassion nor by nostalgia but by his very own interests.  This is also reflected in the most important statement of his  tour: "Europe remains central to our security." That means,  America's fate remains linked to Europe's. In light of the  atrocities in the Balkans, economic decline and spreading  nationalism, the President has reason enough to make his  contribution to stabilizing the continent. He is trying in  three ways.    First, with his appeal to the West Europeans' "collective  spirit." Clinton wants the success of the European Union. He  is no longer even terrified by the idea of an independent  security structure of the Europeans. The advantages of a  functioning Union are more important to him than the traditional  reservations: Such a union could assume a greater burden in  world politics, above all, it could have a stabilizing effect on  all of Europe. Those Europeans who ignore this one function of  European Union should let the U.S. President remind them of it.    Second, with his encouraging backslapping for the East  Europeans. The mixed reactions from the Central-East European  capitals may relativize the importance of the Partnership for  Peace. Yet, under American direction, it was NATO that started  to knit an all-European security network, even though it is  knitted coarsely still. If it is extended by ever increasing  economic streams between East and West, it may be much more  conducive to peace than military cooperation. Clinton's motto  -- "Trade is more important than aid" -- makes sense.  Particularly when America itself is opening its doors even  wider to goods from the East.    Third, with the support of the Russian reform forces.  Different than his predecessor Bush, Clinton banked on  intensive support for Russia from the very beginning. After  all, the idea of a bursting Russian nuclear empire is enough to  focus attention. Still, even the Kremlin could not expect lots  of money from the President's visit. Instead, Clinton had to  offer advice, respect, and the readiness to intensify  Russian-American dialogue. One result of the  confidence-building conversation is Ukraine's announcement to  give up its nuclear arms. Moscow and Washington were able to  move the Ukrainian president to commit himself to it. Yet, the  reluctant Parliament in Kiev still has to give its support  before at least this nuclear source of danger can be sealed off.    What are the impressions Bill Clinton will take home on  Sunday? Despite some success he is not likely to feel free from  Thomas Jefferson's "complete horror of everything that links us  to European politics." The President will have to put up with  it in the future, too. America's security does not leave him  any other choice.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Government to restrict incentives on BT sale THE GOVERNMENT will today announce the price for the first instalment of its Pounds 5bn BT stake sale and will take a harder line on incentives than in previous privatisations. Discounts for private investors will be 10p a share for the second and third instalments rather than 15p previously and the bonus for existing shareholders will be 1-for-15 rather than 1-for-10 as before. The discount for the first instalment will be announced later and will depend on demand. The cutbacks have been prompted partly by the government's need to raise as much cash as possible to counter its heavy public borrowing deficit. Also, encouragement for institutions not to sell short and drive down the underlying share price ahead of the issue pricing means that the discount offered can be tighter. Lower interest rates and lower returns from building societies increase the attraction of BT shares and reduce the need to boost the sale artificially. Advisers to the issue, which is being handled by SG Warburg, have signalled that the price for the initial payment of the issue will be between 140p and 150p. Although the issue is expected to be oversubscribed there are industry and market worries which could drag down share prices afterwards. The long-awaited Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas will land on ministers' desks just after the issue and highlight regulatory uncertainty. Also, some analysts believe the impact of wider competition, particularly from cable operators, has been underestimated. Meanwhile, the stock market is waiting to see the fate of the Pounds 1.3bn Zeneca rights issue which closes on June 21. If a significant amount of stock is left with the underwriters and the issue is considered a flop it could depress the stock market and affect the BT sale.</p>

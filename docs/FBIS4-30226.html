			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ]  Governor Yasushi Mieno said Friday [24 June] the possibility is  high that Japan's economy has begun moving toward a recovery.    Speaking at the National Press Club of Japan, the central  bank chief pointed to emerging bright signs on the economic  horizon in a remark following his past comments on the state of  the economy.    Mieno went on to say that corporate activities seem on a  recovery path, citing an improvement in personal spending in  some categories and increasing exports.    As for the yen's recent surge that saw it shoot past the 100  to the dollar level, Mieno said he has serious concern about  foreign exchange rates and noted that he will take appropriate  action whenever needed while keeping close contact with other  group of seven industrialized nations.    He said the yen's sharp appreciation should help promote an  industrial shakeup in Japan.    On corporate investment, one of the main driving forces of  the economy, Mieno said that it would take time to see corporate  investment in plant and equipment pick up because adjustments to  past excessive investment remain.    Mieno apparently made the comment in view of the nation's  gross domestic output for the January-March quarter announced  Tuesday, which showed the economy growing at an annual rate of  3.9 percent, or the best performance in three years, on the  strength of personal spending and not corporate investment.</p>

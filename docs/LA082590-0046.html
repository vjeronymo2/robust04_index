			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> ERLY Industries Inc.: The Los Angeles food processing firm said first-quarter  net income rose 820% to $1.2 million, while revenue dipped 8% to $108 million.  The firm attributed the gain to an increase in juice and rice shipments.  </P> <P> It noted that results were particularly encouraging in light of the fact that  shipments to Iraq were 27% of its total rice shipments, compared to 48% a year  ago. In March, it anticipated that, because of the uncertainty of future  government funding for rice sales to Iraq, it would diversify sales to other  export markets. "We continue to be confident that if rice shipments to Iraq are  prohibited, we will be able to replace that market with other export markets,"  the firm said.  </P> <P> Tables, D10  </P></p>

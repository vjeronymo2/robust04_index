			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Glittering keyboard refinement - London piano recitals Krystian Zimerman's glittering display of keyboard refinement and control at the Barbican on Sunday was an unqualified delight. Seven years ago at the Edinburgh Festival he gave what remains the finest piano recital I've ever had the good luck to hear, Richter, Michelangeli and Horovitz included; if this programme of Debussy, Chopin and Schubert never quite achieved the same exalted heights, it was still a hugely distinguished occasion, full of subtleties of texture and articulation, keenly focused energy and unfailing musical intelligence. In Debussy's Estampes Zimerman's powers were perfectly matched. 'Pagodes' was rendered in glinting, lapping pastels, 'Soiree dans Grenade' almost lazily impulsive, its climaxes vivid and intense, 'Jardins sous la pluie' made crystalline and taut, without a hint of wishy-washy, fake impressionism. Chopin's B minor Sonata was then launched with a similar directness and rhythmic elan, almost evoking memories of Lipatti's legendary recording. Zimerman did not quite manage to sustain the same concentration through the first movement; the development section brought the only moment at which his playing seemed to lack a sense of purpose and direction. Even that though was quickly redeemed by a serene unfolding of the slow movement and an ebullient finale, gilded by the most exquisite figuration. Schubert's B flat Sonata D960 was not conceived on an epic scale, nor would one have expected it to be. Everything was laid out generously - the first movement included the repeat and much beautifully rounded phrase making; the slow movement was nudged forward in a series of carefully sculpted paragraphs; the scherzo offered seamless flows of perfectly purled melody. Yet the finale revealed unexpected moments of sharpened intensity, suggesting an emotional undertow to the whole performance which still needs further performances to mature and well up to the surface. * * * At the Purcell Room the following evening under the auspices of the Kirckman Concert Society, the young British pianist Graham Scott offered an ambitious selection that included Beethoven's Op. 110 Sonata, Berg's Sonata and Chopin's Polonaise Fantasie, as well as Franck's Prelude, Chorale and Fugue and Rakhmaninov's Corelli Variations. Scott, who trained at the RNCM, made his Wigmore Hall debut four years ago; he seemed on the evidence of this recital an immensely polished and confident artist. The absolute technical control one quickly took for granted, but each of these performances also had an impressive clarity of purpose and dramatic strength. There are still moments when Scott rushes his climaxes - the rapt unfolding of the fugue in Op. 110 was marred by a hasty dash towards its climax, parts of the Polonaise-Fantasie were unhinged by an outbreak of assertiveness - but those few examples were more than counterbalanced by the calm distinction of so much of his playing. The way in which he wound down the coda of the Berg sonata, for instance, could never have been learnt by rote; its careful sifting of colours and layers seemed utterly instinctive and appropriate. Ian Fountain offered a curiously short programme at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Sunday, though he managed to elongate it to near-credibility. He is unmistakably a musician (at nineteen, he won the 1989 Arthur Rubinstein competition); I thought he traded upon that lucky virtue to the limit of indulgence. On Monday at the Wigmore Hall, the young Finn Juhani Lagerspetz delivered three heavy-duty piano works - Schumann's Carnaval, Skryabin's 5th Sonata and Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' - with tireless energy, imagination and dash, and without ever inviting us to admire his own pianism. We admired it the more, of course. Lagerspetz has all the marks of a committed, inquiring interpreter with a sterling technique, but is much too Finnish to make any overt show of that. By contrast, Fountain drew out his first-half Mozart - just the C minor Fantasia, K475, and the Sonata K457 - with infinite pains. He dwelt lovingly upon every phrase and exquisitely balanced chord, and seemed to be aiming at Debussy's ideal of 'a piano without hammers,' squeezing the notes tenderly from the instrument. None of Mozart's quick sections developed any momentum; there were too many delicate hesitations for that, too many phrases that went into a rallentando faint. (Some notes simply failed to sound; I wondered what it all sounded like further back in the hall.) After the interval, three of Liszt's Schubert transcriptions were subjected to the same treatment - even 'Aufenthalt'] - and then Schubert's 'Wanderer' Fantasy too, its virtuoso drive lost amidst so many sensitive shadings. It was bracing to hear Lagerspetz the next night: first in a fine, resilient Carnaval, tingling with character, but with sentiment kept firmly in check. His Skryabin was better still - flashing attack, contrasts brilliantly engineered, a complete command of the idiom and of the intricate form of the work. Lagerspetz's 'Hammerklavier' Sonata was a triumph. I have never heard it so vitally realised by a performer of his years. He took the opening Allegro at an intrepid pace, perfectly sustained with no loss of detail, and rounded the work off with a fugue of splendid transparency and pith. It was the great Adagio sostenuto, however, that made the greatest impression; he unfolded it very beautifully, with steady, searching, self-effacing authority. It was a full-blooded 'public' performance, certainly - but it lost nothing whatever by that.</p>

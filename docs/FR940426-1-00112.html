			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two basic life history spawning strategies for coho salmon: Short-run populations which utilize the smaller coastal streams, and long-run coho that will migrate up to 320 miles to utilize tributaries of large coastal rivers. Coho salmon may begin to enter freshwater in September but usually enter from October to March, peaking in December and January. In Scott and Waddell Creeks, spawning of coho salmon primarily takes place from the end of December through mid-February, usually coinciding with increased storm flows. After spending one year in freshwater, juvenile coho salmon migrate to sea where they usually spend two growing seasons before they return as adults to freshwater to spawn as 3-year-old fish. A relatively small portion of adult male coho salmon return to spawn after only one year at sea, and are termed jacks or grilses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consideration as a ``Species''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To qualify for listing as a threatened or endangered species, the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations would have to be a ``species'' under the ESA. The ESA defines a ``species'' to include any ``distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate *&blank;*&blank;* which interbreeds when mature.'' NMFS published a policy (November 20, 1991; 56 FR 58612) on how it will apply the ESA species definition in evaluating Pacific salmon. This policy states that a salmon population will be considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of the biological species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It must be reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the biological species. The first criterion, reproductive isolation, need not be absolute, but must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different population units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second criterion is met if the population contributed substantially to the ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Further guidance on the application of this policy is contained in, ``Pacific salmon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act,'' which is available upon request (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reproductive Isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For this criterion, NMFS considered information provided by the petitioner, information provided by knowledgeable sources, scientific documents, and commercial reports concerning the isolation of Scott and Waddell Creeks from other coho salmon spawning streams, the distance of the Scott and Waddell Creek populations to other coho salmon populations, the time of peak spawning, and a north-south genetic difference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Available information does not make a strong case for reproductive isolation of Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marked coho salmon from Scott and Waddell Creeks have been caught in the Noyo River 200 miles to the north near Fort Bragg, CA, and in the San Lorenzo River 15 miles to the south in the City of Santa Cruz, CA. Therefore, distance in the ocean is not a good measure of reproductive isolation from other coho salmon populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Radstone at Pounds 1m Radstone Technology, a supplier of open architecture computer subsystems, reported a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 221,000 to Pounds 1.01m, for the half year to September 30. The results are the first since it came to the market in February. Mr Rhys Williams, chairman, said the improvement mainly reflected a more even pattern of sales in the current year and the timing of shipments on a small number of production contracts. Turnover advanced by 22 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 12m) generating operating profits of Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 349,000). Earnings per share came through at 3.98p (0.12p) and a dividend of 0.825p is declared.</p>

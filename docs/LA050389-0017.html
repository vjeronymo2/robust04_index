			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ZIP-CODE ROUTE INTO UC;  </P> <P> GPA COUNTS, BUT WHERE YOU LIVE MAY BE JUST AS CRITICAL  </P> <P> California's system of higher education has been celebrated as the nation's  model system, providing equal access to the American dream. But a look at who  is admitted to the prestigious University of California campuses shows that ZIP  codes may be as critical as grade point averages in determining who gets in and  who stays out.  </P> <P> This is how the system works: The top 12.5% of the state's high school  graduates are eligible for the University of California; the top 33.5% are  eligible for the state universities; for everyone else there is open access to  community colleges with the option, after two years, of transferring into a  four-year institution.  </P> <P> California's goal has been a democratic one of making higher education  available to one and all. The reality, however, reveals a system that favors  the rich and the few. The list of the feeder high schools that send more than  100 students each to UC reads like a social register. It includes Beverly  Hills, Palos Verdes, Santa Monica, Rolling Hills, Palisades and, in the San  Fernando Valley, Granada Hills, Birmingham and Taft. With the exception of San  Francisco's Lowell and University high schools, the UC feeders are in  predominantly, if not exclusively, white, affluent enclaves. Not surprisingly,  the mean family income for freshmen at UC Berkeley last fall was nearly  $60,000, well above the national average.  </P> <P> Both the California Master Plan and Education Code are structured in such a way  that students not originally eligible for a state university may be able to  transfer after two years at a community college. But to the extent that  transfer from a community college to UC works at all, it works primarily for  the select, the affluent -- and principally the white -- community college. The  top 10 community college feeder campuses to UC for fall, 1986, were mainly in  affluent residential communities: Santa Monica (252 transfers), Diablo Valley  (241), Santa Barbara (227), Orange Coast (207), Cabrillo (151), El Camino  (143), De Anza (139), San Diego Mesa (138), American River (132) and Saddleback  (132).  </P> <P> By contrast, consider Fresno City College, which serves large numbers of  minority students from a predominantly agricultural region: Only one black and  four Latinos (out of a total student body of 13,000) transferred to UC in 1986.  Imperial Valley Community College, serving a similar student body, sent only  three Latinos to UC campuses out of a freshman class of 1,341 that year. At  predominantly black Compton College, only two blacks transferred to a UC campus  in 1986.  </P> <P> Statewide, the 106 community colleges in California sent a total of 189 blacks  and 485 Latinos to the eight UC campuses, an average of six minority students  from each college. Yet approximately 80% of underrepresented minorities who  enter college in the state begin their studies in a community college.  </P> <P> While it is surely important to maintain high standards, the goal of a  tax-based state educational system should be the development of talents and  skills from all socioeconomic groups. Public education by its very nature must  reflect the entire population that supports it. What California has, instead,  is a perfectly correlated system of family income to educational benefits --  that is, the wealthiest are rewarded with access to the University of  California; middle-income students end up at the California State University;  low-income students begin and end their higher education at community colleges.  </P> <P> One possible solution to the perpetuation of a hereditary elite is to expand  eligibility to UC and CSU to the top 12.5% and top 33.5% of students at every  high school. There is nothing in state law or the California Master Plan to  prevent this more egalitarian approach. Without such a remedy, California will  merely continue to favor students from those schools with honor courses,  enriched curriculums, well-equipped science laboratories and optimal learning  conditions.  </P> <P> Shouldn't a serious student at an inner-city school who graduates in the top  10% of his or her class have the same access to the benefits of California's  postsecondary system as his or her counterpart in an exclusive private or  magnet public school? If not, we should recognize that we are rewarding  accidents of birth and that our current system of admissions to the University  of California is, in truth, determined by ZIP code.  </P></p>

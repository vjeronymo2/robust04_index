			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski and Jerzy Pilczynski: "For </F> the Leftist Character--That Is, for Votes"]    [Excerpts] On 26 June the Union of Labor [UP] officially  joined the opposition. It decided that the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] moved to the center of the political scene, that  it is not implementing its election promises, and that it is no  longer the left wing. Thus, on our political scene, there arose  a dispute that has already often appeared in the history of the  left wing: What is the "proper" left wing, and what is only  pretending to be the left wing?  <H5>  A Favorable "No" </H5>   UP took part in lengthy negotiations with the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] and the SLD regarding the formation of the  government; however, it finally said "no." [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Opposition </H5>   At the Sunday session of the National Council, 38 persons  voted in favor of UP's passing to the official opposition, eight  were against, and one abstained. The decision is of some  significance chiefly in terms of propaganda. UP never was a  member of the governing coalition; in voting, it has acted for a  few months now rather like an opposition party. Thus, nothing  will change in the Sejm.    The coalition maintains its advantage. UP will not  necessarily increase the strength of the parliamentary  opposition. It criticizes the opposition from the position of a  leftist party--that is, from a position entirely different from  the positions of the Confederation for an Independent Poland,  the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, or the majority of the  Union of Freedom. It is worth recalling that UP abstained from  voting on the report on the implementation of the budget by the  Suchocka government.  <H5>  There Is Something Else Behind It </H5>   UP's decision to officially join the opposition is not  addressed to political groupings. Its addressees are supposed  to be voters--voters of UP, as well as voters of the SLD. The  UP Council argues that the SLD has moved toward the center of  the political scene, that it has ceased to be part of the left  wing, and that right now UP is turning out to be the sole  defender of leftist values. UP will be the leftist opposition  to the government, which, according to it, is centrist. At a 27  June press conference, Ryszard Bugaj said that the party's  decision to join the opposition will not cause any serious  political consequences in this parliament.    The argumentation is quite risky. No matter how far to the  right the SLD has moved--if it has moved in that direction at  all--it seems that an attempt to persuade voters that the SLD is  no longer part of the left wing cannot be successful.    However, UP is in a comfortable situation right now as the  last defender of the left. It will certainly act on behalf of  the people, to whom the SLD promised social values in the  election campaign, and the promises have not been kept. Thus,  UP will speak on behalf of not only those who voted for it but  also those who elected the SLD. It will hope that, among SLD  voters, there are people who are really disappointed with the  current policy of their party and will begin supporting UP  instead.    UP was established as the postsolidarity left wing. As such,  it enjoyed the sympathy of centrist and rightist postsolidarity  politicians as well. They hoped that its establishment would  break apart the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, attract  some of the more valuable groups from this party, and, as a  result, parties of the Polish People's Republic's origin would  be relegated to the margin. The last elections must have put an  end to these hopes: It became clear that SLD exists and will  continue to exist. When the PSL and the SLD formed the  government, it also became clear that sooner or later UP would  try to find a place for itself on the right side of the  political scene. The only thing that had to be done was to  choose the right moment.    From the UP point of view, it seems that it was high time.  The party has been going through some problems lately. It has  come to light that one of its politicians, Janusz Szymanski, is  a member of the Supervisory Board of the Posnania Bank, a bank  linked to the Elektromis company. Another UP leader, Wojciech  Lamentowicz, was among those who signed a report on the  condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  which caused such a great commotion. In addition, UP's  influence within "Solidarity" has decreased quite dramatically.  Finally, in the last self-government elections, the party  obtained poorer results than had been expected.    On 26 June, Bugaj's party started its long campaign to win  over SLD voters. It is not at all certain what results this  will yield.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Major faces setback in Maastricht vote THE GOVERNMENT was last night bracing itself for the possibility of an embarrassing House of Commons defeat over Maastricht despite Mr John Major's public plea to Tory Euro-sceptics to end their rebellion against the treaty. A defeat in the vote by MPs tonight on a minor amendment proposed by Labour would not wreck ratification of the treaty. But it would undermine seriously the prime minister's efforts to re-assert the government's authority at Westminster. Speaking at the Conservative spring conference in Harrogate on Saturday, Mr Major told party activists that the party could no longer afford the 'luxury' of disunity. That view was echoed in warnings from colleagues that important parts of the government's legislative programme were being derailed by the row over Europe. The general atmosphere of uncertainty in the highest ranks of the government was underlined by renewed weekend speculation about a July cabinet reshuffle. Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, rejected suggestions that he wanted to return to the cabinet this year as chancellor or home secretary. He has told Mr Major that he expects to stay at Conservative central office at least until next year. But Mr Norman Lamont's concern at the threat to his position as chancellor from other senior colleagues was underlined by evidence that he is seeking to improve his recent frosty relations with much of the media. With some senior Conservatives suggesting Mr Major should appoint a new chancellor in a limited July reshuffle, Mr Lamont has set up a series of high-level meetings with newspaper editors after his March 16 Budget. The chancellor's hope is that a favourable response to the Budget measures will strengthen his case for remaining at the Treasury until a more wide-ranging reshuffle pencilled in by Mr Major for mid-1994. Last night, the Tory Euro- sceptics were unmoved by Mr Major's warning that failure to ratify Maastricht would leave Britain 'irrelevant' in Europe. They signalled they intended to vote tonight for a Labour amendment to the legislation. The amendment, which would ensure that British representatives on the Community's new committee of the regions were elected rather than appointed, would not itself affect the treaty. But it would allow the Tory rebels and opposition parties to further prolong debate by introducing a so-called 'report stage' into the legislation's passage through the Commons. That would allow the rebels more time to press their case for a referendum on the treaty and would further disrupt the government's other legislation. Ministers were insisting that a defeat might yet be avoided. Tory business managers will today discuss the possibility of conceding the substance of the Labour amendment ahead of a vote in the hope of winning the support of the Liberal Democrats and other small opposition parties. In an attempt to increase the pressure on the Tory rebels, ministers said yesterday that new laws to enforce tougher penalties on young offenders and to reform Sunday trading hours were among those facing delay because so much time at Westminster was being taken up by Maastricht.

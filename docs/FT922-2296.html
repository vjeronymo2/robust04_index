			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A BETTER than expected PSBR figure, coupled with a view that recent falls had been overdone, boosted activity in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The squeeze on Monday in after-hours' trading was repeated early yesterday and the June contract opened strongly at 2,601, pulling the underlying cash market higher, and helping the contract establish a five-point premium to cash. Light selling then caused a slight retreat and June traded at a discount to fair value just before 11.30am. June found further support from the favourable performance of gilts and bonds and resumed its upward direction in the afternoon session, before settling into a narrow four-point range. It closed at 2,620, just off the day's high of 2,622 and up 27 from Monday's poor close and at a five-point premium to cash. With the expiry of June later this week, fair value stands at nil. Turnover reached 7,260 lots. The day in the options market was extremely poor and turnover reached a meagre 24,396 contracts, of which the FT-SE option traded a day's total of 10,905 lots. Hanson was the busiest stock option, trading 1,454 lots, with the August 200 puts particularly active. This was followed by BAT, in which 1,000 lots were dealt.</p>

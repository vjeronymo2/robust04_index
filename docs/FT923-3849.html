			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Abolition of wages councils opposed THE Trades Union Congress is hoping to exploit differences between government ministers and among employers in the campaign to retain the wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.47m workers. The TUC fears that abolition of the councils - which are most important in shops, hotels and the clothing industry - will feature in the next round of trade union legislation this autumn. But officials believe Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, is more reluctant to press ahead than some of her colleagues. 'Mrs Shephard is likely to have qualms about removing protection from 2m women workers and supporting a measure which is likely to discourage training,' one official said. The TUC hopes that retailers will be too busy with the campaign tp legalise Sunday trading to seek abolition of wage councils. The Confederation of British Industry does not support complete abolition but 'sector-by-sector review'. An NOP poll commissioned by the TUC has found that nine out of ten people support continued protection for people on low pay. The TUC argues that abolition would not create jobs and claims that 400,000 people are already illegally being paid under the minimum level. It also said that abolition would lead to a large increase in Family Credit payments.</p>

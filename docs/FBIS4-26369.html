			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- An international  commercial arbitration conference opened here today.    At the conference over 250 experts and scholars in the  fields  of economy and trade, arbitration and the legal profession from  30 countries will discuss the latest developments in  international arbitration, arbitration legislation and practice.    It is the first time that such conference has ever been held  in a developing country.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing sent a letter of  congratulations to the conference, which is co-sponsored by the  International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) and the  China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee  (CIETAC).    Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade and chairman of the CIETAC,  said at the opening ceremony that China has solved many  international commercial conflicts through arbitration in the  past 40 years, and its arbitration system has steadily improved.    China has become one of the major centers for international  commercial arbitration, he said.    Zheng said that China will spare no efforts to make its  economic laws come closer to international standards, especially  those of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.    Not long ago, he noted, China adopted a foreign trade law,  and laws of arbitration and commerce are now under discussion.    Earlier today, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with the foreign  delegates attending the conference.    He said during the meeting that the Chinese Government  always  supports not only the development of arbitration in China, but  also exchanges and co-operation between Chinese and  international arbitration circles.    Since China adopted the open policy in the late 1970s  arbitration has played and will continue to play an important  role in supporting the constant development of China's economy,  Li said.    It is learned that so far China has included arbitration  regulations in 14 laws, 82 administrative regulations and 190  local laws.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GREER SAYS HE 'STICKS BY' BOYCOTT;  </P> <P> VALLEY FOURSOME EMBROILED IN CRISIS AT SAN JOSE STATE  </P> <P> A day after asking himself "should I stay or should I go," Damon Greer offered  no apologies for taking part in a San Jose State player boycott of a Big West  Conference game at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday night.  </P> <P> Greer, a freshman point guard and 1988 graduate of Cleveland High, is one of 10  players who left the team Wednesday after complaining of harsh treatment and  negativity surrounding the program of Coach Bill Berry.  </P> <P> Redshirt freshman Sean Davis, a 1987 graduate of El Camino Real, also joined  the walkout. Kevin Logan, a non-scholarship player and a 1988 graduate of  Westlake High, and starting center Jan Svoboda of Glendale, a senior, decided  to remain with the team. San Jose State lost to Fullerton, 82-60, the Spartans'  sixth loss in a row.  </P> <P> Greer said that past player complaints to administrators had fallen on deaf  ears and that previous attempts to foster a better player-coach relationship  were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> "We're the first group to stand up to him," said Greer, a reserve who has  played in 11 games for the 5-12 team. "I've talked to other players who wanted  to but didn't make the move. We did and we stick by it."  </P> <P> The boycotters left school -- which is on a semester break -- Thursday and  spent the day discussing their plans with a San Francisco attorney, Paul  Menzoni of the Melvin Belli law firm. Greer said that the players who left will  not return long as Berry remains.  </P> <P> "Everybody has their own coaching style," Greer said. "We're sick of the way he  comes down on us. Our confidence is totally shot.  </P> <P> "We're supposed to enjoy this. Everybody here comes from a good program -- I  came from Cleveland -- we all know what it takes to win, the sacrifices you  need to make. We know what hard work is, but we don't need this."  </P> <P> Several boycotting players said in a press conference Wednesday that Berry's  verbal tirades and negative reinforcement made practices unbearable.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you just need a pat on the back," Greer said. "When it's all  negative, negative, negative, negative, you start to believe it, that you can't  do it, that there's something wrong with you."  </P> <P> Greer said that the group had not spoken with school administrators since  Wednesday and had no idea whether their scholarships are at stake. Sports  information director Lawrence Fan said that all 10 players boycotting the team  are on scholarship. The boycotting players' athletic scholarship status may be  determined in the next week, university spokeswoman Karen Rosenzweig said.  </P> <P> Berry on Thursday blamed the frustration of losing close games and faulty  guidance for the players' problems.  </P> <P> "They got some bad advice from the people they listened to," Berry told the  Associated Press. "The negative was really something they cling to."  </P> <P> The relationship between Berry and the team broke down when all 14 members met  with the coach Tuesday afternoon to air their grievances. The following day,  Greer said, some players reneged on their promise not to play, including Logan  and Svoboda.  </P> <P> "That's something that just sort of happened," Greer said. "We all looked at it  very carefully and went in as a team. Everybody was together and then the four  that are down (in Fullerton) now just sort of trickled off in their own  direction after speaking with the coach."  </P> <P> Logan and Svoboda joined Dwain Daniels and Tom Desiano as players who did not  go along with the boycott.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Randy Hoffman said that Berry would not be fired based on  player complaints and would remain until the end of the season. Hoffman said in  a press release that it was not the university's policy to dismiss coaches  during the season.  </P> <P> Berry said that he would continue the season despite the player walkout.  </P> <P> Greer indicated that none of the boycotting players have contacted others  schools about transferring and added that the players would meet today to  discuss their options.  </P></p>

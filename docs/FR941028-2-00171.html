			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> &bull;After each risk assessment, the staff responsible for TB control, in conjunction with other appropriate HCWs, should review all TB control policies to ensure that they are effective and meet current needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Examples of Risk Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples of six hypothetical situations and the means by which surveillance data are used to select a TB control protocol are described as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital A. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.6%. No areas or HCW occupational groups have a significantly greater PPD test conversion rate than areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is unlikely (or than previous rates for the same area or group). No clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred. Patient-to-patient transmission has not been detected. Patients who have TB are admitted to the facility, but no area admits six or more TB patients per year. The low-risk protocol will be followed in all areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital B. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.8%. The PPD test conversion rate for the medical intensive-care unit rate is significantly higher than all other areas in the facility. The problem identification process is initiated (Section II.K). It is determined that all TB patients have been isolated appropriately. Other potential problems are then evaluated, and the cause for the higher rate is not identified. After consulting the public health department TB infection-control program, the high-risk protocol is followed in the unit until the PPD test conversion rate is similar to areas of the facility in which occupational exposure to TB patients is unlikely. If the rate remains significantly higher than other areas, further evaluation, including environmental and procedural studies, will be performed to identify possible reasons for the high conversion rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital C. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 2.4%. Rates range from 0 to 2.6% for the individual areas and occupational groups. None of these rates is significantly higher than rates for areas in which occupational exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is unlikely. No particular HCW group has higher conversion rates than the other groups. No clusters of HCW PPD test conversions have occurred. In two of the areas, HCWs cared for more than six TB patients during the preceding year. These two areas will follow the intermediate-risk protocol, and all other areas will follow the low-risk protocol. This hospital is located in the southeastern United States, and these conversion rates may reflect cross-reactivity with nontuberculous mycobacteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital D. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.2%. In no area did HCWs care for six or more TB patients during the preceding year. Three of the 20 respiratory therapists tested had PPD conversions, for a rate of 15%. The respiratory therapists who had PPD test conversions had spent all or part of their time in the pulmonary function laboratory, where induced sputum specimens were obtained. A low-risk protocol is maintained for all areas and occupational groups in the facility except for respiratory therapists. A problem evaluation is conducted in the pulmonary function laboratory (Section II.K). It is determined that the ventilation in this area is inadequate. Booths are installed for sputum induction. PPD testing and the risk assessment are repeated 3 months later. If the repeat testing at 3 months indicates that no more conversions have occurred, the respiratory therapists will return to the low-risk protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital E. Hospital E is located in a community that has a relatively low incidence of TB. To optimize TB services in the community, the four hospitals in the community have developed an agreement that one of them (e.g., Hospital G) will provide all inpatient services to persons who have suspected or confirmed TB. The other hospitals have implemented protocols in their ambulatory-care clinics and emergency departments to identify patients who may have active TB. These patients are then transferred to Hospital G for inpatient care if such care is considered necessary. After discharge from Hospital G, they receive follow-up care in the public health department's TB clinic. During the preceding year, Hospital E has identified fewer than six TB patients in its ambulatory-care and emergency departments and has had no PPD test conversions or other evidence of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transmission among HCWs or patients in these areas. These areas are classified as low risk, and all other areas are classified as very low risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospital F. Hospital F is located in a county in which no TB cases have been reported during the preceding 2 years. A risk assessment conducted at the facility did not identify any patients who had suspected or confirmed TB during the preceding year. The facility is classified as minimal risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Identifying, Evaluating, and Initiating Treatment for Patients Who May Have Active TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most important factors in preventing transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are the early identification of patients who may have infectious TB, prompt implementation of TB precautions for such patients, and prompt initiation of effective treatment for those who are likely to have TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Identifying Patients Who May Have Active TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Health-care personnel who are assigned responsibility for TB infection control in ambulatory-care and inpatient settings should develop, implement, and enforce protocols for the early identification of patients who may have infectious TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Players have described  county fans as bland as white bread -- and Coach John Robinson once said his  team played better on the road without the fans. . . . A poll last winter  showed that in Orange County, about a third of the people wouldn't miss the  Rams if they moved and another third weren't sure. Mark I. Pinsky and Martin  Beck  </P></p>

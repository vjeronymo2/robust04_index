			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / End looms for Rome's councillors ATTEMPTS to keep alive the city of Rome's administration, already battered by corruption scandals, suffered a serious setback yesterday. This time it was the turn of Milan magistrates to take their investigations to the capital. Two councillors were advised by Milan magistrates they were under investigation for alleged corruption over contracts connected with Acea, the Rome municipally owned electricity entity. Five arrest warrants were also issued for former members of the Lazio regional council and former members of the Acea board. Last night, as a result of these arrests, the Lazio administration resigned. One of the Rome councillors, Mr Mario Gionfrida, a right-wing independent, tendered his resignation. At the same time Mr Franco Carraro, the Socialist mayor of Rome, commented: 'It looks as though the game is up and we will have to dissolve.' Among Italy's big four cities affected by corruption scandals, Rome alone has avoided the collapse of its administration. In recent weeks Mr Carraro has blocked a move by a reformist group to back a new Green mayor, but has been struggling vainly to find a consensus for further rule by his discredited Socialist-Christian Democrat alliance. The Milan magistrates' investigations follow confessions from politicians who have collected money on behalf of political parties from companies supplying Acea and Rome's municipally owned transport company, ATAC. They are said to have been taking a 5 per cent commission on such contracts. As a sign of the way Rome's local politicians were accustomed to treat kickbacks, the Socialist party issued a statement expressing solidarity with two of their colleagues alleged by the Milan magistrates' investigations to have collected L35m-L40m (Pounds 15,000) in 1988-90. 'This is an amount which in Rome serves only to produce two manifestos on a couple of occasions.' Rome has been affected by the investigations less than Milan, Turin and Naples. It is thus significant that the new push in Rome comes from Milan, raising once again delicate issues of the territorial competence of investigations. The main Rome investigations are into Anas, the state road building authority, the misuse of overseas aid funds, and fraud in subsidiaries of Efim, the state industrial holding now in liquidation.</p>

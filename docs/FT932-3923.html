			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks sails into Pounds 14m ship owning joint venture MERSEY DOCKS and Harbour is buying 50 per cent of Merchant Ferries, a roll on-roll off freight ferry operator on Irish Sea routes, in a Pounds 14m deal. It is the company's first venture into ship owning. Merchant Ferries, formerly wholly owned by Cenargo International, a private company, has three ships operating on the Irish Sea between Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland and the two Lancashire ports of Fleetwood and Heysham. Two bigger ships will shortly replace the pair on the Heysham route, which then will be chartered out pending redeployment on another Merchant Ferries route. The deal involves Pounds 4.8m cash and a guarantee of Cenargo obligations up to a maximum Pounds 9.1m. Merchant Ferries had net assets of Pounds 1.33m, excluding ship owning - then part of another company - at its last year-end, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 470,000. Mersey Docks already operates a lift on - lift off service between Liverpool and Ireland through Coastal Containers, a subsidiary which charters its ships.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $56 MILLION OF 'EMERGENCY' AID EARMARKED FOR JAILS  </P> <P> San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Tuesday released details of her request for  $103 million in state and federal assistance in the city's war on drugs,  issuing a plan that would devote $56 million to the construction and operation  of jails.  </P> <P> O'Connor and the emergency council that was formed after the city declared a  drug and gang "state of emergency" May 23 want the money to build a 750-bed  pre-arraignment detention facility that would cost $37.8 million over three  years and a 256-bed post-sentencing jail for drug offenders that would cost  $18.2 million during the same period.  </P> <P> The budget was released shortly after O'Connor, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos  and their police chiefs met in O'Connor's office with federal drug czar William  Bennett to ask for federal assistance in battling drug- and gang-related  violence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Can't Wait Another 10 Years'  </P> <P> O'Connor, who presented the plan to Bennett, said San Diego's streets are  "salvageable if we attack it now. We can't wait another 10 years. We can't wait  another three years."  </P> <P> The mayor, on May 23, asked Deukmejian to declare a state of emergency and  grant San Diego $34 million in aid from the state's $2.5-billion budget surplus  to fight drug- and gang-related violence that resulted in four deaths and 43  drive-by shootings during the first four months of the year.  </P> <P> The governor has not formally responded, but his spokesmen have questioned  whether the gambit is a publicity stunt and have said that the money would have  to be allocated through the legislative budget process where it would compete  with requests from throughout the state.  </P> <P> On May 30, O'Connor said that $34 million is not enough, and the request has  since grown into the $103-million spending plan released Tuesday.  </P> <P> The spending blueprint, which would devote more than half the funds to jails,  reflects Police Chief Bob Burgreen's often-repeated belief that detention  facilities are the city's top need.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quicker to Build a Private Facility  </P> <P> The budget envisions a privately operated facility that would be cheaper to  operate and quicker to build than a government facility. It also notes that the  cost to the city for bed space could be reduced if the jail were on federal  surplus land at a military reservation.  </P> <P> Over the next three years, the grant request also seeks $16.8 million for 89  more police officers in gang and drug enforcement units, $6.9 million to build  and operate four more courtrooms, $13.5 million for probation and drug  treatment programs, $5.7 million for 28 more staffers in Dist. Atty. Edwin  Miller's office and $4 million for community programs.  </P></p>

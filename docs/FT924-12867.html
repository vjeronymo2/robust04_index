			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Feltrim Names face Pounds 6m call to fund legal action LLOYD'S Names on the loss-making Feltrim syndicates are to be asked to contribute between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m to fund legal action aimed at winning compensation. Leaders of the Feltrim Names Association met at the weekend after receiving copies of a damning Lloyd's loss review report on Feltrim last Thursday. The association will on 12 November discuss its plans for legal action with its 1,500 members. Some 2,000 Names - the individuals who back underwriting at the insurance market - face losses of more than Pounds 450m as a result of their membership of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847 between 1987 and 1990. Sir Patrick Neill QC, who chaired the loss review committee, said that Feltrim managers 'did not understand the true nature of the London market excess-of-loss (LMX) business'. LMX business is a form of catastrophe reinsurance in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposure to large losses. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the association, said on Friday that information in the report would assist the legal campaign. The association, which is represented by solicitors Richards Butler, filed protective writs against a number of defendants earlier this year. Meanwhile Names who backed the Gooda Walker syndicates, which sustained losses of a similar magnitude from LMX business, will discuss their plans for legal action at a meeting at the end of November. Solicitors Wilde Sapte, retained by the Gooda Walker Action Group, are working on a statement of claim. The Gooda Walker loss review, sent to Names earlier this month, concluded that weak management and poor underwriting were responsible for the losses suffered by four Gooda Walker syndicates.</p>

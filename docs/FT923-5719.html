			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (1): Still in the fast lane - The government's goal is full industrialisation by the year 2020, requiring a growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the next 27 years. The challenge is immense, particularly in view of the dependence on foreign funds. ON A rainy evening earlier this month, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, stood in Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square and, with much fanfare and pageantry, unveiled the latest model of the Proton, Malaysia's home-produced motor car. It was a symbolic occasion. When Dr Mahathir first announced the Proton project in the early 1980s, many predicted disaster. How, they asked, could a poor country with under 20m people sustain such a project? The prime minister was suffering delusions of grandeur. Today, every other car on the Malaysian roads is a Proton, and the car is exported to 12 countries. At a time when car sales in most countries are falling, capacity at the Proton factory is being expanded, with plans to produce 120,000 cars in 1993 and 150,000 a year by 1995 (see also page 6 of this survey). As the Proton has bucked the international trend, so has the Malaysian economy. In the early 1980s, few would have predicted that the country would now be in the economic fast lane and have moved from virtual stagnation to a position where it is now expanding faster than any other economy in the south-east Asian region, with growth of more than 8 per cent in each of the past four years. The turnaround in Malaysia's economic fortunes began in 1987, a year which coincidentally marked a failed attempt to oust Dr Mahathir and subsequent measures which led to a more authoritarian style of government. The government made a big push for foreign investments: it also stepped up its much praised privatisation policy. In 1987, there was just over MDollars 2bn of foreign investment in Malaysia. In 1990, this rose to MDollars 17.6bn and in 1991 was MDollars 15.9bn. So far, more than 50 organisations, most of them former inefficient state enterprises, have been fully or partially privatised. In the first six months of this year, nearly MDollars 2bn was raised on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, much of it through the part privatisations of Proton and Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity utility. Malaysia has been transformed from a mainly commodity-based to a manufacturing economy. Economic success has brought a rise in incomes, virtually full employment and a new sense of self confidence. The goal now is full industrialisation by the year 2020 (termed 'Vision 2020' by the government's copywriters), necessitating a growth rate of 7 per cent in each of the next 27 years. But success has caused economic overheating, a growth in imports leading to balance of payments problems, a battle against inflationary pressures and serious infrastructural bottlenecks. The challenge of achieving Vision 2020 is immense. Malaysia remains to a large extent dependent on the economic health of its main trading partners, the US and Japan. It is also still heavily dependent on foreign funds, which account for 60 per cent of total investments in the manufacturing sector. Many foreign companies have extensive linkages in the local economy: but there is nervousness about competition, the formation of the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) and the leakage of investment capital. Malaysia faces serious labour shortages: not enough technicians are being produced to meet development needs. While the government has taken a tough stance on unions, in its efforts to hold down pay, wages are rising. Dr Mahathir has been in Malaysia's driving seat for more than 10 years. There's no doubting his readiness to meet these difficulties head on. Some are puzzled by his frequent attacks on the west. But often the prime minister seems to be merely emphasising that Malaysia must become more self-reliant. 'We do not want to beg from big nations like the US,' says Dr Mahathir. 'If we can stand firmly on our own feet, we will not be pushed down easily by the bigger powers.' One academic has referred to Dr Mahathir as 'a latter day Malaysian Ataturk . . . a man in a hurry, an impatient moderniser: a man with a clear vision of doing, achieving, realising, not merely preserving and maintaining.'* Less kindly, a former political foe once said that the prime minister, like the doctor he is, believes in prescribing strong medicine: 'The problem with Dr Mahathir is he is crass, rough and hard. This man pushes things down your throat.' Malays make up more than half Malaysia's population, Chinese account for about 30 per cent, and the rest is taken up by Indians and native peoples. For the past 20 years, the main thrust of Malaysian economic policy has been the eradication of poverty and the greater participation of the Malays or Bumiputras (literally 'sons of the soil') in the economy. In 1971, as part of a response to serious race rioting, the government inaugurated its New Economic Policy (NEP). It emphasised discrimination in favour of the Malays in the economy, and set a goal of having 30 per cent Malay ownership of the corporate sector by 1990 (see chart on page 2 of this survey). The NEP was a partial success: according to government figures, Bumiputras (including holding companies) controlled about 20 per cent of corporate equity by 1990. But new disparities have emerged within the Bumiputra community with the formation of a Malay elite grown fat on government handouts and favours. The government, the top echelon of which is Malay, says the NEP was essential to prevent a racial explosion, and still insists on policies which will give Malays a greater share of national wealth. But a new National Development Policy (NDP), covering the years 1991-2000, puts far more emphasis on growth as the principal way of achieving this goal. Dr Mahathir frequently berates Bumiputras for what he sees as their unwillingness to participate fully in the economy. The privatisation policy, while increasing Malay equity holdings, has encouraged what Dr Mahathir terms a 'get rich quick' attitude. Many Bumiputras have grown wealthy overnight through preferential share allocations, sold on at considerable profit. 'Because of a lack of confidence and patience, Bumiputras often sell their licenses, shares and contracts on at enormous gain. . . So long as the get-rich-quick attitude prevails, Bumiputras will fail in economic activities.' The new government message is clear: there will be fewer privileges from now on. The umbrella of the state is slowly closing. A policy which attempts to be less discriminatory and race-related carries considerable political risks. The raison d'etre of the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the party which has dominated Malaysia's politics since the days of independence from the British and headed by Dr Mahathir, is the enhancement of the Malay community. Factional fighting within Umno is a favourite political sport. There are those in Umno who would not look kindly on any move that might threaten the position of the Malays. The opposition - in particular, staunchly Moslem elements - can capitalise on Malay dissatisfaction. Umno is deeply involved in business, and through various holding companies influences performance in a large slice of the economy. A system of political patronage has been allowed to grow. Any attempt to unravel this could cause political ructions. Dr Mahathir does not tolerate fools easily. Information in Malaysia is carefully controlled. An emerging middle class might wish to have more of a say in the direction of policy. A confrontational approach to any opposition, whether at federal government or state level, does not seem to augur well for steps towards national integration. Dr Mahathir's strength lies in his government's management of a flourishing economy. As long as the economic cake is big enough and keeps growing, there seems little that can disturb the prime minister's pre-eminent position in Malaysian political life. But if there is an economic downturn then problems might occur. It is like the Proton story. Malaysia's car has been a great success. But it has been built with considerable financial and technical aid from Japan. Its sales have been greatly helped by high import tariffs on foreign models. Dr Mahathir is trying to make the Malaysian economy more competitive and less protected, to face the challenge of the years ahead. To stay in the economic fast lane will be tough going. *Clive Kessler in 'Fragmented Vision, Culture and Politics in Contemporary Malaysia', published by the Asian Studies Association of Australia.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Equipment orders survive the surgery All three services are to get new equipment as a result of announcements yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, but most of the orders had been expected regardless of the cuts which accompanied them. The value of the orders placed and invitations to tender was more than Pounds 5bn, Mr Rifkind said. Two additions to the MoD's list were an order for Paveway 3 laser-guided bombs and an intention to buy submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles if agreement can be reached with the US government and manufacturers. Both are being ordered in the light of experience in the Gulf war, where 'smart' munitions proved extremely effective. The Paveway is manufactured by Texas Instruments, but British Aerospace has substantial work on the weapon, which is dropped from Tornado ground-attack aircraft. McDonnell Douglas and Hughes of the US manufacture the Tomahawk. The Royal Navy is to get two Landing Platform Docks as replacements for the Fearless and Intrepid assault ships, which are due to be retired. Mr Rifkind announced that the expected invitation to tender for the amphibious landing vessels would be issued soon. Among UK shipyards, only Swan Hunter on Tyneside, in receivership, or VSEL at Barrow, in Cumbria, have facilities for such vessels. An invitation to tender has also been announced for a second batch of up to six Trafalgar class nuclear hunter-killer submarines, to replace the navy's ageing Swiftsure submarines. The competition for the order is expected to be between VSEL, the traditional submarine manufacturer, and Yarrow on the Clyde, which is owned by GEC. The Ministry of Defence said that the order was both to sustain the navy's anti-ship and anti-submarine capability and to maintain a UK nuclear submarine construction capability into the next century. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive of VSEL, said he was 'delighted that the invitations to tender have been confirmed. We have been expecting them for several months. Our teams working on these deals will go into top gear at once'. But he also expressed concern that the timings were further away than VSEL's previous understanding. Vosper Thornycroft won an order for seven Sandown class minehunters which will be built at Southampton. The order was worth Pounds 250m in total, with about Pounds 150m of the work to be done by Vosper. It secures about 450 jobs for four years, with production starting next year. Mr Chris Girling, finance director, said the company was 'obviously thrilled. This will continue a long tradition of supplying ships to the Royal Navy and further enhance our export prospects'. Widespread expectations that another batch of Type 23 frigates would be ordered were not fulfilled, though the MoD indicated that a further frigate order was likely later in the year - it is expected to go to Yarrow if a satisfactory price is agreed. The Army got the largest single order that was placed firmly yesterday, when it was confirmed that 259 Challenger 2 tanks would be bought from Vickers. The company was asked to tender for the tanks last year when it was decided not to update the Challenger 1 fleet. The order is worth Pounds 1.1bn in total and Pounds 800m to Vickers, and will secure work at the company's Newcastle factory until the end of the century. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, said the order 'is good for the Army and for Britain. It provides a formidable yet cost-effective weapons system. The endorsement of Challenger 2 will boost its export prospects in those markets which traditionally look to Britain for a lead'. Royal Ordnance received an order for 400,000 rounds of mortar ammunition worth Pounds 50m. The Royal Air Force was not forgotten. Its 14 Tornado GR1 ground attack aircraft are to get an extensive mid-life overhaul. The order, worth Pounds 700m, will secure 1,000 jobs at British Aerospace's Warton site in Lancashire, as well as a further 600 jobs in first-tier suppliers such as GEC-Marconi. The MoD stressed that the Tornado work would help maintain BAe's manufacturing base until production of the Eurofighter 2000 came on stream in the year 2000. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, welcomed the orders. 'This is worth a total of Pounds 1bn to BAe, and will secure jobs within the company and many of its suppliers.' BAe will benefit from the Tornado and Paveway programmes, and will supply command and control electronics for any Type 23 frigates and Trafalgar class submarines which are ordered. As well as procuring new weapons, Mr Rifkind said the forces' fighting capability would be improved by the retention in service of a frigate and a nuclear submarine which were previously to have been mothballed. He announced the formation of a joint services rapid reaction force, a move many Conservative MPs had been pressing for.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Blissful send-up of Tinseltown - Cinema THE PLAYER (15) Odeon Leicester Sq, Screen on the Hill GLADIATOR (15) Odeon West End RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER ICA from next week All the world loves a comeback. In Cannes, where Robert Altman's blissful Hollywood satire, The Player, won best director prize, Altman gamely insisted that he had never been away. But two decades have passed since his last palpable hit, Nashville. During that period Hollywood's favourite ageing hippy, the creator of MASH, McCabe and Mrs Miller and California Split, has marked time with fidget-inducing filmed plays like Streamers or commercial clinkers like OC &amp; Stiggs. Altman has never been away? As soon believe Rip Van Winkle if he claimed he had only nodded off for an hour. But in The Player Altman not only returns, he returns in style. He takes up the red carpet nervously laid out for him by Hollywood, puts it between his teeth and munches it happily for two hours. The nominal plot, derived from screenwriter Michael Tolkin's novel of Hollywood life and death, concerns the cover-up campaign of a young studio executive (Tim Robbins) who has murdered a screenwriter suspected of sending him poison pen postcards. The real plot, scribbled between the lines by a lovingly acerbic Altman, concerns the follies of the film community as millions of dollars are poured daily into an industry largely devoted to recycling yesterday's waste. We get the message in the virtuoso 10-minute opening shot. As the camera serpentines around a studio forecourt, following strolling execs or peering through windows, we eavesdrop on a dozen different conversations. The bespectacled film-maker pitching 'The Graduate 2', the young writer promising a script that's 'like Ghost mixed with The Manchurian Candidate', the studio employee shouting 'Hey, you're Martin Scorsese' to Alan Rudolph . . . This is the Tower of Babel passing itself off as a communications industry. The language spoken in Hollywood, as everyone who has been there knows, is Gobbledegook without subtitles. But that language also has a nightmare logic. 'I didn't know you had a drinking problem' says Robbins to fellow studio whizz-kid Peter Gallagher as the latter sets off for an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. 'I don't,' comes the reply, 'but that's where all the big deals are being made.' Meanwhile there is the stark-eyed English director (Richard E. Grant) eager to make a no-compromises anti-capital-punishment picture. This will end up as a gaudy jailbreak romp starring Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, playing themselves. There is Robbins's secretary-girlfriend sent to New York on a Wolfe-hunting trip, to sign up Bonfire Of The Vanities author's new book, while Robbins himself plays wolf to Greta Scacchi's fey Icelandic painter (ex-girlfriend of the murdered writer). There is the Hollywood-influenced priest at the funeral intoning 'It's been a long day - fade-out - thank you.' And there is the ceaseless round of Tinseltown parties, where celebrity-spotting becomes a form of delirium tremens. Oh look, there is Rod Steiger; Harry Belafonte; Cher; Elliott Gould; Spiro Agnew; Benjamin Disraeli; Plato . . . Most of the above appear for real in The Player. How an Altman at low career ebb persuaded them to lend cameo kudos to a low-budget comedy aimed at savaging the hand that feeds them is a mystery. But what a beautiful mystery. The film glides along like the invertebrate masterworks of Altman's heyday: those films that seemed all grace and no structure. The camera defies walls, passes through windows, peers under folded raincoats (where a rattlesnake may be concealed), observes the overlapping chatter and makes the filmgoer jump in pleasure at the surreal sight of a knee emerging from a mudbath. When in doubt, which is not often, Altman cuts to a comedy subplot serenely tangential to the Tinseltown themes. Whoopi Goldberg crackles through the story as a semi-crazed black woman detective, clearly overstrained by being every oppressed social sector's equal-rights representative. Like all masterworks, The Player is a film to be lost in. We are never more certain of its sense of direction than when we blithely query 'Where are we?' And we are only aware of faltering navigation when we can say 'Oh here we are', stuck with the indifferent love scenes between Robbins and Scacchi. Scacchi does her bushbaby-eyed, aren't-I-enigmatic routine. And though Robbins won a Cannes best actor prize for his sweetly creepy anti-hero, his natural passivity becomes dullish away from the film's satiric epicentre. Elsewhere, The Player will be remembered as a satire that pours scorn over its targets as if scorn were champagne not vitriol. It may also be remembered as the opening shot of a new and exciting epic - who says that some movie ideas are not worth recycling? - 'Robert Altman the Sequel.' ***** Gladiator should have come as part of the publicity kit for The Player. This is the kind of film Mr Altman is talking about when he suggests that modern Hollywood, or a large part of it, is brain-dead. Somewhere in Chicago, high school youngsters of all ages and races come together nightly in a giant lock-up warehouse to box. It is illegal, semi-suicidal and highly paid: Dollars 1000 for a night's work. Crooked promoter Brian Dennehy, a Satanically-lit hulk peering down on the ring from his office window, would like blood for starters, fear for main course and death for dessert. The merry patter of fist on facial bone continues for 101 minutes, sometimes interrupted by demented character work from Dennehy and Robert Loggia. The latter enjoys himself as a foulmouthed trainer. 'Frig this,' 'Frig that,' 'Frig you' he says. I am giving you the TV and airline version. But no amount of up-to-date expletives or multi-racial casting - James Marshall as the white hero, Cuba Gooding Jr of Boyz N The Hood as his black rival, Jon Seda as an excitable Latino - prevent this film from looking like an old Warner Brothers white slave melodrama of the 1930s. We keep wondering when Edward G. Robinson or Sydney Greenstreet will turn up, or James Cagney prance in hitching his shoulders and snarling 'You friggin' rat.' ***** I love the myths that grow up around film-makers at anniversary time. In the new issue of Sight And Sound, six pages are devoted to the memory of Rainer Werner Fassbinder who died 10 years ago this month. The critic writing the main essay, carried away by his own certainties, claims that RWF's weird tale of an abused transexual, In A Year With Thirteen Moons, was his most autobiographical film and that the director 'took personal responsibility for virtually all aspects of the film's production.' Ah yes. And pigs have wings. I watched two day's shooting on this movie in Frankfurt. Fassbinder, heavily into abusable substances at this time, failed to turn up one morning, vanished one afternoon, and even when present for filming tended to hand the camera to one of his actors to rehearse and shoot. Between sessions of waiting-for-Rainer I and another critic buzzed off to an ice cream parlour with main actor Volker Spengler. Since Spengler was dressed in drag, these trips tended to disrupt traffic and attract even more chaos around the production. RWF was a genius but not always a hands-on genius. Many of his best films were collaborative creations in the best Renaissance tradition, made with a team of cronies who might have been dubbed the Scuola di Fassbinder. To venture this idea does not diminish the achievement of his best work, represented in the ICA's coming season: The Bitter Tears Of Petra Von Kant, Effi Briest, Fear Eats The Soul, Fox And His Friends and the spellbinding Merchant Of Four Seasons. Fassbinder, with and without help, created a cinema that used seeming naivety of gesture and image to refresh our perception of truth, jaded from long decades of looking at the true naivety of Hollywood or the overwrought sophistications of Europe.</p>

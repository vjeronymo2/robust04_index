			<p>BFN     [Text] An official of the National Bank of Cambodia [NBC]  has revealed that from now on the state banks will halt their  joint ventures with the private sector. He said the state has  established joint ventures with five out of the nearly 30  private banks, such as the Overseas Commercial Bank, the  Cambodian Public Bank, Canadian Bank, and the Metropolitan  Corporation Bank.    In joint ventures with the private sector, some state-owned  banks have a small share, while others have larger amounts. But  in general, the shares of state banks are from the  diversification of their immovable assets in proportion to their  value, as agreed upon with each commercial bank.    This state policy to halt joint ventures with private banks  has already been promulgated by the NBC. However, the result of  its implementation is not yet known. The NBC has withdrawn its  capital from the private banks at the proposal of the Asian  Development Bank [ADB]. The ADB has suggested that since the  NBC is within the state structure, it does not need to establish  other joint ventures with the private sector. The national bank  should think only about improving its work and efficiency.    This official added that the joint state-private banking  system has been used in the last four to five years because the  nation has moved from a centralized economy to a free market.  This is because in the centrally-planned system, all banks,  like the factories and enterprises nationawide, were under the  control of the state, which would bear all their profits and  losses. But since the political system has changed, the economy  should also change likewise.    It should be recalled that during the past few years, the  NBC  has generated income for the state amounting up to billions of  riel annually.    According to the private bank law, a private bank will be  permitted to open a banking business only with a capital of $5  million upwards. Moreover, each bank, big or small, is  duty-bound to pay the state 50 million riel annually as business  tax.    It is learned that as of 31 May this year, the NBC plans to  stop allowing private-own commercial bank to open in Cambodia.  However, there will be some special cases concerning private  banks. That is, permission will be given only to the private  banks from big countries such as the United States, Japan,  France, Australia, and Canada.</p>

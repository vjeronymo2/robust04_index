			<p>BFN     [Text] The Movement of Women of the Revolutionary Front for  the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [Mouvement des Femmes du  FRAPH, MOFFRAPH] and the Haitian People's Power Youth  Organization [AJEPOPOA] say they are opposed to any form of  military intervention in the country. In a statement over Signal  FM, the two organizations denounce the latest measures being  considered by the U.S. Government, involving the reinforcement  of sanctions and possible armed intervention in Haiti. MOFFRAPH  and AJEPOPOA ask the Haitian people to rise up against such  decisions.    [Begin unidentified MOFFRAPH spokeswoman recording, in  Creole] MOFFRAPH is seeking independence and freedom. We prefer  to stand up and die rather than kneel down and die. We are  surprised to hear Americans will land on Haitian soil. So, we in  MOFFRAPH urgently call on the parliamentarians to fill the  presidential vacuum before they go on vacation. Courageous  women, courageous men, it is time. MOFFRAPH says: Grenadiers, to  the attack! [end recording]</p>

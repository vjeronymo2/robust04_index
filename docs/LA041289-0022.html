			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VITAMIN C HINDERS BUILDUP OF DEPOSITS IN ARTERIES?  </P> <P> Question: Is it true that taking Vitamin C can help prevent heart attacks? A  nurse tells me that this is the case. I've heard that Vitamin C is good for  colds, but I've never heard that it can keep a person from having a heart  attack.  </P> <P> Answer: Your friend may have deen referring to a study that showed that eating  foods high in Vitamin C may increase the amount of high-density lipoproteins  (HDL) cholesterol (the good cholesterol) in the blood. HDL cholesterol has been  found to prevent the buildup of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the  arteries, and therefore decreases the possibility that the arteries will become  blocked.  </P> <P> Q: Whenever I go shopping, I become confused by the number of different  products to choose from, all of them claiming that they are the best. With  cereals, for example, there seems to be a hundred different kinds on the  shelves. And when I shop for salmon, there's the red and the pink variety. I  usually go by which is cheaper, but is one better than the other?  </P> <P> A: From a nutritional standpoint, there isn't a great deal of difference  between red and pink salmon. They both contain about the same number of  calories and they both contain about the same amount of calcium and other  minerals and vitamins. However, the red salmon does have a little more of the  fish oil that may be medically important.  </P> <P> Pink salmon is more common than red salmon and, therefore, less expensive.  </P> <P> Q: My daughter wants to lose some weight, so she goes in a lot for low-calorie  foods. I don't mind this so much except that all she looks at are the calories,  without giving any thought to anything else the food might or might not  contain. Are calories the only thing a person on a diet should worry about?  </P> <P> A: The fact is that some low-calorie foods should be avoided by some dieters.  For example, many low-calorie frozen dinners are high in sodium. The same holds  true for a number of sugar-free diet soft drinks.  </P> <P> I look upon dieting as a means of enhancing the health of my patients. Any diet  that does not have this as a goal is probably not worth following.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any logical reason why so many people in some of the smaller  countries of the world seem to suffer so much from blindness? Aren't eyes in  one country the same as eyes in another country?  </P> <P> A: One of the most common causes of blindness in the developing countries is  cataracts. While cataract surgery is a fairly simple operation in the United  States, many of the developing nations do not have the surgeons needed to  perform the operation. The result is blindness that is preventable.  </P> <P> Q: I have heard a lot of talk about skin cancer, but I'm not certain what it  means. Would you please explain? I would also like to know if all skin cancer  is the same.  </P> <P> A: Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in one of the layers of the  skin. There are several different types of skin cancer, but the most common  ones are basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common; squamous cell  carcinoma; and malignant melanoma.  </P></p>

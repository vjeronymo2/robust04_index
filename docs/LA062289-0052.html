			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> BIDS TAKEN FOR RANCHO SECO  </P> <P> The utility that operates the Rancho Seco nuclear plant is taking bids for a  takeover of the power station that voters decided to close. The decision by the  Sacramento Municipal Utility District to take bids angered many of the  activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which has a history  of operating problems. The board majority argued that the ballot measure in  which the electorate decided to close the plant does not forbid someone else  from running it. The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the  $200-million to $300-million cost of shutting it down, said Joseph Buonaiuto,  board president. Voters had decided in a non-binding referendum to close the  plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is unsafe and uneconomical,  and a majority of the utility board agreed to abide by the outcome. The plant  was taken out of service and so far about 400 contract workers have lost their  jobs. The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an  operating reactor.  </P></p>

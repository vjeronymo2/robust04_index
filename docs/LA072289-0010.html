			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> As a professional estimator I deal with what can be bought for a given sum of  money. Here are two lists showing what can be had for roughly $500 million.  </P> <P> The first list: building of a new VA hospital, two small medical research  centers, 20 ten-unit apartment buildings, and 10 drug rehabilitation centers.  Also included are purchases of two F-16 fighter planes, 1,000 pickup trucks,  1,000 personal computers, five police helicopters, and funds to repair some  5,000 miles of highways.  </P> <P> The second list shows only a purchase of one B-2 stealth bomber.  </P> <P> Perhaps President Bush and Congress should study these lists. Maybe they might  come up with other lists of items financed by our tax dollars.  </P> <P> JOE HOFERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

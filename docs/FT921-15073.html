			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Talks on Georgia handover THE MILITARY council which seized control of Georgia after the flight of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia met parliamentary deputies of the republic yesterday to discuss transferring power back to a civilian government. Mr Gamsakhurdia fled the country a week ago after a violent two-week siege of Tbilisi's government building in which latest estimates say that 113 people died, with 420 injured. He was still in Armenia this weekend, in a mountain retreat outside Idjevan, 40km from the Georgian border. Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, said on Saturday he was offering Mr Gamsakhurdia and his family and personal guard temporary asylum in his republic, but all other supporters were being made to give up their weapons and leave the republic. In Tbilisi, the leaders of the ruling military council agreed in principle to a swifter-than-expected handover of power, but this was delayed by the failure of a meeting of Georgia's parliament on Friday to reach a quorum. Only 57 deputies attended; 90 were required. If parliament continues without a quorum, deputies have suggested it may be replaced by a national assembly composed of representatives of all parties, trade unionists, students, ethnic minorities, and local government officials. Further violent incidents were reported in western Georgia, where support for Mr Gamsakhurdia remains strong. Railway services in the area have also been severely disrupted because of a strike by railway workers. Tass quoted a local report that 7,000 passengers were trapped in about a dozen trains destined for Tbilisi and Yerevan, the Armenian capital. Fighting also occurred outside Akholtseki, on the border between Armenia and Georgia, when 60 Gamsakhurdia supporters trying to return home clashed with local police. Claims by the former Georgia opposition now trying to consolidate power, that Mr Gamsakhurdia was trying to set up a dictatorship, were backed the human rights group Helsinki Watch. The group documented what it called 'severe violations of human rights on the part of the Gamsakhurdia government'. These included violations of freedom of speech, freedom of teh press and the right to free assembly, as well as the imprisonment and ill-treatment of political opponents.</p>

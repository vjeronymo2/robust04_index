			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labels of candidates confusing Sir, On May 12, immediately after the close of nominations, the Devon branch of the European Movement held a public meeting at which six of the eight candidates for the Devon and East Plymouth Euro-constituency were given equal opportunity to speak. One candidate, named to us over the telephone from the returning office shortly after 4pm as the Direct Democracy Candidate, arrived at our meeting some three hours later as the Literal Democrat. As a result of concerns raised after the meeting, we sent a fax on May 13 to the returning officer about the clear scope for confusion between the labels of two candidates, already both described in Express and Echo of May 13 as Liberal Democrat. We pointed out that this could have 'a not inconceivable pernicious effect on the representation of this area in the European Parliament'. Our request for clarification of the descriptions was not acted upon. The election result fully justifies our concerns; the Literal Democrat, unknown and with no campaigning literature, obtained some 10,000 votes by deceiving large numbers of understandably very upset electors. The Liberal Democrat was a mere 700 votes behind the Conservative. It should be noted that the misleadingly described candidate was in a higher position on the ballot than the Liberal Democrat. In the interests of fair and proper representation my committee considers it necessary for a new election to be held in this constituency. Keith Cameron, chairman, Devon Branch, European Movement, Exeter</p>

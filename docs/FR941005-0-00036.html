			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the September 30, 1993, proposed rule, the Service requested that all interested parties provide information and comments on the status of arctic peregrine falcons, on the proposed delisting of the subspecies, and on the draft monitoring plan included in the delisting proposal. The appropriate foreign, state and provincial governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and encouraged to comment. During the 90 day comment period, 39 responses were received by the Service. Responses were received from one Federal agency, 9 foreign governments, 16 State governments, and 13 organizations or private individuals. No requests for public hearings were received. Comments concerning the status of arctic peregrine falcons and the proposed delisting are presented below; comments that addressed the proposed monitoring plan are presented in the Monitoring Plan section of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 39 responses, 24 (61 percent) expressed support for delisting, 5 (13 percent) opposed delisting, and 10 (26 percent) stated no position. Of those expressing support for delisting, 11 (the government of Trinidad and Tobago, 8 State governments, and 2 organizations) specifically addressed the need for the Service to implement the proposed, post-delisting monitoring plan. Two of those (the government of Trinidad and Tobago and the State of Pennsylvania) stated that their support for delisting was contingent upon implementation of the monitoring plan. One nation (France, which governs the colony of French Guiana in South America), three individuals and one conservation organization opposed delisting. No position on delisting was given by the governments of Canada or Greenland, which are the only nations other than the United States in which arctic peregrine falcons nest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responses to the Service's proposal to delist arctic peregrine falcons contained several concerns. In some cases, similar or identical concerns were raised by more than one individual or party submitting comments. Similar comments have been grouped; the different comments and the Service's response to each are listed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Arctic peregrine falcons are still at risk from natural and human-caused factors. Additionally, pesticides, in low-level concentrations, may interact synergistically with other human-caused or natural stresses to negatively affect arctic peregrine falcons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service recognizes that little is known of the effects of low-level pesticide contamination upon arctic peregrine falcons and the synergistic interactions of pesticides with other decimating factors. However, the Service must base its decision to list or delist species upon the factors discussed in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section of this rule. A species is protected if one or more of the five factors affects its continued existence. Since the late 1970's, arctic peregrine falcon populations have steadily increased in size, indicating that the cumulative and synergistic effects of pesticides and other decimating factors have been insufficient during this interval to threaten arctic peregrine falcons at the population level. The monitoring plan included in this rule is designed to detect any possible changes in the status of the subspecies following delisting, regardless of what factor or combination of factors prompts the change in status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of pesticides may increase in Latin America as agricultural development proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is concerned that arctic peregrine falcons and their migratory prey are exposed to pesticides during migration and the winter. Decreasing residues in blood and eggs show that contamination with pesticides is declining, however, despite continued agricultural development in Latin America. As part of the post-delisting monitoring effort, the Service will continue to monitor pesticide residues in arctic peregrine falcon blood and eggs so an increase in contamination can be documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential for over-utilization of arctic peregrine falcons for falconry following delisting has been underestimated by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take of arctic peregrine falcons will remain prohibited under the Act in the conterminous 48 States by the listing of all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falco peregrinus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> wherever found in the wild due to similarity of appearance. In Alaska take will be governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Section 2 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act requires that in adopting regulations for the take of migratory birds, the Secretary of the Interior is to ensure that take is compatible with the protection of the species. Therefore, take of arctic peregrines, as with other migratory birds, will be regulated so as to provide for adequate conservation of the subspecies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> anatum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Peregrine Recovery Team, Canadian Wildlife Service, expressed concern about harvest for falconry following delisting. This Team asked that the Service ensure that capture of migrant falcons will not remove birds from breeding populations not yet completely recovered. They suggested that this could be accomplished by allowing take only on the breeding grounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take of arctic peregrine falcons migrating through the 48 conterminous States will be prohibited under the Act due to the listing of all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Falco peregrinus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> due to similarity of appearance. Moreover, the management of migratory birds, including arctic peregrine falcons, is governed in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act provides for the cooperative protection of migratory bird resources that are shared by the Treaty signatory nations, including Canada. As the Service develops regulations allowing the harvest of arctic peregrine falcons, the concerns of other nations with which the United States shares this resource will be addressed. In particular, the Service will work with the appropriate Canadian officials to provide for the protection of breeding populations that have not recovered to the satisfaction of Canadian resource managers and recovery teams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission pointed out that the Service was incorrect in stating that arctic peregrine falcons winter exclusively in Latin America. An estimated 200&hyph;300 arctic peregrine falcons over-winter in Florida each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service acknowledges that some of the peregrine falcons over-wintering in Florida are undoubtedly of the arctic subspecies. The Service has updated its information on the subspecies to reflect this correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

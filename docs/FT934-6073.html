			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Tokyo's blues The Japanese authorities have long enjoyed an enviable reputation for astute management of the world's most dynamic economy. They are losing their reputation, as the economy has lost its dynamism. Worse, they seem unwilling, or unable, to do anything effective about it. Earlier this week Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, admitted that he could see no sign of recovery, though he doubted whether the recession would develop into a 'worsening spiral'. This is slight comfort. In any case, he insisted, the central bank had 'taken all necessary steps in terms of monetary policy,' after cutting its discount rate seven times since July 1991. This is an unpersuasive excuse. Even as he spoke, the ministry of international trade and industry disclosed that industrial production had dropped by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter. Prospects for industrial output also remain poor, with inventories 1.1 per cent higher at the end of September than three months earlier and the monthly index of leading indicators in decline. Meanwhile, real household spending was down 1.7 per cent in the year to September. With companies suffering declining demand at home and the burden of an appreciated yen, profits are inevitably depressed, as is the stock market, down 19 per cent since September. Economists share the gloom, disagreeing only over whether gross national product will stagnate or grow slightly next year, after stagnating or falling this year. Unlike Germany, Japan seems to be in the grips of a true deflation: wholesale prices have been falling at an annual rate of around 3-4 per cent a year, while consumer prices are rising at about 1 per cent. In the Japanese case, there is no excuse for monetary stringency. Yet broad money has grown little since 1991. No wonder nominal gross domestic product expanded by a mere 0.2 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 1993. Since the combination of expansionary fiscal packages with slow monetary growth tends to push up the exchange rate, monetary policy must be loosened as well. If low interest rates have little effect, the Bank of Japan could inject money via aggressive open market operations. The authorities could also increase the responsiveness of bank lending to interest rate cuts, by helping accelerate the removal of bad debts from bank balance sheets. Meanwhile, radical deregulation - including liberalisation of agricultural imports - should be sold as a way of dampening any incipient inflation and creating new opportunities for growth. Why should an economy with no inflation, huge productive potential and an exceptionally strong fiscal position suffer persistent stagnation? If the Japanese authorities cannot think of a really good answer to this question, they should try harder to stop it being asked.</p>

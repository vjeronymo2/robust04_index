			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Short-lived bank rally leaves Dow depressed Wall Street US STOCK markets remained depressed yesterday after an early rally in bank stocks fizzled out, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.17 at 3,304.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index managed to post a slight gain of 0.08 at 418.26, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.25 firmer at 567.86. New York SE turnover totalled a modest 183m shares. Wednesday's late decline was caused by a flurry of selling in the banking sector, where a variety of rumours, all of them unconfirmed, had depressed sentiment. When trading opened yesterday, analysts expected banks to recover the lost ground. Although bank issues posted early gains, they did not wipe out all the damage inflicted the afternoon before. The failure of the sector to stage a more substantial recovery kept the general market subdued. Citicorp, the biggest loser on Wednesday, rose early on, fell back, but then rallied again to end Dollars  5/8 better at Dollars 17 3/8 . Chemical, which moved in similar fashion, was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 33 1/2 , BankAmerica firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43 5/8 , and JP Morgan put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 60 1/8 . The best performer was Chase Manhattan, which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 7/8 , but the gain was still insufficient to cancel out the previous day's loss. Bristol Myers Squibb fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 7/8 in turnover of 3.6m shares after broker Smith Barney cut its rating from 'hold' to 'underperform' and reduced its third-quarter earnings forecast from Dollars 1.17 a share to Dollars 1.13. Willis Corroon dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 16 5/8 in heavy trading after the insurance broker reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 54.1m for the first half of 1992, down 22 per cent from a year ago. RJR Nabisco shed a further Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 1/2 after a second analyst in two days, Robinson Humphrey, lowered its rating on the stock because of pressure on tobacco margins. Fisher-Price lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 after PaineWebber, the securities house, revised its rating on the toy company's shares from 'attractive' to 'neutral', based on the price of the stock. On the Nasdaq market, In Focus Systems climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 9 1/4 on news of a joint venture which the company will form with Motorola (up Dollars 1 at Dollars 84 7/8 on the NYSE). Under the terms of the venture, Motorola will buy a 20 per cent stake in In Focus at Dollars 10 a share. Canada TORONTO finished firmer after quiet trading. The TSE 300 index gained 18.1 at 3,403.7 and rises led falls by 303 to 229 on volume of 23m shares. Banking stocks again were solidly higher on the positive report from Goldman Sachs, with the financial services index up 1.67 per cent. Republic Waste Industries, off CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 8 7/8 , said a California court has issued an adverse verdict in connection with a lawsuit involving Republic and GI Industries. Republic said a hearing will be held soon to determine damages, but it planned to appeal against any damage award.</p>

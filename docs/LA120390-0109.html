			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> MAN DENIED PAROLE IN WIFE'S DEATH  </P> <P> A former Thousand Oaks resident convicted twice in the death of his wife has  been denied parole by a Delaware parole board.  </P> <P> Robert D. Hughes, 42, a former math teacher at Ascension Evangelical Lutheran  School and a member of the Thousand Oaks church, was denied parole last week  because he would not admit he killed his wife, Serita.  </P> <P> "It did come up, and he continues to deny it," Parole Board Chairman Oliver W.  Casson said. Casson said Hughes can reapply for parole in a year.  </P> <P> After his wife's death in Delaware in 1976, Hughes moved to Thousand Oaks with  his two sons, where he drew supporters who believed he was innocent.  </P> <P> Some church members still keep in touch with Hughes regarding his case, said  Pastor Willis Moerer. Hughes taught eighth-grade mathematics at the Ascension  Evangelical church school in 1977 and 1978.  </P> <P> Hughes was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to a reduced  charge of manslaughter in September, 1985.  </P> <P> When he entered the plea, he had already served four years for two previous  first-degree murder convictions in the strangulation of his wife. Both times,  he was sentenced to life without parole.  </P> <P> But both convictions were overturned by the Delaware Supreme Court -- once for  prosecution misconduct and the second time because the jury may have been  prejudiced.  </P> <P> Hughes entered the guilty plea three weeks before he was to be tried a third  time. He has consistently maintained his innocence, even after he pleaded  guilty. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

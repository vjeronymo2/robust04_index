			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Brent Walker jury retires The jury in the Brent Walker fraud trial retired yesterday to consider its verdicts. After deliberating for the afternoon it failed to reach any decisions and was sent away for a night in a hotel. Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent Walker Group, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, its former finance director, are both accused of fraudulently boosting the company's profits between 1984 and 1989. Mr Walker denies four charges of theft involving Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the Brent Walker accounts to overstate profits and assets. Mr Aquilina denies one charge of theft involving Pounds 4.5m, three of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. The trial, in an annexe of the Old Bailey, started on June 2. The prosecution alleges that the Brent Walker profits were illegally boosted by Pounds 19.3m through bogus film rights transactions which in reality were funded by Brent Walker money. The transactions were then concealed by a complicated money laundering operation involving offshore companies and trusts in the Bahamas, the Isle of Man and Canada, it is alleged. The prosecution said profit-boosting enabled a healthier picture of Brent Walker to be presented to investors when the property and leisure group was expanding in the mid-1980s.</p>

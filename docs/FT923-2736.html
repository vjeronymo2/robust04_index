			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lopex cuts losses to Pounds 125,000 LOPEX, the advertising, public relations and marketing group, cut its pre-tax losses to Pounds 125,000, from Pounds 916,000, in the first half of 1992 as clients continued to reduce their spending. The interim dividend is passed again. Mr Peter Thomas, chief executive, said it was doubtful whether a final dividend would be paid. The policy would be reviewed when the group returned to profit, which would hopefully be next year. Turnover fell from Pounds 111m to Pounds 73.7m, although the bulk of the decline was accounted for by disposals. Lopex said the underlying contraction in volume was 4 per cent. A further 30 to 40 jobs were shed with more to follow in this half. Exceptional redundancy costs of Pounds 447,000 (Pounds 410,000) were, however, more than offset by the surrender of a lease on an acquisition's former head office in Grosvenor Gardens, central London. Mr Thomas said the carrying costs of empty properties used to exceed Pounds 1m, a large proportion of that would have been eliminated by next year. Most of the group's sales are in the UK. Advertising had suffered a severe squeeze on profits, while public relations and direct mailing had held up better. Marketing budgets were much leaner: 'The marketing director is no longer the key man on the board - that's the finance director these days.' After a quiet six months, clients were now considering their budgets for next year and there were signs of them starting to spend. The group's net debt typically stood at Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m and was stable. First half interest costs fell to Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 948,000) as disposals had brought down debt. Mr Thomas said the group had only Pounds 250,000 of earn-out payments left for acquisitions. Those liabilities had stood at Pounds 20m two years ago. Extraordinary costs amounted to Pounds 477,000 (Pounds 50,000) following a loss on selling a subsidiary and the write-off of goodwill. Losses per share were reduced to 1.22p (4.1p).</p>

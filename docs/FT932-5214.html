			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets suffered a nervous and finally unsuccessful session yesterday, although trading volume was below normal levels, writes Terry Byland. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE Index ranged between a healthy premium and a small discount against estimated fair value. During the early part of the session when the June contract reached a premium of around 12 points, there was some arbitraging between futures and cash. But this quickly disappeared as the contract dipped to a 4 point discount. The big institutions played little part in futures dealing, however, and the market trend was determined by two way activity by the locals, or independent traders. The absence of any interest rate change by the Bundesbank discouraged futures speculators at mid-session. In traded options, volume totaled 24,467 contracts with the FT-SE option contract taking up a major share with 13,778 contracts, nearly double the total for the previous day. Individual contracts were featured by the Euro-FTSE contract, where 2,659 traded, with Marks &amp; Spencer heading the corporate list with 2,070 contracts. There was activity in bank share options as some positions taken up on Wednesday were reversed. NatWest options traded 1,810 contracts and Barclays 1,630.</p>

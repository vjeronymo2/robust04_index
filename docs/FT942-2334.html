			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Observer: Who dares, loses out Britain's defence cuts are really starting to bite when the elite Special Air Service sustains an attack even it cannot withstand. Observer has learned that defence minister Malcolm Rifkind wants 50 per cent reductions in the two part-time SAS regiments, SAS 21 and SAS 23, leaving them with significantly less than 700 men combined. This comes on top of proposals - leaked earlier this month - to lop 10 per cent from the full-time SAS 22 regiment. In June 1993 Rifkind said he would be sacking some 4,000 UK army and naval reservists, but made no mention of shrinking the SAS. So low is SAS morale that one senior SAS officer reckons the British army now has 'less operational capability than Guatemala'. Dumping half the SAS reservists will save MoD less than Pounds 3m a year. Hardly a princely sum. In fact, half the cost of one British tank. It looks like cheese-paring of the daftest kind; after all, government spending on all reserve forces amounts to less than 3 per cent of the MoD's budget. The MoD prefers an opaque reticence. It says: 'Quantifying cost effectiveness is not a simple exercise in statistical analysis' - whatever that means. Slashing SAS 21 and 23 also sits rather oddly with Rifkind's recent trumpeting of his determination to use the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) - of which SAS 21 and 23 are considered the fighting spearhead - to plug gaps in the full-time army. As a defence policy it sounds like one step forward, two steps back - a marching rhythm unfamiliar to most British soldiers.</p>

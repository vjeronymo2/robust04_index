			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Discrimination Called: Actors Danny Glover and Robert Guillaume lashed out at  the entertainment industry Monday at the inaugural Robert Guillaume Script  Writing Awards, charging that discrimination against blacks is a persistent  problem.  </P> <P> In presenting the three awards, which went to students from Prairie View  (Texas) A &amp; M University and Chicago State University, Guillaume said: "Our  main hope here was to open doors that might not have ever been opened for  minority writers. The way things stand now, there's no such thing as equal  opportunity . . . in the entertainment industry." More than 100 colleges and  universities participated in the screenwriting contest.

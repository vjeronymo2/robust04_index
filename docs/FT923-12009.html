			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Kohl 'the key' to farm deal GERMANY's Chancellor Helmut Kohl is the 'key' to brokering a farm trade accord enabling a breakthrough in the long-delayed Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, according to Sir Christopher Prout, European Parliament vice-president. Noting the Uruguay round was now 'in crisis,' Sir Christopher told a conference in London on free trade it was 'absolutely crucial' for the west's recession-troubled economies to clinch a deal, and that Chancellor Kohl was the only European leader able to press the French government to make compromises on cuts in subsidised farm exports. He conspicuously omitted Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President, as a potential broker, presumably because of 'institutional deadlock in the EC system itself' over farm reform. Also omitted was Mr John Major, prime minister of UK, which is currently occupying the EC presidency. Mr Major failed at the recent summit in Munich of the G7 industrial countries to force a compromise. 'The key lies with Chancellor Kohl. He is the one man who can press President Mitterrand to give the necessary number of metres to clinch the deal. He has shown no inclination to press Mitterrand, but is going to have to do so,' he said. Sir Christopher was fiercely critical of the 'prehistoric' consensus decision-making process on EC farm policy, which he blamed for blocking reform. He called either for the introduction of majority voting on agriculture, or for responsibility for farm policy to be transferred away from Brussels and back to national governments. He also warned that Uruguay Round aims to liberalise trade could be frustrated by exchange rate manipulation, and said a supra-national currency arrangement would be needed 'if a Gatt-type multilateral trade agreement is to be sustained'.</p>

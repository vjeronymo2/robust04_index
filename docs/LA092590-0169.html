			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VENUS PICTURES 'REVOLUTIONARY'  </P> <P> After a shaky start, the Magellan probe is successfully mapping cloud-shrouded  Venus, beaming back "revolutionary" views of a heavily fractured, volcanic  planet that may be geologically active, scientists at the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena said today.  </P> <P> A brief but dramatic movie made with Magellan data was presented at a news  conference that simulated a zooming 12-mile-high flight above a tortured region  of complex faults and fractures. Other photographs released today, including a  giant 10-by-10-foot mosaic, show numerous volcanic craters, sharply defined Los  Angeles-sized impact craters and broad regions of cracked terrain covered in  places by lava flows indicating a possibly geologically active planet.  </P></p>

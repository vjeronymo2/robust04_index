			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: American Cyanamid shows improvement AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday posted third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 61m, or 68 cents a share, compared with Dollars 56m, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Earnings per share advanced more sharply than net earnings, thanks to fewer shares outstanding in the 1992 quarter. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars 1.12bn. The company's medical group saw higher sales and earnings in the quarter, led by pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Agricultural sales also advanced in the three months, and the group narrowed its traditional third-quarter loss. Cyanamid, which has been moving away from the chemicals business, said chemical sales fell in the quarter, largely reflecting the divestment of several businesses and the discontinuation of some product lines. Operating earnings for the chemicals group, however, rose in the quarter, led by paper chemicals, resin products and water treatment chemicals.</p>

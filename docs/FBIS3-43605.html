At the summit convened in the Senegalese capital because of  a  financial crisis facing the multi-national airline, its French  director Yves Rolland-Billecart a new five-year mandate.  Niger's former prime minister Amadou Cheiffou had been mooted  to replace Rolland-Billecart, whom some African governments had  accused of failing in his management of the airline.    The 11 heads of state and government gathered here called  for  a "financial audit" of the company.    Rolland-Billecart said his new plan provides for a profit of  300 million CFA francs (almost one million dollars) in 1994,  turning round a deficit of four billion CFA francs (13.6 million  dollars) in 1993. "There will be economies across the board,  but no cuts in staff," he declared.    Share-holders of Air Afrique are Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo,  the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire], Mali,  Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad and Togo.    The last recovery plan Rolland-Billecart introduced in 1989  led to the loss of 1,750 jobs among 5,000. The new  recapitalisation plan has been made necessary by the refusal in  December of the African Development Bank to contribute to a  raising of the company's capital, obliging each member state to  pay 500 million CFA francs (1.7 million dollars).    France has agreed to help out countries unable to do so.    At the meeting here, Guinea-Bissau became the 12th member of  Air Afrique. [passage omitted]</p>

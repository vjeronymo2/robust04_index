			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's new battle call in US phone war AN INTENSE marketing battle between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI Communications for US long-distance telephone customers took a novel turn yesterday when AT&amp;T trumpeted it had invented a method of 'dramatically improving' the sound quality of calls over its network. It said the new system made long-distance calls sound clearer, closer and more natural by boosting the base end of a call's sound spectrum. But the claim was immediately dismissed as a 'marketing gimmick' by an MCI spokesman, who added: 'It's not of any concern to us.' The new sound - called TrueVoice - is the latest of many attempts by America's largest long distance operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint - to add brand value to what is essentially a commodity service. As if to underline that point, some of AT&amp;T's self-promotion yesterday sounded remarkably similar to an advertisement for toothpaste or pet food. Mr Merrill Tutton, president of the group's consumer communications services, said research studies of AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI customers had shown that 'eight out of 10 people surveyed preferred the sound quality of AT&amp;T TrueVoice to current long-distance sound quality'. He claimed that TrueVoice 'does for the telecommunications industry what the digital compact disc did for the recording business'. However, some journalists who were among the first to hear the new system felt if it did represent any improvement in sound quality, then this was incremental rather than a fundamental breakthrough. AT&amp;T, the largest US long distance company, certainly needs to bolster its market position, for MCI, the second largest carrier, has been taking share from it through marketing initiatives. MCI has about 18 per cent of the long distance market, against 60 per cent for AT&amp;T and 9 per cent for Sprint. AT&amp;T said it would begin introducing TrueVoice in some parts of the US in September and would complete deployment across the nation by the end of 1994.</p>

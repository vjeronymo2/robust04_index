			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti on course to hit 1m ounces a year Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange last month, is still on course to become one of the world's few 1m ounces a year gold producers in 1995. This was revealed yesterday by Mr Sam Jonah, managing director, who also reported a marginal increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-March. The profits figure of Dollars 42.6m (Pounds 29m) was in line with most expectations and compared with Dollars 41.5m. Turnover increased from Dollars 127.3m to Dollars 142.8m and earnings per share emerged at 53 cents (52 cents). Mr Jonah said gold production in the half-year was below the budgeted 395,268 ounces at 380,581 ounces, principally because of a lower grade of ore processed at the Pompora treatment plant. A higher gold price encouraged Ashanti to use more low-grade ore from its stockpile. Also, a lower average grade of ore mined underground pushed Ashanti's cash costs from Dollars 157 an ounce in the same period a year ago to Dollars 184. Mr Jonah said these underground difficulties should come to an end in about a month's time. Ashanti expected production to increase significantly in the second half following the full commissioning of a biological sulphide treatment plant and further development of the underground mine. The production target of 860,000 ounces for the year was expected to be met at cash costs below Dollars 180 an ounce over the full year. The average gold price achieved before hedging in the half-year rose from Dollars 339 to Dollars 382 an ounce.</p>

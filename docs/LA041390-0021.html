			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YANKEES BEAT INDIANS IN OPENER, 6-4  </P> <P> Dave Winfield missed the 1989 season with back problems and went one for 29 in  spring training, fueling speculation the 12-time All-Star outfielder might not  be able to come back at age 38.  </P> <P> But Thursday at New York, Winfield doubled and scored the New York Yankees'  first run in a 6-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians in a much-delayed season  opener.  </P> <P> The teams were rained out Tuesday and snowed out Wednesday at Cleveland. They  returned to Yankee Stadium for a game, rescheduled because of the lockout, and  became the last two major league clubs to start the season.  </P> <P> "Everything I do is kind of new," Winfield said. "It's like I'm a rookie."  </P> <P> A crowd of 50,114 saw the Yankees win their fifth consecutive opener and John  McNamara lose his first game as manager of the Indians.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Luis Polonia, batting for rookie Mike Blowers, singled home the  tiebreaking run off reliever Doug Jones in the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Eric Plunk, the Yankees' fourth pitcher, went 1 1/3 innings for the victory.  </P> <P> Cory Snyder, who had a home run wiped out by the snow on Wednesday, hit a  two-run homer off Dave LaPoint in the fourth.  </P> <P> Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly, a notorious slow starter, had two hits,  including a run-scoring single. Mattingly is a .285 lifetime hitter in April,  38 points below his career average.  </P> <P> Detroit 11, Boston 7 -- Lou Whitaker hit the 150th home run of his career and  Tony Phillips had four hits at Detroit to help the Tigers end an 11-game losing  streak against Boston.  </P> <P> Whitaker's two-run homer off rookie Mike Rochford in the first inning gave  Detroit a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> Phillips singled in two more runs during a four-run second inning.  </P> <P> Former Angel right-hander Urbano Lugo relieved Frank Tanana in the fifth and  earned his first victory for Detroit.  </P> <P> Tony Pena hit his first home run for the Red Sox in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Toronto 7, Texas 1 -- Fred McGriff, Pat Borders and Kelly Gruber hit home runs  to lead the Blue Jays at Toronto.  </P> <P> McGriff's second-inning homer off Jamie Moyer was his first in his past 108  at-bats and tied the score, 1-1. McGriff led the American League with 36 home  runs last season, but his last homer was on Sept. 4 against the Chicago White  Sox at Comiskey Park.  </P> <P> Borders hit a solo homer and Gruber had a three-run home run during a four-run  seventh.  </P> <P> Mike Flanagan (1-0) allowed five singles in five innings, struck out one and  walked none.  </P> <P> Moyer (0-1) allowed four runs and nine hits in six-plus innings.  </P></p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Money and Credit: Fed spells out bond auction reforms THE REPERCUSSIONS of last year's Salomon Brothers bond trading scandal continue to reverberate around the US Treasury markets. Earlier this year the government unveiled plans to reform the bond auction system - the process by which the Treasury sells new government securities to the dealing houses and investing institutions. The new system would involve an ascending-price plan which allocates securities based upon the lowest interest rate bidders are willing to accept. All bids would be submitted electronically, and every participant in the new, 'dutch', auction would be able to see the bidding at every stage. At the close of each auction, the securities would be distributed to bidders at the same price. The amount of securities each bidder receives would depend on the interest rate they were willing to accept. The Federal Reserve Board, which, with the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched an investigation into ways to improve the auction system in the wake of the Salomon scandal last summer, has now explained why it thinks its proposed new auction process would be an improvement on the current system. The Fed's thinking has been laid out in a paper written by Mr Vincent Reinhart, chief of the Fed's banking and money market analysis section, and reportedly the architect of the new auction plan. In the paper, the Fed admits the current system was susceptible to 'squeezes' and 'corners'. A squeeze occurs when one or a small group of bidders buys up most or all of a new issue - in effect, cornering the market - and uses its position to force rivals, especially those who sold the new issue short, to pay more for the securities. Mr Reinhart explains how firms that wanted to create a squeeze or a corner could prey on three weaknesses in the existing auction system: one, there was always a core of reliable demand for the securities from short-sellers who had traded in the when-issued market; two, the method of allocating the securities made demand at the auction acutely price-sensitive; and three, the use of sealed bids meant a 'cornerer' could place bids only marginally better than the consensus, yet win all the awarded securities. The paper went on: 'Clearly, one dealer with adequate capital could take advantage of the system.' One such dealer was Salomon, which with its billion dollar capital muscle, could afford to swallow huge amounts of the newly auctioned securities. The Fed's conclusion, therefore, was that the design of the current system provided dealers and investors with incentive to manipulate the auction process. Despite these inherent faults, the Fed does not believe the current system is entirely bankrupt. Moreover, Mr Reinhart's paper acknowledges that the proposed new system may also be open to abuse, and that setting up a real-time auction will pose a daunting technical challenge. In particular, it warns of potential hazards in the transition to a new system. The biggest fear, and one voiced by many of those who oppose the new plan, is that investors will be reluctant to enter the new auction because of unfamiliarity with the process. Most of the opposition to the plan is coming from the primary dealer community. They already face a loss of value in their dealership franchise, with the government pledged to open up bidding to a host of other financial institutions. Even worse, if the proposed changes are introduced, primary dealers will no longer have crucial inside knowledge about the progress of each auction. In the current auction process, the primary dealer's exclusive access to the Fed means investors feel they must bid through the dealers if they are to stand a chance of being awarded any securities. Under the new system, customers will be confident of bidding on their own because the crucial inside knowledge - who is bidding for what - will be on the screens for all to see. The Fed is not rushing into anything. In June it plans to host, with the Treasury, a seminar on the proposals. After considering the views of the securities industry, it plans to start experimenting with the new system next year. Everything, however, will have to wait until the automation of the current antiquated auction process is finished.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                       Friday      ago     ago       High        Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly   average)              3.50     3.75    4.19      11.00       2.00 Three-month Treasury   bills                 4.09     4.15    4.02       8.29       3.76 Six-month Treasury   bills                 4.27     4.37    4.12       7.70       3.89 Three-month prime CDs   4.30     4.32    4.16       7.17       4.01 30-day Commercial   Paper                 4.25     4.23    4.15       7.12       3.90 90-day Commercial   Paper                 4.25     4.30    4.15       7.02       3.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last   Change             1 week      4 wk.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cuban Foreign Minister's Surprising </F> Remarks"]    [Text] During the brief visit he made to our country,  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina disclosed to the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies some of the unusual  concepts used by Castro's regime in its assessment of  international reality.    The Cuban foreign minister thus disclosed to Uruguayan  representatives the fact that "the time was not ripe" to  institute political changes in his country "due to a still  prevalent foreign pressure," an obviously allusion to the trade  boycott imposed by the United States on the island's communist  regime.    Furthermore, Robaina commented on the alleged violations of  human rights in his country, noting that "the only argument  those who are waging a human rights campaign against Cuba can  cling to (sic) is the issue of political liberties and party  affiliation."    The Cuban foreign minister has therefore openly paraded his  lack of familiarity with current democratic thinking, according  to which his remarks sound, if nothing else, surprising.    Indeed, his mere admission that the U.S. trade boycott is  used as the underlying reason for the Cuban regime's systematic  refusal to open the gates of freedom of expression in Cuba  constitutes the clearest acknowledgment of the essentially  arbitrary nature of the Cuban dictatorial regime.    Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to  present the U.S. boycott as a "blockade," an "embargo," or a  kind of "sanitary cordon" that is virtually driving Cuba to  famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the  case. The United States has imposed a trade boycott on Cuba,  thus severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the  eyes of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to  be simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the  United States. Not in vain has Castroism been preaching to the  hemisphere, for nearly 40 years, about the most drastic rupture  possible with the United States.    What is still more serious, however, is the attempt by Fidel  Castro and his followers to construe this international  political reality as the cause for their adamant refusal to  allow Cubans to have access to democracy. This means, in the  strictest sense of the word, that Cuban citizens are truly  hostages to the communist regime.    Within this context, Minister Robaina's utterances  concerning  the campaign denouncing human rights violations -- which can  "only cling to" (sic) the systematic contempt for political  freedom, including freedom of association -- are even more  revealing.    It is obvious that the Cuban diplomat brushes aside this  area  of public liberty as insignificant, and we have reason to  believe that the regime he represents shares his views. In  fact, it would be very interesting to listen to the commentaries  of such a eulogist of Castroism, for whom the name of General  Pinochet in Chile is, for example, anathema. He ought to  explain right now, and clearly, what makes this repression  desirable in Havana and yet revolting in other parts of the  Americas.    This explanation will surely not be forthcoming for a long  time, because even though Castroist leaders and their sidekicks  are not familiar with democratic values, they really know the  dark side of the system they represent. Otherwise, Minister  Robaina's efforts in Montevideo to express his wish to see a  reality in Cuba which "in the not too distant future would  involve living together under a multiparty system in that  country" would become incomprehensible. These remarks are  particularly auspicious in that they were uttered by a  government official who until very recently labelled multiparty  systems as "multi-rubbish."    Despite the praiseworthy attempts by the young Cuban foreign  minister to present his country's political regime in the light  of the promised economic changes -- or at least to concede the  clearly critical situation in Cuba -- his remarks are neither  convincing nor timely at a point when the island is facing a  shodown on its path toward freedom.    For all the persuasuve attempts to disguise its actual  makeup, the Cuban dictatorship is a reality that has outlived  its useful life and is doomed to end up in the dusty attic where  the sad ideology that once inspired it is already languishing.</p>

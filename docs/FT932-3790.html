			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Deng warns on Chinese economy China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who triggered a boom that has led to the world's fastest economic growth rate, has warned against letting the economy spin out of control, a pro-Beijing newspaper said yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. The Communist Party's top policy-making body will meet shortly to tackle the problems caused by the economy charging ahead at rates that surpassed 14 per cent in the first quarter this year, the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po said. Inflation, even by official figures, is more than 17 per cent in key cities.</p>

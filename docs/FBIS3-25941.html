After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao again urged that the  party and government organs at various levels and their leading  cadres should be honest and thrifty in their spending during the  Spring Festival and that the discipline inspection and  supervisory organs at various levels should strengthen  supervision and inspections.    Cheng Weigao stressed: The year 1994 is a year for package  reform and breakthroughs in key areas. So long as the leading  cadres at various levels maintain honesty and establish close  contacts with the masses, the reform measures will be supported  by the masses and reform progress smoothly. Party committees  and governments at various levels should always regard the  opposition to corruption and the maintenance of honesty as a  political task and grasp it. At present, we should grasp the  issue of honesty during the Spring Festival. Leading cadres at  various levels should take the lead in being honest. As for  localities, departments, and units where many serious problems  emerge, their principal leading cadres should first be called to  account.</p>

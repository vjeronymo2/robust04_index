			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: A brutalist partnership dissolves - Architecture They have been described as the most important husband and wife team in the world of modern architecture. The death last week of Alison Smithson brings to an end the long partnership of Alison and Peter Smithson that was so close, personally and professionally, and for a time so influential in the history of recent modern architecture in England. They always acted as one, to such an extent that any of their work was always attributed to 'the Smithsons'. Alison Smithson was born in 1928 in Sheffield and married Peter in 1949. They practised together from 1950 onwards, both as builders and polemicists. The death of Alison Smithson provides the occasion for a reflection on their mutual achievement and the effect of their work on contemporary British architecture. They did not build a great deal. They certainly wrote a lot, particularly their regular manifestos that appeared in the magazine Architectural Design during the 1950s, '60s and '70s. They were jointly responsible for three important post-war British buildings. They became famous for their first project - the competition-winning secondary modern school at Hunstanton in Norfolk, which was designed in 1949 and completed in 1954. Looking back today at photographs of this school it is hard to realise what excitement it caused when it was new. Everyone wrote about it at the time and praised it for its rigid symmetry and courtyard planning. It was, of course, very much derived from Mies van der Rohe's ideas with an exposed steel frame and brick wall panels. Service elements were exploited with the water tank elevated into a tower as though it was a campanile. There was almost a celebration of plumbing and much pleasure was taken by the architects in their exposure of pipes. Their architecture soon became dubbed 'the new brutalism' - a prophetic description - by the critic Reyner Banham. Their second major achievement, and one that has lasted better than any of their other work, is the office building for The Economist, in St. James's Street, London. This remains one of the few good commercial post-war developments in the centre of London. It is more than just new offices - it is a microcosm of a modern planned city block that encompasses three buildings next door to the Adam-ish Boodle's Club (actually designed by J. Crunden in 1775). There is nothing brutalist about this architecture. It is almost like a modern Italian design, especially in its sensitive use of roach bed Portland stone that gives the surfaces such unusual texture. The particular achievement of the scheme is the way that it utilises the whole space between two streets, allowing pedestrians to walk through and providing a small piazza between the blocks. The block on St. James's Street itself, originally intended to be a bank, is scaled directly to its neighbours, concealing the too tall tower block behind. There is something disturbing about the bank block on St. James's Street that must be to do with it being an irregular polygon - always a difficult shape to fit into a city grid. The slight raising of the little piazza, on the other hand, is immensely successful. The scheme was built in 1964 and has worn well. Civil and well detailed, it has been refurbished recently by Skidmore Owings and Merrill who should have known better than to make the lobby look just like any other standard American office lobby. The third monument to the Smithson partnership may well be one that they would have preferred to forget. It is the most brutalist of all their structures and is precisely the kind of building that gives modern architects and modern architecture a bad name. Robin Hood Gardens, Bromley-by-Bow, the East End public housing built by them for the Greater London Council, is said to represent the culmination of 20 years of theorising about urban planing and the nature of city life. To any eye, trained or untrained, the site of the two cranked pre-cast concrete slab blocks, seems to sum up all that is bad about 20th century architecture and official policy towards public housing. Only architects could have imagined a scheme of such horror. The Smithsons, along with others, had a fascination with 'street culture' (something no middle class architect has ever experienced for himself), which they explored at pretentious meetings of the Independent Group in the 1950s and showed to the world in the infamous exhibition held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956 entitled This is Tomorrow. It was in that exhibition and in many subsequent articles and built schemes that 'brutalist' architects reappraised the street, talking of street decks and streets in the air . . . We have all seen the results on London's South Bank; in the Barbican in the City of London; and in Park Hill flats in Sheffield. Most readers of this column do not have to inhabit the results of this mad theory - and the residents of Robin Hood Gardens must be mystified by the double standard that could produce the fine Economist group while condemning them to lives that have been permanently vandalised by architectural dogma. The rampant brutalism of Robin Hood Gardens was intended to 'replace such group concepts as house, street, district and city which are too overloaded with historical overtones . . .' What a sad monument to a partnership that clearly could enhance the world.</p>

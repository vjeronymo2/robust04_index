			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Birse losses cut sharply to Pounds 2.7m For the third year running Birse Group, the construction company, has announced an annual pre-tax loss. The deficit, however, was reduced substantially from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 2.7m for the 12 months to the end of April. The group yesterday announced that it had moved from an operating loss before interest of Pounds 14.3m to a profit of Pounds 855,000. It was helped by the absence of provisions on commercial property which cost the company Pounds 3.48m last time. The contracting division also turned round from a Pounds 9.46m loss to a Pounds 1.12m profit, with no repeat of the problem contracts which severely dented the 1993 results. The group still made an overall loss in spite of reduced interest charges of Pounds 3.56m (Pounds 4.22m). Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said: 'Despite evidence of an improvement in all our markets, construction margins continue to be depressed by surplus capacity in the industry.' Turnover increased by 7 per cent from Pounds 328m to Pounds 351m. Losses per share emerged at 2.3p (19.4p), and again there is no dividend. The plant hire division increased operating profits from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 871,000, while the small housebuilding division, which sold 115 homes last year, moved from a Pounds 1.39m loss to a Pounds 71,000 profit. Birse also sold some of its remaining commercial properties, for Pounds 6.8m, making a small book profit and further reducing its borrowings. Overall, commercial property made a Pounds 21,000 loss (Pounds 4.04m). The biggest improvement has been in the company's balance sheet. Net debt following last year's Pounds 24m share placing had fallen to Pounds 11.8m by the end of April, equivalent to almost 35 per cent of shareholders' funds which increased from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 33.8m. The company said that in the absence of property sales it would expect to maintain gearing at an average of about 50 per cent this year. COMMENT Birse, having survived the recession by retaining the support of its bankers and shareholders, must now rebuild its fortunes. Margins are improving, but competition for work remains intense and progress will be slow. Housebuilding may be leading the industry out of recession, but Birse's housing operation is too small to benefit much. Commercial property sales should improve the balance sheet further. Pre-tax profits, depending on these sales, may top Pounds 1m this year, but a return to dividends is some way off and investors will need to see firmer evidence of improvement.</p>

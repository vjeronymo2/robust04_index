			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Administrative receivers in at Forwell RECEIVERS HAVE been appointed to Forwell Group, the USM-quoted design and technical services company. Lloyds Bank has appointed Mr Timothy Harris and Mr Christopher Hughes of Cork Gully as administrative receivers to Forwell Design and Contracts and Ferndale Contracts. Forwell had a short career on the USM. It came to that market via a placing at 62p per share in July 1989 which valued the company at Pounds 9.15m. The shares were suspended at 3p on January 31. In 1989 the group made a pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 1m but the following year was forced to pass its final dividend after losses of Pounds 1.03m. In the six months to June 30 1991 the group returned to the black and bank borrowings were reduced by more than Pounds 1.5m; at the 1991 year-end bank indebtedness was about Pounds 1.4m. Mr Michael Wheller, chairman and chief executive, said he hoped to put out a statement shortly. He said that the group needed just Pounds 600,000 of working capital and that a company doctor, who would have been appointed executive chairman, had joined the group.</p>

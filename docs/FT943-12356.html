			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / DTI urged to heed advice on Lloyd's solvency report The government was urged in the House of Lords yesterday to ensure that the Department of Trade and Industry takes account of independent advice before it determines whether the Lloyd's market remains solvent, Ivor Owen writes. Lord Marlesford, the Conservative backbencher who has described himself as a 'victim' of Lloyd's, suggested that the DTI should not rely entirely on its own resources 'in view of the widespread suspicion and doubt that does exist'. Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, a government spokesman, said the DTI would look carefully at the solvency report, which he believed was due out next month. He said: 'We have no reason to believe that Lloyd's is insolvent. It continues to pay all valid claims.' Lord Peyton of Yeovil, the former Conservative minister, asked for an indication of the government's thinking on decisions made by the US courts which could have a 'catastrophic effect' on the insurance industry. Lord Mackay said the problem of 'huge settlements' went a great deal wider than Lloyd's. 'I think the insurance industry as a whole will have to look to the courts of the US to perhaps be more realistic.' He reaffirmed that the government had no plans to intervene in the market to change the regulatory arrangements which were approved by parliament in 1982 with the passage of the private bill promoted by Lloyd's. Lord Mackay said the management of Lloyd's had overhauled its self-regulating arrangements under the legislation . 'The government considers this to be the best way forward for the regulation of the Lloyd's market,' he said.</p>

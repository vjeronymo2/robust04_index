			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte dividend Another forecast that the dividend may be cut at Forte unsettled the shares yesterday, when Smith New Court became the latest broking house to predict a payment reduction with next week's results. The house now estimates that the full-year dividend will be 5p, compared with last year's 9.91p, joining company with NatWest Securities, long-term bears at 5.5p, Hoare Govett, recent converts to 6.3p, and Paribas at 5p. Ironically, in view of recent events at Queens Moat Houses, a dividend cut by Forte would be interpreted as a positive move by the market. 'In a difficult hotel environment, Forte will look prudent if it reduces its dividend,' said one leisure analyst. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 177 1/2 p, although turnover was a meagre 1.3m. An early attempt by BAT Industries to rally was undermined in late trading. Agency broker James Capel became the latest house to alter its stance, changing its recommendation from hold to weak hold following the Philip Morris decision to spark a price war in the US. BAT shares fell a net 5 to 880p. International conglomerate BTR had a busy session as talk that the company may soon announce a big disposal did the rounds. At the day's best, the shares were 9 better at 619p, but surrendered that gain on profit-taking to close unchanged at 610p, after trade of 4.8m. The slump in the Fisons share price was the latest in a series of damaging blows to the market and was seen by some dealers as a signal for a more aggressive approach in switching into the highly defensive areas of the market, notably the utilities. British Gas settled 4 higher at 307 1/2 p. The electricity stocks were well supported, helped by a recent flurry of broker buy recommendations, as were the water stocks, but customer business in both areas was minimal with only Severn Trent able to boast turnover in excess of 1m shares. Severn closed 4 firmer at 527p. Activity in the power generators was on larger scale with broker Hoare Govett forecasting dividend growth rates of 14.3 per cent and 12.5 per cent for National Power in the next two years and 15.2 per cent and 12.4 per cent for PowerGen. The latter settled 5 up at 350p and the former 3 better at 348p. There was renewed speculation that Rank Organisation had struck a deal to sell its provincial hotels with a price of Pounds 57m being suggested. The 15 hotels have been for sale for a year and rumours of their imminent disposal have been rife since January. Analysts hinted that several interested parties had been in negotiations with Rank, but the favourite scenarios are a management buy-out, or a move from a Far Eastern group said to have been scouring the UK hotel market recently. A Singapore group purchased the Gloucester hotel from Rank in November for Pounds 67.5m. Rank shares fell 3 to 666p. Good results from City Centre helped the shares gain 2 to 85p and reflected well on Bass, up a penny at 551p. Switching from Guinness to Grand Metropolitan left the former 9 adrift at 478p and the latter 2 stronger at 426p. Results from Tesco came largely in line with expectations and with a mildly positive meeting with analysts, the shares closed a penny firmer at 232p. However, specialists said that the company failed to satisfy the bears of the stock worried about the long-term strategy for growth. There were more downgrades at Unilever as meetings with analysts continued. Most cuts have been on currency considerations. The shares fell 19 to 1144p. Wellcome recovered 16 to 721p ahead of briefings to analysts today in the UK. The company is busily carrying out a belated damage limitation exercise following worries over its anti-AIDS drug AZT or Retrovir and will discuss its plan to seek regulatory approval for wider use of the drug. Shares in UK airports operator BAA, eased 12 to 788p,with Cazenove said to have downgraded profit expectations. Trailer rental and leasing company TIP Europe jumped 15 to 40 1/2 p after announcing an agreed bid from a subsidiary of General Electric of the US. There was talk that the move could lead to greater competition for Tiphook which fell 25 to 335p. In motors, several stocks were boosted by the news of a 12.7 per cent year on year rise in UK car sales for March. Thomas Cowie put on 3 at 211p, Dagenham Motor hardened 2 to 108p, ahead of figures today, while Lex Service also added 2 at 341p. International trading group Inchcape, owner of several UK car dealerships, rose 8 to 593p. The encouraging statement to shareholders at BICC's annual meeting saw the stock race up to 361p before closing a net 8 better at 358p. A broker's suggestion that MB Caradon could be targetting Redland's bricks business, substantially enlarged by Redland's acquisition of Steetley last year, saw Redland move up 6 to 429p on good turnover of 1.3m shares.</p>

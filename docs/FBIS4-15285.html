			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5, RIA -- In the opinion of Sergey  Samoylov, acting head of the president's administration  department for territories, the new fundamental law of the  republic of Kalmykia -- the Regulations on the Steppes --  complies with the Russian Constitution. Although the decision  passed today by the constitutional conference of Kalmykia on the  adoption of the regulations is not binding, it will pave the way  for the forthcoming relevant decision by the Kalmyk parliament.    Sergey Samoylov emphasized that valid until now has been the  constitution of the Kalmyk SSR with some amendments. However,  the experience of independent development of the republic has  prompted new changes, i.e. the problems concerning the  implementation of the concept of economic independence called  for enacting an updated fundamental law. This circumstance is  envisaged by the constitution of the Russian federation. Under  the provisions of the newly- adopted regulations, Kalmykia  remains a full-fledged national- territorial subject of the  Russian Federation. The document also lays down the democratic  norms of establishing state power and human rights, the  representative of the president's administration pointed out.</p>

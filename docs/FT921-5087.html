			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corporation climbs 24% to SFr1.03bn SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC) reports consolidated net profits of SFr1.03bn (Dollars 684m) in 1991, up 24.7 per cent despite soaring provisions for bad debts. Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive of Switzerland's second largest bank, said at a press conference that the SBC group out-performed its own targets last year and he was optimistic about achieving further growth this year. 'If our provisioning needs are as expected lower than in 1991, our ambitious goals could be well within reach,' Mr Frehner said. Gross operating income jumped 49 per cent to SFr2.8bn, but provisions for bad loans, including SFr211m against a SFr330m exposure to companies formerly led by Mr Robert Maxwell, jumped 81 per cent to SFr1.5bn. The extraordinarily high level of bad loans in the UK and in the US, where SBC has a large real estate loan portfolio, depressed the contribution of foreign subsidiaries to group net profit to only 2 per cent. Net interest earnings were up 10.4 per cent to SFr2.9bn and commission income gained 14.6 per cent to SFr1.7bn, thanks mainly to fees from portfolio management operations. Income from financial operations and trading soared 123 per cent to SFr1.5bn in large part because of the strengthening of the group's derivatives business. Mr Frehner said SBC's share of profits from its joint venture with The O'Connor Partnerships of Chicago was SFr107m, well ahead of expectations. Total assets of the SBC group rose 8.5 per cent to SFr207bn, with two-thirds of the growth arising from the consolidation of Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), in which SBC now has a 58 per cent stake. Published capital and reserves rose 4 per cent to SFr12.5bn. Mr Frehner said there was no justification for Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to downgrade SBC's long-term debt from its triple A rating. Moody's put SBC on its watch list in January at the same time as it removed its triple A rating from Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank. BSI is to become the core of a new subsidiary within SBC to specialise in private banking. SBC will sell four of its Swiss private banking subsidiaries to BSI and will take over the business of BSI's commercial branches outside of the Italian language part of Switzerland. The new bank, to be called SBSI Holding, will have total assets of about SFr8.1bn and funds under management of roughly SFr33bn.</p>

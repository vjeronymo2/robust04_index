			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dorling settles dispute with TBS Peace has broken out in the war between Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of illustrated reference books, and its distributor, Tiptree Book Services, which is owned by Random House, the US publisher. DK recently partly blamed computer problems at Tiptree for a 17 per cent decline in its pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 - a claim disputed by Tiptree, which said it refused to be made a scapegoat for DK's failure to meet the high expectations it had generated among shareholders. DK said yesterday it would this summer transfer the distribution of its publications for the UK book trade and English-language exports from Tiptree to International Book Distributors, a Rugby-based company which is part of Paramount, the US media company. As part of a confidential settlement, a compensation payment to DK for the loss of sales was partly offset by a payment to Tiptree for ending the distribution deal when it still had 14 months to run. Mr Rod Hare, managing director of DK, said: 'We had to ensure that our distribution this autumn would not be at risk - that was our paramount concern. Tiptree was confident that it could manage, but we decided not to take the risk.' He added: 'The settlement will certainly improve our results this year, but I doubt whether they will be significantly better because of the compensation.' DK had already transferred from Tiptree to International Book the distribution of DK Family Library, its direct-selling operation to homes and schools which was most affected by the problems at Tiptree. Mr Hare said DK had lost a 'significant proportion' of its network of Family Library agents, but this was being rebuilt as confidence in supplies returned. DK's shares, which were floated at 165p at the end of 1993, had climbed to 351p last October, but plunged to 213p in December after the group issued two profit warnings. The shares yesterday closed 5p higher at 293p.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE ASKS CITIZENS TO BLOW WHISTLE ON WATER-WASTERS  </P> <P> Several days before the Glendale City Council enacted mandatory water  conservation rules aimed at cutting consumption by 10%, Councilwoman Ginger  Bremberg began getting calls about water-wasters.  </P> <P> "One was about a business that was using a high-pressure hose to clean off the  sidewalk," she said. "One of them was about a sprinkler system that had gone  berserk" and was spraying water into the street.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, such practices were outlawed under the first phase of a  conservation plan that was activated unanimously by the council. Pre-meeting  publicity prompted the calls to Bremberg, and city officials said they'll need  such tips to meet Glendale's water cutback goals.  </P> <P> "You ought to be a rat-fink on your neighbors who use too much water,"  Councilman Carl Raggio said at Tuesday's meeting. "I intend to practice that to  the hilt."  </P> <P> The council implemented the first stage in a five-step water conservation  ordinance adopted in February. The last four stages would require each customer  to reduce water usage by a specific percentage. City officials do not believe  the more serious cutbacks are needed now, but they said the early conservation  measures must be imposed to avert water rationing next year, if the drought  continues.  </P> <P> On the average, Glendale uses about 28 million gallons of water a day, although  a summer heat wave can boost the daily draw to about 50 million gallons, city  staff members said.  </P> <P> The state's four-year drought has led a number of cities to implement  conservation measures. But unlike neighboring Los Angeles, Glendale is not  planning to hire "drought busters" to cruise the city in search of  water-wasters.  </P> <P> "There's generally pretty good peer pressure that tends to make enforcement  self-supporting" said Michael P. Hopkins, the Glendale's director of public  service.  </P> <P> Under the new rules:  </P> <P> * Hose-washing of walkways, driveways, sidewalks and parking lots is  prohibited, except by public safety officers flushing away a hazardous  substance.  </P> <P> * Decorative fountains must recirculate their water.  </P> <P> * Restaurants must serve drinking water only on request.  </P> <P> * Water leaks must be repaired in a timely manner.  </P> <P> * Lawns and other landscaping cannot be watered between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.,  when more water is lost to evaporation.  </P> <P> Some of the rules may have a minimal impact.  </P> <P> For example, virtually all fountains in Glendale already recirculate their  water, including those outside City Hall and in the city's Maryland Avenue  renewal project. The privately operated waterfall at the 330 N. Brand Blvd.  high-rise also recycles its water, the building's chief engineer said.  </P> <P> Despite Southern California's water shortage, decorative fountains, ponds and  waterfalls have become a popular feature in office building plazas in the  city's central redevelopment area. Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's redevelopment  director, said the city requires that such systems recycle their water.  </P> <P> But even recirculating fountains require regular refilling because of water  lost to evaporation and wind. Armstrong said past droughts have prompted some  Northern California cities to halt the use of tap water in fountains. However,  these cities have allowed fountains to continue operating with reclaimed water  from treatment plants, she said.  </P> <P> Reclaimed water from Glendale's treatment plant will soon be piped to the  Forest Lawn cemetery for irrigation, but no connections to public fountains are  immediately planned, public service director Hopkins said.  </P> <P> Although the city's new mandate on fountains may contribute little to the  conservation effort, Hopkins believes several of the other steps will. Even the  seemingly insignificant cutback on drinking water at restaurants will help  because the equivalent of three additional glasses are water are used in  washing each glass for reuse, he said.  </P> <P> City officials hope publicity surrounding the mandatory curbs will encourage  residents to conserve in other ways. "The prohibited uses are really intended  to increase public awareness of the problem," Hopkins said.  </P> <P> He said the mandatory measures may cut water use by 5%. To conserve the  additional 5%, the city is counting on a public information campaign that will  urge Glendale residents to exercise self-discipline at their spigots.  </P> <P> Through water-bill inserts and school programs, residents will be reminded of  simple conservation measures, such as not letting the tap flow while shaving or  brushing one's teeth.  </P> <P> In targeting a 10% cutback, Glendale is complying with a region-wide  recommendation by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The  MWD, which obtains water from Northern California and the Colorado River,  provides 80% to 90% of the water used in Glendale.  </P> <P> "If we are successful in reducing the demand by 10% over the summer, that will  save us 200,000 acre-feet that we can put in storage for next year, should the  drought continue," said MWD spokesman Bob Gompers.  </P> <P> As an incentive, the MWD is offering a rebate of $100 per acre-foot to  municipal customers who reduce summer water consumption at least 5%. An  acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons.  </P> <P> Glendale officials will take a relatively low-key stance regarding those who  violate the mandatory conservation rules.  </P> <P> For the first two offenses, a violator will receive a written warning but no  fine. After the third offense, the city will install a flow constrictor to  curtail the customer's water.  </P> <P> A cutoff in service can be initiated for the fourth violation, but city  officials believe it is unlikely that step will be necessary.  </P> <P> "Glendale would always like to lead with the sugar instead of the vinegar on  these things," said Mark A. Doyle, a member of the Glendale Public Service  Commission, which recommended the water curbs to the council.  </P> <P> To find the violators, Glendale is relying on public tips and reports from  hundreds of city employees. Councilwoman Bremberg said she doesn't mind hearing  from residents who say their neighbors are wasting water.  </P> <P> "It means they're paying attention," she said. "And that's all it takes."  </P></p>

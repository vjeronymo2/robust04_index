			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Czech plea to Slovakia on trade decline A SHARP decline in bilateral trade between the Czech Republic and Slovakia could damage the two countries' prospects unless it is halted, Mr Karel Dyba, Czech minister for the economy, says. 'The Czech Republic has a high export ratio and its (economy) is very dependent on exports. Less exports mean less orders and possibly less jobs. We have a mutual interest (with Slovakia) to maintain a profitable trade relationship,' Mr Dyba says. Czech exports to Slovakia and Slovak exports to the Czech Republic fell by 17 per cent and 20 per cent respectively in 1992, following an already sharp fall the previous year as both countries suffered from the collapse of traditional markets in the former Comecon trade bloc. Business between the two countries has also been hit by the break-up of the former Czechoslovak state on January 1 this year. New customs and tax regulations, and an earlier-than-planned end to the currency union between the two states with the establishment of separate currencies have compounded difficulties for many companies on both sides of the border. Several Czech and international companies are considering setting up subsidiaries in Slovakia to overcome cumbersome bureaucratic customs procedures, and some companies threaten to stop selling to or importing from Slovakia altogether. About 25 per cent of total Czech exports go to Slovakia, while 40 per cent of Slovak exports go to the Czech republic. Last year Czech exports to Slovakia were worth about Kcs100bn (Pounds 2.38bn) and Slovak exports to the Czech Republic about Kcs90bn.</p>

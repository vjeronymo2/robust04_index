			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Fears of fire risks at large stores The risk of fire in larger supermarkets is causing increasing concern among insurers and safety experts after a spate of losses in recent months. The lack of compartment walls, which would halt the spread of fire, and the absence of sprinkler systems and roof venting in many stores have been singled out as potential hazards. The risks were highlighted at a conference this week organised by the Fire Protection Association, a body linked to the insurance industry. Stores hit recently by fires include a supermarket in Hull, which suffered Pounds 10m damage, and a superstore in Chichester, which suffered Pounds 11m damage. The association says there have been nine big fires in the past two years. Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'It is a real worry. Fires can spread very quickly from one corner to the whole building.' Retailers insisted yesterday that the fears were overplayed. Mr Mark Bradshaw, assistant director of the British Retail Consortium, which represents about 90 per cent of the retail industry, said supermarkets fully complied with the statutory framework, and the criticisms exaggerated the effectiveness of sprinkler systems. Instead retailers placed more emphasis on evacuation procedures, so that employees and customers could escape quickly.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS BLACKMAIL  </P> <P> Soon our country will be celebrating the anniversary of the signing of the Bill  of Rights of our Constitution.  </P> <P> The Catholic bishops are a forceful political lobby with a tremendous economic  base, thus violating the constitutional separation of church and state. Should  they be tax exempt if they continue to participate in political action?  </P> <P> Political candidates are representatives of their constituents and should vote  accordingly. Otherwise, those of us who do pay taxes are taxed without  representation.  </P> <P> Thank you, Lucy Killea, for your firm stand against tyranny. You have our  votes!  </P> <P> JANE and RICHARD SPEAKER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

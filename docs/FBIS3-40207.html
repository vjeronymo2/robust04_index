Aggregate gross  investment for the 115 foreign-funded enterprises in the zone  has reached US$600 million, while foreign capital attracted is  at $360 million, of which there are 15 projects (about 14  percent of the 115) funded with at least $10 million each.    Within the Caohejing Zone, Shanghai Beiling Microelectronics  Mfrg. Ltd., Shanghai Microelectronics Engineering Research  Center, and Shanghai Philips Semiconductor Corp. have formed a  technologically advanced microelectronics industry mini-zone  integrating research, development, intermediate testing,  production, and sales. This mini-zone has an industrial-grade,  communications-grade, and consumer-grade large-scale integrated  circuit (LSI) production capacity outfitted with 0.65-micron IC  design technology, technology for producing 4-5-inch silicon  wafers, and technology for fabricating l.2-3-micron ICs. A  Shanghai fiber optic communications industrial base has taken  shape around the Shanghai Fiber Optic Communications Engineering  Co., Shanghai AT&amp;T Communications Equipment Ltd., and the  Sino-U.S. joint venture AT&amp;T Fiber Optic Communications Ltd.  Some 30 firms, including Shanghai Foxboro Co. and Shanghai  Qiming [0796 2494] Software Ltd., have formed a computer  software industrial group engaged in R&amp;D of products for  industrial and office automation, information and enterprise  management, finance, insurance, and commerce. The wholly  U.S.-owned 3M China Ltd., the Sino-U.S. joint venture Shanghai  Ruikan [3843 0170] (Electric) Cable Accessories Ltd., and the  British firm ICI Co. have formed an  international-state-of-the-art production base for industrial  new materials. Finally, Caohejing has the nation's first  bioengineering R&amp;D/intermediate-testing base--the Chinese  Academy of Sciences' (CAS) Shanghai Bioengineering Research  Center and other Sino-foreign joint ventures have formed an  embryonic bioengineering industrial development zone.    As of the end of 1993, the Caohejing Zone's industrial gross  output value exceeded 4.2 billion yuan, business sales income  exceeded 5.5 billion yuan, industrial profits approached 700  million yuan, annual per capita sales income for foreign-funded  enterprises within the development zone reached 330,000 yuan,  and annual per capita profit was 70,000 yuan.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1,000 SQUATTERS STAGE RIOT IN EASTERN BERLIN;  </P> <P> GERMANY: HUNDREDS ARE INJURED IN A BATTLE THAT BEGAN WHEN POLICE EVICTED  ILLEGAL TENANTS FROM THREE HOUSES.  </P> <P> Berlin suffered its worst street violence in a decade when more than 1,000  militant squatters fought a pitched battle with riot police overnight. Hundreds  of people were injured.  </P> <P> The squatters, angered by the clearance of three occupied houses in east Berlin  on Monday, pelted police with gasoline bombs, stones and metal bars, set fire  to cars and a streetcar and dug deep trenches in the streets.  </P> <P> Outnumbered and forced to retreat at first, police fired tear gas and water  cannons to contain the rioters, who fashioned barricades out of cars, garbage  containers, building huts and barbed wire.  </P> <P> It was the latest episode in a rising spiral of violence since unification a  month ago and raised questions about the social stability of the new German  state.  </P> <P> "When young people in Germany try to use other means to point to problems, no  one listens. When they use violence, the interest grows," sociologist Wilhelm  Heitmeyer told German television. "Politicians must not miss the warning  signals."  </P> <P> The Berlin city government came under criticism for provoking the violence.  </P> <P> "Some 135 injured police officers and untold plunder and destruction are the  result of a flawed security policy by the Berlin political authorities," the  head of the German police union, Martin Gregg, said in a statement.  </P> <P> The riots could raise new objections among Germans to moving the government  from Bonn to Berlin, a choice facing the pan-German Parliament to be elected  next month.  </P> <P> Squatters have occupied about 100 houses in east Berlin since the fall of the  Berlin Wall last November, protesting against a housing shortage and plans to  raise rents heavily subsidized by the former Communist government.  </P> <P> A stringent element, including many from other parts of Germany and Europe,  have occupied virtually an entire street in the run-down Friedrichshain  quarter, where Monday night's violence took place.  </P> <P> The quarter was calm by daybreak today, but burned-out cars and remains of the  barricades closed the area to traffic.  </P></p>

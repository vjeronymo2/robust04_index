			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To defend the whole truth about Cuba is the  equivalent of protecting the sovereignty and independence of  Latin America. This has been stated by Cuban Ambassador to  Brazil Jorge Bolanos in an article published by JOURNAL DO  BRASIL, entitled "The Truth About Cuba." Bolanos denounces the  fact that the CIA, just days ago, once again issued apocalyptic  reports about Cuba. He stressed that it is not the first time  that the CIA has done something like this against Cuba. He gives  as an example the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the  predictions about of the fall of the Revolution, which is today  more solid than ever.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Barisic: "Wrong Interpretations of </F> Tudjman"]    [Text] Few could have anticipated that the dilemma from  the last HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] congress about  whether this political body would grow from a movement into a  party was going to leave so many scars on the Croatian political  scene, and so much uncertainty that now even the normal  functioning of the parliament is questioned. This will be used  in raising the question of the democratic system of Croatia, and  even its stability.    Let us remind readers that for a while Tudjman supported the  faction that wanted to turn the HDZ from a movement into a  Christian democrat-oriented party, but he later joined those  headed by Manolic, who asked that the HDZ retain the original  principles, that is, that of a movement, with the emphasis on  national party.    The HDZ movement has lately been executing Manolic in a way  that all the movements have employed through history: by taking  the conflict to the end. All the media are involved. Manolic's  photographs no longer appear in certain papers, columnists who  used to favor the movement, most often believing in it, are  doing their best to blacken the name of the man who until  recently was the closest associate of the movement leader.  Manolic is no longer a person with different political  positions; he has become a traitor, a Rankovic, a chetnik. No  wonder -- a movement, whether it is called the HDZ or otherwise,  functions as a community of holders of the same views, and as  soon as an individual from within the community persists in his  positions, the movement rejects them because they betrayed the  community.  <H5>  The Movement and the Party </H5>   By insisting at the last congress that the HDZ be a  movement,  and now deciding to persist in his position, Manolic himself  created the conditions for this kind of breakup. If he had  joined those now condemning him, and who then supported the  transformation of the movement into a party, Manolic would now  be leader of a HDZ faction, completely legal. Apart from his  left faction, at least two more (right and center) would have  emerged, which is the case in all the parties in all the  European countries in which national movements for the  liberation from the occupying forces or for the forming of the  state had finished the job long ago, while time and observance  of the democratic procedure have made them countries with a  stable democratic system.    The factors of this stability are political parties with  legalized factions, and this way of dealing with those who do  not share the same views is therefore impossible in their  systems, as they are not considered traitors. If they change  their views, they transfer from one faction to another, or from  one party to another, and in the process no one gets excited.  On the contrary, the party tries to persuade such individuals  to stay, and if they do leave, the party expresses regrets about  it.    In the case of a movement, things are different: It sends  such individuals away (the official statement said Manolic had  been "expelled" from the HDZ), and tries to oust them  politically (Manolic is meeting with Paraga), personally  (Manolic is a member of Yugoslav State Security Service, as if  he had not been one until two months ago), and morally (he is  blackmailing Duka).    Manolic has thus become a victim of his own political  beliefs. Moreover, he is responsible for having used his  influence -- indisputable at the time -- and preventing the  movement from becoming a party, which is a guarantee for the  establishment of democratic bases, which should, through the  body of the party, gradually penetrate the entire body of  society. Signs of lack of democratic procedure are not  characteristic of only one party. Other parties have also been  affected by the inauguration of nondemocratic procedures. Not  only have they been affected, but, because of applying methods  of the same kind, they are gradually being destroyed by it.  They have been functioning less as parties and more as  movements -- minor ones.  <H5>  Squaring Accounts in the Opposition Parties </H5>   The way it has been done in the IDS [Istrian Democratic  Congress] by the movement leader Jakovcic and the so-called  Herak group is well known. Jakovcic has proclaimed them the  "moles" of the HDZ, that is, betrayers of the movement, and, at  a convenient time, when they were not present, expelled them  from the movement. In fact, they did not have the same views;  they were a faction, and now they are saying that they are  devoted to the IDS, and that they will found a new one. The  cause of the dissension is the same as in the HDZ: lack of  democratic procedure within the party. A similar event took  place in the HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] when a group of  members with different views, gathered around Madjor, tried to  overthrow Drago Stipac as president. They did not manage to do  it, so he threw them out. Even if the reverse had happened, the  nature of the conflict would not have been different.    A similar situation has recently occurred in the HSLS  [Croatian Social Liberal Party], the strongest opposition party.  At the party conference in Kutina two factions were in conflict  because of the recently forced syndrome of "Herzegovinian  politics." One of the factions, headed by Vilfan and supported  by Fizulic, asked that the party expel all the so-called  Herzegovinian cadres from the politics of both Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. They gloated over the failure of the  "Herceg-Bosna project," saying the worst possible things about  the people there, forgetting that a young man from, for  instance, Ljubuski, who was mobilized in a normal procedure and  killed at, say, Gornji Vakuf, had nothing to do with high  politics, where decisions about the forms of political  organization were made.    In the war with the Muslims he was just as much a patriot  as when, at the beginning of the Serbian aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he had stood before the Serbian tanks  unarmed. Zoric, vice president of the party, opposed Vilfan and  Fizulic's positions at the Kutina conference. A conflict  occurred which, interpreted in political terms, means that two  very different factions have been established: Vilfan's liberal  and Zoric's social-liberal one. Budisa took Zoric's side, but  in such a way as not to lose Vilfan.  <H5>  Connecting Vessels </H5>   The HDZ democratic centralism, or, more clearly said: Lack  of  democratic procedures, has, through the principle of connecting  vessels, spread to most of the major Croatian parties (the rest  are at a standstill or about to break up). However, it did not  stop there. It also spread to most of the media, and even to  the Croatian state institutions. The stories about the election  of the Zagreb University president, about the status of the  Central Croatian Cultural and Publishing Society, or those about  electing school principals, hospital principals, managers of  public companies, which could be anything but models of  democratic activities, are well known. One of the main culprits  for this is Josip Manolic, because, not knowing political  theory, he insisted that the movement remain. He will hardly be  able to correct his delusions by legalizing his faction and  founding a new party. However, the HDZ may be taking another  direction as a movement, a new way toward becoming a party.    The cause for this consideration is the statement of the HDZ  head secretary and head of the President's office, Dr. Jure  Radic (a person who, because of his position, should not only  express his private views, but, more likely, those of the  institution he is head of), in the last issue of DANAS,  regarding the explosion at Duboki Jarak [reference to the  explosion of a military warehouse near Sesvete]. "There are some  who would like Gojko Susak not to be defense minister," said  Radic and added: "What if it is established that those who want  Susak to leave are responsible for the tragedy at Sesvete?" As  part of the opposition wanted that, most of all the Manolic  group, it is clear that Radic's statement, which was later  published in all the papers, paved the way for a new political  procedure. Although none of the committees investigating the  reasons for the explosion has published the results of the  investigation, Radic's pointing the finger at a possible culprit  can also be an indication of new political relations in Croatia.  Having been expelled from the HDZ, Manolic is no longer a  betrayer of the movement; he is a possible terrorist, a person  who plants bombs, mines. He wants to overthrow the legal  authorities through terrorist activities. Clearly, he is not  the only one; those gathered around him in stage one, and in  stage two all those "on the other side," both from the HDZ and  the opposition, can become "the Manolic people," therefore  terrorists. Ultimately, anyone who is suspicious can be a  terrorist. In all the political science textbooks this form of  dealing with those who do not hold the same views is called  civil war. First within the HDZ, and later, consequently, in  the entire Croatian nation.  <H5>  Youth and Lack of Experience </H5>   Ivic Pasalic, the President's adviser for internal politics,  has, perhaps unintentionally, contributed to the HDZ growing  into a hard movement rather than into a party with his  announcement that the HDZ was soon "starting the process of  decommunization." Considering the fact that the HDZ holds most  of the authority in the state, it could so happen that this  "decommunization" is not only implemented within the party, but,  by the nature of things, in the entire state machinery. In view  of the fact that a number of Croatian people were involved in  the communist machinery, it is not difficult to imagine what  that could mean. First of all, there could appear the danger of  a certain number of Croats being pushed to the margin by  politically nondemocratic means, by the creation of new  divisions, and by the demand to prove suitability. This time  the "right ones" could be those who did not write praises to  socialism and were not part of the communist authorities.  <H5>  Legalizing the Factions </H5>   Pasalic and Radic may have been led to these "radical"  statements by their youth and lack of experience. Considering  Tudjman's opus and his active idea of national conciliation,  which is what led to the forming and defense of the Croatian  state, it is important to point out the possible traps in these  "interpretations." Instead of creating the preconditions for  establishing a democratic political atmosphere, these  "interpretations" lead to the brink of a conflict within the  Croatian national corps. As if once was not enough, and as if  the consequences of this division should not be enough of a  warning about what danger the present Croatia is facing.  However, we should hope that, despite the harsh words that are  piling up on both sides, neither of the two sides, or the  others, will cross the threshold where the limits of the legal  state end and violence begins, because they do not want to enter  a conflict that would turn into a civil war.    According to one of the political analysts, there is a deep  misunderstanding between Manolic and Tudjman. He proposes that  two things be done to calm the situation, which even threatens  to turn into a parliamentary crisis. He proposes that Manolic  give up the idea of a movement and accept the HDZ as a  Christian-democratic oriented party (in most of the European  countries the former Communists go over to the Christian  democrats), and that Tudjman accept the general rules concerning  the possibility of factions existing within the HDZ as a party.    The legalization of the factions means that the movement  automatically becomes a party and that different forms of  political behavior are in force. This would have a positive  influence on the stability of the other Croatian parties to the  degree that it has so far been negative.    In any democratic system, the majority must protect the  minority, provided the minority give up violence. This is a  lesson that Manolic should have learned by now. Dictatorship or  civil war are always a worse form of war, and they have more  serious consequences than defense wars waged against an  aggressor. Let us remember what Hitler told Pavelic a few weeks  after the Independent State of Croatia was established: "Croatia  emerged by accident. If the English had not staged the coup in  Belgrade, we would still have supported Yugoslavia." Let us not  forget Baker; the Americans also supported Yugoslavia at the  beginning of the Serbian aggression. The fear of the renewal of  Yugoslavia is still present. It would not be good if it is  again built on Croat corpses.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5> <H5>  Interview With Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "I Do Not Know </H5> What Manolic's Plans Are"    [Barisic] What is your position regarding the "Manolic  case"?    [Budisa] The president of the Chamber of Counties has the  right to hold a session of the Chamber of Counties whenever he  decides it is necessary. The rules of procedure grant too much  authority to the presidents of both the Chamber of Counties and  the Chamber of Representatives; situations such as this were not  taken into account. However, we consider that even laws we do  not consider good should be obeyed, and our relation toward the  rules of procedure is the same. At this moment I do not know  how and when the session of the Chamber of Counties will be  held. It is also logical that the positions of presidents of  both chambers belong to the party in power, although I would  like to point out that the HDZ representatives voted against my  nomination for deputy parliament chairman at the Chamber of  Representatives, and elected Mr. Djukic [president of the  Serbian National Party] instead. I have not contacted Mr.  Manolic since the talks of the presidents of the opposition  parties, so I do not know what his plans are.    I suppose that Manolic is trying to gain time so he can  carry  out preparations for the organization of the new party, which  means putting together the program and the statute, and getting  as many citizens and HDZ representatives as possible to start  the new party. I will not conceal the fact that we in the HSLS  consider this stratification useful for the democratic  development of Croatia, since the role of the HDZ in Croat  political life has been predominant, while at the last elections  it (the HDZ) did not have the support of the electoral body that  would justify this predominance.    The HSLS did not start this parliamentary crisis -- to be  honest, it could not have done so -- which, if it does emerge,  will be a consequence of the conflict in the party in power.  Since we consider Mr. Manolic to have done a good job as  president of the Chamber of Counties, our representatives will  vote against his replacement. If he is replaced, then the issue  of the new president of the Chamber of Counties will certainly  arise, and I suppose talks will be held. We believe that the  party that has the most representatives is entitled to have its  member as president of the Chamber of Counties. However, since  this did not happen in a similar situation regarding the  election of the deputy president at the Chamber of  Representatives, we have the possibility, regarding the  candidate, to take the position we decide is best during the  election.    [Barisic] How do you see the possibility of early elections?    [Budisa] I think it is logical that any self-respecting  opposition party wants elections to be held as soon as possible.  Not only would we not oppose them -- we want them, but it is not  up to the HSLS if they will be held or not.    [Barisic] To what extent do you think the Manolic case has  international implications? Namely, it can often be heard that  he is an agent of certain Western circles.    [Budisa] Every topical political event in Croatia has an  international dimension. I think that the president's recent  statement at the closed-door session of the Club of the HDZ  Representatives has contributed to this. He pointed out two  things: one was that one of the world powers had offered Croatia  help in founding its defense system, on the condition that  Manolic withdraw. The other was that the present official  Croatian politics and authorities were coordinated with the  Western interests, and that each attempt at destabilizing the  authorities, including Manolic's attempt, had a background on  the other side of the political spectrum, that is, in the East.  I can answer your question if Manolic was carrying out the  wishes of the West only by saying that this is completely  contrary to what the president of the Republic said.    These topics are so big that I think this discussion could  not end without a conversation either during the discussion of  Manolic's replacement, or through a parliamentary committee that  would examine the basis of such positions. If the people from  the top are called to account for promoting foreign interests,  we ask that the parliamentary committee also evaluate the former  activities of those who allegedly promoted somebody else's  interests. It is certain that there are many foreign secret  services in Croatia at present, but I think that there is no  relevant political force or party in Croatia at present that is  conducted from abroad. I would interpret these accusations  primarily as a heritage from the communist past, when each  political opponent was accused either of being a real or a  potential foreign agent.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5> <H5>  Interview With Josip Manolic, President of the Chamber of </H5> Counties: "I Will Leave Upon Secret Vote"    [Barisic] Mr. Manolic, you have refused to hold a session in  spite of the demands of the HDZ representatives. You said that  either a solution will be found in an agreement, or else there  would be a parliamentary crisis.    [Manolic] When a parliamentary crisis emerges in any of the  multiparty systems, the resolution of the crisis is sought in  the agreement of all the parliamentary factions -- if there is a  wish to overcome the crisis.    [Barisic] What do you mean by "agreement"?    [Manolic] That is again a matter of agreement. I think that  the crisis can be overcome in two ways: by electing a new  president of the Chamber of Counties, or by keeping the old one.    [Barisic] Do you think that is also a possibility?    [Manolic] I think it is, as a certain regrouping of forces  in that respect has already been carried out within the party in  power.    [Barisic] However, some of the representatives of whom it  was said they would join you have publicly denied it.    [Manolic] I have not said anyone would support me and vote  for me. There was therefore nothing to deny. There are  indications that there will not only be 1 percent of HDZ  representatives who will join us, as the president was  generously offering. The balance of powers regarding this issue  is quite different.    [Barisic] Do you know what position the opposition will  take?    [Manolic] The opposition parties have all supported me.  They have thus expressed solidarity with the method of  resolving the dispute concerning the position of president of  the Chamber of Counties, not entering the dispute between me and  the HDZ leadership.    [Barisic] What is important about this method?    [Manolic] The important thing is that in the process of  replacing the former president or electing a new one the rules  of procedure are observed, that the procedure is carried out  through secret vote. The rules of procedure say that secret  vote can be carried out in the elections if there is more than  one candidate. I will accept that immediately if there is a  multiparty agreement on it at the Chamber of Counties. Those  who oppose the secret vote are not only opposing the rules of  procedure, but the democratic procedure in general.    [Barisic] When are you going to hold the session?    [Manolic] I will do so when all the political elements  necessary for the session to continue are present.    [Barisic] When do you think that could be?    [Manolic] As I have said, only when an agreement is  previously made concerning the way to overcome this crisis.    [Barisic] Is that an invitation for talks to the "other"  side?    [Manolic] It is a good chance for resolving the entire case  by talking at the same level, observing the rules of procedure,  rather than, as is the case here, by using nondemocratic methods.</p>

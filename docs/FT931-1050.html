			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / NZ cabinet reshuffled MR Simon Upton, the New Zealand health minister responsible for implementing an unpopular reform of public hospitals and health funding, lost his portfolio yesterday in a cabinet shake-up apparently designed to bolster the National government's chances in this year's general election. He is being replaced by the Prime Minister Jim Bolger's closest ally, Mr Bill Birch, who is widely acknowledged as the most powerful minister in the cabinet. Mr Birch, known as Mr Fixit, is expected to lead a campaign to explain and popularise the planned changes in the health area. Opinion polls show 75 per cent of voters oppose the changes. The main surprise was that Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister, kept her position It had been widely expected that she would lose her responsibilities for tax matters following widespread disquiet among government backbenchers. Last week Ms Richardson suffered a setback when she was forced to back down on proposed tax changes due to party opposition. Mr Wyatt Creech, the minister of revenue, who had been expected to be appointed a full associate of Ms Richardson's in the finance ministry, was instead given additional responsibilities as minister of state owned enterprises. The changes follow opinion polls which show that the government is consistently trailing Labour by between 18 and 20 points.</p>

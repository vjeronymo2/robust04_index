			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: L&amp;P staves off deb default A RARE default in the debenture market was staved off yesterday when London &amp; Provincial Shop, the troubled property group, announced that it had reached agreement with the trustees to the debenture. However, the company still faces the possibility of a default early next month when a Pounds 6.75m interest payment falls due on its debentures. Holders of only two secured bond issues are thought to have lost money after defaults in the past 25 years. Law Debenture, trustee to the Pounds 135m of bonds, had written to London &amp; Provincial alleging a breach of covenant two weeks ago. This concerned the sale in 1990 of a property which had been charged to the debenture holders, which Law Debenture said was conducted without proper consultation with the bond holders. The company announced yesterday that it had deposited Pounds 1m with Law Debenture, representing the present market value of the property, although it continued to insist that it had acted in accordance with the covenants when it made the sale. Although the security backing the bonds has fallen well below the 1.5 multiple required in another covenant, this cannot lead to a formal default for at least six months, to allow the company time to make good the deficit. A further danger of breach of covenant comes on May 6, when the next half-yearly interest falls due on the debentures.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> HOMELESS HAVE PLANS FOR THEIR $3,308  </P> <P> When city workers twice confiscated and discarded Pat Ford's clothes, bedrolls  and other personal property two summers ago, they made life on the streets  around the Santa Ana Civic Center even more difficult for the 46-year-old  homeless man.  </P> <P> "I had to go for two weeks in the same clothes. I would take a shower but then  dress in the same dirty clothes," Ford said. "Then when I got some more, they  wiped me out again. It was downright thievery."  </P> <P> But Ford and 16 other homeless people refused to let the city's action pass  without a fight.  </P> <P> They sued Santa Ana, and on Thursday, many of them received a check for $3,308  as part of the $50,000 out-of-court settlement reached with the city earlier  this year.  </P> <P> Each plaintiff had different plans for their chunk of the settlement.  </P> <P> Some said they would open savings accounts or attempt to buy a home, while  others planned to take vacations or get medical treatment. One man said he  would simply cash the check and carry the money with him, admitting that it may  make him an easy target for robbers.  </P> <P> Most of them agreed that the money would help them build a better life for  themselves.  </P> <P> "Oh, I can't express my feelings. . . . It's helping me live life again," said  Beulah Robison, a 58-year-old woman who now works as a live-in maid for an  elderly man in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Robison plans to open a savings account, get a new pair of glasses and buy her  granddaughter a present with the money.  </P> <P> The lawsuit stemed from a Santa Ana policy begun in 1988 of discarding the  possessions of homeless people during periodic citywide cleanup campaigns at  parks and public places.  </P> <P> Santa Ana has since stopped throwing away the property and now keep all  collected belongings in a storage facility at Eddy West Stadium.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, city workers will also give the estimated 1,500 homeless  people who live in Santa Ana time to move their property before the cleanups  begin.

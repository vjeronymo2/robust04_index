			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Consumers' champion in the Japanese high street - A look at the innovative approach of the leading supermarket chain's founder Isao Nakauchi, a blunt talking baseball fan and former street trader, is doing more than almost anybody in Japan to change people's daily lives. He is doing so partly as one of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's top private sector advisers on the government's campaign to sweep away retail and distribution regulations, to stimulate the comatose economy, and ward off threatened US trade retaliation. But Mr Nakauchi, 71, is best known to millions of Japanese consumers through the profound changes in high street shopping he has pioneered as founder of Daiei, Japan's only national supermarket chain. Mr Nakauchi predicts the prices of most goods sold in his supermarkets will halve, to US levels in dollar terms, but this will take almost 20 years. Japan's retail market has already become free enough for deregulation to gain its own momentum, pushed by foreign competition, he believes. Daiei, which started life as a corner store in 1957, has led a slow campaign against countless middlemen, suppliers and sometimes bureaucracy, to nibble away at Japan's notoriously high prices and introduce new ways of shopping. Its innovations include Japan's first own-brands in 1978 and the first wholesale warehouse club outside the US, opened in Kobe 18 months ago. While Daiei is not the heaviest discounter in today's price battles in Japanese retailing, it led the first rounds of the war. Its acquisition last year of three regional supermarket chains has speeded up the rationalisation of Japan's overcrowded retail industry, eroding the dominance of the small corner store which forms a picturesque but overpriced staple of urban community life. Like his shops, Mr Nakauchi's personal style challenges the run of the mill. The corridor outside his office, for example, is lined with 75 historic cash registers, instead of the badly hung Impressionist masterpieces usually found in Tokyo corporate headquarters. The difference in style expresses a difference in conviction. Unlike most of his colleagues in the Keidanren business federation, devoted to defending the interests of big industrial producers, Mr Nakauchi made his fortune by pursuing consumers' interests. He got his first job after the war in his father's small town chemist shop, and founded the first small shop of his own outside a railway station in Osaka, rather than joining the bottom rung of the salaryman's corporate ladder, the usual way to the top. Mr Nakauchi befriended Mr Hosokawa after Daiei bought melons and grapes from Kumamoto prefecture during the future prime minister's period as governor there from 1983 to 1991. Daiei's patronage was a valuable boon to Kumamoto, since the nearly 10,000 stores it owns or manages under its own and other names take a 4 per cent to 5 per cent national market share in most products. Daiei's turnover of just over Y2,000bn (Dollars 19bn) in the year to last February, on which it made Y24bn taxable profit, makes it slightly larger than Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain. This might explain why the equally straight talking Mr Hosokawa turned to Mr Nakauchi for advice on deregulation in the retailing industry. Mr Nakauchi's report pointed out that Japan's chain stores would save nearly Y52bn annually if the government scrapped the 42 permits required to open a supermarket. Why, asked Mr Nakauchi's report, is it necessary to have separate permits to sell meat, milk, tofu and soft ice cream? Another is needed to operate a dry cleaning service and yet another to sell thermometers. Small shopkeepers have staunchly opposed deregulation since the web of rules has provided them with valuable protection from competition. Until recently, they were helped by their ties with the Liberal Democratic Party, which ran Japan for an unbroken 38 years until its election defeat last July. The break-up of the LDP is one factor to lighten small retailers' former political clout. Another, says Mr Nakauchi, is the ageing of the current generation of shopkeepers. Unlike Mr Nakauchi's two sons, both senior managers in Daiei, ambitious young people now see no future in joining their shopkeeping parents' business, he says. All this points to dramatic change in the high street. Mr Nakauchi believes half of Japan's 1.5m shops will go out of business. It will, in line with his theory of gradual change, be a slow process, taking until the middle of next century. But it will be inevitable, says Mr Nakauchi. He cannot see how Japan's retailing industry can sustain twice as many shops per head - 12 for every 1,000 people - as the US. Neighbourhood retailers will then broadly divide into supermarkets and convenience stores, 'so long as they are really convenient,' he says. Daiei itself neatly captures both sides of Mr Nakauchi's vision of retailing, with 225 Daiei supermarkets and nearly 5,000 Lawson convenience stores. He dismisses suggestions that the social cost of closing 750,000 shops will create a backlash. The process will take such a long time, perhaps 50 years, the lost jobs will be mopped up by service and leisure businesses, Mr Nakauchi predicts. Again, the shape of Daiei's own business deliberately reflects this, with its investments in hotels, consumer finance and even a baseball stadium, to house Mr Nakauchi's own team, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. Contrary to some other businessmen's attempts to dabble in field sports, Daiei's baseball projects are turning a healthy profit, despite the recession and the Hawks poor performance in the professional leagues. Mr Nakauchi has no plans to export the Daiei formula. His thoughts are more of learning from foreign retailers. He cites as his models Kmart of the US and Britain's Marks and Spencer, because of their devotion to value for money. He laughs when he is reminded that Baroness Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, is among Marks and Spencer's customers. Does Mr Hosokawa shop at Daiei? 'I don't know, but I certainly hope so,' says Mr Nakauchi.</p>

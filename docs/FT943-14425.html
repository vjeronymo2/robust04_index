			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: US forestal group hit by weakness in wood prices Weyerhaeuser, the US forest products company, saw second-quarter earnings before special items fall to Dollars 128.8m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 181.5m, or 89 cents, in last year's corresponding period. Sales for the period rose to Dollars 2.6bn from Dollars 2.4bn last year. The company said that although pulp and containerboard packaging prices had begun to strengthen, the improvements were offset by weaker wood products prices. Prices for logs, lumber, and plywood reached historically high levels last year. However, rising interest rates this year have dampened the new home building boom that had underpinned those price increases. 'Our second-quarter results were mixed,' said Mr John Creighton, president. 'We began to see the benefit from higher prices in our pulp, paper, and packaging businesses at the same time we experienced lower lumber, plywood and oriented strand board prices, and reduced volumes of domestic log sales.' Weyerhaeuser's timberlands and wood products segment turned in second-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 243.3m, up slightly from Dollars 241.8m. The company's pulp, paper and packaging businesses recorded earnings of Dollars 30.1m in the quarter, down from Dollars 44.4m in the second quarter of 1993. Weyerhaeuser's overall first-half earnings slumped to Dollars 255.4m, or Dollars 1.24 per share, from Dollars 359m or Dollars 1.75 in the 1993 first half. Sales for the period were Dollars 4.9bn, up slightly from last year's Dollars 4.7bn.</p>

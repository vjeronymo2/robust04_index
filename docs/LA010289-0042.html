			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> AVOIDING PREGNANCY  </P> <P> A test that tells a woman when she can have sex without using artificial birth  control to avoid pregnancy has been developed by a biotechnology company that  said it will be at least a year before it gains regulatory approval.  </P> <P> Monoclonal Antibodies of Mountain View, Calif., has released details about the  test, which it said provides valid results only during the second half of a  woman's monthly cycle, after ovulation.  </P> <P> The test, which Monoclonal said will sell for $3 to $5 per test when it is  eventually marketed, measures progesterone levels to tell women when ovulation  has happened. When the hormone level is high, it indicates that ovulation has  taken place and conception is no longer possible. The test involves putting a  spot of urine on a pad. If the progesterone level is high, the sample shows no  color. If the test sample turns blue, a woman would be liable to become  pregnant.  </P></p>

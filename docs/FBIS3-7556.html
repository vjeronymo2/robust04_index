			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Kagoshima Prefectural headquarters of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] held a meeting in  Kagoshima city on 26 March. On the issue of the next general  election for the House of Representatives, Wataru Kubo,  secretary general of the SDPJ, told the meeting: "If the  general election were to be held before this autumn, it would be  under the present multiseat constituency system. The ruling  coalition parties need to prepare for their election campaign  under any electoral system. They need to cooperate with each  other in the next general election."    He indicated the need for the ruling coalition parties to  speedily prepare themselves for electoral cooperation in  anticipation that the next general election will be held under  the current multiseat constituency system once the House of  Representatives has been dissolved.    Commenting on moves by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to  form a new party, he expressed again a negative view.    He said: "It will be difficult for the ruling coalition  parties to form a new party unless they reach a general  consensus on the view of the state, the Constitution, and  political tactics."</p>

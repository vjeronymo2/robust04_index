			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by freelance commentator Taro Yayama in "Fair </F> Argument" column: "Do Not Easily Compromise on Forming New  Government"]    [Text] The LDP Versus Non-LDP Structure Is Outdated    The ruling parties seem to have been split into two due to  differences in their positions on how to form the next  government following Hosokawa. Now that the situation has  become serious, they should not make any compromise to patch  things up. It is fervently hoped that all Diet members will be  fully aware of the current political situation and consider what  Japan is required to do, and what they have to do.    Carrying out political reform -- which the two previous  cabinets failed to carry out -- is the greatest political  achievement of the Hosokawa government. However, it can be said  that political reform has not been completed until redistricting  for new constituencies is decided and the effective date of the  new electoral system is set. Among conservatives within the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ], some want to see political reform canceled by  holding a general election after the Diet dissolution under the  current multiple-seat constituency system. Therefore,  regardless of what sort of cabinet the next government will be,  the Diet should not be dissolved until the new electoral system  is completely established.    The biggest immediate problem facing Japan is the issue of  North Korea. The United Nations is about to implement sanctions  against North Korea which is suspected of developing nuclear  weapons. Although I hope this issue will be settled peacefully,  I cannot help wondering what action Japan will take if the  United Nations should decide on sanctions. Senator William Roth  (of the Republican Party), who is versed in Japanese affairs,  stresses: "If Japan does not take any action, the Japan-U.S.  Security Treaty will be just a piece of paper." The government  is required to realize the possibility that if Japan, which  advocates UN-centered policies, should fail to comply with the  United Nations' possible decision on economic sanctions, not  only will its loyalty to the United Nations be called into  question -- and thus Japan will be isolated from the  international community -- but also the United States will  review its security treaty with Japan. Japan's evasion of its  responsibility by providing financial contributions, like during  the Persian Gulf war, will not be allowed this time. In order  to completely discontinue exchanges of things, money and people  with North Korea, it is necessary to review all the existing  laws and at the same time legislate new laws. The North Korean  issue is an important problem that tests Japan's ability to deal  with a crisis. Actually, instructions should have already been  given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to ministries and  agencies to study how to deal with the North Korean issue.  However, Mr. Takemura, who has close relations with North  Korea, has not done anything about it. Although there have been  calls for Mr. Takemura to be chosen as prime minister, it is an  absurd view. It may be all right to choose him as prime  minister if the situation is calm. But given such a serious  situation, we should by all means not let him take power.    Regarding the North Korean issue, SDPJ General Secretary  Kubo said: "Our party has fraternal relations with the Workers'  Party of Korea [WPK], and we can talk to the WPK because the WPK  is a fraternal party of the SDPJ." It is all very well, but I  wonder what the SDPJ will do if the situation does not allow the  SDPJ to talk to the WPK. When the Persian Gulf war broke out,  Ms. Takako Doi flew to Iraq and met with President Husayn. But  her effort ended in complete failure. I would like to ask the  SDPJ what action it will take if North Korea rejects requests of  such SDPJ leader as Mr. Kubo for accepting nuclear inspections,  and if the United Nations implements sanctions.    Mr. Takemura recently published a book entitled  Japan--A Small But Brilliant Country. In short, this  is a book of schoolgirlish tastes. When I visited Jakarta  recently, I asked a high-ranking Indonesian official which  countries the word "a small but brilliant country" brought to  mind. He answered "Singapore." This answer is common sense.  Japan is not "small." Japan's gross domestic product (GDP)  accounts for 15 percent of the total GDP of the world, and when  the GDP of the United States is added, it reaches 40 percent of  the world GDP. The view of the international community is that  Japan should have a more responsible role in the United Nations.  With such hopes in mind, foreign nations say that they can let  Japan become a permanent member of the UN Security Council when  the United Nations is reformed. I think Mr. Takemura and the  SDPJ probably want to avoid any military duties. However, they  should recognize that Japan will not be allowed to take such a  special position in the United Nations.    Need To Promote Economic Reform    The next immediate task is to seek ways to solve the  Japan-U.S. economic friction. Japan is frowned on by foreign  nations for storing up a $130 billion trade surplus. Of course  the United States and European nations cannot criticize Japan if  Japan's market is fully open to other nations. However, in  Japan various regulations and barriers were established in  wartime and during the period of postwar reconstruction. From  the standpoint of the other nations, it is not easy for foreign  nations to access Japan's market. This reflects the fact that  the Japanese are unable to obtain cheaper foreign products. The  gap between domestic and foreign prices is about 30 to 50  percent. Getting rid of regulations and barriers will not only  help solve trade friction but also lead to creating a society in  which the people feel comfortable and satisfied with their  lives. The Hosokawa government, after carrying out political  reform, set "economic reform" as the next task to be fulfilled.  It was a correct decision. However, carrying out economic  reform requires a capability to overcome the heavy resistance of  bureaucrats. In view of this, the ruling parties need to get  united. The Hosokawa government failed to take the leadership  because of the split in the ruling parties resulting from the  conflict over political realignment and policy matters, thus  failing to bear down on bureaucrats. Meanwhile, however, a line  has already been laid by Hosokawa. What the next government has  to do is to run on the track like a weighty train.  <H5>  Rise in Consumption Tax Unavoidable </H5>   Carrying out tax reform is also an unavoidable matter.  Unlike the time when consumption tax was introduced, the people  are now gradually understanding the meaning of indirect tax.  The current component ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax  revenue is 7:3. If this current component ratio should remain  unchanged in the coming aging society, payment of income tax  will be unbearable for tax payers. For this reason, a rise in  consumption tax is unavoidable. The new coalition government  should keep this point in mind.    Revision or abolition of the current food control system is  also indispensable.    It is urged that politicians who share a common  understanding  on the current political situation described above get together.  The government formed through such a process will be able to  work in the people's interests.</p>

On Tuesday [1 February], during his visit to the  Arab-Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Geneva, the  Palestinian leader reiterated that 12 billion dollars will be  needed for rebuilding Palestine. The issue had already been  broached during the meeting between Mr. 'Arafat and Mr. Stich on  Monday.    Mr. 'Arafat spoke Tuesday in Geneva to more than 600  representatives of Swiss and foreign industry established in  Switzerland. According to Elias Attia, secretary general of the  chamber, all of the country's largest companies were  represented, from construction to chemicals and banking.    The Palestinian leader reiterated that his country would  have  a market economy, that it would be democratic, and that it would  respect the equality of men and women. According to him, the 12  billion dollars needed for reconstruction will primarily be used  to reestablish basic infrastructure. Forty percent will come  from the public sector, while 60 percent will come from private  investors.    On Monday, during his meeting with the president of the  Confederation in Bern, Yasir 'Arafat had asked Switzerland to  participate actively in rebuilding the infrastructure "destroyed  by the occupation" in the territories. "We need your support  and your experts," he said. According to Mr. Stich, apart from  the financial aid (60 million Swiss francs) planned by  Switzerland, the talks also centered on technological  cooperation and tourism.</p>

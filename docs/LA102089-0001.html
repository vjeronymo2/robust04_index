			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING RTD BUSES ON TIME  </P> <P> Wishart's column only substantiates what exasperated riders of the 406-407 line  have experienced at least since I started riding the line in January, 1985.  </P> <P> After numerous complaining calls, two petitions addressed to the local county  supervisor calling for better service in the form of on-time buses, and local  meetings attended by riders, RTD officials, and politicians, nothing has  changed in 4 1/2 years of bus riding.  </P> <P> At one point a few weeks ago, the bus that had been showing up at a particular  time failed to arrive for three days in a row. Calls to RTD asking if there was  an unannounced schedule change only inform the dispatchers what they already  know, i.e., the bus failed to arrive as scheduled.  </P> <P> The reasons given by RTD for such shoddy service are always the same: lack of  drivers, shortage of working equipment and a dearth of spare parts. Since bus  riders can only vote with their feet, how will the powers that be convince more  people to take the bus in view of the inability of RTD management to rectify  the problems?  </P> <P> Even the drivers are hampered by such ineptitude. One recent consistent and  courteous driver left to drive another line when he realized that RTD would not  provide adequate equipment to service the line.  </P> <P> In fact, since there appears to be no particular accountability on the part of  RTD officials to do anything about the problems, why should they? I'll continue  to ride the bus because my company subsidizes the cost. My answer to the shoddy  service is: What do you want for nothing?  </P> <P> At any rate, fellow bus riders of the 406-407 freeway express to downtown Los  Angeles from Sunland-Tujunga and thereabouts will continue to refer to RTD as  the Ridiculous Transit District, or better, Real True Disaster.  </P> <P> ROBERT MARGULIES  </P> <P> Tujunga  </P></p>

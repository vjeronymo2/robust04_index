			<p>CSO     [Text] Concurrent with the unprecedented intensification of  the economic and social crisis in the country and increasing  mass protests by an exasperated public, reports have been  received of the spread of student strikes.    Following the student strike at Martyr Beheshti University  in  Tehran (formerly the National University), which began as a  strike by women students against the unworkable situation at the  student dormitories and quickly spread throughout the  university, the strike continued for a week with a demand for  the firing of the university management.    Based on this report, whose details are still unclear, 500  accounting students at Tehran's 'Alameh Tabataba'i University  staged a strike on 7 and 8 Esfand last year [26-27 February  1994] demanding the firing of the university president.  Likewise, officials at Qom's Fatemieh University closed the  academic term in the face of an extensive student strike against  this university's excessive tuition increase.    The leaders of the regime of the "vice regency of the chief  jurisconsult," who remember well the experience of the student  strikes of the years 1355-56 [21 March 1976-20 March 1978] and  their connection with a mass movement during the Bahman [21  January-19 February] revolution, have undertaken a terrified  search for a solution, believing that by "dealing" with some of  the class demands of the students they will prevent the student  movement from spreading and becoming a national political  movement. In this regard, in a note in the budget passed for  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the Majles has required the  Central Bank to "provide the relevant universities with 10  billion tumans through the banking system in the form of  interest-free or participatory loans and other devices to  complete and build student dormitories."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Istanbul (NATIONAL PRESS AGENCY)--President Suleyman  Demirel has said that a difference of opinion exists between the  leading officials and many of the opposition circles in the  Western world on the Kurdish problem. He asserted: "The  question of the establishment of a Kurdish state is in the  offing. We must be prepared."    Demirel attended the dinner held by the Supreme Press  Council  in the Divan Hotel in Istanbul last night. He discussed the  question of the establishment of a Kurdish state, which the  officials of the Western countries frequently mention. Minister  of Internal Affairs Nahit Mentese, Minister of National  Education Nevzat Ayaz, Governor of Istanbul Hayri Kozakcioglu,  and Director of Police in Istanbul Necdet Menzir also attended  the dinner. Demirel was accompanied by his advisers Emre  Gonensay, Cuneyt Arcayurek, and Omer Tarkan. He recalled that  the British, German, and French foreign ministers opposed the  establishment of a Kurdish state in the statements they made  both in and outside Turkey but said that Mrs. Mitterrand in  France and several members of the House of Lords and the House  of Commons in Britain had mentioned that possibility. Demirel  asserted: In light of the developments, Turkey must be prepared  for the establishment of a Kurdish state. It must consider  every possibility on that matter.    Asked whether or not the Kurdish state that the Western  officials are considering would include a part of Turkey,  Demirel said: "Considering the statements that have been made  and the maps that have been drawn, Turkey is included in their  plans. In other words, they have not excluded Turkey. Large  maps have been drawn up and published."    Replying to a question on the massacre of 20 people,  including women and children, by the Workers Party of Kurdistan  [PKK], Demirel said that the action was an act of violence, the  Turkish security forces will definitely take the necessary  measures, and the PKK will definitely be rendered ineffective.    Demirel disclosed that the PKK does not have toxic gas and  other chemical arms at the present time. However, he stressed  that the security forces do not have clear-cut information on  that matter. Nevertheless, he said that the information  available at the present time must be regarded as being valid.</p>

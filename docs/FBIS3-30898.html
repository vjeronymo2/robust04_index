There, Jeszenszky had met, among others, "Yugoslav"  Foreign Minister Jovanovic, Serbian President Milosevic, and  representatives of the opposition parties. Agoston, chairman of  the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDK), had  participated in the talks with Milosevic and Jeszenszky. In an  interview with this newspaper before his departure to Brussels,  where he signed the "Partnership for Peace" agreement with NATO  on Tuesday, Jeszenszky expressed his surprise at the light in  which his meeting with the political leaders of the southern  neighboring country is now being presented. It is not true that  Hungary agreed with Serbia on main points. The Hungarian  foreign minister was particularly furious about a WASHINGTON  POST report that the attempt at the normalization of  Serbian-Hungarian relations that had been made by Budapest is  endangering the observation of the sanctions imposed by the  United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro.    Jeszenszky affirmed Budapest's point of view, which had  already been stated in Belgrade, that Hungary is supporting the  lifting of the sanctions if "Yugoslavia" succeeds in again  winning the favor of the community of states by its actions. By  that time, which is hopefully not too far off, Hungary will, of  course, fulfill its commitments toward the United Nations and  other international organizations. Hungary has always strictly  watched over the observation of the sanctions at its borders, he  said. (In fact, representatives of the commissions of the  European Union (EU) for the observation of the embargo have  always praised the cooperation with the Hungarian authorities.)  Although his country suffered an economic damage of about 2.5  billion German marks because of the sanctions, Hungary will  stick to the exact controls at the checkpoints with Serbia.  However, it is equally evident that Hungary must not wait  unprepared for the lifting of the sanctions, he said.  Jeszenszky protested against the assumption that Hungary might  have promised the government in Belgrade that the sanctions will  be loosened in exchange for granting limited autonomy to the  Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, which belongs to Serbia. "Such  a deal does not exist," Jeszenszky said.    He carefully chose the date of his visit to Belgrade  because,  in the weeks before, a turnabout of the government in Belgrade  had been perceptible -- that is, regarding the 400,000  Hungarians in Vojvodina, as well as the demands of the community  of states. Hungary is supporting the Kinkel-Juppe plan of the  European Union, which provides for the gradual loosening of the  sanctions in exchange for concessions of the Serbs in the peace  negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nobody will be able to  reproach his country for striving for cooperation with Serbia,  for example, in the combating of crime, and for seeking a  dialogue with Serbian authorities, so that the passage of  Hungarian ships on the Danube across Serbia is no longer impeded  by illegal blockades by Serbian nationalists, he said. The  Hungarian foreign minister is aware that only time will show  whether the Serbian president's good words will also be followed  by action. Not only since the latest massacre in Sarajevo has  he viewed the relations with Serbia with skepticism and  refrained from any naive hopes, he said.    Hungary unreservedly accepts NATO's offer of a Partnership  for Peace. In the Hungarian foreign minister's opinion, this  concept opens up two opportunities: On the one hand, if offers  Russia the opportunity to get closer to NATO, while, on the  other, it makes allowance for the fact that Russia's domestic  policy might develop in a wrong direction. Central Europe  rightly attaches central importance to the Partnership for  Peace; it is not a policy of weakness that shows too much  consideration for Russia. Apparently, the conviction that one  cannot be successful in pushing through democracy and the market  economy in Russia, without having previously pushed through  democracy and the market economy in Central Europe is shared in  Brussels, he said. The Hungarian foreign minister advocates the  theory that democracy and the market economy are gradually  advancing from the West to the East. Jeszenszky does not believe  that NATO will demand from Hungary that its military expenditure  of currently 2 percent of its gross national product has to be  increased soon to 4 to 5 percent, which is usual in the NATO  states. "The Partnership for Peace is not a program that  involves high costs, but it can contribute to the modernization  and restructuring of the armed forces of the Central European  states with a relatively small financial expenditure,"  Jeszenszky said.    Regarding Hungary's integration into the European Union, it  has meanwhile been shown that the opinion voiced, for example,  by Chancellor Kohl in 1990, that is, that Hungary could become a  full member in five to six years, was due to the generally  hopeful mood at that time. Today one has to see that full EU  membership -- the association agreement with Hungary came into  force on 2 February this year -- has to be expected to take a  longer time, approximately until the end of this century. In  view of the security risks in Central Europe, it is a logical  development that the West has above all accelerated security  policy integration. Therefore, it is likely that it will be  easier for Hungary and its Central European partners to be  admitted to NATO and the Western European Union than to the  European Union.    For Jeszenszky, Hungary and Poland have been the driving  forces of the states of the so-called Visegrad Group right from  the beginning. The Hungarian foreign minister deplored that the  Czech Republic and Slovakia are pursuing cooperation with their  Visegrad partners, Poland and Hungary, with only little  enthusiasm. "Central Europe will be jointly successful or  jointly fail," Jeszenszky said. Those in Prague who believe that  a special road to NATO or the European Union can be taken is  wrong. Jeszenszky advocated the revival of cooperation both in  the Visegrad Group and the Central European Initiative [CEI].  The CEI, to which Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Poland,  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina belong today, developed from a small alliance  of Central European states, the so-called Pentagonal. For the  Hungarian foreign minister it was a disappointment to see the  former Czechoslovakia increasingly withdraw from the CEI after  rather enthusiastic cooperation at the beginning. Because of  the war in the former Yugoslavia and the unstable situation in  Italy, the CEI had to limit itself to modest objectives and  little significant statements for the time being, he said.  Nevertheless, Jeszenszky also hopes for the revival of the CEI,  because all member states should be interested in increased  economic exchange, all the more so after peace in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This also offers the chance of closer  political cooperation, Jeszenszky concluded.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Observer: Bank byting One of the big unknowns of early 1993 is how Barclays Bank will address the continuing institutional pressure to split the role of chairman and chief executive. There is even talk of Barclays looking as far afield as the US for a new ceo. In the meantime one man to watch is 45-year-old information technology supremo Joseph De Feo, who has only been with the bank for three years. Big banks have to get their operating costs down if they are to survive, and De Feo is the man in the hot seat at Barclays. He has a lot in common with Gene Lockhart, Midland's ex-technical wizz. Both are straight-talking Americans who have made their reputations on Wall Street rather than in UK branch banking. Pride of place in De Feo's office goes to a huge Louisville Slugger baseball bat and he is not afraid to describe Barclays property lending binge as 'dumb'. Unlike Lockhart, who was promoted to the Midland board within a year of joining, De Feo has not yet made it into Barclays' inner sanctum. He's also said to earn rather less than the Pounds 725,844 Lockhart commanded at the peak of his popularity. However, in much the same way that Lockhart's future was tied closely to that of his boss, Sir Kit McMahon, De Feo's high flying career also depends on the star of current Barclays' chairman Andrew Buxton remaining in the ascendancy.</p>

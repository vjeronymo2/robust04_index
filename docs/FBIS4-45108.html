			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Principled Stand on Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] President Farooq Ahmed Leghari said that he  dismisses any possibility of changing the Line of Control in  Kashmir into an international border. He said that we cannot  ignore the Kashmiri people's right to decide their own future.  We cannot sacrifice the sacrifices that Kashmiri people have  made for this goal. After the final meeting of a seminar held  the other day, the president answered news reporters' questions  and said that he clearly dismissed any effort to make the Line  of Control a permanent border in Kashmir. The Kashmir issue has  its own legal and human aspects. It is not possible for  Kashmiris to give up their right to decide on their own future.  It is very important to give the Kashmiri people their right  according to the UN resolutions. He said in response to a  question that our stand on the nuclear program was very clear.  While commenting on the position taken by U.S. Congressman  Hamilton, he said that he will discuss this and other issues  with U.S. officials during his visit to the United States.  Dismissing the possibility of making the Line of Control a  permanent border in Kashmir, he expressed the opinion with which  the whole nation agrees. Basically, this was proposed by a U.S.  Congressman on his own and it is not necessary to accept any  proposal made by the Americans. What the Congressman said could  be because of his limited knowledge of the situation. The United  Nations agrees that India should follow up on the UN  resolutions. India has been deceiving the United Nations for the  last 45 years and the Kashmiri people's bravery and sincere  efforts have unmasked this deception. The world is fully aware  of India's role in Kashmir and Kashmiri people's struggle for  freedom. It is a fact that India cannot make its point on  Kashmir at any local or international forum. As a selfless  supporter of Kashmir people, Pakistan has unmasked India's evil  role, war crimes, and evil designs to the world. The Indian  leadership despite being embarrassed is still insisting on the  correctness of its stand. The only reason for this is that it  wants to keep its control on this heavenly, Islamic and valuable  valley. Pakistan has always maintained this stand that India  should accept the UN resolutions for solving the Kashmir issue.  The proposal to accept the Line of Control as an international  border did not surface for the first time. India, England, and  some other countries have been advising about it in the past  also. However, no one thought it necessary to consider this  suggestion. The Kashmir issue basically is not a border issue  between two countries. It is the question of freedom and the  right to democracy of about 20 million people. [sentence as  published] The unprecedented sacrifices the Kashmir people have  made during he last few years were not made to accept any third  suggestions and Pakistan cannot force its decision on the future  of Kashmiri people. It is not a secret what the Kashmiris want.  If they wanted to accept the Line of Control as a border, why  would they have sacrificed the lives of 40,000 of their people?  We cannot stop anyone from giving advice or making suggestions,  however, neither are the Kashmiris ready to back off from their  principled stand nor will Pakistan accept any illogical  suggestion. If the U.S. government is desirous of establishing  peace in South Asia, it should advise India to stop their  genocide of Kashmiris and accept the historic facts and  decisions of the Kashmiris.</p>

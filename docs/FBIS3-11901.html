In a meeting with Vo Tran Chin, member of the Politburo of  the Vietnamese Communist Party (PCU) and its first secretary in  this city, Robaina said that changes being implemented in his  country are carried out under strong pressures, a permanent  threat, and a pitiless blockade by the United States.    During the last stretch of his official tour covering eight  countries of Asia and Southeast Asia, the Cuban foreign minister  indicated that there are some risks that must be taken in every  transformation process. "It would be much worse to engage in  mistakes because we did not implement the needed changes," he  added.    In commenting on the impact on Cuba of a possible lifting of  the U.S. economic blockade, Robaina emphasized that such a step  would entail a new type of challenge "which would not be  strictly related to problems of food and welfare, but to issues  related to morals, values, and principles."    The Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Politburo member stressed  that Cuba is quite clear as to its final objective and will  never back away from what it has accomplished so far. "In the  economic sphere we are implementing many changes and there are  still many more to be taken," he stated.    In addition, we want to receive firsthand input from a  brother country such as Vietnam to which we are united not only  through economic ties, but as result of a historical, timely,  and open relationship," he added.    In expanding on the issue, Robaina commented that Cuba is  about to start a process of recovery that depends on endeavor  and work, without having to depend on one single commercial  partner, by diversifying its economy as well as its foreign  relations.    "Cuba is asking from the world what it professes for the  world, understanding and respect," he declared.    The head of the Cuban diplomacy stressed that if there is  something that gets his attention with respect to Vietnam's  experiences, it is the manner in which the CPV controls and  directs the renovation process.    On other hand, Vo Tran Chin commented that currently there  are many aspects both countries can exchange in order to  overcome the prevailing situation.    Before concluding his stay in this city, the Cuban  delegation  will meet tomorrow with leaders of the southern city and will  tour sites of economic interest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Do We Have a Firm Grip on It?"] </F>   [Excerpts] Bratislava--In an interview for Slovak Radio,  Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik described the early elections in  the Slovak Republic as extremely necessary. As far as the  crisis in parliament is concerned, he is of the opinion that the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia is to blame for the  situation. [passage omitted]    In the interview, Moravcik also responded to a REUTER report  on the problems within the Slovak banking system. According to  him, the Slovak Government will take measures to ensure that the  situation depicted in the agency's inaccurate report does not  arise. He described the banking system as the economy's nervous  system. The Slovak Government intends to keep it in order.  "Everything indicates that we have a firm grip on the situation  and that there is no danger," he said.</p>

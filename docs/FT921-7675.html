			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / The Property Market: Unpaid rent recovery law may change Another legal change proposed by the Labour party this week will be cheered by thousands of tenants but abhorred by many landlords in both the commercial and residential sector. Labour plans to repeal legislation that allows landlords to recover unpaid rent from former tenants. The topic was addressed by the Law Commission in 1988 and the Lord Chancellor's department says it is looking closely at the matter. Labour says the current legislation is a anomaly that should have been reformed years ago. 'It is a sixteenth century law. Its repeal should receive widespread support,' says Labour's Ms Andrea Rushton. The property industry is less convinced. 'If you accept a good covenant and the lease is assigned to somebody who fails on you, it is equitable that you can go back to the original tenant,' says Mr John Parry of Hammerson. Any change would be 'most unfortunate', he adds. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors believes that existing contracts should not be tampered with. Surveyors think that a change in the law would diminish one of the attractions of UK property and could lead to landlords restricting the rights of assignment in future leases. On balance, however, RICS thinks there is a case for changing the law on new leases. 'It is unfair to have a responsibility in year 20 for a lease you assigned in year one,' says Mr Colin Vaughan of the institution's commercial property and financial services committee. The many companies that are facing crippling demands for rent arrears on properties they used to occupy will agree.</p>

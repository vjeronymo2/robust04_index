[passage omitted] First policemen  asked for documents certifying the payment of road tax, which is  levied on weekends. After these documents were presented, they  took away vehicle registration documents without giving any  reason. They only told the protesting passengers that whatever  they did, the buses could not leave the territory of the Slovak  district.</p>

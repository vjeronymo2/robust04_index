			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Bonds: World Bank delays global offering until next week The World Bank has delayed its much-anticipated Dollars 1.5bn global offering until next week due to current market volatility and holidays in Japan and the US, joint lead manager UBS said yesterday. Syndicate managers were expecting the Bank to tap the five to 10-year area of the dollar sector this week. 'They are looking at the long end of the market and with current market volatility this is an awkward time to do it,' said one syndicate manager. Strong US producer price figures released on Friday have increased bond market nervousness about US consumer price data due today, UBS said. 'With less data next week, we will get the focus of the market,' said one UBS official. Elsewhere in the eurobond market, activity remained subdued, with investors nervous following the rise in UK base rates and ahead of the key US CPI data today. The Dollars 500m offering by Metropolis of Tokyo of 10-year eurobonds suffered from weakness in the dollar sector, syndicate managers said. 'Markets are nervous and investors are holding back their purchases,' said one syndicate manager. 'As a result, the offering has suffered a bit.' The bonds, priced to yield 32 basis points over US government bonds, were targeted mainly at Japanese institutional investors, lead manager IBJ said. Syndicate managers described the pricing as tight; the spread widened to 35 basis points after the bonds had broken syndicate. 'The spread should have been wider but most of the paper will clear at the 34-35 level,' said one manager. Market sources said the proceeds from the offering were swapped back into yen. France Telecom launched its first eurobond outside the French and Swiss franc sectors with a L150bn issue of three-year bonds. Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation reported strong demand from retail investors in the Swiss and Benelux areas and some French institutional interest. 'The lira market is currently very retail-driven and offers tremendous arbitrage,' said one manager. Dresdner Bank launched a FFr2bn offering of four-year bonds, priced to yield 18 basis points over French government bonds.</p>

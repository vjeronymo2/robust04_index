			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz May 4 TASS -- "The provisions of the  social concord agreement, signed in the Kremlin on April 28,  must serve as guidelines for talks between the presidents and  official delegations of North Ossetia and Ingushetia," North  Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov said here today, addressing  leaders of North Ossetian art unions, rectors of higher  educational establishments, and representatives of the  republic's national cultural centres.    The North Ossetian leader went on record for the  continuation  of the dialogue with the Ingush side, but bluntly rejected the  idea of a moratorium on border changes. In his opinion, it is  necessary to completely delete from the agenda the question of  recarving the borders of the North Caucasian area, because this  may provoke a new tragedy in the region.    The North Ossetian president dwelt at length on the  forthcoming celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia's  accession to Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation  of the city of Vladikavkaz. The jubilee celebrations, devoted  to these dates, will be held from October 7 to October 15.  Galazov said that these dates "have not lost their importance  at all, but are assuming a new historical meaning in the light  of modern political problems".</p>

Taking advantage  of new business without incurring the wrath of the European  Union. This will be the salient line of Telecom Italia, the  single telecommunications operator that is currently being set  up, the macro structure of which is now in the finishing stages.  It will be divided into five divisions: network; business;  mobile radios (that will also deal with part of the satellite  activity in the future); basic and international services.    How was this decision reached? One of the main goals that  STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] set itself in 1992, when  the law on the reorganization of the telecommunications sector  was approved, was the establishment of Telecom Italia. Up to  now telecommunications has been a fragmented realm of  competencies and functions, that has obviously brought about  waste and lost opportunities. It was a precise goal, but not an  easy one. So STET created a special internal task force (that  comes directly under Managing Director Michele Tedeschi), called  in external consultants, and to avoid the usual rows with  Brussels, intensified its monitoring of the European directive  on deregulation that is becoming increasingly restrictive as  demonstrated during the recent bidding for the GSM cellular  telephone. For example, amongst the many directives from  Brussels, there is number 44 of 1992 (which is being  incorporated into the Italian regulations) that provides for  "transparency" of the network based on the so-called ONP [Open  Network Provision]. A special division with responsibility for  the network has also been planned for Telecom Italia to avoid  failure to comply with European Union directives. But let us  proceed in an orderly way.    The reports of the four consulting companies called upon by  STET (Bain Cuneo, McKinsey, Tesi and Telos) to compare the  possibilities for realigning the Italian telephone with the  leading industrialized countries and to make a detailed study of  the structures of the other administrations, were delivered  before Christmas. They were immediately distributed to the  strategic task force, to the operational structures of STET and  IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry], to the  executive committees, and to the advisors of the companies  involved in the operation.    The dossiers of the four consultants are set out in  different  ways and reach several conclusions. The McKinsey report is  based more on international comparison, the others are more of  an organizational nature. Let us start with the first. After  having compared the principal operators in the sector at a world  level, the McKinsey report reached the conclusion that today  STET is more efficient than the very well-known (and privatized)  British Telecom (BT), but a little less efficient than the  French operator and the German Telekom. Furthermore, still  according to McKinsey, SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone  Company] should still have ample margins to improve the quality  of its service, its purchasing policy, and its dealings with  major international clients. As far as the tariff side is  concerned, the Italians recognize the fact that a single  operator is a good opportunity to restructure the tariffs too,  since the existing restrictions can finally be lifted.    Now that the reports have been thoroughly studied, the men  from STET seem to have come to a fairly precise idea about how  to structure the Telecom Italia that is being created. But they  know well that the process will not be a short one, because once  the optimal structure has been outlined, its realization needs  to be careful and gradual.    The first key point is the confirmation of Tecnitel, the  subholding led by Umberto Silvestri, for the management of  companies like Italtel, SIRTI [Italian Telephone Network  Company], AET [Electrical Telephone Equipment], and NECSY  [Network Control Systems] operating in the manufacturing and  installation sector of the STET group. Furthermore, according  to the prevailing hypothesis, the other companies that are not  involved in the management of services (Finsiel [Information  Systems Finance Company], Saritel, CSELT [Telecommunications  Study Center and Laboratories], Telesoft, etc.) will be excluded  from the reorganization.    And what about the sole operator (that has always been  called  Telecom Italia, even if the name could change)? Barring last  minute modifications -- that are always possible -- the  divisional structure chosen by SIP in the fall of 1991 should be  substantially confirmed, at least as far as its philosophy is  concerned.  SIP currently comprises a dozen staff functions (the areas  covering quality, programming, technology, network, strategic  planning, real estate, purchasing, external relations, auditing,  central affairs, administration, and personnel), and four  divisions (basic services, business, public telephones and  mobile radio telephones). Telecom Italia is moving toward a  structure that has more divisions and a further balance of staff  functions. The most important transition is the transformation  of the basic network connecting districts, excluding the local  network, into an autonomous division. The Telecom  infrastructure will be created by merging the SIP, Iritel,  Italcable, and Telespazio networks, while a single  administration and control of the technical area (for plants and  operations) have become essential prerequisites as far as  marketing is concerned. In particular the network division will  become the sole supplier both for "internal customers" and for  the external ones (for example the operator of the private GSM  or the major companies), as provided for by European Union  directives. Then a new division will be formed for international  communications, while public telephones will become part of the  basic services that will lose the major part of the network.    So Telecom Italia will have five divisions. And a couple of  warnings: First, within a period that still has to be defined,  mobile radios should break off to become an autonomous business,  while the policy of alliances could produce new structures. If  this is the new Italian telecommunications structure that is  emerging, the levels of autonomy of the various structures, the  details of the staff areas, and the relative weights to be given  to the various boxes shown on the organization chart [not shown]  must still be defined.</p>

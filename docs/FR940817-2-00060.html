			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl and EPA both desired and intended to assure continuity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the proceedings concerning the July 12, 1991 waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, as remanded to EPA by the Court of Appeals, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application. The entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative record compiled by EPA in support of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial decision, as well as all submissions to the public docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the remanded application, was incorporated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record this final decision on the resubmitted application. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket number for the resubmitted waiver application also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remained the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional 180 days that were provided by Ethyl's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement to resubmit the waiver application were utilized by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate remaining issues that may have been relevant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's decision. In particular, EPA continued to examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects on public health that might be associated with approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Ethyl's application. EPA considered any additional underlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data concerning studies of occupational manganese exposure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were obtained by or submitted to EPA, as well as any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data or information pertaining to the health effects of manganese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by Ethyl or other interested persons during the comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. Any additional information that was submitted was also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in exploring alternative candidate RfC estimates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their relationship to the verified revised RfC. EPA also used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the additional time provided by the extension to make a decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how the RfC should be utilized in assessing health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may be associated with MMT use, evaluate potential exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to manganese compounds associated with MMT use, complete a risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment concerning Ethyl's application, and decide what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional data, if any, should be provided by Ethyl either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before or after MMT is introduced into the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 28, 1994, EPA provided Ethyl Corporation with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft of the revised risk assessment, which updated the 1991 ORD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment and incorporated further analyses performed during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 180-day extension period. Subsequent to providing Ethyl with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this draft, Ethyl provided EPA with comments on the draft and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some additional new data on ambient manganese concentrations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several Canadian cities. In order to allow the Agency time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider this new data, Ethyl requested, and the Agency agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, an extension of the decision deadline until July 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An agreement implementing this extension was executed by EPA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl counsel on May 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. History of Statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress first added section 211(f) to the Clean Air Act in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1977 based primarily on concerns that fuels or additives might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage vehicle emission control devices. Thus, the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute focused on vehicles designed to use unleaded gasoline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibiting the general use in fuels of materials not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantially similar'' to fuels used to certify vehicles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions standards. Section 211(f) also provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator of EPA ``may waive the prohibitions *&blank;*&blank;* if he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the applicant has established that such fuel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel additive *&blank;*&blank;* will not cause or contribute to a failure of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control device or system *&blank;*&blank;* to achieve compliance by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206.'' <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Additionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute provides that if the Administrator does not act to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or deny the waiver request within 180 days of receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, the waiver request shall be treated as granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 206 of the Act sets forth the certification requirements with which vehicle manufacturers must comply in order to introduce into commerce new model year motor vehicles. Under &sect;202 of the Act, standards for hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions for gasoline, gaseous fuel, diesel and methanol-powered motor vehicles have been established. For gasoline, gaseous fuel and diesel-powered motor vehicles, standards have also been established for particulate emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(f) was initially interpreted by the Agency as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying only to unleaded gasoline. In the 1990 Amendments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(f)(1) was broadly expanded to cover all other fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fuel additives, including leaded gasoline, diesel fuel, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer additives. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The 1990 Amendments also apply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this subsection to vehicles other than lightduty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for use by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands to all motor vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel prohibitions of the original section 211(f)(1) (now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated as section 211(f)(1)(A)), which apply only to light- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duty vehicles. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.R. Rep. No. 490, Part 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 313 (1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An interpretive rule defining the term ``substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1)(A) was promulgated for unleaded gasoline at 46 FR 38582 (July 28, 1981), and revised at 56 FR 5352 (February 11, 1991). An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) has been published to begin the proces of promulgating an interpretive rule to define the term ``substantially similar'' under &sect;211(f)(1)(B) for diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives. See 56 FR 24362 (May 30, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In adding section 211, the first focus of Congress was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the introduction of new additives which may prove harmful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to emission control devices but to allow for the introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such additives if it could be demonstrated that they would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm emission control devices. Furthermore, in framing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute such that the Administrator was not required to grant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver, Congress provided authority to the Administrator to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account other considerations associated with introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new material into commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Two Stage Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides the legal authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this waiver decision. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  The Agency interprets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two stage process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the decision to grant or deny a waiver application. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first stage of the process focuses solely on whether a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant has met its burden to demonstrate that a fuel does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second stage of the process reflects the discretionary authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to the Agency by the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(f)(4) states that ``The Administrator, upon application of any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive, may waive the prohibitions established under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, or the limitation specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if he determines that the applicant has established that such fuel or fuel additive or a specified concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel or additive or specified concentration thereof, will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206. If the Administrator has not acted to grant or deny an application under this paragraph within one hundred and eighty days of receipt of such application, the waiver authorized by this paragraph shall be treated as granted.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

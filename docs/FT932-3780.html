			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / CSO warns first quarter figures more likely to revision than normal The Central Statistical Office warned yesterday that the first-quarter trade figures were more than usually liable to revision as a new system for measuring EC trade flows settled down, Emma Tucker writes. The figures showed little change in the UK's trade deficit with the European Community. Following the opening of the single market at the end of last year, Customs declarations - the old source of trade statistics - are no longer required for movements of goods within the community. Intrastat, a system for measuring intra-EC trade statistics, has therefore been introduced. It takes its information from a combination of surveys and value added tax returns. The CSO said Customs had received returns from traders representing about 86 per cent of the value of exports and 78 per cent of imports in the first quarter. 'As a result, estimates for the first quarter are less reliable, are subject to greater revision than usual and have been shown rounded to the nearest Pounds 100m,' it said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE (Pounds m seasonally adjusted)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Excluding oil and erratics             Exports    Imports   Balance    Exports  Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988         80,346    101,826   -21,480     68,718   93,980   -25,261 1989         92,154    116,837   -24,683     78,941  106,582   -27,641 1990        101,718    120,527   -18.809     87,067  108,224   -21,157 1991        103,413    113,703   -10,290     89,003  102,580   -13,577 1992        106,775    120,546   -13,771     93,516  109,961   -16,445  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 Q1      26,055     29,055    -3,000     22,803   26,450    -3,647      Q2      26,642     29,772    -3,130     23,177   27,013    -3,836      Q3      26,431     29,718    -3,287     23,096   27,167    -4,071      Q4      27,647     32,001    -4,354     24,440   29,331    -4,891 1993 Q1      29,600     34,100    -4,500     25,700   30,900    -5,200  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

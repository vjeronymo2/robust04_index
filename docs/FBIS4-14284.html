He directed his  comments to the current situation the country is going through.    [Begin Lounaoussi recording] The FFS rejects violence as  political means. The FFS rejects any agreement or settlement  that could be reached between parties which advocate violence at  the expense of democracy and the Algerian people. The FFS  rejects any dialogue which does not aim at building an Algeria  of democracy, an Algeria of Human rights, an Algeria that  conforms with international values. [end recording]    [Kirat] He also spoke about the Amazighi cultural movement  which continues, as he said, to advocate the Amazighi identity.  [passage omitted]</p>

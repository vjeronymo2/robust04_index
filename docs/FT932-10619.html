			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (6): US housing market is key to lumber rally - Laurie Morse asks whether the forests 'gold rush' can be sustained Adeclining and rather unremarkable little creature has sparked a gold rush in Canada's forests, reversing three years of losses and providing some breathing room to the embattled forest products industry. Concern over the ecological stability of the Northern Spotted Owl, which resides well south of the Canadian border in California, Washington and Oregon has brought timber cutting in those states to a near-halt. Canadian loggers have attempted to make up the production shortfall, reaping windfall profits from lumber prices which have, in some cases, doubled since October. A Price Waterhouse analysis says the turnaround in wood prices sent the Canadian forest industry's profits to Dollars 180m in 1992, compared with Dollars 869m losses in 1991. The improvement is expected to accelerate in 1993, since the bulk of the lumber rally occurred between January and March. The sustainability of the timber rally, and the profits of forestry companies, however, depend upon growth in the US housing market and the extent to which substitute products are available. Canada historically has provided the US with 99 per cent of its lumber imports, or about 30 per cent of its total needs. Lumber company executives view themselves as 'marginal' suppliers to the US market, and as having only a small role in determining North American lumber prices. However, the western US timber harvest dropped 60 per cent last year to 2.64bn board feet. At the same time, US homebuilding rebounded, increasing US lumber demand by 3bn board feet to 45.2bn, a six-year high. Future US harvests are expected to be even smaller, based on federal timber sales to date. Mr John Combes, a timber management analyst with the US Forest Service, says court injunctions linked to the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest caused sales on government-owned lands to dwindle from 9bn board feet in 1987 to 2bn in 1992. 'The shortfall in the US Pacific northwest is very large. British Columbia alone can't make up the shortage, because we are already logging very close to our allowable cut. Supply is a serious constraint in this market,' says Mr Richard Bryan, chief economist for the Council of Forest Industries in British Columbia, where 80 per cent of Canada's US lumber exports are produced. The price of a standard Canadian softwood (spruce, pine or fir) 2x4 board rose from Dollars 230 a thousand board feet in February 1992 to a record Dollars 475 this February. Since the peak, the price has eased to about Dollars 320. The up-and-down volatility has unnerved some mill managers. Mr Laurence Cater, lumber analyst and publisher of Madison's Canadian Lumber Reporter, explains that the rally stalled because a March storm that dropped snow up and down the eastern US slowed homebuilding just as a late freeze allowed additional log harvesting in Canada. According to the US Commerce Department, housing starts dropped to 1.13m units on an annualised basis in March, the slowest rate since July. However, with US mortgage rates at record lows and fine weather in April, homebuilding is expected to rebound. Mr Cater says that if US housing starts reach a projected 1.2m units in 1993, 'it will tax the limits of the North American lumber industry,' and sustain higher prices. However, the economics of timber processing traditionally requires a balance between prices paid for lumber and chips, a sawmill byproduct that is the raw material for pulp. Overcapacity has turned pulp prices into a disaster this year. Limited chip demand has, in some cases, slowed lumber milling even as lumber prices rise. Mr Ross Hay-Roe, forest products specialist for Vancouver-based Research Capital Corp, says picking companies that will profitably ride out the lumber price boom can be tricky. Slocan Forest Products, based in Richmond, BC, is what he terms a 'model' sawmill. It is projected to have earnings per share of Dollars 3.30 in 1993, up from 25 cents in 1992. The increase will be almost entirely due to beneficial lumber prices. Donohue, a newsprint, pulp, and lumber company based in Quebec, is viewed as a well-integrated company that stands to benefit from strengthening newsprint prices as well as the current lumber boom. So far, the ballistic price increases have not turned buyers from the Canadian market. The Canadian dollar has weakened against the US currency, and continues to decline against the Japanese yen, buffering the rally. Japanese buyers, who prefer high-grade old-growth coastal lumber from British Columbia, may be paying five times as much for lumber this year than last in Canadian dollar terms, but see no price increase in their own currency. Unlike the US, the vast majority of Canadian forests are government-owned. Forestry companies operating on crown lands are subject to intricate provincial harvest limits and fees. As demand for other forest uses, including tourism and land claims by indigenous peoples, increases, timber cutting on crown lands, particularly in British Columbia, will decline. To fill the gap, lumber production in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan is rising this year. Lumber harvests in the fast-growing softwood forests of the southeastern US and eastern Canada are also on the rise, although wetlands protection legislation will limit that expansion. Some Canadian companies such as BC-based MacMillan Bloedel are gradually expanding their US holdings, basing fibre-processing plants in such states as Minnesota and Alabama, where cheap, low quality wood is abundant. Over the much longer run, Canadian foresters worry that their exclusive role in supplying the US lumber deficit will be usurped by foreign timber. 'There is no global shortage of (wood) fibre,' says Mr John Johnson, forest industry analyst with Richardson Greenshields. The US has begun to import wood from Honduras, Costa Rica and Chile, and as far away as New Zealand. The competitor that Canadian forest executives most fear, however, is Russia. Although only small lumber shipments have so far made their way to Washington State, Russia's huge forest lands and its thirst for hard currency makes a larger trade inevitable. Russia contains 51 per cent of the world's coniferous forests which, if harvesting and processing infrastructure were upgraded, could supply much of the globe's demand for timber.</p>

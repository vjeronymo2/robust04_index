			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] At the end of their visit to Algeria  yesterday, the European troika stressed their support for the  economic reforms currently under way and the progress of the  dialogue between the Algerian government and the opposition,  with the exception of the parties involved in violence, to  overcome the political crisis. Colleague Bechir Hedebil has  prepared the following report on the visit and its results.    [Hedebil] The Greek foreign minister stressed that the  troika  delegation came to Algeria with a message of support from the  European Union [EU] for the Algerian economic plan and national  dialogue.    George Papandreou described the talks between the European  delegation and Algerian officials, led by [President] Liamine  Zeroual as serious and frank.    In the economic sphere, the European delegation expressed  its  deep satisfaction at the economic plan and the government's  concern about economic reforms. The Algerian Government  delegation, led by [Prime Minister] Mokdad Sifi, was reassured  about the EU's support for Algeria in its negotiations with  international financial institutions. Papandreou said:    [Papandreou, in English with superimposed Arabic  translation]  In the discussions we also talked about the recent signing  of the agreement with the IMF and we expressed our support for  Algeria because that agreement is regarded as a solid basis  which demonstrates and proves the Algerian Government's  determination to continue the economic reforms. We have  expressed our support for these serious efforts.    We also discussed constructive proposals for  cooperation between Algeria and the EU. We made proposals on  support and help for these efforts to achieve the government's  plan.    [Hedebil] Regarding assistance or financial support,  Papandreou said:    [Papandreou] We have announced to the Algerian  Government that 150 million ECU's, which is the second  installment of a loan, will be paid to Algeria soon. Regarding  the proposal and request for a new loan of 200 million ECU's, we  have replied affirmatively to the Algerian request in order to  consolidate the economic stabilization plan. The request will  be submitted officially to the European Commission and the  European Council of Ministers in forthcoming sessions.    A delegation of European experts will visit Algeria to  hold in-depth talks with Algerian counterparts to discuss joint  action to consolidate and implement the economic plan.    [Hedebil] Papandreou concluded by saying that Algeria  possessed enormous resources and had a very important future,  and that the EU supported its plan and would make every effort  to achieve the reforms by developing a partnership.    In the political sphere, the Greek minister stressed the  need  to support the democratic process:    [Papandreou] Again let me stress as we have during our  discussions that the European Union favors, supports and backs  democratic governments, wherever they may be, which respect  human rights, aspire to economic stability and the realization  of reforms, including social reforms, and strongly condemns the  use of violence and terrorism.    The Algerian minister of foreign affairs, Mohamed Salah  Dembri, focussed on the European delegation's understanding of  the difficult situation in Algeria and the pressing need for  supporting it financially in order to achieve economic and  political stability in the country.    [Hedebil] He said that Algeria was determined to achieve  market economy, had a deep desire to have economic dealings with  the EU and that it had put an end to the old economic obstacles.</p>

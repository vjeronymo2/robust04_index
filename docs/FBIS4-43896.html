			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Articles of Poor Faith"] </F>   [Text] The remarks made by Albert Reynolds in yesterday's  IRISH TIMES about the constitutional relationship between Ulster  and the Republic of Ireland were grimly overshadowed by the  funerals of the six Catholics shot dead by Loyalist  paramilitaries on Saturday [18 June]. The brutality of the  Loughinisland massacre -- which claimed the life of an  87-year-old man watching the World Cup on television -- will not  be quickly forgotten. Yet the Taoiseach's [Irish Prime  Minister] words were no less symbolic of the problems that face  the province than the pall-bearers' march.    In the interview, Mr Reynolds demanded a cross-border  authority in return for rescinding Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937  Irish constitution which assert the Republics historic claim to  the North. He and his deputy, Dick Spring, have always made  clear that the constitution would be changed only in the context  of a broader settlement. Yesterday the Taoiseach came closer to  spelling out the conditions which the South would try to exact  from the British Government and the Unionist community. He  expected "institutional links between North and South" which --  crucially -- would have "executive powers." Though still vague,  this demand moves far beyond the existing structures of  Anglo-lrish diplomacy and cross- border co-operation. It would  involve major amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act.    This proposed bargain should be rejected by British  ministers. Articles 2 and 3, which were recently declared a  "constitutional imperative" by the Irish Supreme Court, are an  outrageous anachronism rather than a legitimate bargaining chip.  For Ireland to claim territorial rights over part of another  European Union member state also makes a mockery of its  high-minded aspirations as a European nation. There can be no  question of a deal in which Eamon de Valera's articles were  dropped in return for the partial transfer of executive power in  the North to Dublin.    Joint authority, in any case, is the least satisfactory of  the various constitutional options open to Ulster. Its  superficial attractions are obvious, particularly to a  generation of politicians and diplomats who have grown used to  the institutions set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to the  meetings of the British-lrish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Under a  system of joint authority, the Republic would not have to  shoulder the entire cost of the province but would assume a veto  over all key decisions in the North. The British Government  would be able to claim that it had responded to nationalist  demands for self-determination without abandoning the Unionist  community.    In practice, such a system would stand little chance of  succeeding. The blurring of sovereignty would create more  problems than it solved. The Unionist parties would be very  unlikely to participate in any administrative structures which  gave Dublin "executive power." Though the constitutional  nationalist parties would welcome joint authority, the IRA would  regard it as only a staging-post on the way to reunification.  For the same reason, Loyalist violence would probably increase.  Run by fractious committees, the province might soon become  ungovernable.    The deal set out by Mr Reynolds yesterday epitomises the  delusions of Anglo-lrish diplomacy in the past nine years. In  the wake of the weekend s murders, it should be clear that  constitutional horse-trading between London and Dublin is no  solution to the suffering of Ulster. Imaginative security  measures and swift devolutionary reform would contribute far  more than the spent rhetoric of the Downing Street declaration.  Six months on, the refusal of the two governments to recognise  the need for a change of strategy is no longer excusable.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: 'Waterland' and after 'LITERATURE is about reconciling life and death,' said Graham Swift. 'If it can transcend the individual life of the artist then it has achieved that purpose.' Death is a subject which must have been much on his mind over the last few years because mortality lies at the heart of his new book. Ever After is his fifth novel and, Swift says, his best. The story of an undistinguished academic who has loved and lost his wife, Ever After combines Bill Unwin's struggle with grief and his 'obsession' with an ancestor, a Victorian who has lost his own wife and family through his disbelief in God and a belief in Darwinism. 'When people say about this book that it's a love story, that's fine by me. If people say it's a story about death and mortality, that's fine by me. That heartens me because everyone has to face their own deaths and everybody, hopefully, will in the course of their life love and be loved. These are very basic things.' Ever After is Graham Swift's first novel since Out of This World was published four years ago. Now in his early forties, he first began writing in his early twenties when he should have been studying for a PhD. The doctorate in Dickens was never finished but in the 1980s Swift's training paid off and four novels and a book of short stories were finished and published. It was Waterland, Swift's story of mystery and history in a 'fairy-tale' Fenland, which sealed his reputation and earned him a place on the Booker Prize shortlist in 1983. Described by one critic as 'profoundly and unmistakeably English', a description he disagrees with, Swift has also found many readers abroad. But Swift graciously declines to place himself within any contemporary literary movement. 'l feel that I'm an individual writer. I think the process of writing is one of finding yourself and finding your own voice. l suppose I think I have my own voice and I'm certainly not looking now to other writers to give me moral support in my own work.' Swift's new novel, like so much of his work, is very much concerned with how the past shapes the present and how the individual relates to history. 'I think everyone has to accept that they are shaped by the past and I explore that fact and I think other writers do it too. As a storyteller you are dealing with what has happened, you are intimately involved with the process of trying to understand the past. History is very closely bound up with the business of narrative.' Narrative and the process of creation is, for Swift, something magical and mysterious. 'I begin with some seemingly fragmentary, incidental, little thing, whether it's some scene that comes into my head, whether it's some phrase or sentence, some little image which resonates. 'l want to lay myself open, I want my subconscious to help me. I think novels are in a way dreamt up, that's the best way I can put it. Suddenly there are these strange things going on in your head. In the case of the formation of a book it's like having a very powerful far-reaching dream.' Until Ever After, which perhaps might change things, Graham Swift's best hope of immortality through remembrance rested with the success of Waterland, a novel which has overshadowed his other work. It's a problem which Swift admits might be made worse by the release later this year of a film version of Waterland. 'It's pinned on me this label, author of Waterland, which I am very proud to wear. But I suppose mixed with my pride about the success of that book is a little bit of weariness. Whether or not the new book is going to eclipse that I don't know. It's perhaps time that people said, 'well he's not just the author of Waterland', but given that the film is coming there will be a lot of attention on the past work as well and there's nothing I can really do about that. It's good to have something around to say well hang on, I didn't just write that book, there's this other one around and it's quite a lot better.' Swift although he has become more and more involved in the filming of Waterland, was not interested in writing the screenplay and his loyalty remains, above all, to the novel. 'I'm a novelist and a short story writer,' says Swift. 'I think it's very important to remember that what fiction is all about is this invisible mental act when the reader sits down with a book silently, unseen, and you hope this marvellous, magical, chemistry occurs. 'That's what I write for. It's a wonderful thing.'</p>

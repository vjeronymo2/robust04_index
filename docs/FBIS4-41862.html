			<p>BFN     [Text] Late in June 1954 the world learned about the  launching of the first nuclear power station on the earth in the  town of Obninsk close to Moscow. The scientific community all  over the globe is now marking the 40th anniversary of that event.    At present in Russia the nuclear power industry accounts  only  for 12 percent of total electricity output. We have had a long  range objective for the share to grow to 30 or 35 percent. Now  some details from the first deputy minister of atomic energy of  the Russian Federation, Lev Ryabev.    [Begin Ryabev recording in Russian fading to English  translation] Over the past five years with nuclear disarmament  under way we have been striving to use our potential, first of  all scientific potential, to solve problems of safety in the  Russian nuclear power industry, and other issues, including  those of ecology. This country is now drafting a new power  program up to the year 2010. The strategy of developing the  nuclear power industry is part of the program. For the first  time in the record of this industry, the program incorporates a  profound economic and ecological analysis.    We are now developing reactors and reactor stations of the  so-called third generation to keep abreast of the latest  requirements adopted by the International Association for  Nuclear Affairs. These new developments are scheduled for the  beginning of the next century to boost the nuclear power  industry. Large-scale and wide-ranging research is under way in  the birthplace of the nuclear power industry, Obninsk, at the  Physics and Energy Institute. The main objective of the center  is to develop fast neutron reactors. The researchers there have  proved that this is a highly promising line of studies. [end  recording]    The first deputy minister of Russia's atomic energy, Ryabev,  concludes by saying that as for a look for another 40 years, he  feels the nuclear power industry's safety problems will be  solved drastically. The problems of highly radioactive waste  will also be solved with fine results for ecology. As the  nuclear power industry here keeps developing on a large-scale,  it will hold even greater positions in the long-term and that  will amount to economic gains for Russia.</p>

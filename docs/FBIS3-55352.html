The next scheduled round of talks between the two countries  is to begin on Jan. 18 in Moscow.    Olljum in an interview with BNS said several important  events, including a U.S.-Russian summit and the first meeting of  the new Russian parliament, are to take place before Jan. 18.  The chancellor said these events caused the need for some kind  of preliminary talks before the scheduled meeting of delegations.    Speaking about his planned meeting with Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, Olljum said "the invitation  from the Estonian side remains in force."    The foreign ministers of the two countries at a meeting in  Brussels early last month agreed in principle on a meeting  between Olljum and Churkin. Olljum said Churkin had been ready  to come to Estonia in the last week of December, when Olljum was  having his vacation.    Estonia has received no proposal so far about a new possible  date for Churkin's visit.</p>

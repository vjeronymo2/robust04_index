			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UN rejects Iraq's response to flights ultimatum THE THREAT of renewed military action hung over Iraq early today after the United Nations rejected as unsatisfactory Baghdad's response to an allied ultimatum. This insisted it give immediate clearance for UN weapons inspectors to fly into the country. The rejection came two days after a raid by allied aircraft on missile sites in the air exclusion zone in southern Iraq. Shortly before a 9pm GMT deadline expired yesterday, Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's UN representative, said his country had agreed to allow the UN to go ahead with its flights, but could not guarantee their safety in the event of another military attack by the US-led coalition. In Baghdad, a government spokesman said the UN aircraft would be allowed to fly in Iraqi airspace on January 15-18. The special UN commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's dangerous weapons said it viewed Baghdad's response as a 'refusal' because it abdicated Iraq's 'obligation for ensuring the safety and security of UN special commission personnel'. US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said that Iraq's response was 'wishy-washy'. He added: 'I think the president's made it clear that if Saddam Hussein doesn't step up to the plate and deal with the situation the way he really wants, why, Saddam may be in some more trouble.' The commission appeared to give Iraq a second chance when it said it was sending Baghdad a new set of flight plans shortly in the hope it would not 'couch' its reply in the same manner. The commission said the earliest sensible date for a resumption of UN flights would be on Sunday morning. These remarks prompted speculation that military action had been put on hold. But early this morning the White House said it was still reviewing the situation. Diplomats in the allied coalition meeting in New York and US officials both indicated that Mr Hamdoon's promise fell short of the unconditional compliance with UN resolutions they were seeking. They also said yesterday's Baghdad statement made no reference to the allied demand for the removal of Iraqi police posts from Kuwaiti territory. President Bush declined to spell out what action might follow if Iraq did not comply with the ultimatum. 'Sufficient warnings have been given. They know what they must do,' Mr Bush said. 'This is not just the US, it's the United Nations. It is a strong coalition whose determination has not diminished in any single way.' Iraq claimed yesterday its air defences had chased off a military aircraft from the southern no-fly zone. It warned the allies that anti-aircraft units had been alerted to confront any more 'hostile activity'. 'The US administration has given Iraq only one choice, that is the choice to go to war,' said the government newspaper al-Jumhouriyah. The US said it could not confirm another Iraqi claim that its anti-aircraft batteries had fired on a 'hostile air target' in the south of the country. The latest US ultimatum was issued shortly after more than 300 troops from the US Army 1st Cavalry flew into Kuwait from Fort Hood in Texas. A further two jets were due in the night. US officials expect the full complement of about 1,100 troops to be in place by tonight. They comprise a reinforced brigade of two M1A1 battle tank companies, an infantry company and an artillery battery. Officials stressed that the troops would not be used to police Kuwait's border with Iraq. The fresh deployment will bring to about 1,700 the number of US military personnel in Kuwait.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Inventories Rise: Business inventories rose 0.7% in May as sales growth  stagnated, the Commerce Department said, leading some analysts to predict  further production cutbacks during the rest of the year. When not accompanied  by increases in sales, rising inventories often prompt manufacturers to  decrease production until stockpiled goods are sold, resulting in a loss of  jobs. The department said inventories held on shelves and back lots climbed to  a seasonally adjusted $776.9 billion in May after a 0.8% rise in April. The  pace of business sales, on the other hand, rose a minuscule 0.02% to a  seasonally adjusted $517.9 billion. Sales had risen 2% in April after holding  steady in March.  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Profits slip to R581m at Anglo American ANGLO American, South Africa's largest company, is maintaining its interim dividend at 90 cents per share despite an 11 per cent fall in attributable profits to R581m (Dollars 193m) for the six months to the end of September. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, predicted earnings would fall more in the second half owing to a 'downturn in world economies together with unsettled local political and economic conditions'. Anglo's investment earnings rose marginally to R641m from R630m, due mainly to higher dividend income from gold mining interests, which contributed 27 per cent of investment income. The higher dividends reflected increased gold production and well-contained costs. Anglo is the world's largest gold producer. Dividends from platinum interests - in Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer - fell on the weaker rhodium price. Trading profits fell by 8 per cent to R229m, due mainly to a decline at Anglo American Coal. Earnings per share fell to 251 cents from 282 cents. With the retained earnings of associated companies falling to R523m from R611m - reflecting recessionary conditions in the diamond, platinum, industrial and base metal industries - the group's equity-accounted earnings fell by 13 per cent to R1.1bn. Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted that, over the reporting period, Anglo's associate, De Beers, had opened the R1.1bn Venetia diamond mine; shaft-sinking had started at the R1.7bn Moab gold mining project; the R1bn Namakwa Sands heavy minerals project got the go-ahead; and the Anglo group announced plans to participate in the Collahuasi copper venture in Chile.</p>

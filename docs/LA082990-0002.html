			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL TO CUT PAYROLL TAX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY  </P> <P> It is always a source of amazement how Will can be brilliant in dissecting the  issues and solutions on the political horizon and yet be so confused as to why  various people and groups take the positions they do.  </P> <P> In supporting Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes, Will correctly  points out how unfair it is to use these Social Security surpluses to finance  the government's general operations, and more importantly, how regressive the  tax is -- a flat tax with a ceiling on taxable income.  </P> <P> But Will wonders why Republicans don't jump on the bandwagon and support  Moynihan's plan. From the days of Alexander Hamilton to George Bush,  intelligent conservatives have understood what politics is all about -- place  the benefits of government on the wealthy and big business and the costs on the  middle class and poor. Will questions whether it is wise for conservatives to  campaign for a cut in the capital gains tax, an increase in taxes for beer and  yet oppose paring Social Security taxes.  </P> <P> Well, politically it may be a blunder, but ideologically it is right on the  money. One only hopes that other liberals see the light that Moynihan has seen:  The soul of the Democratic Party is indeed at stake.  </P> <P> RALPH S. BRAX  </P> <P> Lancaster  </P></p>

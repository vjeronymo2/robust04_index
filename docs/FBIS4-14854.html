			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Filippov, chief of the Russian </F> Federation president's information support administration:  "Those Who Called for Violence Cannot Act As Judges, Believes  Petr Filippov, chief of the Russian Federation President's  Information Support Administration" -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  headline]    [Text] I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of  Russian citizens and politicians representing their interests in  the Federal Assembly (and they are of the most diverse  orientations) advocate accord. There is no doubt that you will  always find in society those who try to win political prestige  by kindling hostility. There will be irresponsible politicians  in the Federal Assembly too, and there will be such on the  streets and squares.    It is essential to seek civil accord by all possible means  which exist in society. There have been enough attempts to  "rock the boat." Otherwise the future of Russia, the future of  our people, will be jeopardized. Unless we try to halt  political emotions now, we are threatened with a repetition of  the sorry and tragic experience of Georgia and Tajikistan, where  blood is now being shed. Preventing bloodshed -- that is the  main aim of the conclusion of civil accord.    It is finally time our society realized and considered what  happened 3 and 4 October. Those to blame for those events,  those who called for violence, are now acting almost as judges.  God forbid that an inversion should take place in public  awareness whereby the innocent are called the guilty and the  guilty avoid trial. That is dangerous for the moral climate of  society. The guilty must be punished individually, they cannot  be allowed to turn into defenders of justice. There is a kind  of dialectic under way -- the combination of appeals for peace  and accord on the one hand and on the other the refusal to  accept under the slogan of accord those who want to live in a  normal society, a society of civil accord.</p>

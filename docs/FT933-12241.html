			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Sheehy defends proposals for police shake-up VERY FEW police officers are likely to have their careers 'abruptly terminated' if fixed-term contracts are introduced by the government, Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of the committee recommending the change, says today. Proposals to introduce fixed-term contracts are the most controversial element of the Sheehy report. It recommends that all officers should be employed on initial 10-year contracts, subsequently renewable every five years. Sir Patrick, writing in today's Financial Times, defends his committee's radical proposals for changes in police pay and conditions. He accuses the Police Federation, which represents the majority of officers, of having been long on emotion and short on factual content in its response. The Sheehy committee's proposals - which include performance related pay and abolition of three ranks - have drawn opposition from all the police staff associations. Pressure on the government to tread carefully mounted yesterday when Mr Paul Condon, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he might be unable to continue in his post if some of the reforms went through. Mr Condon, 45, who was handpicked by Mr Kenneth Clarke when home secretary to modernise Britain's biggest police force, said in an interview in the Observer newspaper that he would 'find it very difficult to be a well-paid commissioner, presiding over a demoralised, badly-paid Metropolitan Police'. While supporting some Sheehy recommendations, such as those for a flatter management structure, Mr Condon said the inquiry had not understood the motivation and nature of policing at street level. The suggestion that the Sheehy committee has produced unrealistic recommendations because none of its members had experience of policing has been a consistent police service claim in the three weeks since the report was published. Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT Industries, says in his article that the committee 'fully recognised that our lack of professional experience of working with the police service made it vital that we should learn about the police at first hand'. During 55 visits to 24 forces, he says, committee members found that constables felt badly managed and chief officers lacked the tools to manage them. Sir Patrick describes the claim that fixed-term appointments would be inconsistent with the concept of the police service as a vocation as a 'curious argument'. The only reasons for refusing to renew a contract would be medical unfitness, gross misconduct, manifest incompetence, or structural grounds.

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / This Week: Music It is hard to believe that yet another new set of Beethoven symphonies can produce fresh insights, but John Eliot Gardiner's magnificent version with the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (Archiv Produktion) will surely set new standards of excellence for future performances. Exploiting the clarity and precision of period instruments, Gardiner has used recent work by textual scholars to try to get closer to the composer's final thoughts on these canonic pieces, resulting in some radical re-fashioning of tempi which are barely recognisable from some of the lumbering recordings of the past. If you like your Beethoven sprightly, listen and enjoy the work of a great interpreter. Before the designer suits and the Royal Albert Hall, Eric Clapton used to play the blues. From the Cradle (Reprise) is an entirely logical follow-up to the success of his Unplugged album, which proved definitively that there was a new generation interested in the music which Clapton grew up with. They are all here - Willie Dixon, Elmore James, a lovely 'How Long Blues' and great guitar-playing all round - but there is also a distinct shortage of surprises. Sinead O'Connor (below), on the other hand, would rather grow her hair long than produce a predictable album. Universal Mother (Ensign) has the most cringe-worthy moments on an album since John Lennon's Primal Scream period, but she shares with him a raw and passionate intensity which is hard to ignore. Motherhood is her pre-occupation this time round, although grief, Irish political history and Kurt Cobain also get a look in. A new batch of rare jazz recordings has been re-issued by EMI on their Blue Note Connoisseur series. Pick of the current crop is True Blue by Tina Brooks, a talented and unjustly neglected tenor saxophonist, who teams up in this 1960 session with Freddie Hubbard and Duke Jordan. Esa-Pekka Salonen, conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic, continues his efforts to popularise modern music with his world premiere recording of Witold Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony, coupled with the same composer's Third Symphony and Les Espaces du Sommeil (Sony). Latest move to bring affordable classical recordings to an ever-expanding audience is EMI's partnership with WH Smith in producing a range of compilations of Gilbert and Sullivan, Bach, Beethoven, Maria Callas, early hymns and psalms, as well as themed collections on 'Vienna', 'the spirit of Russia' and more.</p>

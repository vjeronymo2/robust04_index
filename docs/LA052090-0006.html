			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S IN THE MALE  </P> <P> Now that I have joined the "outside work force" (after having been at home for  20 years and hearing from everyone at home how easy I had it) and my husband  left it (due to illness), I laughed when I read "It's in the Male." When I get  home, all I hear is that the laundry is done and how "tired I am."  </P> <P> At these moments, I recall someone (I won't use names) telling me how easy it  is staying home and how demanding it is working outside.  </P> <P> Also I recall having to let him go in our room for at least a half hour before  anyone could say a word to him. When I come from work every evening I am barely  able to put my purse down when everyone tells me it's dinner time.  Occasionally, I run my finger on the oven hood and comment on how it needs to  be cleaned. At these moments we look into each other's eyes and burst out  laughing. Perhaps it's these differences that make the world go around.  </P> <P> DELIA LOPEZ, Sylmar  </P></p>

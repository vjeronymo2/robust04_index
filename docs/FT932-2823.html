			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords referendum motion is tabled OPPONENTS of the Maastricht treaty in the House of Lords yesterday set out their bid for a referendum on the treaty, as peers geared up for the beginning of the detailed line-by-line debate on the bill next week. The cross-party amendment was tabled by Lord Blake, a Conservative, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, a Labour peer, and two independent peers, Viscount Tonypandy, the former Commons Speaker, and the Duke of Devonshire. The amendment would come late in the discussion of the bill, and may not arise until the last planned committee-stage day on Monday June 28.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- With Economic Affairs  Minister P.K. Chiang's remarks on Taiwan's policy toward  Mainland China becoming the focus of attention late last year,  the ministry he chairs is expected to continue to play a leading  role in the cabinet for the new year.    Chiang said at a press conference following a ministerial  meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in  Seattle in November that Taiwan "is taking a step-by-step  approach toward a two-China policy."    Although Chiang later explained that his statement was  simply  aimed at refuting mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's  remarks that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of  China [ROC], his words have still been a subject of much  controversy.    The Taipei government has reiterated that its goal of  pursuing China's eventual peaceful reunification has not changed.    In late December, the minister said he would ask the cabinet  to consider opening direct shipping links across the Taiwan  strait on a city-to-city or harbor-to-harbor basis in order to  help local manufacturers reduce transportation costs. The  proposal drew a mixed reaction.    Taiwan currently only allows indirect trade, transportation,  and mail connections with the mainland in accordance with its  national unification guidelines, which set phased goals for the  development of cross-strait ties.    Observers here said Chiang's two politically sensitive  statements were enough to make him 1993's "man of the year" in  Taiwan.    Since assuming his ministerial post in February 1993 after  having served as a vice minister of economic affairs, Chiang has  plunged intensively into his work. He placed priority on  Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), rallied efforts to avert possible trade sanctions by the  United States, and started to promote Taiwan as a business  operations center in the Asia-Pacific.    Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September  1992, aims to become a full member this year. In late April,  Taiwan was put on the American "priority watch list" targeted  for trade retaliation.    Chiang's efforts at making Taiwan an Asia-Pacific hub reaped  bountiful success when strategic alliances with 11 foreign  enterprises, including American companies AT&amp;T, Motorola,  General Electric, Carpenter, and General Motors Corp., Holland's  Philips Co., and ABB of Sweden, were formed.    Transfers of advanced technology from these multinationals  are expected to help upgrade Taiwan's industrial base, while  these firms in turn could use Taiwan as a gateway to tap the  vast Southeast Asian and mainland Chinese markets.    Chiang stumbled, however, in talks over the proposed joint  venture between Taiwan Aerospace Corp. and British Aerospace plc  (BAE) to produce and market BAE-developed regional passenger  jetliners. The talks deadlocked at the end of the year.    Moreover, Taiwan last year suffered its most serious drought  in 39 years, underscoring the importance of preserving water  resources to the minister and other officials.    For the new year, a load of work is already piling up for  Chiang.    Taiwan's talks with the United States on tariff concessions  are to be held later this month, and negotiations with  respective GATT contracting parties will start in February. In  addition, March will see the United States review trade  practices of countries placed under the priority watch list.    Chiang also has to place emphasis on growing cross-strait  trade, which will be key to Taiwan's economic development.  Cross-strait trade is expected to top US$20 billion this year,  up substantially from 1993's US$15 billion.    Judging from the tasks ahead, Chiang and his ministry will  have to work hard to win Taiwan a role on the world stage.</p>

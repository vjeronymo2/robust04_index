			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, disappointed with the American  stand against the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC),  hopes Japan will not be influenced by Washington.    Dr. Mahathir is also upset with the change in stand by the  Clinton administration which had earlier said it would be  open-minded towards the ASEAN proposal.    Foreign press reports said Washington's latest opposition to  EAEC would make it difficult for Japan to accept ASEAN's  invitation to join the caucus. But, Japan is waiting to be  formally informed by the U.S.    Commenting on the development, Dr. Mahathir questioned the  rationale of the U.S stand.    He said EAEC was not a trade bloc or formal forum but merely  a loose establishment for economic cooperation.    We are very disappointed because, previously, the Clinton  administration appeared more open minded, he told reporters  after launching the World Islamic Civilisation Festival '94 here  Friday.    Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia and its ASEAN partners had  repeatedly explained that EAEC was not a trade bloc and they  would continue to do so.    He also said Malaysia did not understand why EAEC was  rejected. Is it because of our colour? He asked.    He said Malaysia would not allow the differences over the  EAEC, originally mooted by Malaysia, to jeopardise its  relationship with the U.S.    We will use our friendship to explain our stand (to the  U.S.), he added.    Dr. Mahathir had said Malaysia-U.S. ties were set for the  better after his meeting with President Clinton during his  recent visit to the U.S.    Foreign Minister Datuk Dr. Abdullah Badawi said Malaysia  hoped to get a clearer picture from Japan at the upcoming post  ministerial conference of the ASEAN ministerial meeting in  Bangkok later this month.</p>

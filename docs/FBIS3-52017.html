			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto Rodriguez in San Cristobal de Las </F> Casas from the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast]    [Text] The National Human Rights Committee [CNDH] issued  from San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas State, a report on its  work in Los Altos de Chiapas.    According to the report, there has been an individualized  follow-up investigation of the legal situation of 131 persons  reportedly arrested, including three minors. Of those persons,  60 have formal arrest warrants against them, and 58, including  one minor, are free.    It is also known that 18 persons who are Guatemalan,  Salvadoran, and Honduran nationals are at the disposal of the  immigration authorities in Tapachulas for violating the General  Population Law [Ley General de Poblacion].    The CNDH reports that out of 400 missing person reports, 278  people have been located.    Regarding the criticisms from nongovernmental organizations  -- particularly from Amnesty International -- the CNDH said it  believes the time will come for them to settle those  differences. For the time being, the CNDH said, it is focusing  all its attention on complaints and its work in support of the  civilian population.    On another topic, Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de  Las  Casas, said all the Mexican people, regardless of their  religious preferences, must get involved in the search for a  profound solution to the problems brought up during the conflict.    Ignacio Diaz De Leon, executive secretary of the  Inter-Religious Council meeting in San Cristobal de Las Casas,  said the role of the Council is to raise society's consciousness  regarding the dignity of the indigenous groups.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / China rates squeeze alarms export credit bodies EFFORTS by Chinese companies to squeeze interest charges on loans for big import contracts below internationally agreed 'consensus' rates have caused alarm this week among leading export credit agencies. At a meeting of their umbrella body, the Berne Union, the agencies warned that the Chinese pressure was threatening to blur the higher levels of transparency being sought in the financing of big contracts in the developing world. They said the efforts would raise funding costs rather than trim them. The 'consensus' interest rate on finance for contracts in China is currently 6.75 per cent. This figure is reviewed twice a year by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and is intended to prevent tit-for-tat subsidy wars over the financial terms of contracts in developing countries. Pressure from China has come from companies that have to pay a 35 per cent tax on any foreign contract which carries loan interest rates higher than 5 per cent. Contractors in certain countries have been willing to 'cosmeticise' their interest rates by adding to the price of the contract the 1.75 per cent margin between China's demanded rate and the consensus rate. This has been condemned by certain countries, among which Australia has been prominent, because it might give other countries the false impression that governments were willing to bow to pressure to offer lower loan interest rates. It has also been criticised because it increases the danger that corrupt middlemen might splice 'commissions' into the price of a contract. An OECD official said yesterday there was no principled objection to 'cosmetic' interest rates. He noted that several Islamic governments required zero interest rates to conform with Islamic banking laws. He emphasised nevertheless that the consensus rate would still effectively be charged, even if it were built into the contract price. The cost of such loans would be higher as a result, he said, since banks asked to 'cosmeticise' the loan would charge fees for doing so. China is also at odds with OECD exporters in the telecommunications sector, where it is insisting that projects are not commercially viable in order to qualify for 'mixed credits' - cheap loans where commercial credits are mixed with grant aid. Many OECD governments insist that telecommunications projects should be seen as commercially viable. Under the OECD's Helsinki accord, agreed in 1991, aid funds cannot be used to dilute the cost of loans if a project is commercially viable. The spokesman said the same issue had arisen over contracts in India, and that the power sector was likely to prove as controversial as telecommunications. A Bank of China official denied in London it was government policy to press for interest rates below the consensus rate. Problems had arisen in part because Chinese importers, ignorant of internationally agreed financing rules, were 'looking for bargains'. Confusion had also arisen among domestic banks like Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agriculture Bank, which have only recently become involved in international finance.</p>

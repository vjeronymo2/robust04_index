			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Scant comfort from strategists as bourses fall Strategists who had picked on the potential ills of European bourses in recent months had little comfort to offer after yesterday's showing, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs, who recommended commodities as an investment last October, said bourses could go higher on a six-month horizon, but that significant near-term risks remained. Mr Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson, who has made commodity price rises, and their effect on inflation, one plank in his argument against global equities in general and Continental bourses in particular, was still bearish last night. Mr Edwards's keynote yesterday was dollar weakness, pushing US bonds still lower and European bonds and equities down after them. He expected this to continue, especially since gold bullion seemed to be pushing towards Dollars 400 an ounce. 'This impacts directly on to US inflationary worries,' he said. 'In addition, the US Federal Reserve has said that it is monitoring the gold price ahead of its next decision on short-term interest rates.' FRANKFURT did not trust Monday afternoon's partial recovery, but it incorporated most of it during the official session, the Dax index closing 14.45 higher at 1,983.27. However, as analysts forecast on Monday, the Dax went on to test the support level of 1,950 again, closing yesterday's post-bourse at 1,957.08. Turnover eased from DM8.9bn to DM8.3bn. Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that equities, again, were driven by weakness in US bonds and their effect on the German bund future which, at worst, was another 35 basis points lower late yesterday afternoon. The big three banks put in a weak or relatively weak showing, especially Commerzbank, which fell DM7 to DM305 on the session and another DM5.40 to DM299.60 in the post-bourse. Rumours have been moving around the sector about involvement with derivatives losses at the flooring company, Balsam, Germany's latest corporate disaster, and yesterday it was apparently Commerzbank's turn to be linked with the story. PARIS resisted the downtrend until the afternoon when signals from London that US bonds were weakening, and liable to slip back further provided the incentive for investors to sell. The CAC-40 index dipped 12.26 to 1,890.78, in turnover of some FFr4bn. Brokers said that there had been relative calm in the morning, with few institutional investors wanting to deal until indications emerged on the direction of the US. But when the Matif began to slide equities were soon to follow, although the CAC pulled back from a session low of 1,878. The equity market has fallen more than 10 per cent in this current account period which ends tomorrow. There were few corporate features on a day heavily influenced by outside events, although Eurotunnel lost a further FFr1.35 to FFr23.85 ahead of the close of its rights issue. MILAN staged a technical bounce, the Comit index rising 7.0 to 678.63 although continuing worries on the economic outlook restricted trading mostly to domestic investors. The market drew some comfort from data suggesting that June inflation would ease to 3.7 per cent from 4.1 per cent in May, and comments from the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, that he saw no reason for higher interest rates. Mediobanca picked up L239 to L14,650 after Monday's 4.9 per cent fall. The postponement of its planned rights issue was expected to help the market digest other current cash calls. Luxury hotel group Ciga rose L35 to L1,105 amid renewed speculation that Sheraton, currently the largest shareholder, will raise its stake. AMSTERDAM retreated 1.6 per cent as the AEX index fell through the 380 technical support level to close the session off 6.15 at 376.69. Turnover was reported to have been low. Equities took their cue from options again; brokers also noted that negative sentiment took hold in the absence of any major corporate news. The Dutch brokers, MeesPierson, hoped that the publication of second quarter company results later this summer would provide a stimulus for the market's recovery. The chemical and publishing sectors bore the brunt of the day's weakness with Akzo, for example, off Fl 3.10 at Fl 196.70 and Elsevier slipping Fl 1.60 to Fl 153.40. Polygram provided a rare chink of light, rising 30 cents to Fl 74.20, as it benefited from a court judgement in London which found that the singer, George Michael, could not break his contract with Japanese company, Sony. MADRID offered an early and tentative recovery but wilted in the afternoon on the weakness of the dollar. The general index finished 5.62, or 1.9 per cent, weaker at a new 1994 closing low of 296.98. Turnover stayed high at around Pta54bn, but this time a third of that total was attributed to block trades in Bankinter, linked to plans to cancel the bank's holdings of its own stock. Severe weakness was seen in the construction group, FCC, strong recently after an initally unenthusiastic response to the company's capital raising plans; FCC fell Pta790 to Pta13,760, and Gas Natural by Pta470 to Pta9,900. ZURICH gave up an early, 37 point gain to finish flat on futures-led selling, with the weak dollar and Wall Street's early performance undermining the mood. The SMI index lost 0.8 at 2,544.2. Banks, under pressure in recent days on the uncertain outlook for interest rates, put in a steadier performance. SBC rose SFr10 to SFr373. Elektrowatt gave up SFr8 to SFr346 in response to first half figures that were below expectations, and as James Capel revised down estimates for 1994 and 1995 earnings. WARSAW plunged to its lowest level since last October in shrinking volume, brokers said, with no institutional demand being seen from either domestic or foreign investors. The all-share Wig index fell 483.2 or 6.1 per cent to 7,410.6 as turnover fell nearly 30 per cent.

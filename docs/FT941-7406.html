			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Moscow set to resume gold swaps to finance deficit Russia is negotiating to resume gold swaps for the first time since the Soviet Union's collapse in order to help finance its budget deficit, a government official said yesterday. 'Such questions are now being examined because a swap is more favourable for us than a straight sale of gold,' Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Russia's Precious Metals and Stones Committee, said. 'We are looking at different proposals to choose those most acceptable to Russia.' But although he did not give details of the negotiations, he said the authorities did not have that much gold to offer. The government's reserves, which were held by his committee, totalled 177.8 tonnes while those of the central bank amounted to 128 tonnes. Out of those amounts, the government needed 50 tonnes for jewellery production and industrial uses, and 'much less' than an initially planned 100 tonnes to redeem a finance ministry gold certificate which falls due in September. One western gold analyst said a gold swap would be worthwhile for Russia only if it involved at least 100 tonnes, raising around Dollars 1bn. He said he believed that Russia would get much harsher terms than a few years ago because it was perceived as a much worse credit risk than before. 'It's like going to a pawn shop. If the guy in the pawn shop sees you coming several times he will give bad treatment. Since it is possible they will be offering less than 100 tonnes, they might as well sell it.' Mr Bychkov expected Russia to mine 156.9 tonnes of gold this year, compared to 149.5 tonnes last year and 149.1 tonnes in 1992. He said Russia would set up a gold bourse this year as part of plans to liberalise the domestic gold market. Procedures were now being developed for implementing a decree issued by President Boris Yeltsin last December, allowing banks to apply for licences to deal in precious metals. The decree also allowed foreign investors in gold mining projects to recoup their investment in gold.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: MoDo shares rise 5% as higher prices fuel recovery Shares in MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, rose 5 per cent yesterday after it announced better-than-expected results for the first nine months, and painted a bright picture of prospects. Profit after financial items soared to SKr1.01bn (Dollars 136.8m) from a SKr427m loss in the same 1993 period, as rising prices and strong demand drove up capacity utilisation and sales. It upgraded its full-year profit forecast to between SKr1.7bn and SKr1.9bn, excluding one-off items, mainly because of the higher prices. Last year, it suffered a SKr449m loss. The company also announced SKr3bn worth of new investments, including a SKr2.1bn outlay on a new newsprint machine at its Braviken plant. The machine will have a capacity of 270,000 tonnes a year. MoDo's results echoed the strong trend already displayed by Sweden's other big forestry groups, Stora, SCA and AssiDoman. Group sales rose 15 per cent to SKr14.4bn; operating profits increased to SKr1.65bn from SKr456m; and financial expenses fell to SKr638m from SKr883m. Mr Bengt Pettersson, chief executive, said: 'Continued high capacity utilisation and the successive impact of price rises have led to strong growth in the third quarter. All our business areas showed better results.' The biggest turnround was at the group's fine paper unit, MoDo Paper, which swung from a SKr403m operating loss to a SKr387m profit. However, the forestry, packaging and paperboard units also staged a strong profits recovery. Foreign units, where currency factors had earlier hit competitiveness, returned to profit in the third quarter. MoDo has recently agreed to sell its packaging division and stakes in Swiss and Canadian operations. The disposals will release around SKr1.6bn of capital. Its B shares - briefly suspended before the results announcement - closed at SKr349, up SKr16.</p>

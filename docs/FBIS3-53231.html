Official sources  told LANKAPUVATH that these prisoners were being held under  tight security, which have been described as hell holes. They  are equipped with torture chambers. Intelligence reports say  that among the other prisoners were terrorists who tried to  desert the LTTE and others, like Mahattaya and Yogi, who have  criticized the LTTE leadership for its intransigence in refusing  to lay down arms and seek peace with the Sri Lankan Government.    Meanwhile, eight LTTE terrorists were reported killed by a  Sri Lankan Navy patrol craft on the high seas in the eastern  coast of Jaffna at a point between Point Pedro and Vettilaikerny  on Saturday [8 January]. A military spokesman said that the  LTTE had confirmed in a radio transmission that three of its  boats were sunk and eight terrorists killed in the encounter.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Union officials lose legal support THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has withdrawn legal representation from three of its own officials at Timex. They are due to appear in the Court of Session in Edinburgh today in a further escalation of the bitter four-week-old strike at the company's Dundee plant. Senior counsel have warned the AEEU it could face massive financial damages in the court because of an alleged conflict of interest. The three union officials are alleged by Timex to have breached an interdict  -an injunction - limiting picketing outside the plant. They are Mr John Kydd Jnr, former convener at the plant, his deputy Mr Willie Chrisstie and his father Mr John Kydd Snr, who is union divisional secretary. Their costs will be met from legal aid. The union is appealing against the original interdict and this comes before the court next week. Today Timex wants the court to prevent the union and four named officials, including the three facing breach of interdict charges, from holding meetings, demonstrations and gatherings within 50 yards of the plant between 7am and 9am and from 4pm to 6pm. The dispute started when the US multinational dismissed its entire workforce last month after they agreed to return to work from a strike 'under protest'. The company has been hiring an entirely new set of workers to take over their work. It has also resorted to the courts for support in what promises to become a legalistic wrangle. 'The dispute is over as far as the company is concerned,' said Mr Peter Hall, Timex's managing director in Dundee. An estimated 190 newly recruited workers are being bussed into the company every morning past large crowds of angry and former employees and their supporters. A spokesman added that production is at 'levels that satisfy customers needs'. The plant is moving from a single shift to a second shift next week. However, the AEEU continues to give official recognition to the dispute and is paying strike pay to its members involved at Timex. The union is increasingly concerned at the way in which the Timex dispute has worsened in the past few weeks. Last week Timex failed to secure an interdict against all its 320 former employees from taking part in the picketing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 28 (A.A.) -- The Istanbul Chamber of  Commerce (ITO) on Monday [27 June] signed a trade and  cooperation agreement with Cuba's Chamber of Commerce  contravening a 32-year U.S. embargo on the country.    Porfirio Mederos, deputy chief [vice president] of Cuba's  Chamber of Commerce, speaking during a visit to ITO said Turkey  should attend the Havana fair to open up to South American  countries. But it was unclear whether Mederos was speaking  solely about South American countries or Cuba -- Cuba is a North  American island 90 miles (144 kms) south of the United States.    Mederos called on Turkish businessmen to invest in Cuba.  "With a trade and economic agreement," Mederos said, "Turkey and  Cuba will reach the desired level of trade."    The Cuban delegation will visit various installations in  Istanbul before returning to their county.</p>

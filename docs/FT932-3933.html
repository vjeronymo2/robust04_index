			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Betterware shares fall as chief cuts holding MR ANDREW Cohen, chief executive of Betterware, the home shopping company, and his parents, have reduced by 13 per cent their stake in the company he has built up over the last 10 years. The sales raised about Pounds 30m. The shares were placed mainly with UK institutions by BZW and Albert E Sharp at 230p. Betterware's shares recovered after an early fall to close 8p down at 240p. Mr Cohen said the sales were in response to demand for the company's shares, which were tightly held, and the sale would improve their marketability. 'We decided the time was right,' he said. However, he said there would be no further sales in 'the foreseeable future'. Following the sale, the stake held by Mr Cohen, fellow directors and their families will fall from 63 per cent to 50.3 per cent. Mr Cohen said he intended to maintain the controlling shareholding at this level. The disposal was unexpected on the stock market, where analysts pointed to comments made by Mr Cohen in a Sunday newspaper last month. Mr Cohen said in an interview that he had no intention of reducing his stake, which has now fallen from 28 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Cohen's parents have reduced their stake from 29 per cent to 22.5 per cent. According to Betterware's annual report, delivered to shareholders yesterday, Mr Cohen received a 35 per cent pay rise last year. His salary and benefits increased 25 per cent to Pounds 130,484, while his performance pay increased 35 per cent to Pounds 254,784. Earnings and pre-tax profits both increased by more than 70 per cent during the year.</p>

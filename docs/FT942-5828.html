			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ireland set to overhaul trading in gilts Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) plans an overhaul of government bond trading which would replace the order-driven system with market-making. NTMA says the shift to a market-making system would improve liquidity, reduce the cost of borrowing to the Irish exchequer and improve the market for financial derivatives. The changes are expected to increase annual turnover of the IPounds 14.5bn (Dollars 21.5bn) stock of gilts from three to six times. The proposals would create a new tier of primary dealers, which would be separately incorporated from existing brokers. They would have capital resources of at least IPounds 4m each, and quote firm two-way prices in nine designated benchmark stocks. Deals would be in minimum units of IPounds 2m for shorter maturities up to five years, and in minimum units of IPounds 1m for longer maturing stocks. Maximum spreads would be between 0.1 and 0.3 per cent, depending on stock maturity. NTMA says it would give exclusive access to market makers to tap sales, would provide them with stock-switching arrangements, would facilitate the development of stock lending and repurchase arrangements, and would be prepared to intervene in secondary markets 'in times of major financial turbulence'. The average gross issuance of new government bonds is around IPounds 2bn per year, of which IPounds 1.7bn is in respect of refinancing maturing debt.</p>

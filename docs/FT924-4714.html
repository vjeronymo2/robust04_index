			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / US acts against steel imports: UK among 12 producers facing swingeing duties after dumping claims THE US yesterday imposed high provisional duties on imports of flat-rolled steel from the UK, France and Italy, contending that their governments had unfairly subsidised domestic steel production. In all, 12 countries were found by the US Commerce Department to have subsidised their steel producers. Duties ranged from less than 1 per cent to nearly 59 per cent for Italian cold-rolled carbon steel. The action came in response to the filing of 84 unfair trade complaints by 12 US steel companies in June after multilateral talks failed to produce an agreement to end steel subsidies and dumping. Rolled steel is produced in sheets and is used extensively in industry in products ranging from washing machines to fighter aircraft. The US moves come just 10 days after the EC itself imposed duties of between 11 per cent and 30 per cent on steel exporters from Croatia, the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland, alleging they too are dumping. The duties are certain to aggravate transatlantic trade relations, already inflamed by a five-year dispute over Europe's oilseeds subsidy regime which was settled in Washington just two weeks ago after bringing the US and the EC to the brink of trade war. It is uncertain whether the steel dispute will put in jeopardy the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation, which spluttered back into life in Geneva this week following settlement of the oilseeds dispute. But it highlights the danger that dumping actions are set to become the protectionists' weapon of first choice, potentially destroying many of the gains arising from lower tariffs negotiated under the Uruguay Round. In yesterday's action, the Commerce Department found a subsidy level of almost 20 per cent on UK carbon steel plate, essentially contending that the privatisation of British Steel had little effect on the cost of steel production. French steel subsidies were found equal to 26.5 per cent of the cost of production. Mrs Ella Krucoff, an EC official in Washington, said: 'The Community feels that the US has been using legitimate trade policy instruments to harass foreign competitors and to divert world trade flows. They are not really paying attention to the problems of the domestic steel industry.' Mr Erwin Klein, president of the American Institute for Imported Steel, attacked the duties, saying they would severely harm US motor companies and other steel end-users, and would invite retaliatory trade sanctions by foreign governments. 'Restricting steel imports will . . . pass problems of America's steel industry on to the much larger metalworking segment of our economy,' he said. The Commerce Department, which determines whether foreign steel has been dumped or subsidised, took months longer than usual to reach its decision because of the complexity and huge number of cases. Still greater damage to foreign steel exporters is expected to come on January 27 when the Commerce Department announces its finding on 42 anti-dumping investigations. In the past five years, the department has found in favour of the US industry on dumping complaints in an overwhelming number of cases.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "More on the Internal </F> Blockade"]    [Text] In any talk about the blockade, it is essential to  make a distinction between two types of blockades. The first  type is the one being imposed on us by the evil enemies, which  is still continuing due to a declared U.S. decision. The second  type is an internal blockade being imposed on us by a handful of  brazen, capricious, and parasitic retailers and illegal  profiteers. Four years of external blockade have proven beyond  any doubt that we can resist this type of blockade and confront  it with more patience, unity, and creative, productive work. We  have rejected every morsel, no matter how tasty, that has been  dipped in the poison of humiliation and degradation. In fact,  we have proven that we are stronger than the plan of starvation,  impoverishment, and blockade despite its pressure and harshness.    Since the pressure of the internal blockade is greater than  that of the external blockade, we call for government  intervention to protect us from these savage beasts that keep  gnawing at our flesh, sucking our blood, and breaking our bones  without so much as a batted eyelid or feeling any sense of  remorse over national patriotism and responsibility.    We are not being unfair to these illegal profiteers when we  say that what they are doing complements the feverish  U.S.-Zionist efforts against the freedom, dignity, unity, and  will power of our people. It is sufficient to see the clear  harmony between the hike in local prices and the reports being  broadcast by the Voice of America and the BBC on the blockade.    I cannot claim that I have an idea about the measures that  should be taken by the government to protect the people from  these greedy merchants, but it has become essential and urgent  for the government to intervene in order to deter these  merchants and put an end to their activities. We do not doubt  for one single moment that its intervention will be the best  means to block enemy wagers and evil designs.</p>

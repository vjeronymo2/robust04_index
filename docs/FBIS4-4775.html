			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yu Yong-won] </F>   [Text] As tension is heightening due to the North Korean  nuclear issue, there is growing concern over an attack by North  Korea's Scud B and Nodong No. 1 missiles.    Even though the United States plans to deploy Patriot  missiles to the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK in April,  questions are being raised regarding the capability of  effectively destroying North Korea's ground-to-ground missiles.    As if he had sensed the anxiety, Minister of National  Defense  Yi Pyong-tae gave a relatively detailed explanation on  countermeasures against a Scud and Nodong No. 1 attack to the  Standing Committee of the National Assembly on 23 March.    Minister Yi explained that once the Scud is launched, its  camouflaged camp would be exposed. It would take more than two  and a half hours to move to another camp and prepare for a  second launching. Therefore, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces could  locate the launcher through its surveillance system and  immediately attack the launcher with Air Force fire power,  special combat units, and guided missiles.    Minister Yi admitted there is a limit to this strategy  because after the first Scud or Nodong No. 1 is launched, only a  passive defense using the Patriot is possible and a preemptive  attack is not possible. The Scud launcher loaded on a big  vehicle must be moved to another place once it launches a  missile to prevent an attack by its opponent.    Therefore, the only way for the ROK and U.S. Forces to  repulse the first Scud attack is to identify its location using  the U.S. ultra-red ray detective intelligence satellite right  after the launching and intercept the missile with a Patriot.    After the first Scud launching, the hide-and-seek game  between the Scud launcher vehicle and the ROK-U.S. Combined  Force's Scud-hunting vehicle begins. While the Scud launcher is  moved and preparing for the second attack, the ROK-U.S. Forces  will begin the search using the U.S. intelligence satellite and  various kinds of aerial surveillance devices, including the E8  and E3C, which are able to detect the movement of ground  vehicles from the air.    The weakest point of the Scud is that it requires more than  two and a half hours to refuel and prepare for the second  launching.    Military officials believe that considering the ROK-U.S.  Forces' intelligence capability, it will be possible to discover  the launcher before the second launching.    It is easy to destroy the Scud launcher once it is  discovered. An air attack by fighter-bombers and Apache  helicopters, or bombing by infiltrated special units are  possible.    The "Scud hunting system" was designed during the Gulf war  in  1991. The United States had overlooked the threat of Iraqi  Scuds and later had difficulties destroying them after civilian  damage had increased. Considering North Korea's hilly terrain,  which provides more cover than deserts, most specialists view  that the Scud hunting will be more difficult than during the  Gulf war.    Military officials stressed that although the Scud and  Nodong  No. 1 pose a great threat, militarily, they are less a threat  than multiple rockets and fighter-bombers.    The Scud has low accuracy -- sometimes it lands 1 km away  from the target -- and its warhead weighs only 660 kg -- less  than the total weight of bombs carried by one average  fighter-bomber.    Considering that ground-to-ground missiles such as the Scud  had substantial effect in actual combat, including the  psychological effect by attacks on big cities, some military  officials pointed out that better full-scale countermeasures  against the Scud should be developed in case North Korea attacks  Seoul.</p>

The contract would provide provincial telephone systems at  20  sites throughout Cambodia.    The networks would be linked to the $30-million satellite  system installed in late 1991 by the U.N. Transitional Authority  (UNTAC) that policed a peace pact in the country, the  English-language Cambodian daily said.    Before the Australian Company Telstra-OTC installed the  state-of- the-art UNTAC satellite system, the only working phone  network in Cambodia was an antiquated domestic one in Phnom Penh.    The newspaper quoted Cambodian Minister for Post and  Telecommunications So Khun as saying: "There is real interest in  the UNTAC satellite system. We have received 15 applications,  and I have already had five companies knocking on my door to  find out what (we) will be offering."    According to So Khun, licenses to operate on the UNTAC  facility would be awarded in April.    Cambodia currently has four mobile phone systems in  operation, mostly set up by Thai companies but with one from  Malaysia.    The 22,000-strong UNTAC force was deployed in Cambodia after  the signing of an international peace agreement in Paris in 1991.</p>

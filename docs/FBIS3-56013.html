The NATO countries' leaders have outlined the landmarks of  the new strategy. Of course, not all their plans can be  adopted, but the intention to continue the East-West dialogue  and to develop further cooperation with the East European  countries to strengthen European security, should be appraised  as a positive initiative. It can be noted with satisfaction  that the Brussels declaration supports economic and political  reforms in Russia. The declaration emphasizes that the Russian  leaders' firm intention to follow the course of democratic  reforms, is extremely important in maintaining stability and  security in Europe. [passage omitted]    The NATO leaders' apprehension about the appearance in  Europe  of hotbeds of instability and armed conflicts is understandable.  The most classic example is former Yugoslavia, especially the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, that has now been raging for the past  two years.    The heads of state and government of NATO are right in  concluding that the war in Yugoslavia can only be resolved  through peaceful means. Their readiness to assist the peace  process in Yugoslavia can only be welcomed. But it seems to me  that it is hardly advisable nor perhaps appropriate to issue  military threats.    In Brussels, it was announced that NATO was ready to use air  strikes in Bosnia, even though it's true that this would only be  done with the corresponding decision and control by the Security  Council of the United Nations.    Here, I share the opinion of the leader of the Bosnian  Serbs,  Radovan Karadzic, who said that the NATO threats were  unproductive and that they would only complicate the situation  at a time when hope for signing a peace agreement on the Bosnian  issue still existed.    Other decisions concerning the rejuvenation of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization were taken in Brussels. As a  whole, the impression is created that the NATO leaders are  waking up to the conviction that it is necessary to establish  such a system of common European security that will prevent a  return to a Europe of political blocs.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water in US joint venture Yorkshire Water is seeking to enter the multi-billion dollar North American water and waste treatment market through a joint venture with a US contractor. The UK group will take a 45 per cent stake in Ogden Yorkshire Water, with the balance to be held by Ogden Projects, the waste and energy arm of the Dollars 2.5bn Ogden Corporation. The joint venture will launch bids for contracts in a market which is expected to grow rapidly from next year because of increased spending and tighter legislation. NatWest Securities, the UK broker, estimates that the Clean Water Act, which is being proposed in the US, could result in increased funding next year of Dollars 3bn. The tighter regulation is also expected to force local government bodies to turn to the private sector to manage waste treatment facilities. Neither partner will inject capital initially. Funds will be allocated on a project-by-project basis. Mr John Bell, managing director of Yorkshire Water Enterprise, said Ogden would bring an already significant presence in the municipal sector to the joint venture.</p>

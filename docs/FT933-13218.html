			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Strategists consider post-election Japan Last week, prospects for Japanese politicians, the Japanese economy and the Tokyo equity market loomed large in the global equity performance charts. The FT-Actuaries World Index rose by 0.6 per cent in local currency terms, with Japan's 2.7 per cent gain outweighing weakness in the US, and a flat performance from Europe. On the political front, there were suggestions from the market as the week went on that the Liberal Democratic party could hold its ground in last Sunday's elections, or that a coalition would be formed around a core conservative party. As it happened, the LDP lost its overall majority. The UBS global research team does not think that this is necessarily a disaster. In a preview of the current week, it says that for all the talk of political reform in Japan, the market would probably respond well to the consistency implied by an LDP-led government, 'particularly if it was in partnership with some of the new centre-right parties'. UBS notes that there has been a growing consensus among the various Japanese political parties that a tax cut is needed to sustain recovery. 'However,' it points out, 'the exact nature and timing of its introduction will depend upon the make-up of what is certain to be a coalition government.' Caution, which seems implicit in this note, was reflected in a 0.9 per cent fall in the Nikkei index yesterday. The US, meanwhile, mixed good inflation news seen early in the week with poor results, consumer and corporate expectations later as the quarterly results season got under way. So gains resulting from the essential weakness in the economy - reflected in a fall in the producer price index, and in bond yields - were overtaken by a high-impact downgrade of drug issues by Smith, Barney on Thursday, and by losses at Apple Computer, and a weak consumer confidence report on Friday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change     % change                 % change in local currency*     sterling*  in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                            1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.26    +6.08    +5.03    +14.12     +8.99        +6.47 Belgium       +2.11    +7.63   +15.98    +20.27    +14.82       +12.17 Denmark       +0.87    +2.89    +0.81    +21.47    +16.20       +13.51 Finland       -2.22    +13.01  +76.34    +52.94    +40.46       +37.22 France        -0.26    +3.71    +8.09     +8.87     +4.45        +2.02 Germany       +0.77    +6.94    +3.21    +17.13    +12.61       +10.01 Ireland       +2.01    +3.90   +24.44    +35.89    +19.87       +17.09 Italy         +2.92    +8.35   +40.77    +36.50    +29.41       +26.41 Netherlands   -0.65    +2.56   +15.24    +16.38    +11.61        +9.04 Norway        +2.13    +8.86   +16.41    +23.19    +18.36       +15.63 Spain         +0.17    -2.91   +15.64    +20.83     +4.12        +1.71 Sweden        +2.68    +5.53   +30.47    +16.68     +5.30        +2.86 Switzerland   -0.56    +3.00   +28.20    +16.76    +15.58       +12.90 UK            -0.39    -1.47   +16.50     +1.26     +1.26        -1.08 EUROPE        +0.14    +2.08   +15.40    +10.44     +7.33        +4.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +1.11    +3.02    +5.48    +12.54    +13.60       +10.97 Hong Kong     -1.86    -4.28    +8.08    +26.30    +29.04       +26.06 Japan         +2.74    +4.50   +29.41    +25.19    +47.94       +44.53 Malaysia      -0.37    -2.36   +37.31    +24.36    +29.53       +26.54 New Zealand   -1.61    +4.05    +7.77    +13.00    +23.57       +20.70 Singapore     -1.41    -2.87   +15.28    +13.90    +17.99       +15.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -1.07    -2.31    +3.64     +9.23    +11.12        +8.54 USA           -0.51    +0.75    +7.46     +2.49     +4.92        +2.49 Mexico        +1.92    +4.13    +7.24     -5.81     -3.67        -5.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -0.75    +3.63   +17.43    +31.03    +43.92       +40.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.64    +2.11   +15.19    +11.51    +17.45       +14.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on July 16th 1993.

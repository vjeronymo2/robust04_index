			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> RECYCLING POLICY ADOPTED BY CITY  </P> <P> A recycling policy for all materials used by the city -- including recycled  paper, asphalt, machinery and solvents -- has been unanimously approved by the  City Council.  </P> <P> By adopting the policy last week, the city will purchase recycled products as  long as they meet required standards and the cost is not more than 5% over the  price of virgin products.  </P> <P> Not all recycled products prove cost-efficient. Although the city can save  almost 20% in costs for recycled letter pads and envelopes, the price increases  by 25% for recycled white paper, according to a report by Simone Friend, the  city purchasing manager.  </P> <P> The city also plans to reduce paper use by photocopying on both sides of a  sheet. It also will avoid purchases of glossy paper and plastic foam containers  that cannot be recycled.  </P> <P> Mayor Laurann Cook said that by adopting the policy the city can set an example  for citizens and other cities to follow.

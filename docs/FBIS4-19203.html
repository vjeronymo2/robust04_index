			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- According to a former GDR officer,  the Turkish military is using German tanks against Kurds. They  come from the stocks of the former National People's Army [NVA]  but, before their delivery to Turkey, they were technically  reequipped for the Bundeswehr, the former NVA colonel confirmed  to the ARD magazine program "Monitor." As Westdeutscher  Rundfunk [WDR] announced in Cologne on Thursday [14 April], tank  expert Lothar Mann used film material from "Monitor" to identify  tanks recently used against Kurds as military equipment from  former GDR stocks. "These tanks -- they are BTR 60 PB armored  personnel carriers -- clearly come from the stocks of the former  NVA."    According to the WDR, the military expert noted that the  tanks could have been delivered to Turkey only after having been  reequipped for the Bundeswehr. "Proof of that are the changes  that have been made on the vehicles, which were made in  connection with the transition to the licensing regulation under  the FRG traffic code -- such as rearview mirrors." Thus, it is  quite clear for Mann that these vehicles are not deliveries from  the former Soviet Union or from Russia but German tanks.    The WDR pointed out that, even in the last few days, Turkey  had claimed the tanks used against Kurds came from Russia. FRG  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (FDP) on Wednesday said in the  Bundestag that it has not yet been proven Turkey has used German  weapons in the country against Kurds in violation of the treaty.    In contrast, on Thursday the "Kurdistan Information Office"  in Cologne announced that the delivery of German weapons of all  kinds to Turkey, "with which Kurds are massacred," has indeed  been proved. Concerning the discussion about the deportation of  Kurds to Turkey, the Information Office said that politically  active deported Kurds are threatened in Turkey with torture and  treatment that violates human rights. It would be pointless to  conclude a deportation agreement with Turkey. Turkey has also  signed the European Convention of Human Rights, the Antitorture  Convention, and the Geneva Refugee Convention without ever  adhering to these agreements.</p>

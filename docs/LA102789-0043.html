			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: QUALITY OF SERVICE, DECIBEL LEVEL BOTH HIGH AT ANGELI MARE  </P> <P> Perhaps having two working restaurants really makes a difference. For Angeli  Mare, 13455 Maxella Ave., Marina del Rey, (213) 822-1984, not only opened on  Monday as scheduled -- it opened with a certain smoothness. By Tuesday, when I  got there, the place was frighteningly full for a new restaurant, but the food  was coming out of the kitchen as if the staff had been together for months.  </P> <P> The food is not dramatically different from that at the other Angelis -- except  in one respect. In  </P> <P> addition to the pizzas, pastas and salads of the other two, this Angeli offers  a lot of fish. I particularly recommend the Tuscan fish soup, the grilled tuna  and the squid risotto.  </P> <P> I also recommend that you bring ear plugs. The architecture of this room is  even more avant-garde than the other two. The room is wonderful; when you walk  in the door, you feel as if you are entering the belly of a whale. Only this is  a whale that roars. RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper rise meets resistance - Market Report A late rise in the London Metal Exchange three months delivery COPPER price above the Dollars 1,960-a-tonne resistance level was not maintained yesterday as profit-taking and resistance trimmed gains. A high of Dollars 1,966 was reached before the price dropped back to Dollars 1,956, up Dollars 6 on balance. Dealers suggested the failure to hold above Dollars 1,960 could signal a retracement in the short term, but still thought prices were set to move higher, given encouraging chart patterns and improving fundamentals. ALUMINIUM held steadier in line with copper, although apart from some short-covering and trade interest business remained slack. NICKEL'S breach of Dollars 5,700 a tonne in late trading triggered stop-loss buying orders and short-covering, which chased the market higher. ZINC remained under pressure as its recent technical bounce lost momentum. Compiled from Reuter</p>

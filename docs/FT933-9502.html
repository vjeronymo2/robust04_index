			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Hata, the lone elder statesman: Foreign affairs - As Japan's coalition takes office FT writers assess the likely policy changes AS THE only member of Japan's new ministerial line-up who has previously held a cabinet post, Mr Tsutomu Hata qualifies automatically as its elder statesman. While this befits the role of foreign minister which he yesterday assumed, it suggests that his voice will also be influential on economic, trade and other matters. Mr Hata, aged 57, leader of the Japan Renewal party which precipitated the general election by splitting from the long-ruling Liberal Democratic party in June, was finance minister from November 1991 until last December. There he presided over a Y10,700bn (Pounds 68bn) government spending programme aimed at mitigating the effects of economic slowdown. In the mid-1980s he had held the agriculture portfolio - he represents a farming constituency in central Japan which has returned him nine times as an MP - as the markets for beef and oranges were being prised open to foreign producers. He provoked vexed amusement in Washington by maintaining that a difference in Japanese intestines made US beef more difficult to digest. If that comment was itself hard to swallow, Mr Hata's break with the LDP shows that he has the stomach for a fight. He could have had the foreign ministry in April, when party bosses offered him the job in the hope that he might not defect. Four months on, it is his anyway, along with the deputy premiership in a coalition charged with performing surgery on the country's political entrails. The inward-looking nature of the coalition's agenda, as well as differences among its seven constituent parties on key aspects of foreign policy, will make it difficult for him to pursue the heightened role in diplomacy which the country has in recent years been seeking. In an indication that Mr Hata's prime policy thrust may be regional rather than global, he said Japan should seek a reconciliation with its Asian neighbours over the wartime activities of its imperial forces. He added that Japan needed to move towards normalising relations with North Korea. The statement came partly as a sop to the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member and the most left-wing, which has traditionally backed Pyongyang. But the overture also follows post-cold war shifts in east Asian diplomacy which last year allowed Beijing, North Korea's long-time backer, to establish formal ties with Seoul. The Sino-Japanese relationship will be among the trickiest amid nervousness in Tokyo at evidence that China is modernising its military hardware and staking claim to strategic outposts. Last week satellite pictures showing a lengthened Chinese airstrip on the disputed Paracel islands made front-page news in Japan. Any diplomatic noise the government makes about such moves is, however, likely to be met by a sharp reminder from Beijing about the legacy of Japan's own military expansionism. Relations with Moscow, meanwhile, remain ensnared in the future of the Kurile islands at Japan's northern tip, occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war. Mr Hata's attention will have been drawn to this yesterday by a raucous demonstration mounted outside the foreign ministry by far-right groups demanding the return of the islands to Japan. Inside, bureaucrats continued to prepare for a twice-postponed visit to Tokyo by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which may now take place later this year. A United Nations General Assembly session which convenes late next month will help show to what extent Mr Hata will press the case, mounted under the LDP, for greater recognition of Japan's world stature - in particular, for a permanent seat on the Security Council. SDP opposition to the deployment of Japanese troops abroad in UN peacekeeping missions could cause snags, but he will have an ally in Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, appointed director general of the country's defence agency. Mr Nakanishi, 52, is from Mr Hata's JRP and worked behind the scenes to bring the coalition together. Around the time of the UN gathering Mr Hata is expected to accompany Mr Hosokawa to Washington for a summit with President Bill Clinton, and the two visitors can expect the views of his administration on Japan's need to curb its trade surplus and further open its markets to be driven home. The European Community may have to wait its turn to preach a similar lesson, as Mr Hata yesterday stressed the core nature of the US-Japanese relationship.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEW JAPANESE CABINET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Position                     Name                     Age      Party  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prime minister               Morihiro Hosokawa        55       JNP Deputy PM and foreign        Tsutomu Hata             57       JRP Justice                      Akira Mikazuki           72       * Finance                      Hirohisa Fujii           61       JRP Education                    Ryoko Akamatsu           63       * Health and welfare           Keigo Ouchi              63       DSP Agriculture, forestry   and fisheries              Eijiro Hata              64       JRP International trade   and industry (Miti)        Hiroshi Kumagai          53       JRP Transport                    Shigeru Ito              65       SDP Posts and telecoms           Takenori Kanzaki         50       Komeito Labour                       Chikara Sakaguchi        59       Komeito Construction                 Kozo Igarashi            67       SDP Home affairs                 Kanju Sato               51       SDP Chief cabinet secretary      Masayoshi Takemura       58       NHP Management and   co-ordination              Koshiro Ishida           62       Komeito National Land Agency         Kosuke Uehara            60       SDP Defence Agency               Keisuke Nakanishi        52       JRP Economic planning            Manae Kubota             68       SDP Science and technology       Satsuki Eda              52       USDP Environment Wakako           Hironaka                 59       Komeito Political reform             Sadao Yamahana           57       SDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SDP Social Democratic Party, JNP Japan New Party, JRP Japan Renewal Party, DSP Democratic Socialist Party, NHP New Harbinger Party, USDP United Social Democratic Party. * not affiliated  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

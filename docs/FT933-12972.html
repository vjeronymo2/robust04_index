			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nellore cultivates a taste for seafood - The Indian region is ideal for aquaculture THE SCORCHING hot sun and the treacherous terrain of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, South India, may be hostile for humans, but it is ideal for aquaculture. Here, the cultivation of aquatic livestock, such as prawns, shrimps, scampi, squid and lobster, under controlled conditions is being encouraged by the Indian government to increase exports. Responding to the growing demand for seafood worldwide, with quick returns on comparatively low investments, several large Indian companies, including ITC, the tobacco, agri-products and hotels company, the Bombay-based Hindustan Lever and Tata groups, the Delhi-based Thapar group, the Madras-based MRF Tyres and Britannia Biscuits are all entering the lucrative aquaculture market. In Nellore, which has the right degree of salinity in the water and is naturally shielded from the vagaries of the cyclone, 20 semi-intensive, export-oriented units have sprung up in the last year alone. Shrimps accounted for 71 per cent or Rs9.79bn (Pounds 210m) of the country's Rs13.73bn seafood exports last year, and could be used to increase India's dismal 1.14 per cent share in the Dollars 40bn global seafood market. The country, with its 7,500km coastline and an estimated 1.2m hectares (3m acres) of coastal area ripe for exploitation by shrimp farmers, has distinct advantages over its three main competitors, China, Thailand and Indonesia. China, the world leader in the farmed shrimp market, exports Dollars 1.5bn of shrimps a year, 21 per cent of the Dollars 7.2bn global market. To achieve a similar level of production, India would need to develop 90,000 hectares of land for shrimp cultivation - 7.5 per cent of the total land available for shrimp farming - compared with the 27,000ha at present devoted to that purpose. Other advantages like cheap labour and land costs could push India to the top of of the shrimp export league from its present 4.5 per cent share of the global market. The Ministry of Commerce's Marine Products Export Development Authority, which promotes aquaculture and runs a 10ha demonstration farm in Nellore, is working toward bringing an additional 14,000ha under shrimp farming. 'But India will have to cultivate an additional 90,500ha of land to be the world's foremost shrimp exporter,' said an official of the commerce ministry. 'Traditional methods of aquaculture are still being used, though farmers are realising how dramatically they can increase their yield by switching to semi-intensive aquaculture. Shrimp exports have increased by 23 per cent in the last four years, and we reckon that total earnings from shrimp exports could touch Rs90bn by the year 2000, taking us to the top.' Breaking into the fiercely competitive world market has not been easy, according to Mr Elias Sait, managing director of Alsa Marine and Harvests, a Madras-based aquaculture company, with farms and processing factories in Nellore, Puri and Bhubaneswar in Orissa, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, Calcutta and Cochin. Alsa Marine, with an export turnover of Rs340m, was one of the first Indian companies to market branded Indian shrimps to the European and Japanese markets, and many other companies are following suit. At present, however, 95 per cent of India's seafood exports are unbranded, with large consignments being block-frozen, instead of packaged for super-market shelves. Indian aquaculture companies, besides looking to markets in Japan, which has been the largest importer of Indian seafood, Europe, the US and the Middle East, are also collaborating with foreign companies to be able to compete internationally. The Madras-based Aquamarine Food Products, which recently began operations at its fully export-oriented project in Nellore, has marketing tie-ups with seafood distributors Fiesta Mart, Beaver Street Fisheries of the US and Itoman, Toyo Kosuisan of Japan to market its branded and bulk products. Sprawling over an area of 160ha, with 132ha of waterspread, in Nellore, Aquamarine's hatchery, farm and processing-cum-packaging unit uses technical assistance from Hanaqua International of Taiwan, the leader in aquaculture techniques. Mr S. Vijaya Kumar, Aquamarine's managing director, said the integrated project cost Rs185.9m, but with a large grow-out area and higher yields per hectare, the business should yield good dividends within a year. 'Aquaculture is going to be big business in the 1990s,' he said. He could well be right, with more than 30 Indian companies entering the fray and investing a total of Rs10bn in new projects over the next year.</p>

Chernomyrdin: `The  Government Is Not an Experimental Club'"]    [Text] Our special correspondents Natalya Zhelnorova  and Aleksandr Meshcherskiy met with the Russian prime minister  at the economic summit in Davos (Switzerland).    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] When you joined the government in 1991,  did you entertain the thought that not only would you survive in  it (the atmosphere surrounding your name at the time was heavy),  but would actually become the head of the government? It appears  that the president has entrusted to you completely this ship  named "Russia," and now its fate, the fate of reform, is in your  hands.    [Chernomyrdin] This happened so quickly, so unexpectedly...  I  never thought this would happen. Moreover--I did not strive for  it, did not want to. Seeing, however, what was happening in the  government, I felt hurt, and I knew that with my expertise,  professional training, and considerable experience I would not  do any worse. The government is not a club; it was hard for me  to watch experimentation here, knowing that each decision of  ours affects the fate of millions of people. So when I was told  I was needed, I decided to give it my best shot.    Of course, a lot depends on who you work with. I emphasize  that I do not see this government as perfect. But it is not easy  to find qualified people. To some you say: Come work with us,  but they do not because they are already doing something they  like. I cannot go around yelling everywhere that I need  ministers.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But there are also people who very much  want to be in the government!    [Chernomyrdin] That is the kind of people I do not want! I  do  not know which they want more: work or power.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] There have been rumors that you and  Zaveryukha come from the same parts, and that is why you shield  him from criticism and support him with credit.    [Chernomyrdin] I did not know Zaveryukha before. He  "surfaced" later. We were looking for a minister and had gone  through many candidates when he was recommended to me. We never  met until then.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Rumor No. 2: Abalkin and Petrakov are  writing an economic program for you.    [Chernomyrdin] By the way, Petrakov was the first  market-oriented economist in our country. How can I speak badly  of him? As well as Abalkin. As for the rumors--I have not  commissioned any programs, and if people write them, good. We  should not let market pioneers be left out of the mainstream.  This is not fair. On the contrary, I tell all intelligent  people: Give us programs and proposals, and we will discuss them.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why do you not hire women to the  government? In terms of conscientiousness, smarts, and economic  wit they have no equal among men. The leadership can move  mountains with their help!    [Chernomyrdin] I agree. This is not the best of our  traditions--that we do not utilize in the government their  discipline, honesty, and ability to work hard. Why it has come  to be this way, I am at a loss to answer. Apparently, it is  because we are picked out, and then we find others--we all come  from the same "pot." We know and see who can work and how. I am  not against women in the government, but they need to be  noticed, so to speak, manifest themselves in the business.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Now that Gaydar and Fedorov have left,  would you speak of their work with gratitude or censure?    [Chernomyrdin] I will tell you straight, as it really was.  Gaydar came in September when the program already had been  approved (6 August), and we were already implementing everything  envisaged by it--combating inflation, and other tough measures.  He began working and, frankly, took a lot off my shoulders by  tending to urgent matters. His departure, however, was a  political step, in my opinion. In his place it was not necessary  to slam the door. This is not dignified. I think that in this  respect he is wrong.    All the subterfuge surrounding his leaving and resignation  do  not speak well of anyone. If you want to leave (after all,  nobody can force you to work!), do it in a normal way. People  watch this, and draw conclusions.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Do you not select complacent people to  work with you and let the obstinate ones go?    [Chernomyrdin] Were I unhappy with their work, they would be  out of here in two minutes. On the contrary, I need obstinate  people. I must see two sides of the problem, with everyone  defending his point of view. Only then can you see the truth,  the essence of the issue. If you are surrounded by yes-men, it  is dangerous.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Do you believe that now you have put  together a government that is ideal for implementing the reforms?    [Chernomyrdin] No, I do not. Forming a government is not a  simple process. At the time I told people working with Gaydar:  Those who do not like it may leave. But those who stay will work  the way I demand. Any decision here is made collectively; both  reformers and nonreformers participate, but I, the chairman,  have the last word. Nobody can bypass me in making an important  decision.    Former ministers now say at press conferences that "they  could do anything." They like it; when people are young, a lot  of things make their heads spin. But neither Fedorov nor anyone  else made crucial decisions on their own. Decisions are made  either in the presidium, or by Chernomyrdin.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Viktor Stepanovich, if you, like  Gaydar's  former government, do not explain your policy to the people  (what you want, and how you are going to do it), your actions  will be doomed to failure. You cannot implement reform without  popular support.    [Chernomyrdin] I agree with you; in this respect we were  losing; we distanced ourselves from the people. We have agreed  now to explain to the people any government decision: What we  plan and what came out of it. If things do not go right, we will  explain why. If we are wrong, we will say so: "We are wrong."    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Russia is being overcome by a wave of  crime. The government is indifferent to it, and crime goes  unpunished. Where is the power of the authorities?    [Chernomyrdin] We are also very concerned about this. Crime  is indeed on the rampage, and we have not made much progress in  combating it. If every businessman is afraid of racketeers, and  the ordinary citizen is afraid to go out on the street, who  needs this kind of life? Special services are developing  measures, but everything, alas, boils down to insufficient  material resources and a weak legislative base.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It is probably also partly your fault,  your sin that crime has got so out of hand...    [Chernomyrdin] Since I am the chairman of the government, I  cannot escape this responsibility. I do not. So it is my fault,  too. Although my main criterion in work is authority and order.  This is the way it will be in Russia.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Are you a believer?    [Chernomyrdin] I believe in myself. I would lie if I said I  am a believer, but neither can I say that I am not. I grew up in  a village among believers. I myself have been baptized.  Generally, I am convinced that a person must believe in  something; everyone should have his own God.</p>

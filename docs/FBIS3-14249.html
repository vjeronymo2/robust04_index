A security source told  the BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY [BIA] military correspondent that  the offensive of the militia was aborted in the very first hours  of the attack, and damage was inflicted on rebellious militia,  which suffered a great loss of life. Following their defeat  last night, the militia subjected residential areas of city of  Kabul to rocket attacks last night and this morning. It caused  no loss of life, but some damage was inflicted on the residents  of Kabul. According to another report, yesterday afternoon a  heavy clash took place between the militias of Golboddin and  Dostam in the area of Brishnakot in Kabul. The conflagration  continued until 2200 last night, and much loss of life was  suffered by the warring militias. The security source added  differences between the commanders of Golboddin's party and  commanders of Dostam were increasing. Since the start of the  unholy alliance between Golboddin and Dostam, this was the  umpteenth clash between these two militia groups.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> 57-UNIT PROJECT APPROVED  </P> <P> The City Council, deciding not to wait for the results of a pending land-use  study, has approved a zoning change along San Gabriel Canyon Road to allow a  57-unit condominium project on almost nine acres.  </P> <P> The change was approved 3 to 0 on Monday, with Mayor Eugene F. Moses and  Councilman Bruce Latta abstaining because they own property near the site and  have a potential conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The project is next to Moses' Canyon City Ghost Town, the object of a city  public-nuisance action. The mayor is negotiating with the city over removal of  most of the buildings on his would-be Western theme park.  </P> <P> Councilman Harry L. Stemrich requested a zoning study in January when it was  announced that Moses intended to sell his 2.5-acre ghost town, saying the city  did not want more multifamily units in the area. The study is pending.  </P> <P> Although the project was labeled a condominium, it actually will have separate  units. The single-family homes will be located on small lots, averaging 3,000  square feet, that have common areas, said Roy E. Bruckner, director of  community development. The city has no provision for such a development at this  time, he said.  </P> <P> Landowners Johnny E. Johnson and the Speckert Trust will sell their parcels to  Brea-based D &amp; D Development for the project.  </P> <P> During the meeting, Moses said the zone change violated a standing agreement  between property owners that the area was to remain "rustic." City officials  said Azusa was never part of any such private agreement.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTING  </P> <P> Two men driving through Centennial Regional Park looking for a friend were  mistakenly shot by gang members who approached their car and opened fire,  killing one of them, Santa Ana police said Monday.  </P> <P> Police said they do not believe that the two men who were shot, or a third  uninjured man sitting in the back seat, belong to a gang. But when the  unidentified assailants approached their white Suzuki Samurai just before 8  p.m. Sunday, they demanded that the occupants disclose their gang membership.  </P> <P> When they responded that they were not members of a gang, one of the assailants  opened fire with a handgun at close range, according to Maureen Thomas, a  Police Department spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Francisco Ulloa, 22, of Santa Ana was shot in the head and chest. The driver,  whose name was withheld by police, was shot in the arm.  </P> <P> The victims immediately drove Ulloa to a local hospital where he later died.  </P> <P> On Sept. 16, in another fatal gang attack in Orange County, a 4-year-old boy  and a youth were shot to death in neighboring Garden Grove in what was believed  to have been a gang retaliation. Law enforcement officials have said there are  about a dozen fatal assaults in Orange County each year attributed to gangs.  </P> <P> Thomas said there were "quite a few" people in the park at the time of the  shooting, but none claimed to have been a witness. Thomas said police did not  have a suspect or a description of the gunmen and are asking anybody with  knowledge of the incident to contact investigators Ron Reid or Phil Lozano at  (714) 647-5168.  </P></p>

He said spending restraint was a "relentless task" which  would be central to all Conservative Budgets.    In an unusually tough speech Mr Clarke gave his first clear  backing to the fundamental reviews of departmental expenditure  being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the  Treasury.    Mr Clarke underlined the importance of the reviews by saying  that they were not a one-off attempt to reduce a big budget  deficit.    He said the whole basis of departmental spending --  including  the issue of whether the state should withdraw from certain  activities -- should be regularly scrutinised in the approach to  the annual Budget.    He told industrialists at a conference in Westminster:  "Bearing down on public spending is a relentless task. My  strong view -- and that of Michael Portillo -- is that  controlling public spending is definitely not something  chancellors and chief secretaries only do once in a while."    In recent months some Tory backbenchers, including Mr Norman  Lamont, the former chancellor, have warned that tough spending  cuts recommended in some of Mr Portillo's early reviews were not  fully implemented in the last Budget.    They have said that cost-cutting measures announced by Mr  Clarke last November in areas such as social security and  education -- were already in the pipeline, and that Mr Clarke  could have been even more stringent.    The chancellor emphasised yesterday, however, that he had  reduced spending plans by 15 billion pounds more than had been  envisaged in the March 1993 Budget -- "more than anyone thought  possible."    He said that the first four expenditure reviews -- in  health,  Home Office, education and social security -- had "contributed  to the success of last November's spending round."    Treasury officials privately emphasised yesterday that two  cost-cutting reforms announced in the November Budget -- the  introduction of the job seekers' allowance and of incapacity  benefit -- were direct results of Mr Portillo's review of social  security. One official said: "That was what the review was  after and that was what we delivered."    Mr Clarke stressed that cuts in taxation before the next  election would be possible only against a background of spending  restraint.    "Whenever I am asked `Will taxes ever come down?' I say:  `Yes, provided we control public spending,'" he said. "As a  Conservative chancellor, I will always look first to the  spending side of the account when deciding how to reduce the  deficit."</p>

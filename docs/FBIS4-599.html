			<p>BFN     [Text] Transvaal IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] official,  Humphrey Ndlovu, says the party will take up arms if the  election proceeds without it. He told the ZIANA [ZIMBABWE  INTER-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY] news agency of Zimbabwe that the IFP  had the capacity to survive a war with the South African Army,  but he declined to elaborate on what resources were available to  the IFP.    Mr. Ndlovu was commenting on the mediation process aimed at  solving the constitutional impasse between his party and the  ANC. Mr. Ndlovu said he was pessimistic about the negotiations,  and warned of catastrophe if the election went ahead without the  IFP.</p>

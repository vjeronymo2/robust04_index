			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: 'Bribery' charge against Mexico CORRUPTION in Mexico yesterday resurfaced as an issue in the debate over Nafta as a congressional committee heard from a businessman who claimed he was offered the chance to pay a bribe while representing IBM. Congressman John LaFalce, the anti-Nafta chairman of the House committee on small business, brought Mr Kaveh Moussavi to testify because of concerns about Mexican corruption and the 'safety of the air-travelling public in and out of Mexico'. Mr Moussavi, who acted as an agent for IBM in an attempt to renew Mexico's air traffic control system, repeated charges that he was asked by men he said were Mexican officials for a Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) payment to the government's solidarity programme to secure the Dollars 21m contract for the US computer maker. 'If this is what the government of Mexico is capable of doing to a Dollars 75bn company. . . what hope is there for your constituency?' he asked. An official of the Mexican government called the allegations unfounded and said they had been reviewed by the Mexican controller general and the Congress. Mr Moussavi said he had IBM documents asserting the Mexican air traffic control system represented a 'menace to the air travelling public' because the existing computer and radar systems were not integrated. This charge was disputed by Congressman Joel Hefley, who said he had a document saying IBM 'had no reason to believe the current air traffic control system was unsafe'.</p>

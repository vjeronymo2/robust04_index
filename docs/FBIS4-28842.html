			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi  Ki-taek called on North Korea Tuesday to retract its  announcement on quitting the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), asserting that such action will not help settle its  nuclear row with the international community.    He also urged Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its  nuclear development program and renounce its nuclear ambitions.    In an emergency press conference called at his Democratic  Party office in the morning, he said, "I'm deeply concerned  about a crisis of war being brought about by the government's  unprincipled and incompetent diplomacy."    He called for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem  through a package deal, instead of through sanctions, and the  convening of a special parliamentary session to discuss this  pressing security issue.    On the failed parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae  scandal, he criticized certain banks and government agencies for  refusing to produce the documentary evidence requested by  lawmakers, terming the refusal "an anti-social act."    The opposition party will sue those suspected of being  involved in the scandal for bribery, impeach the finance,  justice and defense ministers for obstructing the investigation  and make public its own probe results and the military  prosecution's investigation records, Yi said.    Commenting on the nuclear issue, he said, "the present  government instils a sense of war crisis into the people's mind,  the people are scared of war, and because of this the economy  faces a crisis... Dealing with the issue, the government has  only created confusion in its approach, using a stick one time  and a carrot another time without any principle. It must now  reconfirm the principle of avoiding war under any circumstances."    He added, "I'm ready to visit North Korea if it would help  solve the nuclear issue."    Yi opposed any U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea  outside  the UN Security Council and urged the government to seek a  peaceful solution through direct inter-Korean dialogue,  including a summit, "instead of pushing for UN sanctions even by  distorting the results of summit diplomacy."    Asked why the parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae  scandal failed, he said the government had interfered with the  probe by refusing to produce necessary data in an attempt to  conceal the truth.    During the course of the investigation, the government  exposed its immorality while destroying public trust in  politics, he said.    The truth behind the scandal must be brought to light by  amending the parliamentary inspection law to give it more teeth,  he stressed.</p>

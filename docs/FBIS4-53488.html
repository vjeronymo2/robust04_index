			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Yun Tok-no] </F>   [Text] Large corporations continue to join small- and  medium-business [SMB] cooperatives. Originally, SMB cooperatives  were organized to promote the common interests of small and  medium businesses by pooling their efforts. Naturally, their  members are primarily small and medium businesses.    No one can categorically say that the interests of SMB  cooperatives and those of large corporations are always in  conflict with each other. But depending on the circumstances,  SMB cooperatives occasionally have to take a position  diametrically opposite to that of large corporations.    Despite the primary characteristics of SMB cooperatives,  cases of large corporations joining SMB cooperatives as their  members have increased steadily for the past several years.    As a matter of principle, large corporations can become SMB  members only with the approval of the SMB cooperatives  concerned. Large corporations are admitted into SMB  cooperatives when small and medium businesses need them and  vice versa for mutual cooperation and interests. But according  to cooperatives, there are some side effects.    As of the end of this March an additional seven large  corporations joined five SMB cooperatives so far this year:  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. joined Korea Electrical  Manufacturers Cooperative; Korea Tungsten Mining Co., Hannong  Co., and Koyang Furnace Industry joined the Korea Industrial  Furnace Cooperative; and Hankuk Glass Industry Co. joined the  Korea Glassware Industry Cooperative; Iljin Corp. joined the  Korea Geographic Information Cooperative; and Koryo Industry  Co. became a new member of the Korea Corrugated Cardboard  Producers Cooperative.    Last year 21 large corporations joined 15 SMB cooperatives.  For instance, Anam Electric Industrial Co., Tongyang Precision  Co., and Korea Xerox joined the Korea Electronic Industry  Cooperative; Samsung Electronics Co. joined the Korea  Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative; and Hyundai Electronics  Ind. Co. joined the Korea Communications Cooperative.    In 1992 as many as seven large cooperations joined the Korea  Electronic Industry Cooperative. They are: Goldstar  Communications, Samsung Electron Devices Co., Hyundai  Electronics Indus. Co., Goldstar Information Communication Co.,  Daewoo Communications, Tongyang Nylon Co., and Koryo Systems.  In addition, the Lotte Machine Manufacturing Co. and the Mando  Machinery Corp. joined the Inchon-Kyonggi Machine Manufacturers  Cooperative. In all, 15 large corporations joined eight SMB  cooperatives in 1992.    Of the total 588 SMB cooperatives, 94 have large  corporations  among their members.    The combined membership of SMB cooperatives totals 46,500,  of  which 307 are large corporations, accounting for 0.66 percent.  The Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.  are among the largest corporations in our country. Most of the  largest corporations in the country are among the members of  SMB cooperatives, which are primarily for small and medium  business firms. The case of Korea Electronic Industry  Cooperative is most conspicuous, with 20 large corporations  accounting for 4.6 percent of its total membership of 434 firms.    In the case of the Korea Pharmaceutical Production Industry  Cooperative, eight of its 173 member firms are large  corporations, accounting for 4.6 percent of the total  membership. The percentage is 3.8 percent in the Korea  Communications Cooperative, and 3.5 percent in the Korea  Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative.    A large corporation can apply for membership in a SMB  cooperative with the recommendation of five member firms when  its admittance is deemed necessary for subcontract  transactions, business alignment, technology transfers, the  procurement of raw materials and parts, and other purposes for  the development of small and medium businesses. When the  cooperative's board of directors approves the application, the  applicant can become a member of the cooperative. However, the  number of large cooperations in any single cooperative cannot  exceed 5 percent of its total membership.    In admitting large corporations, the SMB cooperative  concerned has a decisive voice inasmuch as membership  applications are subject to the approval of the co-op's board  of directors.    The purpose of large corporations in joining SMB  cooperatives  is to maximize the mutual interests of large corporations and  cooperatives.    First of all, the admittance of large corporations into SMB  cooperatives has some positive facets in securing cooperation  between large corporations and SMB cooperatives in areas such  as technology transfer, subcontract transactions, and  information on overseas markets.    In addition, large corporations and SMB cooperatives can  promote their common interests by jointly participating in free  group contracts. When an SMB cooperative cannot fulfill by  itself the obligation to supply a certain amount of goods  assigned to it under a free group contract, it can do so by  admitting large corporations as its members. For their part  large corporations can secure an outlet for their products by  participating in free group contracts.    Large corporations cannot account for more than 20 percent  of  the total amount of goods supplied by SMB cooperatives under a  free group contract. In reality, survey shows that the amount  of goods actually supplied by large corporations under free  group contracts is slightly over 5 percent of the total  contract volume.    According to Korea Federation of Small Business, large  cooperations accounted for 5.7 percent of the total amount of  goods supplied by SMB cooperatives in the first half of 1993  under free group contracts.    The percentage allocated to large corporations in the total  volume of supplies provided by SMB cooperatives under free  group contracts slightly decreased from 7.6 percent in 1990 to  6.5 percent in 1991. Still, the portion of goods supplied by  large corporations is not small. Large corporate members of SMB  cooperatives participate in free group contracts of SMB  cooperatives only where small and medium firms alone cannot  fulfill their contract obligations.    Another reason large corporations are admitted into SMB  cooperatives is that their admittance enables SMB cooperatives  to seek common interests through joint purchases and other  means. With the participation of large corporations in joint  purchases, the unit cost can be lowered through a larger  purchase volume. Large corporations for their part can enjoy  the benefit of purchasing necessary raw materials and parts at  lower prices.    For small and medium enterprises admittance of large  corporations into SMB cooperatives can have the effect of  preventing competition with large corporations in competitive  bidding, according to concerned officials of SMB cooperatives.  They say that by admitting large corporations as their members,  SMB cooperatives in some cases can avoid competitive bidding  with large corporations and succeed in signing free contracts  on their initiative.    It is also pointed out that admittance of large corporations  into SMB cooperatives has other positive aspects in promoting  cooperation between large corporations and small and medium  business in areas, such as information on overseas markets,  technology transfers, and subcontract transactions. However,  it is noted that admittance of large corporations has some  negative side also. For instance, depending on circumstances,  large corporations for their own interests may have a greater  voice in the management of SMB cooperatives.    In some cases small and medium enterprises may find their  voices drowned out by the louder voices of large corporate  members when it is necessary to make a decision contradictory  to the interests of the large corporations. In reality, in some  cases large corporations join SMB cooperatives as an expedient  way of staving off the opposition of small and medium  enterprises.    Wishing to enter the lunch-box business, a certain company M  attempted to join the relevant SMB cooperative, but it failed  because of the deep-rooted antagonism between it and small and  medium member firms of the cooperative.    Admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperative has  both positive and negative sides. Concerned officials of  cooperatives say that in the final analysis it is important to  bring masterly management skills into play in order to maximize  the mutual interests.</p>

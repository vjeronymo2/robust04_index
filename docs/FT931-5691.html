			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report London COCOA headed south, weighed down by a New York market in retreat on what traders described as liquidation related to the lack of progress at the Geneva pact negotiations. 'People had taken long positions as protection before the talks began. But it's becoming increasingly clear nothing is going to happen so they're getting out,' one dealer said. On the London bullion market PLATINUM, after fixing at Dollars 342.75 a troy ounce - 25 cents up from the morning - largely recovered the ground lost following Allied-Signal's announcement of a new palladium-based auto catalyst. PALLADIUM was marked down 25 cents at the afternoon fix to Dollars 105 a troy ounce. BASE METAL price movements were less extreme on the LME, largely consolidating after the losses sustained over the last week. However, consumer demand remains thin, and once technical corrections have run their course, many metals remain vulnerable unless there is a sea-change in sentiment. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CANCER RISK REPORTED FOR NEIGHBORS OF  LANDFILL  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley residents living near the controversial BKK Corp. landfill  face a risk of contracting cancer that is slightly above the U.S. average,  according to a recently completed health-risk assessment by USC and the state  Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> However, researchers also concluded that the cancer rate for those living  around the West Covina landfill was essentially the same as for Los Angeles  County overall.  </P> <P> The studies involved 100,000 residents who lived around the landfill from 1972  to 1982, when it was one of the state's principal toxic waste disposal sites.  </P> <P> The heightened risk translates into an additional 2 people out of 100,000 who  are likely to develop cancer as a result of the presence of vinyl chloride, a  carcinogen present in the air, soil and water around the landfill, which is now  closed to toxic waste.  </P> <P> About 33,000 people in the study area would be expected to contract cancer  regardless of the landfill's proximity, researchers said.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Senators pass bankruptcy law The Romanian Senate has passed a much-delayed bankruptcy bill, one of the most important pieces of legislation needed in the country's transition to a market economy. The bill, which has been blocked by conservatives in the ruling left-wing party for nearly two years, is due to be discussed by the lower house of parliament this week. The government agreed to pass the bill this year as a condition of a Dollars 700m IMF loan package signed last May. The passage of the bill coincides with a growing liquidity crisis at several large state companies, with many unable to pay suppliers or wages. According to central bank figures, inter-enterprise debt has jumped to more than Lei7,000bn (Pounds 2.37bn) but until now only a handful of small companies have been forced into liquidation in cases brought by banks under a pre-communist commercial code. The delay in paying wages has increased social tensions. Thousands of steel workers in the Transylvanian town of Resita yesterday entered the sixth day of street protests sparked by non-payment of wages for two months.</p>

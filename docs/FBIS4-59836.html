			<p>BFN     [Text] The militia's of Dostam-Golboddin have embarked on  an all-round attack on Chardara District, Konduz Province, in  order to compensate for their defeats in the capital and in the  northern regions during the last few days. The attacks of the  murderer militia's, accompanied by heavy air bombardment, on the  residential areas of Konduz and Chardara District, caused loss  of life and financial damage to people.

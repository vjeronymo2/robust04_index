			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A lot is being said about bloody Friday, 22 January  1993, but the truth is still far from being revealed. This is  because Luanda is doing all it can to hide its involvement in  the crime. Thousands of citizens of the Bakongo tribe were  killed in Luanda on that day. Thousands of others were  assaulted and had their property looted, while the government  and the press under its control watched silently in complicity.    A report on the massacre was published yesterday by the  government-dominated Parliament chaired by Franca van Dunem, and  the Luanda government washed its hands, saying it was an  isolated incident. Milton Kilandamoko, an Angolan politician,  reacted to the masquerade.    [Begin recording] [Kilandamoko] We think that is not true.  First of all, I must say this parliamentary report was made a  long time ago. It has not been published until now because the  ruling party wanted to make certain alterations. Our confidence  in Parliament consequently has been erased. I do not believe in  the report. The Bakongo people do not believe it at all.    [Unidentified reporter] You continue to believe that the  bloody Friday violence last January had ethnic causes?    [Kilandamoko] Absolutely, absolutely. There is no doubt  about that. The armed elements involved in the violence even  said why they were doing it. The government cannot, therefore,  try to deceive people. It is clearly responsible for the  violence. The police elements who carried out the massacre are  government administration elements. This being the case, the  government is responsible and it is its duty to respond. Only  these elements would be brought before a court, while the  government washes its hands. That is not justice. It has  referred the case to Parliament and the Parliament tried to  spare the government.    [Reporter] This means, therefore, that the parliamentary  report is not correct and the Bakongo people will continue to  demand justice.    [Kilandamoko] Absolutely. This report is a pure lie. We do  not agree with it. I, personally, as a Bakongo, do not agree  with it, and the Bakongo people think in the same way.    [Reporter] What are you going to do now?    [Kilandamoko] Well, first of all, we think the government  must be brought before judicial institutions. Here in Angola,  it is not customary for the government to be called to answer.  A person can be killed by the police, an armed civilian can be  killed by the government, the person will be buried and the case  will end there. We think that our country is developing and the  government must know that it is its duty to care for the life of  the people. Parliament's failure to give priority to this case  means that the same kind of justice that was applied during a  one-party system continues to be applied in the country today.  [end recording]</p>

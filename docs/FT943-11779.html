			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mitie ahead 40% despite 'fierce environment' Mitie Group, the Greenock-based building maintenance company, lifted pre-tax profits by 40 per cent from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.36m in the year ended March 31 on the back of a 39 per cent jump in turnover to Pounds 101.7m. The shares closed 10p higher at 338p. Mr David Telling, chairman, said that the outcome was achieved against a background of a 'fiercely competitive environment'. However, Mr Telling saw an improvement in the market place and so far, results for the current year were ahead of last time. Shareholders receive a 29 per cent expansion in dividends, via a recommended final of 2.5p which raises the total from 3.5p to 4.5p, matching an increase in earnings per share from 13.3p to 17.1p. The dividend is covered 3.6 times by earnings. A 2-for-1 subdivision of shares is also proposed. Mr Telling said yesterday that indigenous sales growth represented some Pounds 24m, or 30 per cent of the total. He said he looked forward to an increase in margins fuelled by the bottom pressure of a shortage of skilled labour which would lead to increased prices. Margins were 40 to 50 per cent below what they were 5 years ago, but despite a substantial increase in turnover and acquisitions the company remained ungeared. The company also announced the acquisition, by its Mitie Engineering Services subsidiary, of the shares not already owned in Mitie Engineering Services (South East) for Pounds 1.69m. Pre-tax profits of the offshoot were Pounds 599,151 during the 1993-94 year. On completion of the deal Mitie will be able to consolidate an additional 45 per cent of the profits.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Cashmere is fine, but musk ox was the royal choice  -Daniel Green explores exotic and luxurious types of woollen fabrics FED UP with cashmere? Too affluent for angora? Try guanaco or musk ox for some really decadent clothing. The world's woollens specialists can supply some of the most exotic fabrics around, if only their customers knew it. For many, cashmere will always be king. But alpaca can feel almost as good at a fraction of the price. Cashmere weavers, who would not be seen dead in yak, yearn for vicuna. But how to navigate about the arcane world of rare fibres? Here is a quick tour. Cashmere is the benchmark for all luxury fibres. Connoisseurs seek out white and pastel coloured clothes because only the highest grades of fibre from the best Inner Mongolian cashmere goats are pale enough. Poorer, darker, produce from Afghanistan, Iran or Australasia is made into darker clothes. Prices of all grades have halved since 1989 and are now back to the levels of the early 1980s. Sweaters are widely available starting at less than Pounds 100. Daks Simpson sells a Pounds 699 men's jacket and Aquascutum has a ladies' coat at Pounds 1,100. For an unusual variation, Sogo on Piccadilly Circus is stocking a Pounds 395 blazer of wool, cashmere and silver fox. Harrods has men's cashmere suits at Pounds 1,750. Mohair comes from the Angora goat and should not be confused with angora rabbit hair. It is light, warm and soft but a little coarser and stiffer than cashmere and is easily creased. Lightweight suits are popular in the Far East. Aquascutum has a ladies' mohair and silk blend sweater at Pounds 245. Chester Barrie has a mohair and wool mix men's suit at Pounds 575. Pure Mohair suits cost from Pounds 1,200 in Savile Row. Angora is a rabbit hair fabric that has been out of fashion since the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, it is soft enough to be an alternative to cashmere and can be much cheaper. The best comes from Germany, Austria and Japan where it is popular for thermal underwear. Sweaters cost from Pounds 50 and Chester Barrie has a men's coat at Pounds 995 - Harrods priced them at Pounds 595 in its sale and sold out within a week. Camel hair has a poor image in most of Europe and Japan but competes with cashmere in the US and Italy. Look out for kid camel hair from Italy. Do not expect to pick up bargains in the Middle East: the camels required are the two-humped Bactrian variety from central Asia. Daks Simpson sells a men's jacket at Pounds 699 and John N Kent in Stafford Street sells an overcoat at around Pounds 1,200. An Aquascutum classic ladies' coat costs Pounds 749. Alpaca fibre is the biggest seller from the llama family of the South American Andes. In terms of fineness it compares with camel hair, yet the wholesale price is about the same as top sheep's wool. The best comes form the suri alpaca rather than the huacaya. There is a men's overcoat at Pounds 549 from Daks Simpson and a ladies' swing coat from Aquascutum at Pounds 850. Vicuna is one of the rarest of all fine fabrics and is widely regarded as a cashmere-beater. The vicuna is a relative of the llama, but poaching has decimated wild herds and the remaining creatures are protected. Pure vicuna garments probably originate from the black market, and legal stocks are being eked out by blending with cashmere. The cloth, if available, sells at more than Pounds 1,500 a metre in London but Japan is the main market, where a pure vicuna men's coat would sell for at least Pounds 6,000. A blended overcoat in Japan retails at Pounds 2,500. Guanaco is also a member of the llama family. Some are reared in Wales, although Argentina produces a higher-quality raw material. It is slightly finer than cashmere and costs 25-30 per cent more. Cashgora is an Australasian cross between cashmere and angora goats. Cashgora is not as soft as cashmere but its fibres are longer and stronger. It is typically about 20 per cent cheaper than cashmere but lack of customer awareness means that sales have yet to take off. Germans put it in luxury blankets and Sogo sells a sweater for Pounds 140 and Aquascutum has a ladies' coat at Pounds 545. Yak hair comes from the Himalayas and is rare and fine enough to challenge the lower grades of cashmere. Unfortunately, each 350kg yak moults a mere 100g of hair a year and the material is most likely to be found blended with other fibres in overcoats in the US. Musk ox was once worn by George V and is said to be finer than either vicuna or cashmere. In 1989, Lyle and Scott of Scotland made 72 musk ox sweaters and sold them for Pounds 500 each, mostly in Japan. One of the few reliable sources today is Oomingmak Musk Ox Producers' Co-operative, 64 H Street, Anchorage, Alaska 99501. Tel 0101-907-272-9225. Hats, scarves and tunics knitted by native Alaskans cost between Dollars 65 (Pounds 43) and Dollars 385, mail order. Daks Simpson, 203 Piccadilly, W1A 2AS. 071-734-2002. Sogo, 28 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4SP. Tel: 071-333-9000.</p>

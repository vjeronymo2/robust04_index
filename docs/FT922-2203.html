			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Old memories revived at Philips  -Confidence in the Dutch group has been shaken PHILIPS' problems in consumer electronics could not have come at a worst time. Investor confidence had been returning gradually after the upheavals of 1990 and 1991, and the Dutch company's shares have stood around 12-month highs for most of May and June. But yesterday's surprise from Philips that it is unlikely to meet its 1992 profit forecast has wiped out the fragile, emerging belief that the group may have put the worst of its troubles behind it. Still, the dramatic 17.6 per cent decline in Philips' share price was a sign of continued disillusionment with the company's investor relations as well as a reflection about overall strategy. Analysts were taken aback by Philips' announcement, but were quick to point out that the company is in the same boat as most other manufacturers of consumer electronics. The news was especially surprising because the company had failed to indicate at a meeting with analysts last week that its consumer electronics business had deteriorated further. Only last month, the company had described its first-quarter figures as 'satisfactory', despite the fact that consumer electronics had slipped into the red. The latest profit announcement revived memories of the 'bad old Philips' which sprung surprises on financial markets and failed to meet profit targets. But there were also traces of the 'new Philips' which Mr Jan Timmer has tried to create since taking over in July 1990: this time, the company at least prepared investors for the bad news it will be issuing when it releases second-quarter results on August 6. The stock market's sharp reaction to setbacks at the company is a continuing legacy of May 1990, when Philips unveiled sharply lower first-quarter results without any warning. This touched off a severe crisis of confidence in Philips' management, culminating in the early retirement of the then president and the early appointment of Mr Timmer. But unlike the situation in 1990, when many people doubted whether the overmanned, excessively bureaucratic Philips group would be able to survive at all, the company has proven its ability to plug gaping holes in its profit and loss account. Under Mr Timmer, Philips acted quickly to cut 40,000 jobs from a workforce of 240,000 and slim down its computer and semi-conductor divisions. These moves have partly paid off, as is demonstrated by Philips' steady return to profit since record losses in 1990. But successes are now becoming quickly overshadowed by stubborn setbacks in consumer electronics, the group's single biggest business. Even before yesterday's news, Philips had said that its senior managers in consumer electronics were working on a package of measures aimed at reviving the profitability of selling compact disc players, colour television sets and video cassette recorders (VCR) in a recession-hit market. So far this year, Philips has moved to bolster its marketing of consumer electronics in Europe by centralising the division's marketing, sales and service organisations. It has also announced that its entire VCR business will be merged into a joint venture with that of Grundig, the German consumer electronics maker owned by Philips, in an attempt to strengthen competitiveness in one of the most hard-fought segments of the market. But if consumer electronics remains in the doldrums, Mr Timmer will need to take bold action if he is to restore the confidence which yesterday's profit pronouncement has so quickly swept away.

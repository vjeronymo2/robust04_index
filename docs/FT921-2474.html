			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consumption forecast to surge by 1995 PLATINUM CONSUMPTION by the automotive industry is set to rise by 55 per cent, or 865,000 troy ounces, to about 2.4m ounces between 1991 and 1995, according to a report by the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation. Car manufacturers consumed about 36 per cent of total supply last year and could use 50 per cent by 1995 as tougher limits on vehicle emissions are introduced, it points out. On the supply side, the consultancy suggests that exports by Russia, second-largest producer after South Africa, are already falling and this year are likely to be pushed back by production difficulties from nearly 1m ounces to 370,000 ounces, near the levels seen in the 1980s. During the 1980s the Soviet Union sold an average of 350,000 ounces a year, equivalent to about 12 per cent of total annual platinum supplies. In 1990, however, Soviet sales jumped to 700,000 ounces, about 17.5 per cent of total supply, and last year they are estimated to have reached 990,000 ounces or 23 per cent of supply. Some of this came from strategic stockpiles or industrial stocks rather than current production, which is probably well below annual capacity, estimated to be between 700,000 and 800,000 ounces. The big jump in sales from the former Soviet Union boosted the annual supply surplus from 210,000 ounces in 1990 to an estimated 455,000 ounces last year, says APMA. However, this year there may be a small supply deficit (about 75,000 ounces), which by 1995 could widen to more than 300,000 ounces. 'This deficit, in combination with rising investor interest, will force platinum's price substantially higher by the middle of the decade,' the report suggests. In spite of cuts recently made to South African producers' planned expansion programmes, its platinum output could rise by more than 40 per cent between 1991 and 1995, from 2.8m ounces to 3.95m, says APMA - 'if South African politics and race relations don't interfere.'

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: CLIFFHANGER THRILL IS RELIVED IN VIDEO SERIALS  </P> <P> In the 1981 film "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones, the daring  archeologist, got himself into some of the darndest, life-threatening fixes,  escaping just in the nick of time.  </P> <P> Director Steven Spielberg, now at work on the third Indiana Jones epic, has  said that the inspiration for the movie was those Saturday-afternoon  cliffhanger serials he watched as a youngster. The spirit of those serials -- a  staple in movie theaters from the '30s through the mid '50s -- lives on in the  phenomenally successful Indiana Jones series.  </P> <P> The real thing lives on too, thanks to home video.  </P> <P> Republic Home Video has cornered the market on serials. Since the mid-'80s, the  company has put out 16 of them -- six in the last year -- and has more than 40  more in its vaults, according to Vallery Kountze, senior vice president for  marketing. It plans to release six to 12 of those in the next year, she said.  </P> <P> Drawn from the catalogue of Republic Pictures, a B-movie outfit that was a  major serial maker (along with Universal, Columbia and RKO), Republic markets  them at $29.95, offering a complete serial -- 12 to 15 chapters -- on two  cassettes.  </P> <P> "They appeal to older people, who remember them as kids, and to film buffs,"  Kountze said. "But there's also a new audience of younger people who consider  the serials camp and hip."  </P> <P> Indeed, the sets are tacky and the acting is generally wooden. The big  attraction, however, is the action, which they supply non-stop. The favorite  form of action -- bloodless in those days -- is the fist fight. One breaks out  about every five minutes.  </P> <P> Each chapter ended with the hero or heroine in some terrifying situation, on  the brink of death. Do they survive? If so, how? Fans would come back each week  to find out. The beauty of having all the chapters -- which run 11-17 minutes  each -- available in one package is not having to wait to find out how the hero  survives.  </P> <P> Here's a sample of the Republic serials available on home video:  </P> <P> "King of the Texas Rangers" (1941). Serial buffs and sports fans love this one  because it features former star quarterback Sammy Baugh as a Texas Ranger. In  defiance of logic, it mixes an old-fashioned Western with a wartime saboteur  hunt. But in terms of action -- especially the big oil-field fire -- it's still  one of the better Western serials.  </P> <P> "King of the Rocketmen" (1949). Features Tris Coffin, who usually played  villains, as the Rocket Man, a crime-fighter who flies because of a jacket  equipped with rocket jets. His nemesis is the shadowy Dr. Vulcan, a  major-league saboteur. This serial is notable for its well-staged fistfights.  </P> <P> "Adventures of Captain Marvel" (1941). Starring Tom Tyler as the comic-book  character who was Superman's chief rival for fan affection. Captain Marvel's  alter-ego, Billy Batson, shouted, "Shazam!," turning him into the invincible,  caped crime-fighter. With some remarkably authentic flying scenes, this is  considered one of the best serials ever.  </P> <P> "Nyoka and the Tigermen" (1942). Kay Aldredge plays Nyoka, who's battling the  pretty but evil Vultura in North Africa. The film includes a hair-raising  collapsing rope-bridge sequence, with acrobatic Nyoka barely escaping alive.  </P> <P> "The Masked Marvel" (1943). Tom Steele, as the hero, battles Sakima, an evil  Japanese agent. It is awash with flag-waving patriotism and the kind of odious  Japanese stereotypes that were prevalent in wartime movies.  </P> <P> "Spy Smasher" (1942). Kane Richmond plays another comic-book hero who's  combating saboteurs, this time The Mask and his gang. The production values are  far above the norm. Features some of the greatest escape sequences in the  serials genre.  </P> <P> "Son of Zorro" (1947) George Turner, as the masked avenger, fights an outlaw  gang in the post-Civil War West. Most of the Western serials were sub-par, but  this one, full of bang-up fight scenes, is well above average.  </P> <P> Information: (800) 826-2295.  </P></p>

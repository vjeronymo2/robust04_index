Soldiers are regarded  as government officials who must comply with government policy,  but it is good that they openly express their opinion about  certain policies that they find impractical instead of keeping  quiet and refusing to implement such policies, as some civil  servants have been doing.    The three armed forces commanders, however, believe that  this  government harbors hatred against the armed forces and looks for  any opportunity to bully them. They claim it is improper for  the government to impose the same policy on the procurement of  military hardware and materials as on the construction of public  facilities such as the elevated electric train system. Things  have now changed. We believe that the elevated electric train  project is a higher priority than the weapons needed for the  country's defense. There is currently not much of an external  threat to national security, but the traffic problem has become  a national issue.    It does not make sense to say that if we do not decide now  the price of the planes will increase. It will not be difficult  if the armed forces clearly understand the arms barter policy  from the very beginning. They can agencies to help arrange  purchases using this method. It is true that the armed forces  have no expertise in this area, but the Commerce Ministry and  several international firms can offer assistance. They know  which countries produce what kinds of weapons and military  hardware and what agricultural products they want. If the armed  forces had only been a little more patient and had not revealed  their position so hastily, the people would not have the feeling  that there is a rift between the government and the military.    We support the government's endeavors to tackle the problem  of low crop prices through the practice of barter trade.  Although it might not work out perfectly, at least we will be  able to sell our crops in cases of production surplus or falling  prices. The armed forces should realize how this scheme can  benefit our poor farmers. If they really cannot implement the  policy, though, they should talk to the government and explain  the possible adverse consequences. The government's intentions  are good, but it has not spelled them out clearly to the  agencies concerned.    It was not a surprise when the three armed forces convened a  meeting and declared their disagreement with the government's  arms barter policy, because they lack a clear understanding of  it. It is necessary for the armed forces to study this policy  thoroughly before they can implement it successfully.    We appeal to the government and the armed forces to try to  reach an agreement on which level this policy should be applied  at, and the fact that this is one method to help solve the  problem of low crop prices. We must make sure that deals are  carried out in a transparent manner and that nobody pockets  commission fees, as repeatedly has happened in various agencies.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Bank chief hints at room for rate cuts MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, last night left the way open for further cuts in interest rates, although he warned that efforts to counter inflation were still high on the government's list of economic priorities. In a further indication of the government's shift in economic policy in recent weeks, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said objectives had changed to put more emphasis on 'opportunities for growth and opportunities for employment'. Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee, Mr Leigh-Pemberton acknowledged fresh fears that the recession was deepening by saying the economy suffered from 'lack of life' and that inflationary pressures were 'difficult to detect'. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected tonight in his Mansion House speech to the City to sketch in further details of UK economic policy, including new efforts to make Treasury policies more comprehensible. Referring to the events of Black Wednesday - September 16 - when sterling was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that with hindsight European Community nations should have considered more seriously during the summer a broad ERM realignment to counter severe currency turbulence. Repeating the line of other UK government representatives, he said he had been 'unaware' of any approach by the Bundesbank or the German finance ministry during August or September that Britain should take part in a broad realignment as a way to reduce the currency strains. On the change of approach in UK policy since Black Wednesday, the governor said there was 'no inconsistency' between laying the foundation for growth and countering inflation. But asked by Mr John Watts, the committee's chairman, about what he understood to be the main objective of economic policy, Mr Leigh-Pemberton replied: 'Sustained non-inflationary growth - in a word, prosperity.' The governor stressed that it would be unwise for the government to bring down base rates, now at 8 per cent, too quickly, on the grounds that this might give financial markets the impression it was indifferent to the value of the pound. He said that the depreciation of sterling since Black Wednesday, coupled with a 2-percentage-point reduction in interest rates in recent weeks had laid the ground for an economic stimulus in the coming months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman made the following statement in reply to  questions raised by JIJI [JIJI PRESS] and AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS]  correspondents stationed in Beijing in connection with Japanese  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on 3 May that the  "Nanjing Massacre was fabricated":    The war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists in  China in the past inflicted grave calamities to the Chinese  people, and the Nanjing massacre was one of the heinous crimes  committed by Japanese militarists. The international community  has long drawn a conclusion on the aggressive nature of Japan's  war against China and the historical facts surrounding the  Nanjing massacre.    To correctly deal with historical questions is an important  political foundation for developing friendly and cooperative  relations between China and Japan. The Chinese Government has  all along advocated the needs to adopt a forward-looking  attitude regarding unfortunate segments of history and to draw  lessons from history in jointly developing friendly and  cooperative ties in the future. Such are also the common  understandings and stance of many Japanese government leaders.  Many of them have even expressed apologies and repentance for  Japanese aggression abroad during World War II.    It has been nearly a half century since the war was ended.  Today, as Sino-Japanese relations are entering a new stage of  development, we are shocked and indignant that a Japanese  cabinet member has gone so far as to openly tamper with history  and deny facts to defend the aggressive act committed by  Japanese militarists. We hoped that the Japanese Government  will proceed from the overall interests of safeguarding  bilateral relations in seriously handling this question.</p>

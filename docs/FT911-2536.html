			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: France urges EC to keep Japanese car import curbs FRANCE'S industry minister yesterday called on theEuropean Commission to back EC car-makers' proposals for continuing controls onJapanese car sales in Europe. Today, all 17 Commissioners will discuss the vexed question of Japanese car imports for the first time since October, with the aim of informing EC governments of their proposals by the middle of next month and restarting negotiations with the Japanese. 'I hope the Commission will agree on a proposal not much different from what the European car producershave put forward,' said Mr Roger Fauroux, the French minister. The European industry seems to have moved closer to the Commission's line on Japanese car imports recently, principally because Mr Jacques Calvet, the hardline chairmanof Peugeot, has distanced the group from fellow-producers. Last month, ACEA, the new industry lobby group, which excludes the French car manufacturer, called for continuing controls until the end 1999, saying the Japanese share of the market should not exceed 15 per cent until then. The Commission would now like to end months of squabbling between EC member states and manufacturers on the timetable, terms and conditions for opening up the European market to Japanese car imports, but the potential for disagreement is still great. Today' s meeting will consider again outline principles for opening the EC market which were first put forward at the beginning of last year. They include the ending of national restrictions on Japanese imports by the beginning of 1993, Japanese monitoring of its own car exports to the EC for a transitional period to end in 1998, according to first Commission plans, and improved access to the Japanese market. Commission officials stressed that only imports would be monitored and not 'transplants' - Japanese cars assembled in Europe  - which they estimate could grow from 250,000 a year at present to perhaps 1.2m by the end of 1998. The absolute level of imports is expected to rise to a similar level before the EC market is completely open, but commissioners will also consider how far the level of imports should be adjusted if market conditions change.</p>

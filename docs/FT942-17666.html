			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Exports to Latin America rise For the first time in 12 years Germany recorded a trade surplus of DM1.8bn (Pounds 700m) with Latin America during the first nine months of 1993, helped by a 56 per cent increase in exports to Brazil and a 17 per cent drop in imports. Prospects for the continent improved dramatically with a net capital inflow of about Dollars 50bn last year, of which Dollars 17.5bn comprised direct foreign investments, according to figures from the Deutsch-Sudamerikanische Bank, a part of Dresdner Bank. German exports to Latin America rose by just over 6 per cent to DM11.2bn while its exports worldwide fell almost 13 per cent. Weak prices for coffee, copper and other commodities caused the sharp fall in imports. Plant and machinery made up about a third of exports to Brazil where a surge of almost 5 per cent in GDP wiped out a traditional German trade deficit with Latin America. Exports to Colombia and Paraguay also rose, while shipments to to Mexico dropped 6 per cent.</p>

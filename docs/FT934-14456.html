			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Alcazar agreement hinges on US partner THE FOUR European airlines aiming to combine forces in the Alcazar project have resolved in principle all key issues, except the selection of a US partner, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said yesterday. However, resolving the US partner question is vital to a successful outcome of the Alcazar negotiations which SAS, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are hoping to complete by the end of this month. 'This has to be resolved in order to fit the whole puzzle together,' said Mr Peter Forssman, head of corporate relations at SAS. He said the three issues of the location of the Alcazar headquarters and other major functions, the line-up of senior executives in the new management company and how to value the four airlines' respective shares in the alliance were in principle solved. But negotiations this week had not resolved which US partner Alcazar would choose from Delta, which has links with Swissair, Northwest, tied to KLM, or SAS's partner Continental. It is clear the issue is more complex than an argument over which US airline would offer the best commercial partnership. The choice will form part of a delicate division of spoils in Alcazar between the four airlines which each have sensitive political constituencies to satisfy. For example, the open-skies agreement between the US and the Netherlands, and Dutch membership of the EC are strong arguments in favour of choosing Northwest and siting the Alcazar headquarters in Amsterdam. But this would most likely be unacceptable to the other partners.</p>

CIA Station Chief in Moscow Declared  Persona Non Grata on a `Reciprocal Basis'"]    [Text] Yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry made a  representation to the counselor envoy of the U.S. Embassy in  Moscow in connection with the deportation of Aleksandr Lysenko,  official representative of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service [FIS] in Washington. "In this situation," the note  says, "we are forced to declare the CIA representative in Moscow  persona non grata and to request that he leave the Russian  Federation on a reciprocal basis. The Russian Foreign Ministry  proceeds from the assumption that there are special channels for  settling matters that may arise with regard to the intelligence  and counterintelligence activity of the two sides. These  channels can and should be put in operation. This will make it  possible to find a mutually acceptable way out of the current  situation and to avoid its politicization." When asked by your  SEGODNYA correspondent to specify, Grigoriy Karasin, director of  the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry press and information  department, said that the person in question was James L.  Morris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy.    Morris was given seven days to leave the country, same as  Lysenko. It has transpired from other sources that some time  ago the secret services of Russia and the United States were  going to reveal to each other one representative working under  diplomatic cover each, although, of course, without the right to  publish their names. Aleksandr Lysenko assumed his job in  Washington last summer and has no relation to Ames. In Moscow,  his deportation has been perceived as a purely political action,  and there have been attempts to conceal the fact that actions  taken against Morris are a retaliatory measure.    According to that same source, there have been no agreements  on the mutual cessation of intelligence activity between the  Russian and U.S. special services. There is, however, an  agreement on forgoing "uncivilized methods" of recruitment.  Nonetheless, the Russian side has evidence proving that the  U.S. special services have been using just these methods. The  Russian services, the source claims, are not interested in  arousing passions over the Ames case and, on their part, would  not like to make cases involving U.S. agents public. For the  time being, CIA Director Woolsey "is carrying on considerately,"  an approach that Moscow interprets as showing a similar desire.  Russian professionals have already made clear that they stand  for continuing cooperation with their American counterparts, but  they believe that the cooperation may only be based "on the  common perception of national interests." At the same time, the  source emphasized, there are influential forces in the United  States wishing "to impose a time-out" on President Clinton so as  to take a closer look at what is going on in Russia.    The decision regarding Morris was made personally by the  president. According to our information, the dismissal of  Golushko from the post of Federal Counterintelligence Service  [FCS] director does not have any bearing on the Ames case. At  the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, arrests have  been made at the FCS central staff and the Federal Agency of  Government Communications and Information.</p>

Meshkov ruled that Crimean conscripts serve only on  Crimean territory.    On Friday, Bizhan visited Sebastopol to meet with the  command  of the Ukrainian Navy and the Crimea's Military Commissar.    He denied the Crimean authorities the right to make  decisions  on drafts to the Ukrainian armed forces. But he said the order,  by which the Ukrainian Defense Minister allowed up to 20 percent  of the Crimean draftees to serve on the peninsula, remained in  force and those who could motivate their desire to stay to serve  in their home region, would be allowed to stay.    Also on Friday in Sebastopol Bizhan met with the Russian  Navy's chief-of-staff Admiral Selivanov. According to Bizhan,  several senior officers of the Russian Navy arrived in  Sebastopol without coordinating that move with the Ukrainian  leaders.    Addressing the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Bizhan said  his Ministry wanted to take stock of the Fleet's property and  study all the angles of that problem before preparing an  agreement on the transfer of the Fleet under Russian command in  payment for the fuel debt Ukraine was running with Russia.  Preparatory work could show, said Bizhan, it would make no  sense for Ukraine to sign that kind of an agreement with Russia.  On the other hand, Moscow saw the problem as practically  settled and was willing to discuss in detail the transfer of the  Black Sea Fleet under its command.    In Bizhan's view, Moscow was violating a number of earlier  agreements. Russian symbols were used by the Fleet and the  decision was disregarded that the Fleet's vessels be manned in  equal proportion by Russian and Ukrainian sailors.    According to Bizhan, 810th Marine brigade, with base in  Sebastopol, was manned exclusively by Russian citizens. If it  was recognized as all-Russian, the brigade would have to be  removed, without delay, from Ukrainian territory.</p>

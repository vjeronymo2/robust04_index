			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / PSBR cut by surprise tax boost An unexpected boost in tax receipts brought government borrowing down to Pounds 4.08bn in September, edging slightly below City forecasts of Pounds 4.3bn. September's figure brings the public sector borrowing requirement for the first six months of the financial year to Pounds 19.5bn, down from Pounds 23.9bn in the same period last year, indicating that the Treasury is still well on course for its forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95. The Central Statistical Office said the rise in tax revenues was largely due to early payments of corporation tax, which usually are not received until October. Companies were encouraged to file taxes early by the introduction of the pay and file scheme, an incentive plan allowing companies to earn interest on overpayments. Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 19.26bn for September, representing a 20 per cent increase from Pounds 16.11bn in the same month last year. Cash receipts so far this financial year are 8 per cent up from the previous year. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'So far this year revenue growth has been rather weak. But in the last couple of months the figures on tax revenues have been very encouraging indeed.' The government's purse was filled with Pounds 59m in early receipts from the third call of the third tranche of BT shares. Excluding these privatisation proceeds the underlying PSBR was Pounds 4.14bn in September and Pounds 21.8bn in the first six months of the year, compared with Pounds 27.4bn in the same period last year. Central government borrowing on its own account was Pounds 4.65bn in September and Pounds 21.7bn for the financial year to date, against Pounds 25.2bn in the same six months last year. The overall public sector figure was improved by the debt repayments of local authorities and public corporations. Cash outlays by the government in September were Pounds 23.9bn, up from Pounds 22.3bn in September last year and Pounds 20.96bn in August. The running total for the financial year to date is Pounds 128.0bn, an increase of 3 1/2 per cent from the same period last year. Spending by departments was Pounds 21.8bn in September and Pounds 120.1bn in the first six months of the financial year, only 1 1/2 per cent up from Pounds 118.4bn in the same months in 1993-94. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said: 'It now appears that expenditure is picking up more than we had expected so I think this month's figure will tame some of the more optimistic forecasts for the PSBR this year.' Construction orders fell by 5 per cent in the three months to the end of August, compared with the three months to the end of May, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. It added that orders were 5 per cent higher than the same period last year, suggesting that the slow recovery in construction activity is generally being maintained.</p>

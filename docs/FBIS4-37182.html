			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between anchor Hayim Yavin and party affairs </F> correspondent Menashe Raz in the Tel Aviv studio -- live]    [Text] [Yavin] Several weeks ago, Likud Chairman Binyamin  Netanyahu met with Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan in London. What  were the circumstances of the meeting? Who initiated it?    [Raz] In fact, the meeting was initiated by both sides. It  took place following several meetings and discussions, which  culminated in the idea of getting Likud Chairman Netanyahu and  Prince Hasan together.    [Yavin] Where was the meeting held?    [Raz] It took place at a private residence in London in  early May. Netanyahu left Israel and returned on the same day.  The meeting lasted several hours. In the meeting, Netanyahu  made it clear to Prince Hasan that the Likud supports the  government's policy regarding a peace agreement with Jordan.  The Likud has no problem with a peace arrangement between  Israel and Jordan. After he returned to Israel, Netanyahu  briefed Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the meeting.    [Yavin] Has Netanyahu confirmed the report?    [Raz] No. He refused to discuss the issue and, in fact, has  neither denied nor confirmed the report.    [Yavin] Nonetheless, by holding the meeting and making it  public, Netanyahu is making a statement, is he not?    [Raz] Yes. I would say that Netanyahu is seeking to  somewhat improve his image. On the local political map, he is  considered a hawkish rightist. He hopes to convey the message:  If and when I become Israeli prime minister, I will work more  along the central lines of the Israeli political map. Netanyahu  is also trying to deliver a message on the domestic level. He  wants to appear as if he is representing the state. To date, he  has been an outspoken critic of the government's peace policy.  Quite a few of his associates have told him that he should seek  some way to somehow support some component of the peace process.  At the time, they discussed possible Likud support for the  agreement on Gaza; however, as will be recalled, after the Oslo  agreement was signed, Netanyahu attacked the entire agreement.  Therefore, I assume that one of the main motivations for this  meeting was an attempt to show his domestic audience that he is  acting like a statesman.    [Yavin] You said that Netanyahu briefed the prime minister.  Did he also brief the Likud members?    [Raz] The only ones in the Likud who know of it are the very  few who were involved in the contacts prior to the meeting, as  well as several to whom he reported about it.</p>

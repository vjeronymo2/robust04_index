China's National General Institute of Animal and Plant  Quarantine has recently agreed to the apple imports, provided  they meet a number of conditions.    It has signed an agreement with its counterpart in the  United  States on the hygiene conditions of the apples of Washington  state to be exported to China, and the conditions of the  orchards.    Under the agreement, the apples to be exported to China must  be produced in the area designated by the Chinese National  Animal and Plant Quarantine Institute. That area must be free  of the Mediterranean fruit fly. The fruit must be packed,  frozen and stored by designated factories after being strictly  quarantined by the U.S. quarantine institutes.    The fruit will have to meet the quarantine requirements of  China and must enter the country through designated ports. Only  after being quarantined by the Chinese quarantine institutes can  the fruit be put on sale in China.    Mediterranean fruit fly is destructive to fruit. So far,  China is free from the pest. But it has been found in some  parts of the United States, though not in Washington state.    In recent years, the demands of the Chinese market for  foreign fruit have kept growing.</p>

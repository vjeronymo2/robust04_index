			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Sport:  Left with the legend of Borotra and Hoad - Tennis It is one of life's hard lessons that nothing is for ever. In the past two weeks the lesson has been particularly hard to bear with the passing of two tennis legends who were both old friends. On the day when the 22-year-old American Pete Sampras was adding to his fame in this year's Wimbledon final, Lew Hoad, the great Australian champion of the mid-1950s, died aged 59 near his home in southern Spain following a short illness. Like Sampras, Hoad had successfully retained his Wimbledon title in 1957, the first post-war champion to do so. Since that day only Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Boris Becker - and now Sampras - have achieved the feat. Last Sunday, 450 of us, all friends of Lew, gathered with his wife Jenny, son Peter, and two daughters, Jane and Sally, to celebrate his life on the lawns of their Campo de Tenis in Fuengirola. Later that day, we heard that just across the French border, near Domaine de Pouy, his original home near Biarritz, Jean Borotra, the Bounding Basque of French tennis in the 1920s, had died, aged 95. These last few days, the camera shutter of memory has clicked constantly. There are vivid pictures of both men: Hoad smiting that mighty backhand to destroy Ashley Cooper 6-2 6-1 6-2 in the 1957 Wimbledon final, one of the shortest on record. Borotra, aged 51, leaping like a gazelle for a backhand volley on the old East Court at Queen's Club in 1949 to beat 27-year-old Geoff Paish for his 11th British covered court title. Hoad lifting an inebriated Roger Becker to his feet at the New Fitz Club in Bournemouth during the hard court championships of 1957 and carrying him out to his car with one strong arm. Borotra arriving late for a lunch of the International Club of Great Britain and going around the room kissing the hand of every woman present. Each man had that elusive quality, charisma, and each contributed greatly to the evolution of the game. Borotra, without much of a serve, showed what could be accomplished as a volleyer if you had fast enough feet, hands and reflexes - all qualities he had developed as a pelota player in his youth. He was also a master of match-play psychology - perhaps even the inspiration for Stephen Potter's marvellous works on Gamesmanship and Lifemanship. He would make a great show of donning the beret to rouse the crowd and would delight them by leaping into the lap of a pretty girl in the front row. He was always chivalrous and would applaud an opponent's good shots. At a change of ends Jean might say: '. . . well done] You are hitting your service so beautifully today - I've never seen you hit it better.' You would spend the next five minutes wondering what made the shot special and, hey presto, you had lost your serve. He had tremendous energy and enthusiasm. In the 1960s, when I was managing a British team at the French championships, Jean persuaded me to partner him in the doubles. He was well into his 60s and insisted that we limber up in the Bois de Boulogne prior to combat. Mercifully, we lost our first match and I was spared further torture. Jean was also a great patriot for whom the six years of French Davis Cup dominance, from 1927 to 1932, with his fellow Musketeers, Henri Cochet, Rene Lacoste and Jacques 'Toto' Brugnon, represented all that is best in sport. The comradeship of those days - all for one, one for all - never died. All four were dedicated to the ideals of the International Club of France, established in 1929, following the founding of the British Club five years earlier by Wallis Myers, a former international player who was then tennis correspondent of the Daily Telegraph. The two clubs have met twice a year since 1929 and Jean's incredible record of playing in every one of them until last November - 116 in all - is surely unique. Borotra inspired successive generations of French players and was there at the Davis Cup final in Lyon three years ago to see Yannick Noah's team of Guy Forget and Henri Leconte score their famous victory over the US, led by Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. He shed tears of joy at the end. Hoad, the forerunner of today's power players, had a tremendous physical presence on court that would often intimidate opponents, although he was actually a very shy man. With the blond good looks of a Robert Mitchum, Hoad was also immensely strong thanks to a training regimen that was unusually advanced for that era. With a powerful forearm and wrist he could hit the ball hard and early only because he possessed sound stroke production plus a natural ability to time the ball perfectly - essential qualities for success with a wooden racket that was 26in long, 1in shorter than the conventional frame. One shudders to think what devastation Hoad would have caused using a graphite frame. Hoad's first great performance came in the Davis Cup challenge round of 1953 against the US, played in Melbourne. Harry Hopman, the Australian captain, decided to blood the 'twins' Hoad and Ken Rosewall, who were both 19. The key to success lay in finding a way to beat the top American, Tony Trabert. On the opening day Trabert beat Rosewall and Hoad beat Vic Seixas. The Americans also took the doubles, so the fourth rubber, Hoad vs Trabert, would probably decide the tie. In a magnificent match, played in intermittent drizzle and with both men wearing spikes, Hoad won 7-5 in the fifth set. The next day Rosewall duly beat Seixas and the cup remained in Australia. Playing Hoad was an instructive experience. I had lost to him in the third round at Wimbledon that year and remember wondering why I was so slow. When you went to the net, the ball seemed to come at you just that bit faster than expected. Consequently, you were late on the volley. At the baseline the ball would bounce so close to the line that you always felt rushed. Three years later, Hoad made everyone look slow as he beat his old friend Rosewall to win the first of his two Wimbledon titles. Already the winner in Australia and France in 1956, Hoad needed to win the US title to achieve the grand slam, a feat accomplished only once before, by Don Budge in 1938. By a twist of fate it was Rosewall who beat him in the US final. Champions come and go but it will be a long time before we see two such great ones again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   The history of Japan's space development began with the  pencil rocket launching test conducted by the University of  Tokyo in 1955. In 1969 National Space Development Agency of  Japan (NASDA) was established.    Introducing U.S. technology, Japan developed the N-I rocket,  followed by the N-II and H-I rockets. At present, an H-II rocket  is under development designed solely with Japanese technology.  The H-II rocket will deliver four times more power than its  predecessor and will have a capability of launching a 2-ton  class geostationary satellite.    When complete, the new rocket will move Japan to a  world-class country in the field of space development. The  following are the outline and future outlook of the H-II rocket.  <H5>  Outline of H-II Rocket </H5> <H5>  1) Purpose of Development </H5>   The work on developing the H-II rocket (Fig. 1) started in  1986 with the purpose of providing this country with her own  world-level transport system and of promoting Japan's space  activities. Based on Japanese technology acquired through rocket  development and operation so far, the H-II rocket is designed to  meet broad demands for the launching of 2-ton class  geostationary satellites and other devices at an internationally  acceptable launching cost.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-31A>           Fig. 1. Comparison of H-II Rocket With World's Major Rockets </FIG>     <H5>  2) Structure and Specifications </H5>   The H-II rocket is a two-stage rocket with a high-power  rocket engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as  propulsion fuel and with an auxiliary engine in the form of a  large-sized solid rocket booster.    The basic model of the H-II rocket is designed for launching  a single geostationary triple-axis satellite. However, by  changing its structure, the rocket is also capable of launching  low- and medium-altitude satellites and multiple satellites. The  H-II rocket is a transport system that will have the capacity,  in the future, to meet a broad range of demands including the  launching of moon and planet surveyors.    The H-II rocket is of a simple two-stage formation but has a  vastly increased launching capability compared with Japan's past  rockets by improving the propulsion and other systems.    The first-stage engine is LE-7 (Fig. 2), a two-stage  combustion cycle type liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket  engine now under development based on the technology of H-I  rocket's second-stage engine, LE-5.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-32A>           Fig. 2. LE-7 Engine's System Chart </FIG>       The development of a system using the two-stage combustion  cycle method is difficult due to the high temperature and  pressure of combustion gas which are higher than those of the  gas generator method employed in the LE-5 engine. The new method  has been adopted practically only in U.S. space shuttles and the  former Soviet Union's Energia rocket.    The H-II rocket's second-stage engine is LE-5A, a liquid  oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine of expander breed cycle  type. The LE-5 adopted the gas generator method, but, for LE-5A,  the method was changed into a structurally simple expander breed  cycle system to gain improved functions and higher reliability.    Using LE-5A engine's re-ignition function, the H-II rocket  is  capable, in its second stage, of launching a satellite into a  transfer orbit toward a geostationary orbit.    The solid rocket booster, SRB, is unlike the solid auxiliary  rocket, SOB, adopted through the H-I rocket, a large-sized solid  motor now being newly developed using solid propulsion fuel of  composite type. The SRB has a movable nozzle for position  control.    The H-II rocket will be fitted with large-sized satellite  fairings of four and five meters in diameters, double the scale  of those of the H-I rocket, to meet the future demand for  large-sized satellites.    The guidance control of the H-II launcher will be of the  inertia guidance control type, similar to the one employed in  the H-II launcher, but the H-II attitude control method will  change from the H-I platform method to the strap down method.  <H5>  Development of H-II Rocket </H5>   The H-II rocket is being developed solely with Japanese  technology and the work of development has faced one  technological difficulty after another. It was particularly  difficult to develop the LE-7, the main first-stage engine. The  following are the outlines of the LE-7 engine.  <H5>  1) Current World Situation </H5>   Rocket engines use oil fuel, liquid hydrogen fuel, solid  fuel, etc.; among these, liquid hydrogen provides the highest  performance. However, the use of liquid hydrogen fuel involves  serious technological difficulties and only the United States,  the former Soviet Union, Japan and the European Space Agency  have successfully operated or developed engines with thrusts of  more than 100 tons.  <H5>  2) Technological Problems </H5>   Liquid hydrogen has an extremely low temperature of minus  253  degrees centigrade and liquid oxygen minus 183 degrees. If air  remains in the movable parts of the engine, lubricant oil  freezes, and the engine fails to operate fully.    The combustion temperature of the gas rises to 3,200 to  3,300  degrees centigrade, melting or burning ordinary metals.    Rocket engines show high performance as combustion pressure  is increased. To take advantage of this merit, the high-pressure  combustion method is employed, requiring the development of  high- pressure combustion technology and high-pressure turbo  pumps of large power to send propellant into the combustion  chambers under high pressure.    Thus, the development of a large-sized liquid oxygen or  hydrogen engine contains technological difficulties in handling  simultaneously the three factors of extremely low temperature,  extremely high temperature and extremely high pressure.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-33A>           Figure </FIG>    <H5>  3) Purposes of LE-7 Development </H5>   One of the purposes of developing the LE-7 engine is to  provide high-performance launch vehicles with large-sized liquid  oxygen/hydrogen engines to utilize space environment and send  explorers to nearby planets in the near future.    Another purpose is to establish liquid hydrogen technology  as  the fuel considered the best for the future scramjet, an air  inducting ultra-sonic speed combustion engine, which is to power  a single-stage rocket. Such a rocket is currently thought of as  the best space transport system in the next generation.  <H5>  4) Current Situation of LE-7 Development </H5>   The work to develop the LE-7 engine started simultaneously  with the development of the H-II rocket and is under way,  overcoming various technological difficulties. In November 1992,  the engine design was determined. Combustion tests, combining  the LE-7 engine with the first-stage rocket body, were held from  February through July 1993.    As a result, the development of the LE-7 engine is nearing  completion and the H-II rocket took a giant stride toward the  maiden flight in February 1, 1994.  <H5>  Future of H-II Rocket </H5> <H5>  1) H-II Rocket Launching Plans </H5>   The H-II rocket's test flight No. 1, TF No. 1, is scheduled  to be launched in February 1, 1994 and launching plans have  already been decided through the sixth test flight (The  launching schedule in Table 1 is as per the space development  plans decided on 15 March 1993).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-34A>           Table 1. Satellite Launching Schedule by H-II </FIG>        The TF No. 1 (scheduled for launch in 1 February 1994) is  planned to carry payloads for confirmation of functions (VEP)  and an Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX). The TF No. 2  (scheduled for launch in August-September, 1994) is to launch  the Engineering Test Satellite VI (ETS-VI), and the TF No. 3  (scheduled for launch in January-February, 1995) will launch the  Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS-5) and the Space  Flyer Unit (SFU).    The flight No. 4 (scheduled for launch in January-February,  1996) is to launch the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite  (ADEOS); the flight No. 5 (January-February 1997), the  Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite  (COMETS); the flight No. 6 (August-September 1997), the Tropical  Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Engineering Test  Satellite VII (ETS-VII).  <H5>  2) Future Plans </H5>   Studies are being made on H-II-derived rockets to meet  future  launching demands on the basis of the H-II development  technology, such as a plan to strengthen the capability of  launching payloads into low orbits.    Japan needs to develop its own space transport system to  supply and recollect commodities for the utilization of the  space environment. The research and development of the unmanned  winged shuttle HOPE (H-II Orbit Plane) has been conducted with  the target of first flight by the early 2000s. There is a plan  to use an H-II-derived rocket to launch HOPE.  <H5>  Postscript </H5>   The H-II rocket is thus Japan's mainstay launch vehicle in  the future and has broad potentials to meet various needs. When  this rocket is completed, Japan will be able to further  contribute to international cooperation in the field of space  development and make giant strides toward the construction of  space infrastructure.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES REPORTS FTC SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Traditional Industries in Agoura Hills said it settled a previously disclosed  dispute with the Federal Trade Commission over some of Traditional's sales  practices.  </P> <P> The company had denied any wrongdoing and said last week that "virtually all of  the terms of the settlement" involving changes in its sales practices already  have been made. It also said the FTC did not order Traditional to pay a fine,  but that Traditional had set up a $250,000 trust fund for possible refunds.  </P> <P> Traditional sells packages of cameras, film and other photographic and video  accessories directly to consumers, particularly newlyweds and new parents.  </P> <P> Among other things, the FTC objected to Traditional using the word custom to  advertise its picture enlargements when, in fact, some enlargements were simply  a standard blowup of a photograph, Traditional has said. The FTC also found  that some Traditional customers were not given a 3-day cancellation period  offered to other customers, the company reported.  </P> <P> The settlement is subject to approval by FTC commissioners.  </P></p>

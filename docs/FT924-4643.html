			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean group seeks joint venture partners CODELCO, THE state-owned Chilean copper corporation, is seeking joint ventures with mining multinationals to explore four of its mining prospects. Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's planning director, said he would invite 20 mining companies this week to study the projects on offer. Two are copper deposits in the Atacama desert, and two are gold prospects close to La Coipa and El Hueso, gold mines already in operation. Mr Bande said these were the first of several prospects Codelco wanted to explore as joint-ventures, following the passage of recent legislation that authorised the state-owned company to forge partnerships with the private sector. Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, owns about a third of the registered mining property in Chile. Its exploration work, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint-ventures as a way of tapping the vast mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own. 'We are opening a whole field of exploration that was previously closed to the private-sector mining industry,' Mr Bande said. 'It will also allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration ventures.' Mr Bande did not name the mining companies that had been selected to consider the first four mining prospects. He would only say that they were companies already established in Chile with active exploration projects. They are being invited to bid for risk contracts. Codelco will effectively be a sleeping partner: it will offer its mining properties, while the partner will be responsible for meeting the costs of exploration work. This, Mr Bande said, would give Codelco's partners the right to acquire a share of the mining property if the deposits were judged to be worthy of commercial exploitation. Several mining multinationals in Chile have expressed an interest in teaming up with Codelco for exploration work. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia, which operates the huge La Escondida copper mine in the Atacama desert, recently opened its offices for South America in Santiago. It has earmarked Dollars 3m a year for prospecting projects in Latin America, just under half of which will be spent in Chile. Mr Jose Cabello, BHP's explorations manager, said he hoped his company would be included in Codelco's list of potential partners. Placer Dome and Falconbridge of Canada are also locating their exploration headquarters for Latin America in Santiago, supporting Chile's claim to being the top country for mining exploration in the region.</p>

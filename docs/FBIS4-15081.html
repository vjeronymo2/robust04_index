			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Balyutskiy: "The Winner Was </F> Kaliningrad's Biggest Party -- the Electorate"]    [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast -- Compared with other regions  of Russia the elections in its Westernmost Oblast -- Kaliningrad  Oblast -- proceeded almost smoothly. They will have to be held  again in one of the 21 electoral districts. That is the  quantitative aspect, as they say.    As for the qualitative aspect, here there are only enigmas.  After all, today no one here can answer a seemingly simple  question like who, what political force, will call the tune in  the oblast duma? The actual ban on running on party lists and  the considerably simpler registration procedure for independent  deputies than for deputies from political parties and  associations (the former had to submit a protocol from a voters'  meeting in which at least 30 people took part!) have led to the  point where all elected deputies will represent themselves. Nor  have the bureaucrats had any luck. Even Kaliningrad Mayor V.  Shipov lost his round to the doctor G. Petrachenko.    Indifference was the dominant feeling among the Kaliningrad  people. That is borne out by the number of those who came to  vote -- two-thirds of the voters registered on the lists stayed  at home that day.</p>

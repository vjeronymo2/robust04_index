			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Data From Boeing Model 737's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that the FAA consider data from Boeing Model 737  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, in conjunction with data from Boeing Model 727 airplanes, when reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests to extend the leak check interval. The FAA points out that, even though the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design of the Model 727 and Model 737 are not similar in many aspects, the functioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the lavatory drain systems on both models may be similar due to the similarity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardware used. Therefore, the FAA will consider data from similar drain systems of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different airplane models when reviewing requests received to extend leak check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals; however, in accordance with the data gathering requirements of paragraph (c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this final rule, any data submitted must reflect which airplanes and which drain valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data represent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Boeing Specifications vs. Brand Name Valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised so that affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardware is identified by Boeing Specification number, rather than by vendor part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers. These commenters are concerned that certain parts may not qualify for longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection intervals because they have dash numbers not called out specifically in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. They consider that this is not only confusing, but inequitable, since many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later hardware configurations will fall into the ``any other type valve'' category that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for a leak check interval of only 400 flight hours. The commenters consider that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting ``alternative methods of compliance'' will become the norm, unless the rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to refer to hardware specification numbers. One commenter, a manufacturer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves, is concerned that it will be unable to market its equipment because the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule provides no performance standards under which its valves can qualify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand one commenter objects to the FAA's statement in the preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the supplemental NPRM that indicated, ``*&blank;*&blank;* One of the factors that the FAA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider in approving alternative valve designs is whether the valve meets Boeing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specification S417T105 or 10&hyph;62213.'' This commenter interprets the phrase to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for Boeing approval of any alternative valve only to the Boeing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenters' requests to call out valves by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing specification only. Boeing specifications were not referenced in this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the FAA does not consider it appropriate for Boeing to screen and potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapprove, for purposes of this AD, alternative valves that may not qualify to Boeing's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications. This would have the effect of delegating to Boeing, through its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification qualification procedure, the authority to approve or disapprove alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of compliance with this AD. Approval under a Boeing specification is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for a valve design under this rule; it is only a factor to be considered. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors may be taken into account as well, such as having extensive service history data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review and approval of alternative valve designs is a function of the FAA through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alternative methods of compliance'' procedures provided by paragraph (f) of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The wording of the NOTE 7 following paragraph (f) of the final rule has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Qualifying For 1,000 Flight Hour Leak Check Interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several operators request that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would allow any service panel drain valve, manufactured by any manufacturer, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become qualified for the 1,000-flight hour leak check interval. These commenters state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, by restricting the 1,000-flight hour interval to only certain brand name valves, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA restricts competition that could lead eventually to the development of better valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not agree that the 1,000 flight hour leak check interval should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed unequivocally for all service panel drain valves. Current service history data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate that some valves are more reliable than others; those valves that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated such reliability in service so far are the valves identified (by brand name) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule. The FAA does not consider that a design review and qualification test are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to determine how well a valve will perform in actual service. This has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly demonstrated by the history of this specific AD action: the installation of any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several valves was designated previously as terminating action for the required leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check, but those valves were later found to be subject to leakage. However, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does agree that requirements for service history data should not be so rigid as to preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition by valve manufacturers with new designs. Therefore, the FAA will consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests for inclusion in the 1,000-flight hour leak check category any valve for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the design, qualification test, and service history data are provided. The request should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include an analysis of known failure modes for the valve and failure modes of similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves; an explanation should be included as to how the design features of the valve will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude these failure modes. Also included should be the results of qualification tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and service history data covering approximately 25,000 flight hours or 25,000 flight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycles (including a winter season), collected in accordance with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c) of the final rule, or a similar program. The final rule has been revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a new NOTE 7 to specify the request for this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

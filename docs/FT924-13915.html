			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Deadline on VAT change nears HUNDREDS of thousands of companies throughout Europe must urgently complete radical changes in the way they handle value added tax if they are to meet the January 1 deadline for creation of the European single market. Many companies will not have enough time to modify internal information systems and alter computer systems, tax specialists said. They may be forced to carry out large numbers of VAT calculations manually, hire scarce information technology consultants or employ external computer bureaux at extra cost. The new VAT rules have been devised to take account of the abolition of border controls which will mean that customs officers will no longer monitor shipments at border posts. The responsibility for reporting VAT liability and recording trade statistics will be shifted to companies themselves. The new rules are intended as a first step in a move from levying VAT on imports to imposing the tax on exports. The change-over is due to be completed in 1997. It affects only trade between European Community member states so businesses dealing with other countries will have to operate two sets of VAT procedures. Accountants report considerable resistance from many of their clients to making preparations for the VAT changes. Part of the reluctance stems from the fact that the new EC legislation has not been finalised and last-minute changes may still be made. Business organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors in the UK, the French Patronat and the German employers' association, BDI, are concerned that the new VAT rules will impose a heavy bureaucratic burden on business with few corresponding benefits. 'It is a horribly complex system,' said Mr Adrian Ogley, a tax specialist at the CBI. 'Tax is not glamorous politically so it has been left to the administrators from the 12 member states and business has not had much input.' The abolition of border tax controls is expected to lead to savings of up to Pounds 10bn, according to one estimate. But business organisations fear that much of this will be offset by the costs of adjusting to the new VAT regulations. Details, Page 15 Editorial Comment, Page 20</p>

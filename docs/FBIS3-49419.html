			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Apostolov: "Bulgaria Relegated to </F> Third Echelon"]    [Text] The meeting of the Visegrad Four in Warsaw produced  an unexpected but not surprising result -- the Four became a  "Three Plus One."    The Czech Republic decided to act alone on its admission to  NATO after it realized that Moscow would hardly lift its veto  over the admission of its close neighbors, such as Poland, to  the North Atlantic Organization. It is very possible that  Hungary would follow the Czech example. On the other hand,  Slovakia, just like Poland, is not one of the favorites, because  of its weaker economic development.    Against the background of those developments the Czech  Republic and Hungary form the first echelon of the candidates,  Slovakia and Poland the second, while the other East European  countries, outside the Visegrad four, will naturally remain in  the third position. The irony of this development is that the  new U.S. diplomatic vocabulary appeared to be completely  opposite to the reality. Justifying its retreat from the  previously expressed readiness to expand NATO toward the East,  Washington adopted the "avoiding a new division in Europe"  expression. Under this euphemism one understands an  unwillingness to admit to NATO the East European states that are  close to Russia in order to not isolate Moscow. However, in  practice this attitude led toward two new divisions. In  addition to the old division into East and Central Europe, now  there is a "first central group" -- the Czech Republic and  Hungary, and a "second central group" -- Slovakia and Poland.    For the time being Bulgaria is in the third echelon.  However, while the Bulgarian politicians continue to place  their bets on the group principle, which has already failed,  possible new divisions are possible, which will push Bulgaria  even more toward the back of the line.</p>

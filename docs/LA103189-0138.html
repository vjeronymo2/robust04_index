			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> FIRE IN IRVINE QUICKLY CONTROLLED  </P> <P> Orange County fire officials credited a properly working ventilation system at  an Irvine manufacturing plant for the rapid control of a fire early today that  broke out in air pollution-control equipment.  </P> <P> Hazardous materials specialists were called to Holt Integrated Circuits on  Jeronimo Road in Irvine because the company uses acids and other potent  chemicals in the manufacturing process. The fire was confined and extinguished  after it broke out about 4:30 a.m. without ever endangering the chemicals. The  fire was controlled within half an hour because ventilators worked as designed  and stopped the flow of oxygen to the fire, extinguishing the flames, said Fire  Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha  </P> <P> Mike Garner, vice president of the company, said the fire was confined to an  air pollution-control device on the roof that cleans gases from the  manufacturing process before they are released into the atmosphere. He said the  hazardous chemicals are stored in a different section of the building.  </P></p>

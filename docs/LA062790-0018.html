			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRIDAY IS PROCLAIMED 'NELSON MANDELA DAY'  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to welcome Nelson Mandela with a  day in his honor, but one board member called on the black South African leader  to repudiate his support of Yasser Arafat, Moammar Kadafi and Fidel Castro.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich blamed the three leaders for much of the "bloodshed"  in the Middle East and Africa, and urged the African National Congress leader  to distance himself from them.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who introduced the motion, told Antonovich that  Mandela has repeatedly explained his support of the Palestinian, Libyan and  Cuban leaders. Mandela has noted that they supported the ANC at a time when few  leaders in the world would.  </P> <P> Despite the debate, the board voted to proclaim Friday -- when Mandela visits  Los Angeles -- "Nelson Mandela Day."  </P></p>

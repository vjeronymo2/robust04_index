			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Alexandra leaps to more than Pounds 2m ALEXANDRA Workwear, the uniform supplier, announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 672,000 to Pounds 2.01m for the 28 weeks to August 14. Earnings per share rose to 4p (1.3p). The directors declared an interim dividend of 2.1p (1.8p) on the back of improving trading results and continued reduction in borrowings. Turnover rose to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 30.9m) as the mix of business changed. Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said: 'A year ago we were in a position of undertaking strategic sales giving very low margins, but keeping the factories going and allowing us to reduce stocks to levels commensurate with activity.' Stocks had now fallen and sales had increased on the back of higher turnover in the core business - stockback service to small businesses that require a 24 or 48 hour delivery. Towards the end of the first half Alexandra opened new shops in Hanley, Northampton and Solihull as well as relocating an existing shop in Croydon. Further sites are being considered, the company said. 'All areas of the group have contributed to the results, which have been achieved through greater efficiency and a better sales mix despite their being no fundamental improvement in trading conditions,' said Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman. He said there had been some signs of increased retail activity and the company has resumed its retail investment programme: 'We look forward with confidence to the second half of the year where so far all areas of the group are maintaining their first-half performance.' Borrowings fell to Pounds 7.59m (Pounds 13.5m) at the half-way stage and the company anticipates further falls by the year-end. Interest charges declined to Pounds 463,000 (Pounds 1.09m). The company had Pounds 7.3m in bank loans and overdrafts as well as Pounds 289,000 in hire purchase contracts. Gearing fell to 34 per cent compared with 46 per cent in the comparative period.</p>

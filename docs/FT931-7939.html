			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: The servant of parliament Sir, Your report, 'Watchdog to probe complaints against taxman' (February 19) contains one error which needs to be corrected. You said: 'The Revenue received 15,000 complaints last year, of which 100 were referred to the government's ombudsman. Yesterday it said it expected the adjudicator to handle 20 to 50 complaints a month.' I am certainly not the government's ombudsman. I serve parliament and the results of my investigations were rightly described by Mr Francis Maude, when financial secretary to the treasury, as not always comfortable to the government. The new Revenue adjudicator will, I hope, be able to sort out many complaints between taxpayers and the Revenue, but he is to be appointed by the board of Inland Revenue. While this latest initiative is welcome, it will still be open to dissatisfied taxpayers to ask members of parliament to refer their grievances to the parliamentary ombudsman. William Reid, parliamentary commissioner for administration, Church House, Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BW</p>

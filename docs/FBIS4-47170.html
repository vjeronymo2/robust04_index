			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "Government Protects Food </F> Producers: Schedule of Customs Duties in Ukraine"]    [Text] The Ukrainian government has decided to  protect its national food producers from competition stemming  from imported products. In accordance with a decision  promulgated yesterday, import duties are being raised by several  orders of magnitude on virtually all basic food products,  including alcoholic beverages. The reasoning behind this action  by the Ukrainian government turned out to be analogous to that  taken by the Russian government. But whereas in Russia the  introduction of the increased import duties was postponed until  1 July, in Ukraine they have already gone into effect.    No matter how strange it may seem, the decision to introduce  prohibitive import duties on food products was adopted at  precisely the same time that the Ukrainian government officially  announced that the decline of agricultural product output was  continuing in this republic. (It is curiously interesting that  two years ago, when the decline of production volumes in the  agrarian sector was not so clearly expressed, decisions were  taken on restricting the export of food products in order to  protect the national consumer). Nevertheless, in accordance with  the government's decision, the import duties on liquor-and-vodka  items--as well as on drinking alcohol--rose from 50 to 350  percent of the contractual value, on chocolate--from 10 to 100  percent, on boiled sausage--from 20 to 100 percent, on meat and  meat products--from 10 to 50 percent, and on sunflower-seed  oil--from 20 to 60 percent.    It is very evident that in the case at hand the government  is  pursuing purely fiscal goals--those connected with the critical  condition of the Ukrainian budget. However, as some independent  Ukrainian economists have conjectured, this measure will not  exert any tangible influence on budgetary revenues. This is  connected with the fact that the production cost of Ukrainian  agricultural output is significantly lower than the analogous  Russian output, as well as that being imported from beyond the  borders of the CIS. And so one can hardly count on the fact that  import volumes--and, correspondingly, the revenues collected  from levying customs duties--will increase. Furthermore, in the  CIS countries methods have been approved for quite some time now  for avoiding the payment of customs duties so that traditional  importers do not turn out to be losers as a result.    The adoption of the present government decision,  undoubtedly,  would not have taken place without powerful pressure being  exerted by the national producers of agricultural output (as  likewise occurred in Russia at the time when the new import  duties were approved). Ukrainian agrarians view the rise in  import duties, on the one hand, as a possibility for increasing  the sales of their products in the domestic market and--on the  other hand (with the increase in prices on imported goods) as a  possibility for sharply increasing the prices on food items  being produced at Ukraine's enterprises. In any case, as a  result of the increased duties, there will be a further upsurge  of inflation--something which is already making the transition  to hyperinflation. However, this governmental step could also  have a positive effect--an improvement in the supply of  Ukraine's major industrial centers with their own, domestically  produced food items, as well as an increase in their export  beyond the borders of the republic--first and foremost, to  Russia.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Rates for Ukrainian Import Duties in Comparision With Presently Existing |  |Russian Rates                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item                     |Customs Duties (as a percentage)                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Ukraine                  |Russia                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ethyl Alcohol            |350                      |150                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chocolate                |100                      |30                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Meat and Meat Products   |50                       |Duty-Free                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Boiled Sausages          |100                      |Duty-Free                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vegetable Oil            |60                       |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Eni set to restructure foreign unit ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals concern implicated in Italy's political corruption scandal, plans to rationalise its network of foreign subsidiaries. The aim is to improve transparency and accountability at the group, which had sales of L50,883bn (Dollars 32bn) in 1991 and 209 subsidiaries registered abroad. The Eni group comprises the parent company and 12 main subsidiaries, all but one of which, Eni International Holding, are based in Italy. The biggest subsidiaries in terms of sales are Snam, involved in gas supply and distribution; EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals concern; Agip, the upstream oil and gas operation; and Agip Petroli, which handles the downstream side of the oil business. While Eni International Holding, a purely financial operation, has four subsidiaries, all abroad, Eni's other big subsidiaries have many of their operations registered outside Italy. Agip Petroli and EniChem together have around 60 non-Italian companies, while Agip has 30 subsidiaries registered abroad. Among the most common locations are financial centres or tax havens such as Geneva and Jersey. Details of the streamlining are still vague, but the changes are expected principally to affect the Eni group's financial subsidiaries or holding companies, rather than trading or sales operations. Eni has become a focal point for investigations into political corruption and illegal financing of Italy's main political parties. Illegal payments to politicians and kickbacks on big contracts have allegedly been channeled through Eni's foreign operations.</p>

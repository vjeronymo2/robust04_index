			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Great excitement in the Socialist Party: Michel  Rocard found himself in the minority and resigned as first  secretary. Things were not dragged out, since Henri Emmanuelli  was elected first secretary of the Socialist Party ad interim.  [passage omitted]    The departure of Michel Rocard has opened up a new crisis in  the Socialist Party. In order to overcome it as soon as  possible, the National Council this evening elected Henri  Emmanuelli first secretary, but in an acting capacity, until the  next congress, which will be held in the autumn. Henri  Emmanuelli, aged 49, is the former speaker of the National  Assembly. In his first statement he paid tribute to Michel  Rocard:    [Begin Emmanuelli recording] I should like, first of all, to  praise the way in which Michel Rocard, the outgoing first  secretary of the Socialist Party, has faced up with dignity to  this day, which has passed off calmly, in a relative mood of  fraternity -- I say relative because, when people are separated  by the way they vote, there is always a degree of antagonism,  but it has been calm.    To the activists I say that I hope that from now on we will  be able to act in such a way as to recover the confidence of the  men and women of the Left, who over these past months, sometimes  over these past years, have felt that the Socialist Party was  either not speaking out for their interests, or not speaking out  for their hopes.

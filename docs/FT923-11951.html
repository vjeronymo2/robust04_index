			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Endowment Trust fully subscribed KLEINWORT Endowment Policy Trust, an investment trust investing in unmatured endowment policies, was fully subscribed and raised more than Pounds 30m at launch, it was announced yesterday. The maximum size for the trust had been set at Pounds 30m due to worries about the total supply of suitable policies in the UK. Institutions had taken Pounds 22.5m in a placing, leaving the balance for private investors and intermediaries. Applications were received for ordinary shares worth Pounds 7.88m. Applicants for up to 250,000 ordinary shares have been accepted in full, while applicants for more than that number shares will receive 70.77 per cent of the total for which they applied. The launch goes against the recent trend for unsuccessful new issues, although this was partly because the trust's investment policy was regarded as being unusually conservative. Mr Ben Siddons, chairman of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trust Management, said he was 'delighted' by the level of response, and added: 'We are very pleased to see that the majority of the money has come from stockbrokers, intermediaries and the public.' Share certificates will be posted on Friday, July 24, and dealings in the shares are expected to start on Monday, July 27.</p>

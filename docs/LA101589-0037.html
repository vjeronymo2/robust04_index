			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: SWEATERS BY HAND: DESIGNS FOR SPINNERS AND KNITTERS BY HELENE RUSH  AND RACHAEL EMMONS, (INTERWEAVE PRESS; 1988)  </P> <P> RACHAEL EMMONS IS a spinner who knits, Helene Rush knits and is learning to  spin, and together these two Portland, Me., women have created a beautiful and  useful book -- even for those who don't spin their own yarns. Each sweater  design (some simple, some lush, using all kinds of yarns from silk and mohair  to sturdy wool) comes with spinning, dyeing and knitting instructions, complete  with suggestions for modifications. Because hand-spun yarns don't always  conform to commercial yarn weights, the authors give commercial equivalents for  those of us who don't spin. But here is fair warning: After absorbing this  book, I'm seriously considering buying a spinning wheel. Of course, the sofa  will have to go. ($17.95) Judith Sims  </P></p>

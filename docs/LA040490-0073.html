			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL PLAYOFF PREVIEW;  </P> <P> STRUGGLING OILERS OPEN AGAINST JETS  </P> <P> A year ago, after winning four Stanley Cups in five seasons, the Edmonton  Oilers had to learn to live without Wayne Gretzky, who led them to the titles.  </P> <P> They did all right in the regular season, but when they faced Gretzky and the  Kings, they were knocked out in the first round.  </P> <P> Until about a month ago, the Oilers, although they played much of the season  without goaltender Grant Fuhr, one of the best, appeared to be a legitimate  contender for the Cup again.  </P> <P> As they open the NHL playoffs tonight at Edmonton against the Winnipeg Jets in  the first of the best-of-seven series, the Oilers are again without Fuhr and  are below their February peak. Fuhr reinjured his shoulder Friday and may not  be available for the opener.  </P> <P> And backup netminder Billy Ranford, who played well in the middle of the  season, has tailed off.  </P> <P> However, they figure to get to the division final against either the Kings or  the defending champion Calgary Flames because the Jets are not accustomed to  winning playoff games, especially against the Oilers.  </P> <P> The Jets were one of only five teams who did not make the playoffs last spring.  They have qualified for postseason play seven times, but have won only two  series.  </P> <P> Usually they wind up playing the Oilers. In 19 playoff games against Edmonton,  the Jets have won only once.  </P> <P> First-year coach Bob Murdoch, a longtime defenseman for the Kings, has done a  remarkable job with the Jets. But they lost all four games at Edmonton this  season.  </P> <P> The other games tonight involve the Norris Division teams. The Chicago  Blackhawks, who won the division, open at home against Minnesota and Toronto  plays at St. Louis.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks and North Stars figure on a brawling series. They had  free-for-alls in several games this season. The Maple Leafs finished below the  Blues, but hammered them, 7-1, during the season.  </P> <P> The Boston Bruins, the lukewarm favorite to win it all after being the only  team to earn 100 points, play Thursday night at home against Hartford. The  Whalers have a 2-1-1 record at Boston.  </P> <P> In other openers Thursday, the Rangers and Islanders play in New York, New  Jersey faces Washington and Montreal meets Buffalo.

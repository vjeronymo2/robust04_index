			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears for US cotton harvest as torrential rain continues A deluge has been keeping the cotton farmers of the Mississippi Delta indoors and driving futures prices to their highest levels in years. In Northern Louisiana, the rain has flooded thousands of homes and farm acres. Some residents have been driven from their homes and others are living without clean running water. The Delta last year produced 4.9m bales of cotton. The forecast this year was for 6.1m bales, but as the rain has continued, that estimate has been slipping. Usually one-half to three-quarters of the 1.5m acres of cotton lands are planted by this time in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Georgia. In one Mississippi county, Coahoma, only 4 per cent of the 96,000 acres has been sown so far. Any planting after May 20 is considered late, according to Mr Terry Townsend, a spokesman for the International Cotton Advisory Committee in Washington. American cotton requires 140 to 160 days of warmth before harvest, or yields are considerably reduced. 'Even if it stopped raining today, it could take a week to dry out,' Mr Townsend said. 'But the forecast is for additional rain this weekend. There is some talk that the crop won't get planted until the last week of May or the first week of June.' Problems could arise if the harvest runs into the middle of October, when the rains generally begin again. At that point, the quality may deteriorate. With stocks at their lowest point in decades, the New York futures prices have been jumping both on weather concerns and continued strong demand. The May contract closed on Wednesday at 92.2 cents, up about 10 cents from a month ago. Concern has also focussed on California, which last year produced 2.8m bales. An early drought lowered the forecast for this year to 2m bales. Now continued cool weather has depressed that estimate.</p>

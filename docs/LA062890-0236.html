			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FBI VIDEOTAPE SHOWS BARRY SMOKING CRACK  </P> <P> Federal officials today released a videotape showing Mayor Marion Barry smoking  a substance alleged to be crack cocaine the night of his arrest in an FBI sting  operation.  </P> <P> The tape was released at the U.S. District Courthouse at the same time it was  to be shown to jurors in Barry's drug and perjury trial.  </P> <P> FBI cameras hidden in a downtown hotel room recorded Barry's visit to the room  of a longtime friend, Rasheeda Moore, on Jan. 18.  </P> <P> The fuzzy tape shows Barry inhaling twice from a pipe, and a few moments later,  FBI agents bursting into the room and telling him he was under arrest.  </P> <P> "I didn't do anything," Barry said, uttering a string of expletives in Moore's  direction. "I've been set up."  </P> <P> The tape shows Barry initially expressed reluctance to inhale unless Moore did  so first -- a potentially important development in view of his defense claims  that he was the victim of government entrapment.  </P> <P> Barry looked at the substance and then said, "I don't know."  </P> <P> Moore: "You do it."  </P> <P> Barry: "No."  </P> <P> At one point Barry said "How does this work?" and Moore responded, "What?"  </P> <P> A few moments later, he inhaled and then appeared momentarily wobbly.  </P> <P> Moore, who was cooperating with the government sting, asked if he was all  right.  </P> <P> The tape was aired after a morning of testimony by Moore about the events of  the night.  </P> <P> Moore said the mayor was "uncomfortable" with visiting her in her room.  </P> <P> "There are too many nosy rosies around," Barry complained in a phone call to  Moore shortly before his arrival. That call and others were recorded by agents  and played for the jury today.  </P> <P> Moore testified that she was surprised when Barry said he did not know how to  use the crack pipe that she gave him after he arrived in the room.  </P> <P> "What do you mean? You've used that a lot," Moore said she told Barry. Barry's  attorney has portrayed the mayor as a reluctant, inexperienced drug user in  recounting Barry's version of the night.  </P></p>

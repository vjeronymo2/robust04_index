The first was on Sunday. The second came  yesterday morning around 0930. The last farewell had not been  announced, and instead, it was chaotic, brief, and unpleasant.    A total of 34 former soldiers of the Movement for the  Defense  of National Sovereignty (MDSN) trespassed into the gardens of  the Italian Embassy to demand the fulfillment of the agreements  signed in October in exchange for their demobilization.    These agreements include the delivery of 240 Italian  packages  (construction materials valued at $500 per package), food  packages (each valued at $80), and 3,000 cordobas for each rifle  turned in.    According to the former soldiers, some of whom were involved  in last September's kidnapping of UNO's [National Opposition  Union] top leaders, some former soldiers were told they would be  "attended to" first and, after that, the rest.    One of the former soldiers standing near the Montoya  monument  said: "None of the three things promised have been given to any  of us. They said that one month after our demobilization, which  occurred in October, they would give us a response... but as of  now, we have not received anything."    Violet Chamorro's government also promised them a 3,000  manzana security zone... "but we have received nothing up until  today," said one of the group's spokesmen. "Instead, they  evicted us from San Cristobal, where we had begun planing....  Those crops are now lost."    At 1040, after a brief discussion with Subcommander Manuel  Ledezma, head of patrols in Managua, only one negotiating  commission remained at the embassy. The demobilized soldiers  remained standing outside the embassy in the scorching Lenten  sun.    The Cenidh [Nicaraguan Human Rights Center], from which the  former soldiers sought mediation, rejected the soldiers' actions  as being illegal, although Cenidh considered their demands fair.  Cenidh Director Vilma Nunez said she understood their  frustration, especially taking into account the manner in which  the government is now negotiating with El Chacal [3-80 Northern  Front rebel leader Jose Angel Talavera].    At approximately 1330, after negotiators Edwin Gomez,  Fidencio Duarte, and two Italian Embassy officials returned to  the Special Disarmament Brigades [BED] Headquarters, an  agreement was announced: "We will meet at BED Headquarters on  Tuesday at 1000 to discuss the timetable for commitments to be  met."    The atmosphere was bittersweet. One of the men, angered and  frustrated, said: "If this time they fail to keep their  promises, we will return to the mountains, and then they will  have to fulfill the commitments."</p>

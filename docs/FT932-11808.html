			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (8): British addiction has gradually spread - Company Cars / Europe The finance director at a large US group's European headquarters in Brussels for years resisted all entreaties by middle managers to introduce a company car scheme. The finance man was an American and he carried with him American attitudes. Companies in the US usually allocate company cars to only a handful of top executives, for status reasons, and to sales people when they need them. Eventually the finance director was promoted and replaced by an Englishman. One of the first changes he made was to find a suitable company car scheme for middle managers. Almost certainly the new finance director had a personal interest. He would have had long experience of the benefits that company car provision can bring to an executive - benefits which would be just as valuable in Brussels as in London. He would have enjoyed the hassle-free aspects of company car ownership which most managers believe more than makes up for the tax they have to pay on the notional value of this perk. This is an illustration of how the UK addiction to the perk company car has gradually spread through the rest of Europe. The virus took hold in the UK for good reasons. During the 1960s and early 1970s there were periods of pay 'freezes' and continuous high personal taxation. Companies had to find ways other than salary increases to capture and retain skilled managers. Before long, even relatively junior members of the management team were allocated company cars. The UK government in recent years has been attempting to reduce the burden of personal taxation and, to even the balance, has pushed up substantially the tax on perk cars, arguing that companies no longer have to use this benefit as an incentive. But, despite the government's determination and even in the depths of the deepest recession the UK has witnessed since the Second World War, very few companies have made big cuts to their car schemes. Meanwhile, the concept has been growing more and more popular in other European countries. Executives all over Europe now enjoy having 'wheels' supplied and maintained by their companies. The trend was certainly encouraged by the speed in which perk car provision accelerated in the UK. Many international companies have their European headquarters in the UK, so their executives picked up the habit there. As the Brussels example quoted above goes to show, UK executives at multinational corporations carried the concept with them when sent to other parts of Europe. The spread of the virus has also been helped by the fact that company car provision policies are not usually decided at the centre in large corporations but are left to local management to sort out. Tax authorities all over Europe now take account of the perk car as a matter of course and executives pay tax on the notional benefit one way or another. According to Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt at Monks Partnership, the UK-based remuneration consultants, the tax rate is usually based on between 20 and 25 per cent of the capital cost of the car. Since the recent UK Budget, Britain is now coming into line with this concept. Monks recently looked at 7,600 posts in 1,342 organisations in Europe and found that a car was included in the remuneration package of most senior managers in all countries except Switzerland. In that country there are good tax reasons why only just over half the senior managers have company cars. Mr Vernon-Harcourt stresses, however, that tax is by no means the prime consideration when senior managers are considering their company car policies. The status of individual managers and 'competitive practice' (the fact that other companies are offering this benefit) are more important in the decision. The Monks research showed that the general manager of a subsidiary of a multinational business is virtually assured of a company car wherever he might be positioned in Europe. The number of companies offering this benefit ranged from 98 per cent in Spain and Belgium - both beating the UK's 97 per cent - to 83 per cent in Denmark and the Netherlands and 68 per cent in Switzerland. The pattern was very similar for directors responsible for a leading function such as finance, sales or production and ranged from 100 per cent in Ireland and 97 per cent in Germany to 65 per cent in Sweden and 56 per cent in Switzerland. Policies begin to diverge in Europe when it comes to allocating company cars to less-senior managers, such as the chief accountant reporting to the finance director or the sales manager reporting to the sales director. Monks' Management Remuneration in Europe Survey shows that in some countries, such as the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, the incidence of car allocation at this level of management remains high - at about 80 per cent - whereas it falls to about 65 per cent of similar posts in Italy and France and below 40 per cent in Denmark, Spain and Switzerland. Undoubtedly there is great reluctance in some countries to allocating perk cars below board level. The car as a necessity is another matter and Monks found that in France and Italy a manager below board level was more likely to be allocated a company car if employed in sales and marketing rather than in accounting. Because a perk car is supposed to be an incentive to join and remain with a company, in the UK the concept of the user-chooser has also taken hold: the executive, or the sales person, can select a car from a list offered by the company. Monks estimates that only 2 per cent of UK companies do not offer this benefit to directors and only 12 per cent do not offer it to sales people. On the other hand, half the companies in Austria do not even give directors a choice and 70 per cent do not offer a choice to sales representatives. Germany follows the middle road, with 30 per cent of companies not offering directors any choice of company car and 26 per cent not offering sales people a choice. Monks also attempted to discover differences in the cost of cars allocated to various managers in European countries compared with the cost of those used by sales representatives. Comparisons between countries are difficult to make because of shifting currency alignments, but it is clear that in the Scandinavian countries the sales person's car is often nearly as good as the one offered as a perk to managers. 'The question is,' says Mr Vernon-Harcourt, 'does this reflect the fact that Scandinavian sales reps have to travel long distances, often in poor weather conditions and have to have cars as good as managers, or does it simply reflect Scandinavian egalitarianism?'</p>

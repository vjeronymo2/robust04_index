			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS OF HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Nowhere does Mathews suggest that L.A. County's film industry earns, in our  time of industrial humiliation, an enormous favorable balance of trade for the  United States.  </P> <P> Films have done so for decades, without one nickel of government subsidy.  </P> <P> He also omits the huge incomes that films bring to Los Angeles -- all without  polluting underground water or the coastline.  </P> <P> A survey of the print industry would disclose Byzantine plotting that destroys  publishing empires and other excesses.  </P> <P> Calendar's peek under the skirts of movie production is more like a "Cinema  Vice" TV episode than a balanced report.  </P> <P> JULIAN BUD LESSER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Companies seeking domicile overseas  -Corporate Exodus AS HONG KONG people head overseas in search of a foreign passport, Hong Kong companies are also looking abroad for their own type of 'insurance policy'. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Jardine Matheson and, two of the best-known companies in Hong Kong, have announced plans to distance themselves from Hong Kong. Other companies are moving legal domicile, applying for overseas listings and investing overseas. These measures combine a desire to protect overseas assets with a natural diversification in search of new investment opportunities. A total of 68 of Hong Kong's 306 listed companies have switched domicile to places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Taking into account companies now planning to move, bankers estimate that a third of Hong Kong's stock market will soon be domiciled overseas. Hongkong Bank's decision last December to set up a new holding company in London was the most significant switch of domicile since Jardine started the flow in 1984 and went to Bermuda. Hongkong Bank said it was moving to reassure customers and banking partners worried about 1997. Jardine Matheson, controlled from London by Mr Henry Keswick, is asking Hong Kong to create a special category of 'exempt listings' for big international companies. This would allow Jardine's shares to be traded in Hong Kong, where they account for about 10 per cent of market turnover, while transferring regulation of the company to London. The proposal is being studied by the Securities and Futures Commission who will release a public consultation paper on the subject in June or July. One problem is that London's takeover code does not extend to foreign incorporated companies. Jardine's proposal has been criticised by Legislative Councillors who accused the company of seeking special privileges and trying to avoid takeover rules in London and Hong Kong. No one knows how many companies could follow Jardine and switch their primary listing overseas. But the proposal is important. If Jardine was granted exemptions from some Hong Kong regulations, for example the takeover code, smaller companies would press for similar exemptions and this could undermine Hong Kong's reputation. Other companies have sought overseas listings to raise capital and attract new shareholders. A stronger Hong Kong's stock market this year allowed five companies to launch rights issues in the first quarter, compared to two in the same period last year and 10 in the first quarter of 1989. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's volatility and low overall ratings are pressuring some companies to go overseas - 'the likelihood of Hong Kong being an international financial centre after 1997 is remote and that affects its stock market,' says Stephen Clark, director of Anglo Chinese Corporate Finance. Gold Peak Industries, an electronics manufacturer, last year listed its battery division on the Singapore stock market. The Singapore company is now trading on a price earnings multiple of 18 times, compared to the holding company's 8.3 times in Hong Kong. Video Technology, which claims more than 50 per cent of the US market for electronic learning aids, last year delisted from Hong Kong and is now planning a listing in London, New York or Singapore - 'the delisting was a purely a money decision. The price quoted in Hong Kong was undervalued,' according to Mr William Ho, managing director. These companies have been able to go overseas because they have foreign markets and their own brand names. But most Hong Kong manufacturers make products under contract for foreign companies. They would gain little from a foreign listing because their shares would still likely be rated on a Hong Kong multiple. Other companies with most of their assets in Hong Kong, such as local banks, utilities and property companies, would still be treated as Hong Kong companies if they listed overseas. Bankers agree the majority of Hong Kong companies therefore have to stay in the colony. Although public listed companies will stay in Hong Kong, private money is flowing overseas. Hong Kong Chinese have traditionally diversified their wealth outside Hong Kong. The process has been accelerated by the brain drain. According to some estimates, based on information from destination countries, more than HKDollars 50bn is being invested overseas each year by emigrants. The corporate exodus has co-incided with natural expansion overseas by Hong Kong companies. Companies like retail group Dairy Farm has made overseas acquisitions because prospects for further growth in Hong Kong were limited. Dairy Farm, an associate of Jardine Matheson, has made acquisitions in the UK Australia and Spain. But it is one of the few examples of successful overseas moves by Hong Kong companies. Groups such as New World Development and Sir Yue Kong Pao's World International have bought overseas hotel chains - Ramada and Omni, respectively - while Mr Li Ka-shing bought Canadian oil and gas company Husky Oil. But, so far, none of these moves have proved successful. Some analysts argue Hong Kong companies, designed to react quickly to business opportunities in fast growing economies, do poorly in mature economies where management needs to be well structured.</p>

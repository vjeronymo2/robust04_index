			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIA COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF REPLACED  </P> <P> The leader of the Armenian Communist Party was replaced on Friday by a  subordinate after two years of unremitting turmoil in the southern Soviet  republic.  </P> <P> Suren G. Arutyunyan, who had been named the Armenian party's first secretary in  May, 1988, after months of strife with neighboring Azerbaijan, is succeeded by  Vladimir M. Movsisyan, who had been chairman of the republic's agro-industrial  commission and a first deputy prime minister.  </P> <P> The official news agency Tass said that Arutyunyan, 51, a veterinarian who has  worked as a party official for nearly 30 years, had sought a transfer to other  unspecified duties. While Tass gave no explanation for the abrupt change, which  was made by the Armenian party's Central Committee, Arutyunyan was regarded  both in Moscow and in Armenia as less and less effective in dealing with the  growing nationalism there.  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Grown from the earth of Malta / A look at a sensitive design for a new arts centre in Valletta Malta is still a glamorous island with a past that has left behind a remarkably rich architectural heritage. You cannot get away from the fact that the place is composed of limestone which has been used for centuries as the basic building material. This has given the island a distinctive unity: walls, bastions, fortifications, palaces and churches fill the skyline. They are varied in style, but all look as though they have grown from the earth. Malta has always drawn a rich variety of travellers to its shores; poets and writers have followed a succession of conquerors. It was Coleridge who arrived shortly after the British had captured the island from the French in 1814 and wrote: 'One's first feeling is, that this is all strange; and when you begin to understand a little of the meaning and the uses of the massy, endless walls and defiles, and then you feel and perceive that this is very wonderful. A city all of freestone, all the houses looking new; all with flat roofs, the streets all straight, and at right angles to each other; but many of them exceedingly steep, none quite level; of the steep streets, some are stepped with the smooth stone . . . the whole island looks like one monstrous fortification . . . the fortifications of Valletta are endless . . . such vast masses, bulky mountain breasted heights.' Malta is still a paradise for the military historian and even more of a paradise for the architectural enthusiast. There are 300 churches in the group of islands and more are still being built. Piety and an enthusiasm for building seem to go together. Malta is fortunate in having a small but significant group of architects and artists who appreciate its very special qualities. This is not to say that the island is unspoilt - one million tourists a year and a tendency for aspiring locals to move out of older parts of the towns and build new houses that could be built anywhere - is leading to a decline in standards. But the smallness of the island means that the group of good designers and artists can have considerable influence. One of the leading architects there is Richard England, who has made Malta his personal crusade. In London at the moment there is a small, colourful and cheering exhibition of his work, lifting the spirits in the London winter and offering a lot of encouragement to architects who believe, as I do, that it is perfectly possible to create new buildings in old places if the problem is approached with sensitivity, respect and love. It is some nine years since I last wrote about Richard England's work and it was fascinating to see in his exhibition at the Building Centre in Store St, WC1, how he has developed and changed. In a recessionary world where architects are finding it hard to sustain their practices, it is hard not to envy Mr England the range of his work. Building continues in Malta to house and cater for the successful tourist industry. There is money even for churches and opera houses, and England is a leading contender for the rebuilding of the opera house in Valletta. Surprisingly, Malta had an opera house that was designed by Edward Middleton Barry - the architect of the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. He was commissioned to design an opera house for Malta in 1860, at a time when the island acquired a crop of major late 19th century buildings in the flourishing days of British rule. Barry designed a theatre with a huge portico that would have looked at home in London, Manchester or Liverpool. By designing it in an office in London, Barry ignored the fact of the steeply sloping streets and had to raise the whole thing on a grand podium to cope with the changes of level. The opera house also had a chequered career - it was gutted by fire in 1873; completely rebuilt; and then, badly damaged by bombs in the second world war, closed down. Today the island authorities want to encourage a lively evening life in Valletta and the building of an arts complex on the opera house site is their next priority. Richard England's scheme proposes utilising the marvellous remains of the great portico and building splendid public spaces behind it in an uncompromising but powerful modern style. His design is very effective and original. If and when the opera house/arts centre is built, it will be close to the new city gates by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. He won the 'Malta Gates' competition with a design that responds intelligently to the island's traditions without venturing down the paths of pastiche. In his exhibition Richard England shows another example of one of his skilful designs fitting in to the old fabric of the city. His new Central Bank of Malta in Valletta is built inside the massive walls of one of the great fortifications. By lighting the centre of the new premises with a great atrium it has been possible to build an important new facility for the island which is more or less invisible. This will not be the case for the San Tumas Tourist Village, a kind of terraced pyramid of flats and rooms. While this can never be recessive it can fit in to the island because Richard England recognises the elemental nature of the cubist vernacular stone houses. This is something basic to the island which adapts to modern architecture very successfully. I enjoyed the way Richard England's architecture is now using more colour in a bravely cubist way. His work succeeds for two main reasons: drawing and style. The many prints and drawings in the exhibition demonstrate that he has completely absorbed the architecture of his native island. While drawing clearly helps him to absorb the qualities of the architecture, he uses this skill to develop a style of his own, successfully relating to the elements of the island's tradition. Malta is fortunate to have him to lead the profession on the island.</p>

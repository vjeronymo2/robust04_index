			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MERITS OF EMOTIONAL DISTANCE  </P> <P> Jimmy Carter may have lost his chance for reelection in 1980 because he made  the fate of the American hostages in Tehran the preoccupying burden of his  presidency. Ronald Reagan blundered or was led into covertly selling arms to  Iran because he hoped to win freedom for the American hostages in Lebanon. Both  Presidents, by their displays of public compassion for the hostages and their  families, demonstrated what in other circumstances would be regarded as  admirable humane instincts.  </P> <P> But the political lesson of those experiences is that a President, however  great his sympathetic identification with the victims of terrorism, best serves  the country by keeping a certain emotional distance from their plight. George  Bush seems to have absorbed that lesson.  </P> <P> As Bush made clear again this week, he has not put the hostages out of his mind  or slackened his efforts through diplomatic channels to gain their freedom. But  he has also been careful not to put what might be perceived as an exceptionally  high value on their well-being and their return. He has made it a point to  avoid emotional involvement by not communicating personally with the families  of the hostages, delegating that to others. And he has not wasted his time by  directing public pleas to the terrorists who hold the hostages or to their  sponsors in Iran; as everyone in government knows by now, such people aren't  moved by appeals to decency. Their surest response in fact would be to regard a  plea not as evidence of concern but as sign of weakness.  </P> <P> Wisely, Bush has similarly avoided issuing bold-sounding, if not necessarily  practical, threats against hostage-taking, as Ronald Reagan did on his  Inauguration Day in 1981. Bush did make clear, through diplomatic and press  channels, that any further harm to the hostages would invite a military  response. But by not putting that warning in the form of an explicit public  challenge, he gave those to whom it was directed a chance to exercise restraint  without appearing to bow to pressure. Meanwhile, first through diplomatic  channels and then publicly, Bush has signaled that he is ready to have full  discussions with Iran, presumably meaning talks not just about the hostages but  about a range of bilateral issues.  </P> <P> On the most basic, human level, it obviously hasn't been easy to refrain from  threatening words and even forceful action after the murder of Lt. Col. William  R. Higgins was so brutally disclosed and so obscenely flaunted. But it has been  what conditions require, as offstage diplomacy explores the chances for a  multiparty exchange of prisoners and hostages. Bush has so far acquitted  himself in this matter firmly, responsibly, dispassionately, and for that he  deserves credit.  </P></p>

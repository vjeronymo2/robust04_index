			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 1 -- President Lech Walesa told PAP  Wednesday he would run in the presidential elections scheduled  for the autumn of 1995. "It is for the first time that I  confirm it publicly," the president said. "I was encouraged to  fight again, especially by the postcommunists and all those  attacking me," he said in an exclusive interview for PAP.  Speaking about his possible electoral platform, Walesa referred  to the programme he had promoted in the last presidential  elections and said: "We must review the programme we have had  until now and draw up a new one, using the experience of the  past four years."    Walesa said he hoped his electorate would include all people  of honest work. "I do have many achievements to my credit and  although some have been forgotten I am convinced that not one of  the figures on the political scene can match my record," Walesa  claimed. He said he planned to draw up a complete list of his  accomplishments and have it published.    Asked about his political base in the elections, Walesa did  not exclude this role would be played by the Non-Party Reform  Bloc (BBWR), an organization created on his initiative shortly  before the September, 1993 parliamentary elections. He left  open the possibility that a new presidential political party  would be created.    The president said he was glad there were already  politicians  in the political arena planning to contest the presidential  election, but added he was not afraid of rivals. "I will prove  I still have many fresh ideas that no politician can beat,"  Walesa assured. He announced he would not support any grouping  in the forthcoming local government elections.    The president reiterated his position that the chief of the  Polish army general staff should report to the president, not  the minister of defense. He also once again declared he would  not sign into law the amendments to the law on abortion now  debated by the Sejm.    Walesa gave good marks to the cabinet of Waldemar Pawlak,  but  remarked that the bulk of really tough decisions had been made  by the previous four cabinets. "The present government is in a  convenient situation and this accounts for its successes so  far," said Walesa. "However, we shall only see what the future  will bring..."    Walesa categorically denied information concerning his sons  carried by the latest issue of the POLITYKA weekly and putting  in doubt his conduct as a father. "I will say bluntly: those  who cannot fight me through other means are now trying to do it  via my family life," the president declared.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] European aircraft makers, including France's  Aerospatiale and Britain's British Aerospace, complained to the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] on 30 May of  the "U.S. bias" in the process of selecting a partner to develop  the small passenger jetliner YSX, a joint project of the  Japanese Government and private sector, and asked MITI to  correct this tendency.    The Boeing Company of the United States and the Japanese  have  already started a feasibility study on YSX. The Europeans  seriously regard "Boeing's entry into the market of small  aircraft to be a threat," and competition between the United  States and Europe is bound to intensify.    The complaint was made in a letter from the Aerospace  Committee (chaired by De Fontaine [name as published], Japan  representative of Eurocopter) of the European Business  Association in Japan. The letter says that if partnership  between Japan and Boeing in small passenger aircraft  materializes, this will: 1) aggravate the disparity between  Europe and the United States in Japan's cooperation with foreign  countries in the aerospace sector; and 2) threaten the existence  of European companies.    YSX is the passenger jetliner that will succeed the  Japanese-made YS-11. MITI has obtained appropriations for  research on this aircraft since fiscal 1989. However, joint  international development is considered indispensable to share  development costs and strengthen marketing potential. For this  reason, the Japanese Government and private sector have been  negotiating with a number of foreign companies, including Boeing  and ATR, a joint venture company formed by Aerospatiale and  Italy's Alenia, and plan to select a development partner by this  summer.    Boeing has already started a feasibility study with Japan  and  China on small passenger aircraft in preparation for the YSX  project. This complaint by the European companies seems to have  been filed amid speculation that "Boeing will be the probable  partner in the YSX project," and is meant to remind Japan of the  presence of the European companies.</p>

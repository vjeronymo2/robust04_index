			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / US watchdog looks at use of derivatives The pressure on US companies to reveal more about their use of derivative financial instruments grew yesterday as it emerged that the Securities and Exchange Commission had written to a number of companies asking them for more information about their activities in this area. News of the SEC's request comes ahead of an appearance today by the agency's chairman, Mr Arthur Levitt, before the House of Representative's subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. Mr Edward Markey, the subcommittee's chairman, is planning legislation on derivatives. The SEC's letter is believed to have been directed to some of the largest users of derivatives, instruments which companies use to reduce exposure to exchange or interest rate fluctuations. In recent weeks reported losses, most notably from Procter &amp; Gamble, has led to concern that in some cases derivatives have increased the risks companies are running, rather than reduced them. Yesterday Dell Computer announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 15.6m (Pounds 10.4m) after it misjudged the trend of European and Japanese interest rates and incurred losses on its investment portfolio which used derivatives. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting regulations, is also pressing US companies for extra disclosure. The body has released draft disclosure rules, and hopes to have a final version in place to apply to companies whose financial years end in December. The FASB's draft requires companies to explain the objectives of their use of derivatives, and the instruments and hedging strategies they use. The spotlight that has been turned on to the use of derivatives - and the attention paid to every loss incurred, whether or not such instruments have enhanced companies' profits in the past - has scared most big companies away from talking publicly about this area. 'It's like asking them about their marital relations,' said one auditor with a big US accounting firm. Several companies are believed to have commissioned external reviews of their derivatives portfolios, to reassure themselves that they do not have losses in this area as well. A report last week from the US General Accounting Office last week called for more regulation of the way companies use such financial instruments. Dell Computer, Page 29</p>

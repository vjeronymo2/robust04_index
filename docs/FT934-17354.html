			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: Drawn to Michelangelo - Susan Moore visits the Casa Buonarroti in Florence Italy's museum revolution is gathering momentum. Earlier this year, the new Minister of Culture Alberto Ronchey decreed that the country's notoriously inhospitable state monuments, museums and galleries should be open from 9am to 7pm. No more apologies pinned to firmly closed doors. No more closures at two. Over the summer in Florence, for example, some 20 museums welcomed visitors for late evening viewing too. The city's museums have authorised an unprecedented number of loans to London's Accademia Italiana for a Lorenzo the Magnificent show which opens later this month. A few years ago, such a project would have been unthinkable. This cultural perestroika is also affecting what the public sees. Visitors to one of Florence's least known small treasure houses, the Casa Buonarroti, off the tourist track in via Ghibellina, will find 18 of its finest Michelangelo drawings on show together for the first time (until October 31). Their display is a bold move in a country where museums tend to exhibit facsimiles of drawings rather than originals. Michelangelo never lived at the Casa Buonarroti. The present house was built on a site he bought for his nephew and was later decorated by his grand-nephew Michelangelo the Younger with frescoes which turned the master's life into history. Loans and gifts supplementing the family holdings, including works returned by the Medici, have transformed the house into a veritable shrine. Alongside portraits by Bugiardini and Daniele da Volterra is the most recent addition to the Michelangelo iconography: a marble group of the young Michelangelo sculpting the famous head of a faun by one Cesare Zocchi (1851-1922). It seems a fearless act of homage seen beside Michelangelo's technically daring low-relief 'Madonna of the Steps' and the tumult of intertwined figures in the 'Battle of the Centaurs'. The greatest glories of the drawings collection have long since gone, dispersed by the family and now largely divided between the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. What remains, as represented here, is a fascinating group that reveals a great deal about the artist's range, working practice and ever astonishing inventiveness. We find figures studies and compositional sketches in pen and ink, black chalk and red chalk, plans and elevations of churches and schemes for city fortifications. There are vigorous working drawings precise enough to be used by craftsmen, alongside extraordinary flights of imagination. A few swift strokes of the pen on a letter to a friend describe how he painted the Sistine ceiling. Many of the drawings reveal Michelangelo's obsessive desire not to waste paper, even though paper was no longer a luxury commodity. One particularly beautiful early figure drawing, after a figure of Hercules on an antique sarcophagus relief, was kept for some 20 years before being folded in four and its verso re-used for jotting down expenses. The list includes the cost of a pair of slippers for his nephew and heir Leonardo. It is typical of Michelangelo's genius as well as his frugality that his sketch for the elevation of San Lorenzo should be only some 10cm wide and free-drawn in soft red chalk with little concern for accuracies of scale or proportion. Other sheets here show him trying out various schemes for the great staircase in the vestibule of the Laurentian Library and designing the desk and benches for the reading room inside. On a drawing for the base of a pilaster in the New Sacristy, he cannot resist adding an eye and a few extra touches to turn the elaborate moulding into a profile of a gaping-mouthed human head. Most remarkable is a design for the monumental Porta Pia in Rome, the city gate commissioned by Pope Pius IV and still immortalising his name. In this much altered pen and wash drawing, heightened with white bodycolour, Michelangelo has given his design a sculptural richness never previously seen in architectural drawing. In pride of place in the collection is one of the so-called 'presentation' drawings. These exquisite chalk drawings were conceived as works of art in their own right and given to his closest friends. This idealised head of Cleopatra was presented to the Roman nobleman Tomasso dei Cavalieri. Its recently uncovered verso presents an altogether more convincing image of the queen post asp, wide-eyed and screaming. Tomasso was obliged to surrender the drawing to Duke Cosimo de' Medici. In a letter lamenting its departure, he said that it was like losing one of his own children.</p>

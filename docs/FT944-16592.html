			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers move Insurance sectors moved into overdrive late in the session as dealers reacted to continuing takeover speculation plus a more positive view of the insurance brokers from BZW, a leading light in the sector. The broking stocks made rapid progress with some dealers still convinced a predatory move against Willis Corroon could be in the offing. 'If a serious bid was made for Willis the management would be virtually defenceless,' said one insurance specialist. Big blocks of Willis shares have changed hands in recent weeks with PDFM, one of the UK market's biggest institutions increasing its stake to over 11 per cent and another big buyer said to have been operating. HSBC is seen as a strong contender for Willis. Willis shares rose a further 6 to 161p yesterday, after turnover of 1.7m shares. Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, jumped 8 to 156p on 1m traded. Much of yesterday's interest was triggered by a positive note from BZW whose insurance team shifted its long-term stance on the sector from underweight to neutral with Sedgwick shifted to a 'buy' and Willis from 'sell' to 'hold'. BZW said it had visited the US operations of Sedgwick, Willis Corroon, and JIB as well as the big US groups. The broker said it viewed the underperformance of the sector as 'too severe' and said many stocks now appear to be suffering punishment ratings. BZW said Sedgwick has a 'sensible' group strategy and is likely to be a winner in an industry which is likely to be restructured in coming years. Airports group BAA rose 8 to 504p in 5.1m trades for a two-day gain of 30p as a stream of favourable air transport news added potential spice to tomorrow's September traffic figures from the company. Strong passenger flows from British Midland Airways, air fare cuts on a number of Far Eastern and trans-Atlantic routes and plans by British Airways to restart 'open skies' policy talks this month with US airlines all helped to concentrate market focus on BAA's volume background. British Airways put on 6 1/2 to 371 1/2 p. Whitbread rose 13 to 539p, in good trade of 1.2m. Cider maker HP Bulmer was a particularly strong feature in the drinks sector. The shares jumped sharply early in the session after details of the previous three months trading were reported in the market, taking analysts by surprise. Calls by some City firms for further information were followed by release of an official trading statement from the company in the last hour of market trading. The shares closed 8 ahead at 433p. The day's single biggest trade was carried out in retailing group House of Fraser bringing turnover to 25.9m by the close. The shares eased a penny to 207p. The trade, representing around 5.5 per cent of the company's equity, was carried out by NatWest Securities below the market price. Amersham International jumped 17 to 943p as the company announced it had acquired 20 per cent stake of Nihon MediPhysics, Japan's leading nuclear medicine group. Other statistics, Page 35</p>

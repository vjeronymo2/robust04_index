Chavalit received the report on  Sunday. He is studying it in detail before deciding what to do  next, the source said. "The minister said he will need two days  to study the report," the source said.    A high-ranking Foreign Ministry source yesterday said Saudi  officials have told the ministry that Thai-Saudi diplomatic ties  would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level in  seven months. This is if the police fulfilled their promise to  settle the case within this month. The account could not be  confirmed by Saudi Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Said Khoja  yesterday. "I don't know anything about it," he told The Nation  by telephone.    Chawalit yesterday would not confirm whether he had received  the official report from police. "The results should be known in  two days," he said without elaborating.    The same source said police are preparing to arrest an  elderly woman who was once the wet nurse of a police general.  They have acquired evidence pointing to her possession of some  of the missing jewellery.    The same Foreign Ministry source yesterday confirmed that  Chawalit had received the police report concluding the years-old  investigation into the disappearance of the Saudi jewellery. The  source said the Foreign Ministry had consistently kept Saudi  Arabia informed of progress in the case and the latest details,  but not including the final report submitted to Chawalit, were  translated and sent through the Thai Charge d' Affaires in  Riyadh, Mahadi Wimana. The ministry has told its Saudi  counterpart that the Thai police were wrapping up the jewellery  case and preparing to arrest those suspected to be involved in  the crime, he said.    The Saudi side was also told that Thai officials had  promised  good news in March, understood to mean the arrest of culprits,  including some police officers, the source said. Riyadh has  expressed appreciation for Thailand's efforts to settle the case  and urged a continuing attempt to bring the culprits to justice,  he said. "The Saudis have said if Thai authorities could settle  the case in March as they have promised, Thai-Saudi diplomatic  ties would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level  in seven months," the source said. Thailand and Saudi Arabia  currently have charges d'affaires as the head of their  respective embassies.    Thai-Saudi relations have been strained by the disappearance  of some of the jewellery retrieved by Thai police in early 1990  after it was stolen by a Thai worker in Riyadh, and by the  murders of three Saudi embassy officials in Bangkok in the same  year. Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers while  pressing for settlement of the jewellery and murder cases.    Seven policemen and one civilian are on trial in connection  with the suspected embezzlement of the missing jewellery and  more arrests are expected.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said he was  waiting for official results of the investigation.</p>

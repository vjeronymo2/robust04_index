			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / People: Greycoat draws in its horns Greycoat, the troubled property investment company which on Thursday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 39.2m, up from 5.8m, for the six months to September 30, is taking the reduction of its administrative overheads seriously. In the words of Richard Guignard, managing director, finance: 'it's not just a question of getting rid of a few secretaries'. Three directors of the 12-person board are to resign at the end of the year. Barry Cockerell, deputy managing director and a member of the board since the founding of Greycoat in 1978, is to leave, as is Walter Kumar, who joined the company as a development executive in 1985 and moved up to the board in 1989. Alastair Fergusson, a non-executive director since the company's inception, is also going. All this follows Geoffrey Wilson's decision earlier in the year to move from executive to non-executive chairman. He was the founder of the company, but, says Guignard, is now paid 'a fraction of what he received before'. ***** John Menzies, formerly non-executive deputy chairman of Corah, has been appointed to the board of ROBERT H LOWE as md of the childrenswear division, Babygro. ***** Michael Guerin, director responsible for NORTHUMBRIAN WATER's Enterprise division, is appointed group commercial director and md of Entec Europe; Ian MacMillan, md of Northumbrian Environmental Management, is appointed director of customer services at Northumbrian Water. Peter Wilson, md Integrated Environmental Management, the group's joint venture with International Technology of America, also becomes md of Northumbrian Environmental Management. Stuart Raistrick is to become md of Amtec Europe; and David Watson, company secretary of Northumbrian Water Group. ***** Leonard Rose, currently md, and Richard Rose, currently commercial director, are to become joint md of WHOLESALE FITTINGS from January. ***** Geoffrey Miller, formerly md of BARCLAYS UK Banking Division, has been appointed banking adviser to MOORES ROWLAND.</p>

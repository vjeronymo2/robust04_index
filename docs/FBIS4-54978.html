			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, 6 May (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova,  president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK], today  described his talks in Pristina yesterday with British Foreign  Office minister Douglas Hogg as "rather important and  successful." At a news conference, Rugova recalled Hogg's  statement that Great Britain will make efforts to resolve the  problem of Kosovo and other parts of the former Yugoslavia.  Commenting on Hogg's statement that Kosovo is part of Serbia  and that the Albanians can only count on autonomy, he said: "We  discussed all issues with the British Foreign Office minister.  From the international point of view he has no authority or  power to make any suggestions about what Kosovo is part of."    "Mr. Hogg came here primarily in good faith and with the  intention of exploring the possibility of a Serbian-Albanian  dialogue," the DSK leader said. Asked about the possibility of  establishing a dialogue with representatives of the Serbian  authorities, Rugova said: "We have had no information about  this." He described all talk about the possible beginning of  talks as speculation. To a reporter's comment that "Serbia is  ready for certain concessions to normalize the situation in  Kosovo," Rugova said ambiguously: "We will see what concessions  we are talking about."    In the context of what he usually calls the daily repression  of Albanians by the Serbian authorities, Rugova mentioned the  crime in the Mladenovac barracks, describing it as "an incident  which reflects the games and insinuations surrounding ethnic  Albanian soldiers in the Yugoslav Army." Instead of condemning  the crime, Rugova condemned the military authorities and said  they are allegedly asking for financial compensation to release  soldiers of Albanian nationality from the Yugoslav Army.</p>

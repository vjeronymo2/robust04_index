			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood loss cut to Pounds 21m - Chairman optimistic as house reservations rise significantly TRENCHERWOOD, a USM-quoted housebuilder and property company, reduced its loss before tax from Pounds 37.7m to Pounds 21.4m in the year ended October 31. The loss was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 29.9m). Operating losses rose from Pounds 863,000 to Pounds 2.3m. At the year-end group borrowings stood at Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 45m) with a deficiency on net assets of Pounds 33.3m. However, following the refinancing, approved by shareholders at a recent extraordinary general meeting, a pro forma balance sheet shows borrowings restated at Pounds 22.2m with a positive net worth of Pounds 3.9m. Mr John Norgate, chairman, said: 'Since the start of the year we have seen real cause for optimism. Visitor levels to our show houses and house reservations have increased significantly since December, with demand on some developments now outstripping supply.' Mr David Moss, managing director, said the housing market had changed for the first time since the recession. 'With mortgage rates at their lowest for 37 years, we are experiencing a recovery which we do not believe is about to peter out.' He said the company's new found confidence was underlined by the support it had received from its banks. 'It is significant that the company's five-year business plan won the support of its lenders.' The group's loss in the second half was Pounds 5m compared with a deficit of Pounds 16.4m in the first six months. The total loss after taxation fell to Pounds 20.8m, compared with Pounds 34.2m. In line with its policy of increasing its residential side, the commercial operation disposed of assets worth Pounds 2.9m and commercial sales of Pounds 2.4m were made. Under the terms of the refinancing, Pounds 35m of bank debts and claims were swapped for ordinary and preference shares, leaving existing shareholders with 30 per cent of the enlarged capital. Their holdings will be diluted to 15.9 per cent if there is full conversion of the preference shares. The banks also agreed to provide five-year term facilities of Pounds 22.4m, overdraft and engagement facilities of Pounds 7m and a standby facility of Pounds 1m. With the exception of one project, where the maximum recourse is about Pounds 60,000, the group does not have to repay any of the borrowings of its joint venture projects. Losses per share were reduced from 137.01p to 83.10p and the final dividend is being passed again.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A LACKLUSTRE session was seen in the derivatives sector as hopes of a cut in UK base rate all but dwindled, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was steady at the opening with the first trade recorded at 2,922, just ahead of Tuesday's closing level. A brief spate of buying - mainly from independent traders - sent the contract to the day's high of 2,937 at around 10am. However, with the fading hopes of a reduction in interest rates, the higher level proved difficult to sustain and sellers emerged in a thin market, bringing a retreat for the contract. A poor gilts sector and the early decline on Wall Street brought further selling and the day's low of 2,914 was recorded at around 3pm. September finished at 2,916, down 4 from its previous close and some 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 11 points. Volume was thin, reaching only 5,778 contracts by the official close. In traded options, activity in the index options made a substantial contribution to the day's total volume of 28,250. Some 9,890 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,455 in the Euro FT-SE 100 contract. British Airways was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,271 trades and was followed by Asda with 1,156 contracts.</p>

Hun Sen told AFP by  phone that government troops were successful in a three-pronged  attack on the radical faction's headquarters and the logistics  base for guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia. Hun  Sen said ten government soldiers were killed and more than ten  wounded in the operation, most by mines.    "One of the prongs moved very fast and had to wait for the  other two. But today, the three met together and shook hands in  Anlung Veng," Hun Sen said.    Other government and diplomatic sources, however, said they  were not sure whether the military had captured the base. But  Hun Sen said the Khmer Rouge did not put up much resistance, but  dispersed and escaped. The guerrillas were pushed 15 kilometers  (10 miles) north of the base and were occasionally firing  mortars at the government troops, Hun Sen said.    A high ranking officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said he thought government troops had occupied part of Anlung  Veng. "But we are not sure whether Anlung Veng is 100 per cent  liberated or not," the officer said. A Western diplomat said  that, while he believed the government was close, he thought the  troops were moving slowly because of booby traps and mines.</p>

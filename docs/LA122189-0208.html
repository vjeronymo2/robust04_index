			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DRIVER GUILTY IN FATAL BUS CRASH  </P> <P> Larry Mahoney was convicted today of 27 counts of second-degree manslaughter  and most of the other charges he faced in the nation's deadliest  alcohol-related traffic crash, which claimed the lives of 27 people riding home  from a church outing.  </P> <P> Mahoney bowed his head slightly as the verdict was read on each count he faced  from the fiery crash May 14, 1988. Mahoney, 36, was charged with 27 counts of  murder, 12 of first-degree assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of  drunken driving.  </P> <P> Jurors were to consider a sentence later in the day.  </P> <P> Mahoney was driving his pickup in the wrong direction on Interstate 71 near  Carrollton, when it rammed head-on into a bus, killing 24 children and three  adults who belonged to the Radcliff First Assembly of God church. Mahoney's  lawyers said he admitted being drunk and driving north in the southbound lanes  of the divided highway.  </P></p>

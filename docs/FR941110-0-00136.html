			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters suggested that we set forth at &sect;488.402(b)(2) the principle that termination of provider agreements is a measure taken only as a last resort when the imposition of intermediate remedies has failed to correct the deficiencies. One commenter recommends that paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter said that OBRA '87 stated that when deficiencies constitute an immediate and serious threat to residents' health and safety, neither HCFA nor the States have any discretion with regard to remedies. Rather, the commenter said that, in such cases, HCFA or the States must impose either temporary management or a provider agreement termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that termination of provider agreements is a serious measure, but not that it is a ``last resort'' in the strictest sense. While we believe that the Congress wrote into the law the wide array of alternative remedies to encourage their use, the Act does not require that in every case the States or the Secretary may not choose provider agreement termination until alternative remedies have been used. We believe that the Act's alternative remedies offer States and the Secretary a valuable opportunity to redress a wide variety of facility shortcomings through means that will promote quick correction without having to exclude the facility from program participation, and it is our expectation not only that serious consideration will be given for such opportunities when there is facility non-compliance, but that they will be used far more frequently than they have in the past. It would be an entirely erroneous impression of the Act, however, to conclude that it deprives States and the Secretary from exercising discretion to choose  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> remedy, including termination, whenever they determine it appropriate to do so. The comment suggesting that the proposed paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies is inappropriate; the number of remedies that may be imposed is covered in the proposed &sect;488.202(c). We will discuss this comment in connection with others on that paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is true that, when no immediate jeopardy exists, the Congress stated that the State or the Secretary may impose termination or may impose one or more intermediate sanctions against the provider, or may impose both, and that this is in contrast to the specific measures that must be imposed when immediate jeopardy exists. However, it does not follow that the State, rather than the Federal government, should have the ability and the obligation to specify when and how each remedy is to be applied. The Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87 clearly states: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* it is the responsibility of the Secretary to take the enforcement measures necessary to assure compliance by Medicaid facilities with the requirements of participation as well as to assure that State enforcement activities are adequate to protect the health and safety of residents. To enable the Secretary to discharge this responsibility, the committee amendment would greatly expand the remedies available to the Secretary under current law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* [I]f both the State and the Secretary decide that remedies other than termination are appropriate, the Secretary's selection of alternative remedies, and not those of the State apply. (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 475&hyph;7 (1987)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, section 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act specifies that the Secretary shall provide, through regulations, guidance to States in establishing remedies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, when there is disagreement between HCFA and the State regarding enforcement action, the disagreement is resolved in accordance with the policy set forth in &sect;488.452(d). For example, paragraph (d) says that when HCFA or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, the additional or alternative remedies will also apply when_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Both HCFA and the State find that a NF has not met all the participation requirements; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this way, the sanction(s) proposed by the State can take effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion and the need to make conforming changes with other provisions of the regulation, we are revising &sect;488.402(b)(2) to indicate that the State or HCFA may apply one or more of the remedies specified in &sect;488.406 instead of terminating the provider agreement, or in addition to termination procedures, to continue until the effective date of the termination or until substantial compliance is achieved, and, in some cases, until the State or HCFA is assured that substantial compliance can be maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above, one State said that &sect;488.402(b)(2) should be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies. The State's rationale is that the proposed paragraph (c) would restrict both HCFA and the States in their efforts to encourage prompt corrective action, and to protect residents' health and safety. Another commenter said the application of a separate remedy for each deficiency seems unduly harsh. A remedy or set of remedies should be imposed relating to the entire universe on deficiencies cited. Still another said that one incident should trigger the citing of no more than one remedy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters said that there is no statutory basis for paragraph (c). Other commenters asked for clarification, suggesting that we use examples, limits, and further guidelines to ensure consistency. Of particular concern to many was the fear that, absent these guidelines and limits, providers might incur multiple sanctions for single deficiencies or for multiple deficiencies arising from a single act or incident. Some suggested that HCFA and the State be directed to consider whether a facility's deficiencies are ``clustered'' or ``bundled'' (we used the term ``interrelated'' in the proposed rule) or scattered throughout the facility in deciding which remedy(ies) to impose in particular situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

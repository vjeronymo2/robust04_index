			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WANDERING BELL GARDENS OFFICER UNDERGOES PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS  </P> <P> The wandering Bell Gardens police officer who told authorities he blacked out  last week and regained consciousness 12 hours, and two counties, later has been  undergoing psychological tests to determine what caused his curious desert  pilgrimage, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officer David Larimore, 35, who disappeared in a patrol car early Friday, was  picked up unharmed later that day in Victorville -- a Mojave Desert city 28  miles north of San Bernardino -- after a massive search by authorities.  </P> <P> Although Bell Gardens police have refused to comment on details of the case,  saying that Larimore's mental condition is a private matter, San Bernardino  County sheriff's detectives said the officer was being interviewed by doctors  and counselors.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Warren Nobles said that he had been briefed by Larimore's  commander about the missing officer's despondency over a marital rift and his  failure to be promoted within the department.  </P> <P> "In Bell Gardens, (Police Chief William Donohoe) said they were looking at all  possible explanations about what happened," Nobles said. "There were some  marital, financial and job problems that came up in the discussion. . . . Those  may have been issues."  </P> <P> Larimore, an 11-year veteran who lives in Long Beach, had arrived early for  work on Friday, changed into his uniform, and left the station before morning  roll call, sheriff's spokeswoman Denise Garland said. After repeated attempts  to reach Larimore by radio, Bell Gardens police began searching for him.  Sheriff's deputies joined the effort after Larimore's car was found.  </P> <P> The officer was found walking in the neighborhood of a friend who was a Bell  Gardens officer for eight years and is now a sheriff's deputy stationed in  Victorville.  </P> <P> Deputy Michael Stout said Larimore's desert visit was curious as well as  unannounced. Larimore, who has visited Victorville in the past, said he had  been wandering on foot for about five hours and wasn't certain where he was,  Stout told authorities.  </P> <P> Garland said of Larimore: "Not knowing where he was or how he got there was  very disturbing to him."  </P> <P> Authorities said Larimore did not remember going to work or driving in the  squad car earlier that day. The abandoned car had been found earlier, parked in  the middle of a construction site in downtown Victorville. Larimore's uniform  shirt, police identification and service revolver were on the front seat. The  keys were in the ignition.  </P> <P> Garland said Larimore recently had been treated for "severe headaches," but at  the time he was found, he "did not appear to be under the influence of any  drug."  </P> <P> "He simply seemed apprehensive, almost frightened, about where he had been,"  she said.  </P></p>

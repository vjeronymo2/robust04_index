			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Second cash call from Hemingway Properties to finance acquisition HEMINGWAY Properties, the lossmaking property group formed through a reverse takeover of Marylebone Estates in August 1991, is making its second cash call in six months. It also forecast it would pay a dividend in 1995. It is raising Pounds 32.3m net of expenses through a placing and open offer of shares and convertible bonds to finance a Pounds 35m purchase of eight properties. The deal follows a Pounds 21.9m placing and Pounds 30.2m acquisition which was announced in June. The deal would increase basic net asset value from 25p to 28.2p a share or from 27p to 29.4p on a fully diluted basis. Hemingway is to issue 66.2m shares at 31.5p, with shareholders able to buy one for every two held, or 10 for every Pounds 6.40 nominal of stock held. It will also sell Pounds 10.6m of new convertible stock, which will merge with an existing convertible, at a 17 per cent premium to par. Shareholders can buy Pounds 2 nominal of stock for every 25 shares held or Pounds 1 nominal for every Pounds 4 nominal of stock held. The conversion price on the new stock is 37.4p a share. After the issue, the group's debt would be Pounds 51m compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 45m. However, if the Pounds 22.6m convertible stock is counted as equity, gearing falls to less than 50 per cent. Hemingway said this 'relatively modest level of gearing' would allow it to make further acquisitions funded by debt. Annual rental income from the properties being bought, which includes five industrial estates, two offices and a shopping centre, is Pounds 3.5m. It is expected to grow to Pounds 4.2m in five years. After financing costs and expenses, Hemingway expects the properties to contribute Pounds 2.2m a year before tax. The vendors of the properties are a group of private property investment companies representing institutional investors. Hemingway is planning a capital reduction next year to wipe out an accumulated deficit on profit and loss reserves. It is expected the deficit will be worsened by the 1993 results. However thereafter the company is expected to make a profit in 1994 and plans to pay a dividend in 1995 of 0.4p in respect of the 1994 financial year.</p>

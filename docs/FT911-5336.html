			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Economics: On guard for German rate rise EUROPE is awash with economic news this week. The markets are on guard for an interest rate rise in Germany - the Bundesbank meets on Thursday. It would be difficult to overestimate the German authorities' commitment to price stability, so there is speculation that the bank will raise rates to counteract the recent weakness in the DM and quell rising inflationary pressures. This is viewed as more likely after the bank tightened money market conditions last week and the current account data, which revealed the extent to which reunification has depressed exports and sucked in imports. In the UK, the producer price data tomorrow will be keenly dissected for evidence that subdued demand and trading conditions are restraining inflation at the factory gate. This series has recently indicated that manufacturers are still trying to pass on high unit wage costs in higher prices. With the pound weak against the dollar, there is the additional risk that the UK is importing higher inflation - adding an estimated 1 percentage points on input prices. US inflation, on the other hand, seem much improved after last week's consumer price data. With the strong dollar, better current account data and encouraging noises from the Fed, even recessionary data on housing starts today should not damp hopes of a modest US recovery. Thursday's wodge of statistics should reveal the latest state of the public sector finances. With a borrowing requirement of around Pounds 2bn pencilled in, this suggests a debt repayment for the financial year of Pounds 1.7bn. Also of great interest to the gilts market will be the money supply data, which are due to show M4 lending slipping after a slackening in takeover activity in March. Other events and statistics with median market forecasts from MMS International, the financial services company, in brackets include: Today: Japan, corporate bankruptcies for March, wholesale price index (0.9 per cent) for March, trade balance customs basis for March. Germany, wholesale prices for March. UK, informal G7 meeting. Tomorrow: US, housing starts, building permits, industrial production and capacity utilisation for March.

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Troubles behind the red ink BEHIND the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's belief that Hungary's big banks need rescuing are some compelling facts. The capital of the two biggest banks - Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank - is wiped out when international accounting standards are applied to their bad loans. Economic output has fallen 18 per cent in the last three years. The disappearance of demand from former Comecon countries has worsened the recession. In 1991 parliament passed strict new laws: on bankruptcy, causing about a tenth of companies to go into liquidation or file for protection from creditors; and on financial institutions, giving banks the incentive to recognise bad debts. Hitel Bank says its non-performing loans tripled. The result has been a sharp credit crunch. Banks, faced with the need to make huge provisions, have charged high real interest rates to maintain margins and produce paper operating profits, estimated at Ft39.7bn (Pounds 293m) for the whole sector in 1992. The average interest rate on short-term corporate loans was 28.2 per cent at the end of 1992, compared with inflation of 21.6 per cent over the year. The World Bank study concludes that 'the financial system is unable to finance the transformation to a market economy'. A one-off recapitalisation is widely seen as essential. Economic recovery is still feeble and loan portfolios are deteriorating. Weaker banks are losing their better clients to stronger ones. Recapitalisation must also put the banking sector into condition for privatisation before more of the potential acquirers lose patience and set up local subsidiaries from scratch. An injection of funds, however, would allow bank managers to escape the consequence of past errors.</p>

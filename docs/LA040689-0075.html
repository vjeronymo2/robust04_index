			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10: BLOOMING FIELDS;  </P> <P> OUTINGS SUGGESTED FOR VIEWING CALIFORNIA WILDFLOWERS  </P> <P> All around Southern California, the curtain is rising on this year's springtime  show of colorful wildflowers.  </P> <P> This is the best month to see this glorious display, although blooms this year  are later and more sparse than usual because of scant rainfall and an  exceptionally cold winter. Still, there are plenty of locations where you can  see wildflowers, especially in moist coastal areas and at some Southland  botanic gardens, where patches of wildflowers are seeded and irrigated.  </P> <P> What follows is a sampling of places to find wildflowers near Los Angeles. To  learn more about the flowers, join one of the nature walks offered at each  location.  </P> <P> Whether you are alone or with a group, remember that wildflowers are a fleeting  annual treasure for all to enjoy. Look, but don't pick.  </P> <P> Theodore Payne Foundation, 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley, (818) 768-1802. Open  Tuesday through Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Free.  </P> <P> Walk up the hillside trail at this 21-acre nursery. Non-native plants have been  carefully weeded from this hill so that native flowers can grow without  competition. At the top of the hill, you'll be rewarded with the sweet  fragrance of ceanothus (California lilac).  </P> <P> Below, you can buy wildflower seeds or seedlings of more than 500 species of  California native plants. The foundation is dedicated to the propagation and  preservation of these plants. Stop by the office to pick up a set of "Exploring  Wildflower Country" maps and a 1989 nature calendar. Call the foundation's  24-hour hot line, (818) 768-3533, for a weekly update on wildflowers in bloom.  </P> <P> Charmlee Natural Area County Park, Encinal Canyon Road, Malibu, (213) 457-7247.  Open daily, 8 a.m. to sunset. Free.  </P> <P> You get a double viewing treat at this bluff-top park -- a close-up look at  wildflowers in a wide meadow and long-range vistas of the ocean below. Stop  first at the nature center to check the blackboard for a list of flowers that  have been sighted recently in the park. Pick up a trail map at the center and  head across the meadow. Wildflowers bloom in a thick carpet on the meadow's  gently rolling hills, symbolic of nature's regeneration following a fire in  1985. See if you can spot the chaparral currant, Indian paintbrush and  California peony along the trail.  </P> <P> Point Mugu State Park, 9000 W. Pacific Coast Highway (4 miles north of the  Ventura County line), (805) 987-3303, (805) 488-1827. Open daily, dawn to dusk.  Day-use fee, $4 per car.  </P> <P> Despite the drought, it's a fine year to see the giant coreopsis in bloom along  the coast, and the trail up La Jolla Canyon at Point Mugu is one of the best  places to see it.  </P> <P> To see the oversized plants, start your hike at the Ray Miller trailhead on  Pacific Coast Highway and continue along La Jolla Valley Trail. You'll find  coreopsis blooming near a walk-in campground with picnic tables and restrooms  about 1 1/2 miles along the trail.

Hike a trail  from the center into the canyon to see bright-orange monkey flowers,  fuchsia-flowered gooseberry and Indian paintbrush. Rangers lead hikes on some  Saturdays and some Sundays at various times; the Crystal Cove Interpretive  Assn. offers walks the third Wednesday of every month.  </P> <P> Santiago Oaks Regional Park, 2145 N.

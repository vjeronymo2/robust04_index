			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Local Government Commission: Plans to axe six counties abandoned Banham signals rejection of unitary authorities; Labour says government policy in turmoil Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, yesterday announced that plans to abolish six county councils - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent, Lancashire and Oxfordshire - had been abandoned. The announcement signals a decisive rejection of the government's original preference that county councils should be replaced by unitary authorities combining the powers of counties and districts in all bar 'exceptional' circumstances. Of the 17 counties for which proposals have been announced so far, 10 will keep the two-tier system at least in part. Proposals for the other shire counties will be given to the government by the end of the year, and few are likely to involve a unitary structure. Sir John's proposals followed the decision of Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, not to proceed with plans to restructure Somerset and North Yorkshire. Mr Gummer has the power to ask the commission to reconsider its proposals, but seems unlikely to use it. Opposition politicians said the government's policy was in chaos. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The present position is yet another monument to government incompetence. Turmoil and trouble, all for nothing - a useless distraction.' The commission has proposed a change to the structure of Hampshire, with Portsmouth, Southampton and the New Forest district councils all given unitary status on their current boundaries. The proposals for the two cities were widely predicted, but the New Forest unitary was a surprise. Sir John said the commission's opinion survey in the area had shown overwhelming support for a unitary authority independent of Hampshire, with 60 per cent of residents in favour of this option. In Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, Sir John recommended more radical change - the abolition of both county councils and unitary status for most of the lower-tier district councils on their current boundaries. Milton Keynes, Aylesbury Vale and Wycombe in Bucks will all be unitary, with a new merged South Buckinghamshire authority created by linking the existing Chiltern and South Bucks councils. Mr David Rendel, Liberal Democrat local government spokesman, said this would mean abolishing the one county council still controlled by the Conservatives after their bad showing in last year's local elections. Bedfordshire will be split into three unitaries, rather than the two originally recommended, with unitary status for Luton and Bedford.                            *      *      *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991:          Government raises prospect of ending traditional two-tier                system in which large county councils and smaller                district councils hold different powers over the same                areas  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 1993:      Review commission's first recommendations involve                abolishing several county councils  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1993:     John Major vetoes proposal by environment minister                John Gummer to abandon the review for all counties and                send the commission only to counties where a majority                request it  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1993:      Gummer announces changed guidance to the commission:                retaining existing two-tier administration is now                to be the 'exception'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 1994:      Lancashire county council, threatened with abolition,                wins court judgment that Gummer's 'exception' rule is                unlawful  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Summer 1994:   Commission suggests abolishing several county councils                and handing their powers to enlarged districy authorties;                launches local 'advisory referenda'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 1994:  Referenda show widespread opposition to administration                by enlarged district councils  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Keeping hold of the customer - Companies underestimate client loyalty Companies have long known that the customer is king, yet when a customer abdicates few are aware of the event, let alone understand the reasons for it. Evidence from the US and the UK shows it can be up to five times cheaper to serve existing customers than to get new ones. Yet most businesses still put more effort into increasing the size of their market than keeping the section they have already. According to Price Waterhouse Management Consultants, British industry loses Pounds 100bn a year in sales when customers defect and a similar amount in marketing, sales and distribution expenses. In a survey of the UK's top 200 companies Price Waterhouse found that barely one in 10 keep tabs on how many customers leave them each year. Only one third provide any link in staff pay to customer satisfaction, while nearly half admit their sales forces are inadequate to meet the needs of their existing customers. In the US, companies are keener to monitor their clients, but are still no closer to keeping them. According to Frederick Reichheld, of consultants Bain and Company, most companies' attempts are ad hoc at best. Writing in the latest Harvard Business Review, Reichheld argues that customer loyalty should be the first building block of a business plan. Such an approach can reap handsome rewards: MBNA, a credit card company, found a 5 per cent rise in customer loyalty increased profits by 60 per cent after five years. The first step is to find the right customers - those that are likely to stay for the long haul - and also identify the wrong ones - those that are transient or a drain on a company's resources. While it is not always easy to spot the stayers, those who come through personal referral are usually more loyal than those responding to an advertisement. Older people and home owners are more likely to stay. For each company the target group of customers will be different; the more homogeneous the group the easier - and cheaper - it will be to address their needs. The next step is to develop a strategy to win this type of customer. A cut-price promotion is almost certainly a waste of time, as it will invite those likely to defect. Attempts to recover defectors may also backfire if those customers are disloyal by nature. Once it has found its target customers, a company must keep them sweet. This involves not only a dedication to quality of product and service, but also to serving evolving needs. One US company practised this 'lifecycle marketing' to effect by supplying the increasingly chubby middle-aged consumers of its fattening cakes a fat-free alternative. Companies should take care when they monitor the customers that leave. Somebody who stops buying dog food because the dog has died is not worth pursuing, while one who has switched to another brand may present a serious challenge: the company must find out why its product has been shunned. Another way of keeping customers is to keep workers, on the grounds that long-serving employees are more in tune with what faithful customers want. This means being generous with pay, and structuring incentives so that bonuses are based on customer retention and commissions on how long the customer stays with the company. It also means choosing employees with great care; the length of time a candidate has spent with a previous employer could be as critical as their qualifications. In the UK some of these ideas are being practised in insurance and financial sectors, where companies have long treated different sorts of customers differently. Other companies have been too keen on getting costs down to think about much else. Yet on Price Waterhouse's evidence nine out of 10 companies recognise that customer retention should be an important part of their strategy. It may be just a matter of time before they start to do something about it.</p>

"We are so poor it's better if I try to hijack a plane to  Taiwan," Gao Guangkai told his mother before making his failed  attempt on November 26 to hijack a flight between the eastern  city of Nanjing and Fuzhou. Gao, 29, is from a family of five  children living in a village in the underdeveloped eastern  province of Anhui. He was a temporary sawmill worker, the  newspaper said.    The plane, which Gao threatened to blow up with a bomb  concealed in his travel bag, finally landed at the airport in  Hangzhou, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Nanjing. Gao was  quickly apprehended by police. Gao's bag did not contain  explosives, only a few personal effects and 26 yuan (four  dollars), the newspaper said.    Ten Chinese planes were hijacked to Taiwan in 1993, although  there were two other known attempts. The hijackers face lengthy  prison terms in Taiwan and officials there refuse to return them  to the mainland as demanded by Beijing.</p>

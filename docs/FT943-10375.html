			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology: Calling time on Wall Street - The move to a three-day settlement period is a technological nightmare When US regulators studied the stock market crash of 1987, they agreed that one factor had a pervasive, negative impact - time. Trades were taking so long to settle that it took days before investors had an exact idea of their losses. 'Time equals risk' became a maxim of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities market watchdog. As a result, the agency mandated a June 1995 deadline for Wall Street to move from five-day to three-day settlement of stocks and bonds. The change, dubbed 'T plus Three' (trade-plus-three), represents a big step in improved efficiency in the US markets, but a technological nightmare for Wall Street. Every computer instruction for five-day settlement must now be changed to three. 'We process 160,000 trades a day, and each trade generates several confirmations,' says Bruce Garland, vice-president of the Depository Trust Company, a US settlement and clearing house. 'That means an awful lot of changes in computer entries.' Everyone acknowledges that the price tag will be hefty. Hopes that the SEC would push back the deadline have been dashed and firms are beginning to scramble in order to be ready in time. Regulators hope the industry will face lower risk under the T plus Three system. As things stand now, a full five days lapse before trades are confirmed and paid for. This leaves ample time for misunderstandings and credit failures. Under three-day settlement, all parties will be sure where they stand within three days of the trade date. 'No one wants to wait five days to find out their trading tickets are wrong,' says Garland. 'The whole system needs to move faster.' Despite its cost and challenge, the new T plus Three rule represents a significant opportunity for the US securities industry to reassess its technological capacity and adapt to current needs and future demands. 'Since companies have to re-evaluate their technology anyway, it makes sense to use this opportunity to re-engineer their entire work flow and prepare themselves technologically for the future,' says Michael Reddy, chairman of FACS Corporation, the consultancy which is advising companies on the T plus Three change. Under three-day settlement, speed will become vital, and companies are likely to rely increasingly on electronic communication to quicken the pace. By encouraging computerised confirmation, clearing and delivery, the new system will help push Wall Street towards paperless trading. Some changes may also be in store for retail customers, as placing buy and sell orders from home computers becomes easier. In the near future, purchases may even be electronically debited to customers' credit cards or bank accounts. One of the key systems allowing for rapid settlement is the Depository Trust Company's 'interactive institutional delivery', nicknamed interactive ID, which allows firms to confirm trades in real time. In the past, firms filed all their transactions together at the end of the day with the DTC. However, regulators fear that with settlement dates moved up, the system would overload with the entire industry reporting at the same time. 'If firms don't start to use interactive ID regularly, the system will break down,' says Reddy. The SEC is even considering making the use of interactive ID mandatory for certain trades. Under the interactive ID system, a broker sends information back to the institutional investor through electronic DTC hookup. The institution confirms in a matter of minutes. DTC then sends confirmation to the institution, broker and the institution's agent. The system could be adapted to send confirmation to personal computers linked to the DTC network or even to faxes. Although the ultimate goal is for firms to report and confirm trades within minutes of their execution, many companies still do not have the ability to do so. DTC says it is therefore encouraging firms to report several times a day, referred to as 'multi-batch', in order to prepare for a shift to real time. 'Technology is only as good as its weakest link,' says Stuart Goldstein, a spokesman for the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a Wall Street clearing house. 'To really move to real time, the entire industry has to do so, not just a few players.' The NSCC is trying to speed up settlement by reducing the number of physical certificates that must change hands. The company plans to operate a vault to be shared by all clients. When the certificates change hands, it is simply noted by computer entry at the NSCC. The NSCC is also working with the SEC to replace physical securities now required for certain commercial paper and initial public offerings with electronic certificates. One of the main concerns on Wall Street is to build flexibility into any new technologies to facilitate modifications later on. 'We need a technological platform from which to grow. Volume levels continue to grow, and we'll need to be able to handle that. Rules might change too, and we need to meet those new demands,' says Goldstein. One rule that may change before the end of the decade is a further tightening of settlement time. 'T plus One is not that far away,' says Reddy. Crucial to ensuring flexibility are 'relationship databases'. In the past, most Wall Street firms wrote computer programs on a step-by-step basis. One step would affect another, but the computer could not see how by itself. Any change in the system, therefore, would require a programmer to rewrite each step individually. Under the increasingly used relationship databases, the computer program is built around functions. Change one step and the computer automatically does the rest. As Wall Street sheds its reliance on paper, demand for certificates continues to fall. The SEC has launched an educational campaign to convince brokers and investors that in most cases, electronic confirmation is as good as a physical document.</p>

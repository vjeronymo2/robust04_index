The FY 1994 range of project support for new and competing continuation awards will be approximately $5,000 to $75,000. Under this program, States enter into agreements with public or private nonprofit community organizations located in federally designated HPSAs. These organizations will recruit qualified residents of their communities and provide scholarships to them to become physicians, certified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or physician assistants based on the needs of the communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This grant program is intended to be consistent with the efforts of the NHSC Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs to meet the needs of underserved populations in federally designated HPSAs through the placement of primary care practitioners. For purposes of this program, the term ``primary health care'' means health services regarding family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology, that are provided by physicians, certified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or physician assistants. The Secretary is required by statute [section 338L(l)(3) of the PHS Act] to ensure that, to the extent practicable, not less than 50 percent of the amount appropriated will be in the aggregate expended by the States for making grants to community organizations that are located in rural federally designated HPSAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for a State to receive a grant under this program, the State must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

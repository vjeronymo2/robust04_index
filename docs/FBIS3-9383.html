			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Petrovac, March 23 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem  battles in the Bihac-Cazin region (Moslem enclave in western  Bosnia) continued on Wednesday and the command of troops loyal  to the Sarajevo Moslem authorities admitted that the fighting so  far left about 500 dead and 2,000 wounded Moslems. This is the  first time that forces of radical Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic admitted to sustaining heavy losses both in manpower  and weaponry in the battles with the Moslems of the autonomous  province of western Bosnia. In western Bosnia the opponents of  Izetbegovic clashed last September with the forces loyal to the  Sarajevo authorities who were ordered to use all means to curb  the new autonomy. The new province's media reports that the army  of the province's president, Fikret Abdic, is slowly advancing  towards Liskovac, Krivaja and Trsce without suffering any losses  while Izetbegovic's troops are sustaining heavy losses. Moslem  Sarajevo Radio confirmed these reports and added that the  fighting is spreading to the other border area in the Cazin  region and that all types of weapons are in use.    Over the past 24 hours, Izetbegovic's troops in the region  of  Bihac, western Bosnia, opened sporadic fire on Serb positions  along the entire frontline, Bosnian Serb military sources said.  According to them, the Serbs did not have any casualties and did  not return fire. The Moslem forces in the region of Doboj,  northern Bosnia, continued offensive amd provocative actions on  Serb positions and settlements, the Bosnian Serb military  sources said.    The Moslem troops were especially agressive in the  southwestern Trebava front (northeast of Doboj) where they  attempted to penetrate Serb defence lines. Similar to the  previous nine attacks in the past week, the latest one was  unsuccessful.</p>

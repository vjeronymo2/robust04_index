			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leaders of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party], PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PFL [Liberal  Front Party], PL [Liberal Party], PP [Popular Party], and PPB  [Brazilian People's Party] promised President Itamar Franco that  they would not attend the congressional session today to vote on  the provisional measure that converts salaries into URV's [Real  Value Units].    According to Senator Jose Richa, the idea is to wait and  allow the government to reedit on 29 March the provisional  measure with changes clarifying the date for salary conversions  into URV. This will thus put a final end to the political  crisis among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.</p>

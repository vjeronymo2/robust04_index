			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 28 (CTK) -- The State Attorney's  Office for Prague's 2nd district has just received President  Vaclav Havel's letter of March 17 ordering criminal proceedings  against Petr Cibulka, publisher of the NECENZUROVANE NOVINY  [UNCENSORED NEWS] periodical accused of defamation of the  president of the republic, to be dropped.    Slavomir Novak from Prague's City State Attorney's Office  told CTK that the Office had already completed the charge which  would have probably been brought against Cibulka today or  tomorrow.    Cibulka was accused of defamation for calling Havel "you  swine, you bastard," during a court case last December. The  case had been brought against Havel by Cibulka and co-editor of  NECENZUROVANE NOVINY for the criticisms Havel had made of the  anti-communist newspaper's decision to publish -- in May 1992 --  a list of alleged collaborators with the StB, the former  communist secret police.    The defamation case was to have been resumed in April. After  the lawsuit was considered in December, Cibulka officially  queried the impartiality of the judge, and the case was not able  to proceed until the Supreme Court delivered judgment.</p>

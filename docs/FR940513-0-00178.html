The only lamp products on this list are ``general service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps.'' 42 U.S.C. 6292(a)(14). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended that any other lamp products be considered covered products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In issuing this rule, the Commission treats medium base compact fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps as covered products. If Congress intended to have these products treated as covered products, it could have included them on the list of covered products. Alternatively, Congress could have given the Commission the authority to add products to the list of covered products under certain conditions, like the authority it has conferred on the Department of Energy. 42 U.S.C. 6292(a)(19). Because Congress neither defined these lamp products as covered products nor gave the Commission the authority to define them as covered products, these lamp products, in my view, cannot be treated as covered products under the rule amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I dissent from the rule to the extent that it treats medium base compact fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps as covered products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11234 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

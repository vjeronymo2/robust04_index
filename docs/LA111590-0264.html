			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILLI VANILLI IS REALLY A MARCEL MARCEAU ACT;  </P> <P> MUSIC: ANOTHER GROUP RECORDED THE VOCALS THAT THE 1989 GRAMMY-WINNING DUO  SIMPLY LIP-SYNC, THEIR PRODUCER SAYS.  </P> <P> The rumors are true: Milli Vanilli -- those dreadlocked, hunky dudes Rob and  Fab -- never actually sang on their debut album that sold 7 million copies, the  producer-arranger conceded.  </P> <P> "The record company never knew that. I never told them anything," said Frank  Farian, the German producer who turned a pair of anonymous pretty boys into an  international phenomenon. "Later on, after the record was out, there were some  people who raised some questions."  </P> <P> The questions were never really answered as the Vanillis won a 1989 Grammy for  Best New Artist. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan became international stars,  lip-syncing their way through television and concert appearances.  </P> <P> "Girl You Know It's True" and "Blame It on the Rain" were huge hit singles for  the band. At the MTV awards, the boys boasted they were better than Elvis or  Bob Dylan.  </P> <P> Farian -- who has a new album with a new group coming out in January -- said he  was forced to go public with the revelations when the guys told him they wanted  to sing on the follow-up to "Girl You Know It's True."  </P> <P> "I said, 'No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice, but that's not  really what I want to use on my records," said Farian, describing the encounter  that occurred earlier this month.  </P> <P> So the bare-chested vocalists once described by the New York Times as  "exotically sexy" really did nothing but look good and lip sync for videos?  </P> <P> "Nothing more," Farian said through an interpreter during an interview here  Wednesday.  </P> <P> A telephone message left today to the group's manager in Germany was not  immediately returned.  </P> <P> Farian's revelation didn't bother Arista, the label that sold "Girl You Know  It's True."  </P> <P> "Seven million albums? Embarrassing?" asked Roy Lott, vice president for  operations at Arista. "I don't mean the end justifies the means. But we sold 7  million albums."  </P> <P> Lott said there was no reason to doubt Farian's veracity: "I certainly assume  the producer would know who sang on the record."  </P> <P> According to Farian, the idea to hire Rob and Fab as front men for the band  came to him when the fabulous bunko boys arrived at his studio in Germany  shortly after the recording of "Girl You Know It's True."  </P> <P> "It suddenly clicked in my mind, and it was kind of evident: I had the music,  there were the people who wanted to perform outside," Farian said. "And I said,  "Hey, let's put that together and make a great record out of it.' "  </P> <P> Farian would not say who the real singers were but added that they will appear  on his next album -- not a Milli Vanilli album.  </P> <P> Lott said the label is unconcerned about the dupe, and it plans to distribute  Farian's new album. Lott has heard some of the record already, and he said  "Frank has my full support."  </P> <P> As to Rob and Fab, well, their future's a bit more uncertain.  </P> <P> "We are purely their distributor. We do not have a specific deal with Rob or  Fab," Lott said.  </P></p>

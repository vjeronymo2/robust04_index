			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / SAS head leaves for Alcazar MR JAN CARLZON yesterday resigned as chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System, a post he had held for 12 years, to concentrate on the alliance between SAS, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The surprise move was a clear attempt by SAS and Mr Carlzon to add momentum to the so-called Alcazar project, which has slipped well behind the schedule the four airlines set for themselves when they announced their alliance plans in April this year. 'It is not our intention to put pressure on our partners, but it is our intention to show that we really mean business,' Mr Carlzon said. 'We have put a lot of effort into this project and we really believe it is the best solution for SAS and our partners in the long term.' Mr Carlzon said he would not resume his position as president and chief executive if the Alcazar project failed, saying he would not be suited to running what would be a 'stand-alone' SAS that would then be forced to contract. The Swedish, Danish and Norwegian-owned airline, which has been in loss for the past three years, further underlined its commitment to the alliance plan by appointing as Mr Carlzon's successor Mr Jan Reinas, head of SAS Norway. He is due to leave SAS to become president of Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp and paper company, next April, about the time Alcazar would be launched if it was agreed. SAS, KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines said they intended to forge a merged operation, with a single management structure and balance sheet, by next year when they unveiled the alliance plan in the spring. They envisaged creating a 'fourth force' among European airlines to compete with British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa. Who will head the new group is among problems still to be resolved. Mr Carlzon is clearly a candidate. But both he and SAS said only that he would 'join Alcazar's senior management if the negotiations are positive'. Lex, Page 20 Background, Page 26</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps regulates the discharge of fill material into waters of the United States, which include navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other waters. The Clean Eater Act requires project proponents to obtain a permit from the Corps prior to undertaking many activities (grading, discharge of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in fill of wetlands. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit 26 to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands totalling less than 4 hectares (10 acres). Under Nationwide Permit 26, proposals that involve fill of wetlands less than one acre are considered authorized. Where fill would aversely modify between 0.4 and 4.0 hectares (one and 10 acres) of wetland, the Corps circulates for comment a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties to determine whether or not an individual permit should be required for fill activity and associated impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual Corps permits are required for discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than 4 hectares (10 acres) of wetlands. The review process for individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require potential avoidance or mitigation for environmental impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an individual permit if the Corps believes that resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In practice, however, the Corps generally does not require an individual permit when a project qualifies for a nationwide permit, unless a threatened or endangered species or other significant resources would be adversely affected by the proposed activity. Most vernal pools and swales within the range of these three species of fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp encompass less that 4 hectares (10 acres). The discontinuous distribution of these sites has allowed some landowners to divide large projects into several smaller projects. Wetland acreage on these smaller projects is usually under 4 hectares (10 acres), and therefore, most projects qualify for Nationwide Permit 26. Discing and other farming or ranching practices, including overgrazing, can destroy vernal pool habitat without a permit from the Corps because many of these activities are exempt from regulation under the Clean Water Act. The discontinuous configuration of the pools and swales further obscures separation of these wetland losses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sacramento District of the Corps has several thousand vernal pools under its jurisdiction (Coe 1988), which includes most of the geographic range encompassing the four species listed herein. Areas occupied by these animals are undergoing rapid urbanization and current trends indicate 60 to 70 percent of these pools could be destroyed in the next 10 to 20 years (Coe 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Conservancy fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are found in vernal pools within the Vina Plains in Tehama County. They likely are found in the vicinity of ephemeral swales and drainages that support  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limnanthes floccosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> calfornica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Butte County meadowfoam). This plant was listed as an endangered species on June 8, 1992 (57 FR 24192). These crustaceans could be protected indirectly by actions taken to conserve the Butte County meadowfoam. A ``conservation plan'' has been drafted for the City of Chico (Jokerst 1989) that details various actions designed to conserve the plant, such as creation of a preserve system. However, the draft plan does not address plant populations and vernal pool habitat outside city limits. Moreover, the City of Chico has yet to adopt the plan. Meanwhile, typical of other vernal pool areas, the Corps continues to use nationwide permits to authorize numerous residential developments in the Chico area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Conservancy fairy shrimp and the longhorn fairy shrimp each have portions of one population on lands under public ownership. Portions of four populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp are on lands under public ownership. Portions of eight populations of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are on lands under public ownership. The Nature Conservancy owns or controls portions of vernal pool habitat, including Jepson Prairie in Solano County, Vina Plains in Tehama County, the Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County, and Santa Rosa Plateau area in Riverside County. All three fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp occur on Conservancy property. Management plans for some Federal, State, local, and Conservancy properties include provisions to protect vernal pools but none specifically address these species. Surrounding privately owned vernal pool habitat and watershed are not protected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other natural or man-made factors affecting their continued existence. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The pools and, in some cases, pool complexes supporting the fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are usually small and unforeseen natural and man-caused catastrophic events threaten the elimination of some sites. Many of the known populations of the four species are comprised of single or less than five pools (e.g., 3 of 6 Conservancy fairy shrimp populations, 1 of 3 longhorn fairy shrimp populations, 20 of 34 vernal pool fairy shrimp populations, 1 of the 18 vernal pool tadpole shrimp populations). In many cases, these populations are remnants of larger, multi-pool populations that originally existed in historic vernal pool complexes. Such populations are important for their genetic uniqueness, which has been documented for the Conservancy fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Fugate 1993; J. King pers. comm. 1992). However, these important populations are those that have the most tenuous chances for long-term persistence due to population bottlenecks in conjunction with low gene flow between populations (J. King pers. comm. 1993). Additionally, some of the areas with the largest populations (i.e., greatest number of vernal pools remaining in pool complexes) are currently under threat of fragmentation by numerous proposed projects (e.g., Sacramento and Placer Counties). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

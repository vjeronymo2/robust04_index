			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> Sajudis, the Lithuanian grass-roots political organization, has conducted a  policy of non-discrimination toward minorities in that country.  </P> <P> A brief examination of the record would reveal not a single incident of  religious or ethnic discrimination on its part.  </P> <P> Admonitions from the White House in this regard are, therefore, unnecessary and  unwelcome. White House support for the full restoration of independence to  Lithuania, on the other hand, would be most welcome. It would be a courageous  act for the United States to give unqualified support to democratic movements  in the countries forcibly incorporated into the Soviet bloc 50 years ago.  </P> <P> JULIA PETRAUSKAS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

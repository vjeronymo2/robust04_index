			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIN DELAYS, CANCELS 20 AMTRAK TRAINS  </P> <P> Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or canceled Wednesday, with passengers  put on buses as heavy rain covered tracks along sections of the railroad's  heavily traveled Northeast corridor, officials said.  </P> <P> Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were affected by the  flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington, Del., with six inches of  water and debris. One of three lines was reopened Wednesday, but repair crews  were working to build up the damaged roadbed on the other two.  </P> <P> Trains were creeping through the area at 5 m.p.h., delaying by about 30 minutes  service on regular trains and the Metroliner express between New York City and  Washington, Black said.  </P> <P> Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. were  canceled, he said. The train normally runs every hour from New York and  Washington, with regular trains on the half hour.  </P> <P> "Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train operations severly  disrupted," Black said.  </P> <P> The rain came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> RED HOLLOWAY, STACY ROWLES TEAMED AT INDIGO CLUB  </P> <P> At the Indigo Jazz Club in the Compton Lazben Hotel a new jazz partnership is  being tried out this week, as the saxophonist Red Holloway locks horns with the  trumpeter Stacy Rowles.  </P> <P> Though there had clearly been no rehearsal and the group had no original  material to lend it a personal character, the results were generally  encouraging.  </P> <P> The set opened with Rowles playing fluegelhorn and Holloway on alto sax playing  that most insipid of vehicles, "Mack the Knife," but once past the theme, they  used its adequate harmonic patterns and some fast and fluent blowing.  </P> <P> Switching to trumpet and tenor sax, they tackled "Things Ain't What They Used  to Be," which, as a blues, was a natural vehicle for them. On "Caravan," Paul  Humphrey offered a fittingly exotic introduction, using mallets, and altering  the pitch by moving his elbows around the drums.  </P> <P> Rowles had her own solo workout with a lyrical "Emily" and Holloway found  hard-cooking new ways to deal with "Love for Sale," partly in waltz time.  </P> <P> Completing the group were Richard Reid, a strong and supportive bass player,  and the pianist Dwight Dickerson, whose "Prelude to a Kiss" was a mite too  flowery but never dull. Holloway's attempts to sing the blues was amusing, but  he could use a fresher and more cohesive set of lyrics.  </P> <P> The finale, "Mood Indigo," which seems to have become the theme song for this  room, underwent major surgery as the band doubled the time, then quadrupled it  -- hardly an indigo mood, but one that achieved a spirited level of creation as  Rowles and Holloway met the challenge.  </P> <P> The only problem was a noisy, yakking, inconsiderate audience. Visitors who  catch the group before its Saturday closing, are advised to find a seat close  to the music. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: CRA bid for Cail given boost THE ADollars 716m (USDollars 487m) bid for Coal and Allied Industries (Cail) by CRA, the Australian resources group, appeared certain to succeed yesterday after Cail's independent directors said some shareholders should accept the offer. CRA was given a further lift when Mr Tony Haraldson, Cail chief executive, and Mr Michael Blackham, deputy chief executive, said they would sell part of their personal shareholdings. 'If I thought there was a chance that CRA would not get control, I would not be accepting for my shares,' Mr Haraldson said. 'I have a significant financial exposure that I would like to reduce somewhat.' Cail's independent directors said medium to long-term investors should reject the ADollars 11.50 a share offer because it was not high enough. However, they advised shareholders with 'short-term liquidity requirements' to accept. Grant Samuel and Associates, Australia's premier valuation company, valued Cail shares at between ADollars 12.49 and ADollars 14.61 a share and described the bid as reasonable in a report included with the Cail directors' statement. Cail issued revised profit forecasts for the next three years, which it hoped would persuade institutional shareholders to keep all or part of their holdings. The company forecast net profit of ADollars 55.45m in 1992-93, well above market forecasts of ADollars 45m to ADollars 50m. It said net profit would rise to ADollars 75.15m in 1993-94 and ADollars 83.95m in the following year. He said the company had completed a capital expenditure programme, and forecast that improved productivity would help it benefit from any increase in coal prices. The offer is CRA's second attempt to gain control of Cail, which is the biggest coal mining group in New South Wales. CRA owns 40 per cent of Cail following a ADollars 8.50 a share offer in 1991. Directors of McIlwraith McEacharn, the Australian coal and transport group, yesterday gave unanimous support to a ADollars 1.95-a-share takeover offer from Cyprus Minerals of the US, which values the group at ADollars 82.3m. The directors said they had asked the Australian Securities Commission to allow shareholders who accept the offer to retain the interim dividend of 1.25 cents a share. McIlwraith said it required 'significant financial support' to develop its main asset, a 40 per cent holding in Oakbridge, a NSW coal producer.</p>

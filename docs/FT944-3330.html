			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Money lenders' 'boys' are women The image of money lenders as people who threaten to 'send the boys round' if payments from their borrowers are not maintained is subverted by a study published today - at least so far as legal money lending is concerned. It says that most of the 27,000 agents collecting payments for licensed money lenders are women working part-time, and that the social aspects of the work are among the factors attracting them to the job. The report for the independent Policy Studies Institute suggests that there are some positive reasons, such as the availability of small loans and doorstep collection, for using money lenders. But it also highlights the extremely high annualised percentage rates of interest - up to 500 per cent - that customers can be charged, partly as a result of such expensive and time-consuming collection methods. The study also criticises money lenders who encourage borrowers to take a further loan automatically when an existing debt had been paid. It says there are about 3m customers of legal money lenders, most of whom are women aged between 30 and 60. Most borrowers, it says, find it hard to repay their loans, with one-third sometimes missing payments and one-third paying smaller amounts or meeting payments only with difficulty.

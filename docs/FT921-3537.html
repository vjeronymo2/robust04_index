			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / School results poor in maths and science ENGLAND and Wales lag far behind Asian and other European states in the maths and science attainment of their schoolchildren, according to an international league table published yesterday. Scotland's performance was significantly better. The table, published in Britain by the National Foundation for Educational research, follows research on the relative performance of pupils aged between nine and 13 in up to 20 countries in Europe, the US, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It places South Korea's nine-year-olds as the clear winners in maths - with a score of 75 per cent on comparable tests. Out of 14 countries, Scotland came fourth (with 66 per cent) and England 11th (with 59 per cent). Behind England were the US (58 per cent), Slovenia (56 per cent) and Portugal (55 per cent). Among 13-year-olds China came top, with Scotland and England achieving a middle ranking. England showed a marked weakness in basic arithmatic, with barely half of nine-year-olds capable of multiplying seven and nine - compared with 96 per cent in South Korea and 69 per cent in the US. In science, English and Scottish pupils secured roughly average scores.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "`Tortoise' Delors is Holding </F> Back EC, Says Clarke"]    [Text] Brussels -- The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke,  launched a sharp attack on M Jacques Delors, the president of  the European Commission, yesterday, characterising him as a  bureaucrat resisting the reform of his institution and producing  change "at the pace of a tortoise".    Mr Clarke's outburst is only the latest of a series of  highly  public clashes between the Socialist M Delors and Mr Clarke.  Late last year they quarrelled over the cost to Britain of  implementing the EC's clean water directive as well as over M  Delors's masterplan to jump-start the European economy with  job-creating infrastructural investments funded by large-scale  borrowing.    Yesterday, finance ministers were holding a regular meeting  in Brussels at which they discussed a German proposal to set up  a "deregulation taskforce", an advisory group of businessmen  which would advise the EC on cutting back on red tape.    Britain strongly supports the idea. "We are lagging in  making  any real progress on removing the burden of excessive regulation  of competitive industries," Mr Clarke explained. But at the  meeting, M Delors protested strongly, arguing that this sort of  outside advice risked undermining the authority of the  Commission and proposing instead limited consultation between  businesses and individual units of the Commission. Mr Clarke  said: "Mr Delors has given a perfect illustration of how a  bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures. He is  impervious to the suggestion."    He said that M Delors's proposals "would produce progress at  the pace of a tortoise . . . I think it is a pity that the  outgoing president has reacted so strongly in favour of the  status quo. It is no good leaving these reforms to the  Commission."    Mr Clarke also condemned M Delors for discussing the  follow-up to his White Paper (the master-plan he produced last  December) only with foreign ministers and not with finance  ministers. This has long been a sore point with Mr Clarke, who  feels that those who control the purse-strings are  insufficiently consulted as M Delors spins his grandiose  schemes.    Earlier, Mr Clarke had lashed out at M Delors's number two,  Commission vice-president Henning Christophersen. Last week Mr  Christophersen produced estimates showing that Britain's growth  rate, the highest in Europe this year, will fall back next year  to one of the lowest.    Mr Clarke said: "The figures are plainly wrong. The  Commission has made a mistake. They are only forecasts, and  forecasts are often wrong." Later, he returned to the subject:  "I think they are wrong. The IMF thinks they are wrong, and  most independent forecasters think they are wrong." But he was  forced to concede that the difference between Mr  Christophersen's estimate and Treasury figures was only 0.2  percent, well within the accepted margin of error.</p>

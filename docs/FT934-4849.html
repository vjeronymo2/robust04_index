			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Argentine judge quits under heavy pressure One of Argentina's nine Supreme Court justices resigned yesterday after a week of intense political pressure on him to quit. Mr Rodolfo Barra said he left because of Argentina's 'process of constitutional reform'. One of five justices appointed by President Carlos Menem after he took office in 1989, he was close to the government. Turmoil in the Court is due to demands by the ruling Peronist and opposition Radical parties that at least three court justices resign. On Tuesday, Mr Antonio Boggiano resigned as court president after five colleagues said they no longer recognised his authority, after charges that he had tried to replace a court ruling against the central bank with a favourable one.</p>

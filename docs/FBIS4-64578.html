			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "The Pawn of the Eurorebels"] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 3 May -- The European Parliament is  flexing its muscles. The European Unions's accession treaties  with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway require its approval,  which is not a certainty, however. It is not so much being  questioned by declared opponents to the membership of these  countries but by the majority of frustrated members of the  European Parliament, who are afraid that the Strasbourg assembly  might never again rise from the shadowy existence of its  fragmentary powers. For this reason, the rebels do not want to  approve of the agreements this evening unless the governments  promise them real parliamentary rights. They also fear that a  group of 16 will not be able to achieve things that the Twelve  have failed to accomplish.    It is easy for the deputies to revolt, because they do not  have to declare themselves but can simply press the "no" button.  Since it is not a majority of votes cast that is required, but  a majority of the total number of 518 members of the European  Parliament, staying away from the vote is enough to prevent the  passing of the agreements. "There is strong resistance against  the acceptance of new members because it would entail a shift of  the European focal point eastward and thus strengthen Germany's  position," Ingo Friedrich, a member of the Christian Social  Union, pointed out. They do not admit this, however, but  pretend that they are worried about the further development of  integration -- the "deepening" of the community.    Thus, there is a great deal of hypocrisy involved,  particularly among some of the French. During the negotiations  about the Maastricht Treaty, Italy, the Benelux countries, and  Germany vigorously insisted on a democratization of the  community, that is on more powers for the Strasbourg assembly.  Yet Paris and London were against it. French members who did  not lift a finger at the time to increase the power of the  European Parliament are now raising the objection that the Union  should not be enlarged before it is "deepened."    However, one cannot only speak of hypocrisy in Strasbourg.  The overwhelming majority of MP's have indeed reason to rebel,  because the governments even increased their fears during the  accession talks. "Deepening before enlargement" was the motto  under which the deputies wanted to advance the process of  integration. The opposite seems to be the case now: Enlargement  and gradually slower integration. They cannot silently accept  that Great Britain has forced the partners to water down the  qualified majority vote in the Council of Ministers of an  enlarged community.    Still, most of the deputies know that they must not prevent  the enlargement if they want to keep the community together.  Yet the question is how many are still interested and will  participate in the vote. A total of 50 percent of the present  deputies will not be returned to the parliament after the  European elections.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / People: Tepnel Diagnostics Tepnel Diagnostics, the biotechnology company which joined the USM last month, has appointed Sir David Trippier as its executive chairman. Tepnel, which is based at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, has developed diagnostic testing systems designed to detect the presence of residual antibiotic or other contamination in foods and of viral and bacterial conditions in blood. The original chairman and chief executive, Harold Morley, has decided to split the two roles, and to concentrate on developing business opportunities. He remains chief executive; Terry Colley becomes marketing director. Alec Craig, a partner with Manchester solicitors, Halliwell Landau, where Sir David is a consultant, has been appointed a non-executive director. Sir David (left), who lost his Rossendale seat at the general election, has picked up several jobs since then: non-executive directorships at St Modwen Properties, based in Birmingham, at Dunlop Heywood, consultant surveyors with headquarters in Manchester, and at PP, a computer services company based in his former constituency, Rossendale. Last week he also took on another role as consultant to Halliday Meecham, a medium-sized firm of architects in the north west, where he will advise on urban development initiatives.</p>

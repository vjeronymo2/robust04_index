			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spain acts to resolve peach crisis EUROPEAN PEACH dealers had their eyes and ears fixed on Spain yesterday following rumours that two markets had offered large quantities of peaches for sale to the Spanish intervention board in an effort to rescue the European market from crisis. The ministry of agriculture in Madrid confirmed that both Zaragoza and Murtia markets were planning to offer smaller-sized peaches for public sale, although until prices were known, quantities remained uncertain. Mr Guardo Angel, a technical adviser at the ministry, said the Spanish markets hoped success would mean a quick end to the crisis, which had been dogging them for the past 10 days. The crisis was made official a week ago by the European parliament. It began in Zaragoza on July 27 and 28 when the price for Jeronimo peaches fell below the European crisis level of Ecu20.62 or Pta37.68 (18p) a kg to Pta36.4. Before the crisis can be declared over officially the markets will have to sell above the crisis point for three consecutive days. A Brussels official said the situation had been caused more by a lack of public demand for peaches all over Europe than by excessive volumes entering the market. He said recession-torn European consumers had been cutting back on fruit and vegetables rather than potatoes, bread, meat or fish. Mr Angel also blamed higher than normal production levels in Spain. A similar situation involving Portugal as well as Spain arose last year.</p>

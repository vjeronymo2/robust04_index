			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Stress blamed for failed mergers MERGERS and acquisitions frequently fail to live up to financial expectations because companies place too much importance on finance, and spend too little time planning for the stressful effects of change on their staff. That is the finding of a three-year study of mergers and acquisitions being unveiled today by occupational psychologists. More than half of all mergers and acquisitions do not achieve their financial potential in spite of being presented to shareholders as a strategy for wealth creation, according to psychologists Dr Sue Cartwright and Professor Cary Cooper from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. In addition, mergers and acquisitions 'have become associated with lowered productivity, higher labour turnover and absenteeism, worse strike records and poorer accident rates'. While companies examine in detail the financial considerations of taking over or merging with another organisation, the 'people' issues are very much of an afterthought, Dr Cartwright and Professor Cooper will tell the British Psychological Society's annual occupational psychology conference in Liverpool. The consequence is that even a genuine merger between highly compatible companies is often perceived as a takeover by the staff, the researchers say. Mergers are found to be more stressful because of the greater degree of ambiguity and the frequently long periods of uncertainty while negotiations are in progress. Middle managers are found to be the most stressed group because they are not close enough to the top to know exactly what is going on, but still have to manage the fears of more junior staff. For example, a detailed study of the mental health of 157 middle managers after the merger of two building societies found the managers had 'adverse mental health scores significantly higher than the normal population', and an 'abnormally high percentage' recorded scores 'comparable with psycho-neurotic hospital outpatients'. Because of the secrecy surrounding acquisitions and mergers, companies do not learn from each other's mistakes. 'Culture audits' need to be conducted before companies combine so the best aspects of each organisation can be brought to the new joint venture, the researchers conclude.

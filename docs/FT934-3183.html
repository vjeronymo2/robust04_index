			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Spain has head start on Delors jobs plan Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, who is grappling with the worst unemployment record in the European Union, has only an academic interest in discussing Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on competitiveness, growth and job creation at today's Brussels summit. The Spanish leader has already begun to implement many measures advocated in the Delors document. As Spain enters its second year of recession, Mr Gonzalez has unveiled a legislative package that aims to curb union bargaining power, reduce the costs of hiring and firing, make it easier to relocate employees and make job classifications more flexible. The government also plans to peg wage increases to below the inflation rate over the next three years. Parliament will debate a draft law to deregulate labour laws when it reassembles after Christmas. A law which came into effect earlier this week also introduces an apprenticeship scheme for under-25-year-olds who will be paid less than the minimum wage over a three-year period, and removes legal impediments to part-time work. The Brussels discussion will nevertheless help Mr Gonzalez as he tries to sell his package in Spain. 'The white paper is a useful umbrella to withstand the storm,' said a European diplomat yesterday. The legislation's main critics, the unions, accuse the government of creating 'junk jobs' and are planning a 24-hour general strike next month. But the government is determined to push its reforms through. It believes the general malaise afflicting the EU economy is sharper in Spain where labour market rigidities are deeply ingrained and labour costs are considered to have risen more quickly than elsewhere. The two ills are blamed for waning multinational interest. Direct foreign investment last year was nearly two thirds down on 1991, half that of the previous two years and at its lowest since 1987. Investment from OECD countries fell again in the first half of this year. The experience of Madrid corporate law firm J &amp; A Garrigues exemplifies Spain's declining competitiveness. In the past six months five multinationals seeking industrial bases for big investments have passed through the firm and, according to senior partner Mr Antonio Garrigues, one settled for the Czech Republic, another for Scotland, two went to Portugal and a fifth is undecided but has ruled Spain out. 'Three years ago at least two of the five would have chosen a Spanish location,' Mr Garrigues said. In the meantime unemployment stood was 3.5m at the end of September, representing 23 per cent of the working population. This figure from the national statistics office masks considerable employment in the informal, or submerged, economy but is nevertheless the highest in the EU.</p>

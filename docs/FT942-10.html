			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Women mean business Japanese companies may have cashed in on the success of the all-male J-League, but women's soccer in Japan has also benefited from corporate involvement. Although still relatively unknown, the women's league, established in 1989, has pulled itself out of obscurity due to participation of company teams two years ago. The dwindling league has increased its member teams from six to 10, and advertising by companies has helped double the number of women involved. However, recent sponsorship has been hit by the recession, and many companies have been forced to scale down their involvement in sport. Kumagai Gumi, a construction company, recently dissolved its baseball and basketball teams, while NKK, a leading steel maker, abolished its volleyball and soccer teams. Although times have also been tough for the securities industry, Nikko Securities, which owns the Nikko Dream Ladies soccer team, says it remains committed to the sport. Nikko was the first corporate-sponsored team to join the league, and the company has even brought players from Norway and the US to play in the team full time. 'When we first started I was more concerned about the cost and financial returns,' says Hitomu Hara, a general manager of Nikko Securities in charge of the team. 'But then I realised that there was more to having a team than financial benefit.' He says that Nikko now wants to raise public awareness of the sport. But unlike the J-League, women's soccer may take longer to become popular. Non-Japanese players point out that cultural differences still present barriers in the game. Gunn Nyborg, a former member of the Norwegian national team and now a midfield player for Nikko, says Japanese women players are less driven by the desire to prevail as individuals and try to win through collective efforts as a team. She also points out that the rise in women's soccer in the west has been closely linked to the women's movement. In a country where equality between men and women has hardly managed to take root, it may take time for the sport to gain wide acceptance. But unlike in Norway, where the teams are club-oriented and players have a harder time supporting themselves financially, the Japanese corporate system offers security. As long as Japan organises its league system and invests in coaches from Europe, in 10 years' time Japanese female soccer will join international ranks.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican losses reversed Mexico Stock prices reversed earlier losses to end firmer on a wave of technical buying, analysts said. The key IPC index of 36 top shares gained 8.5 points, a rise of 0.38 pe rcent, to close at 2,239.23 after falling as low as 2,193.92 earlier in the session. Interest rates on benchmark 28-day treasury bills or Cetes were raised by 24 basis points to 16.49 per cent. A flood of buy orders, the bulk of them for Telmex, came in shortly before the closing bell. Some 36m shares of Telmex traded out of total turnover of 86.91m. Telmex L shares, which may be held by foreigners, ended up 0.64 per cent while the A shares ended unchanged. Despite the positive finish, declining shares topped advancing shares 32 to 25. Advancing issues were led by Bufete CPO series, rising 11.11 per cent, Dina, up 5.88 per cent, Nadro L series, gaining 3.5 per cent, and Cemex CPO shares, also up 3.5 per cent. Venezuela Shares on the Caracas stock exchange climbed strongly after the central bank said that it was to hold an auction of dollars in an attempt to ease pressure on the bolivar. The Merinvest composite index rose 6.8 per cent to 112.39, recovering all of Monday's losses. Electricidad de Caracas put on 34.50 bolivars to 310 bolivars.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Dragan Milosavljevic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 24 (TANJUG) -- Vatican's proposal to  western political centres in late January that Bosnia should not  be divided and that NATO steps up pressure on the Serbs, is  turning into open pressure for the renewal of the Croat-Moslem  coalition.    Vatican's re-involvement and its pressure on Zagreb to  return  to the anti-Serb coalition with the Islamic fundamentalists  rallied around Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic, aim to  oust Russia from the Balkans and give the United Nations a role  inferior to NATO.    Following talks with Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal  Toran, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic confirmed that the  Holy See had assessed as positive Croatia's acceptance of its  proposals, Radio Vatican reports.    The turnabout of the Croatian policy in Bosnia, which is  also  based on the ceasefire agreement with the Moslems, could have  been unreservedly accepted only by those who are poorly informed  about Vatican's underlaying strategy and who see this region as  the threshold of Catholicism.    The unnatural alliance with the 'isle' of Islam in Europe,  imposed by Vatican, is only the initial stage in pushing back  the orthodox religion over the Drina river which separates the  Bosnian Serbs from their brothers in the east.    In view of this, it is hardly surprising that the agreement  between the Serbian and Croatian presidents, Slobodan Milosevic  and Franjo Tudjman, on the gradual normalization of relations,  was strongly criticized by Vatican.    The Catholic Church, and specially Cardinal Kuharic in  Zagreb  and Archbishop Vinko Puljac in Sarajevo, were given the task of  preventing any kind of rapproachment in the interest of peace  between Zagreb and Belgrade.    In view of the pressure by Germany, Italy and the Holy See  to  freeze Croatia's military presence in Bosnia, the Serbs are  still described as the aggressors and threatened with possible  new ultimatums, while the Russian initiative for a summit  meeting of the five big powers on the Bosnian crisis, is viewed  as unfavourable.</p>

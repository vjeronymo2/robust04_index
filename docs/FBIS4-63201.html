			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The Black Sea navy command  today called on all the political leaders, involved in the  current events in the Crimea, to do their best to settle all the  arising disputes by peaceful political means.    Political instability in the Crimea and the situation around  naval bases, says an official statement issued by the Black Sea  navy press centre today, engenders moral and psychological  tension in military units. No matter how the situation  develops, the Black Sea navy will not be able to keep aloof of  the processes occurring around it. This alarms the command of  the navy, its officers and noncoms.    The statement says that not a single regional conflict was  solved by armed force over the past twenty years. The wars in  Nagorno- Karabakh, Yugoslavia and Abkhazia show that the  ordinary people suffer from the hostilities, but not those who  unleash them. The Black Sea navy command relies on the wisdom  and good will of the peoples and the political representative  they had elected.    The winter training is about to end on the Black Sea navy.  The press centre's statement says that exercises of different  forces are proceeding according to schedule. Taking part in  them are warships, auxiliary vessels, and aircraft.</p>

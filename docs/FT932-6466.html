			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Dream job that became a rough ride WHEN Mr Norman Lamont became chancellor of the exchequer in November 1990 he got the job that he had always wanted. Yet few post-war British politicians have had such a rough ride in one of the great offices of state. He would be less than human not to feel more than a little embittered. In recent interviews Mr Lamont has made much of the fact that finance ministers cannot expect to be popular. It is also clear that many of his off-the-cuff remarks have been reported out of context. But unpopularity is something a politician carries off more easily when he or she is equipped with a suitable aura of gravitas. This eluded him. Instead his chancellorship was punctuated by stories that were sometimes bizarre, sometimes comical but invariably damaging. He forgot to pay his hotel bill after one Tory party conference. He exceeded the spending limit on his credit card bill and the news was leaked to the press. His Notting Hill home was rented to a sex therapist after the Lamont family moved to Number 11. The chancellor's response - to hire London's most expensive libel lawyers to handle the press fall-out - was to have serious political repercussions when it emerged that part of the bill was paid by the Treasury. Mr Lamont's chancellorship was never going to be easy. He took over stewardship of the economy just as it was moving quickly into recession. Unemployment, at 1.75m, was starting a rapid rise that was to lift the jobless level to about 3m at the start of this year and bring the grim experiences of the loss of job and home to many thousands of Tory voters in the south of England who had not experienced the direct impact of earlier recessions. At the same time the UK's public finances were starting the slide that has left the government with a borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn a week. Worse, Mr Lamont's scope for policy action was severely limited by Britain's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 at the ambitious central rate of DM2.95 to the pound. As Britain was sliding into recession Germany was struggling to control the inflationary boom triggered by unification. The UK became saddled with tough monetary conditions that were set by the Bundesbank to deal with Germany's problems. The chancellor's difficulties were compounded by his knack of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Hence, unemployment was 'a price worth paying'. He was 'singing in the bath' after Black Wednesday of September 16 last year, when sterling was ignominiously forced out of the ERM. And a light-hearted answer - 'Je ne regrette rien' - to a question during the recent Newbury by-election campaign left the impression that the government was uncaring and the chancellor unfeeling. A Eurosceptic by nature, Mr Lamont mishandled relations with some of Britain's EC partners and in particular with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German Bundesbank president. The chancellor's attempt to force the Bundesbank to cut its interest rates early last September was an important element in the worsening of relations between the two countries ahead of Black Wednesday. Yet his chancellorship was not without its achievements. Freed of the ERM constraints, he presided over a sharp fall in bank base rates from 10 per cent in September to 6 per cent and a substantial devaluation of sterling that so far has not been accompanied by any surge in inflation. Only last week it was announced that inflation as measured by the retail prices index had fallen to 1.3 per cent in April, its lowest level for nearly 30 years. The economy, stimulated by the sharp degree of monetary easing, has returned to growth. Although Mr Lamont can claim little credit for recovery, the UK is likely to be the fastest growing member of the EC this year. In the realm of fiscal policy Mr Lamont has been an innovator. It is doubtful, however, that he will go down as a significant tax reformer. Each of his three Budgets contained surprises. The first drew the sting out of the community charge by ingeniously cutting poll tax payments by Pounds 140 a person, albeit at the cost of adding 2.5 percentage points to VAT. The second stole the Labour party's thunder in the approach to the 1992 general election by introducing a new 20 per cent tax band. The third started the difficult task of redressing the UK's huge public sector deficit by announcing a Pounds 17bn programme of tax increases over two years. Mr Lamont leaves the Treasury with much unfinished business. The finance bill, which contains the measures announced in his March Budget, has just started passing through the committee stage of the Commons. Preparations are under way for the first unified Budget that in November will bring together plans for revenue raising and public spending. Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor, will benefit from a far better economic inheritance than that bequeathed to Mr Lamont, but the risks to recovery are considerable, with recession in continental Europe threatening to act as a drag on UK growth. The budget deficit, running at pounds 50bn a year, is overshadowing economic policy. That part of the legacy will almost certain present Mr Clarke with his toughest task.</p>

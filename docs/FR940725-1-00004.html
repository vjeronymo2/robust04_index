			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the information gathered at the various public meetings and from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written comments, the NRC staff has developed the following recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach. The major features of the recommended approach are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Redefine the purpose and need for the proposed action (renewal of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating license) as preserving continued operation of a nuclear power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant as a safe option that State regulators and utility officials may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider in their future energy planning decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consider a range of alternatives to the proposed action to identify any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action that may reasonably serve the stated purpose and need. Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environmental impacts of any such alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consider the environmental consequences of the ``no action'' alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to license renewal, which the NRC is required to do by NEPA, i.e., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impact of a range of energy sources that might be used if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC should preclude the option of continued operation (license renewal).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Change NRC's NEPA decision standard for license renewal so that renewal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not depend on an NRC conclusion that operation is the preferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NEPA option. Instead, license renewal would depend on an NRC conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that continued operation of a nuclear power plant is within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable range of alternatives considered and should not be rejected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an option for future consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the NRC staff's recommended approach, the definition of the purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and need of the Federal action in the GEIS would read:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose and need of the proposed action is to preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of continued operation of the nuclear power plant for State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulators and utility officials in their future energy planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In formulating this proposed purpose and need statement, the NRC staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has attempted to consider the perspective of State regulators, the needs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license renewal applicants, the nature of the applications at issue, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function that the NRC plays in the decisional process. This proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition does not indicate an endorsement by the NRC of nuclear power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation as a preferred energy source. Instead, the proposed definition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to convey that, absent findings in the Atomic Energy Act safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review or in the NEPA environmental analysis that would lead the NRC to reject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a license renewal application, the NRC will not interfere with the energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning decisions of state regulators and utility officials. It would also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be explained in the GEIS that a renewed license is not a mandate nor a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to operate but is simply documentation that the licensee can meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC's public health and safety requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GEIS would continue to include a full discussion of the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of license renewal, the purpose and need for license renewal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives that can serve that purpose and need, the no action alternative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the environmental consequences of the no action alternative. In doing so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC would fulfill its obligations under NEPA to consider alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed action. The GEIS would contain no discussion of need for power,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the economic competitiveness of nuclear power, or other economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations related to these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In applying the proposed definition of purpose and need to the GEIS, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC staff has identified only two basic alternatives which reasonably flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the proposed approach: renewing an operating license, which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preserve the option, and not renewing the operating license (the no action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative), which would not preserve the option but is nevertheless required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under NEPA. The NRC staff will give further consideration to identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional alternatives and is soliciting public comment by means of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. If any other reasonable alternatives are identified, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts associated with them will be assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the NRC staff will examine the environmental impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative sources of energy in its analysis of the no action alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of the no action alternative, i.e., NRC's rejection of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license renewal application, would create a range of potential environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts including those impacts which would result from the possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of the nuclear plant's power by some other source of energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, under the NRC staff's proposed approach, the NRC staff will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine in the GEIS the full range of environmental impacts of other sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of energy in order to ensure a full consideration of the no action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

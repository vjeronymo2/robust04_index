Our sources said Saddam's regime handed the body of martyr  'Ammar al-Maliki and the bodies of 20 other mujahidin to their  families in Baghdad. On 15 January, the regime also handed over  the bodies of 50 martyrs in al-Basrah, including the bodies of  Husayn al-'Ibadi and Musa al-Hanafi.    Al-Radwaniyah Prison southwest of Baghdad is currently the  largest detention center in Iraq and run by tyrant Saddam's  in-law Saddam Kamil. The prison, called the murder prison, was  originally built as a military camp and was used during the  Iraq-Iran war as a camp for Iranian prisoners. After the March  1991 uprising, it was converted to a large detention center.  The prison is currently occupied by thousands of  (?inmates)--those the regime suspects of taking part in the  uprising--especially people from the center and the south.</p>

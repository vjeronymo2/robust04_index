			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS, the bread to sugar group, reports interim results today and is likely to show little change on the Pounds 175.2m pre-tax in the comparable period. While baking margins are still under pressure, the group's British Sugar division is expected to have gained from the green pound devaluation. Hammerson, the UK's third biggest property company, will tomorrow reveal the damage inflicted by the collapse of the property market in the UK, Canada and Australia, its main markets. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to fall from Pounds 55.5m to around Pounds 43m, while net assets per share may fall from 637p to 470p. It is expected to unveil a cut in its 1992 dividend payout from 20.5p to 10p, as indicated by its interim results in October. Smiths Industries, the defence and aerospace components group, is expected to report on Wednesday a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to about Pounds 40m. Analysts believe restructuring could lead to significant exceptional costs. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, reports interim results on Thursday, with the City expecting a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 37.2m to about Pounds 25m. Some expect the interim dividend to be reduced (1.85p last time). UK COMPANIES TODAY COMPANY MEETINGS: Record Hldgs., Parkway Works, Kettlebridge Road, Sheffield, 11.45 USDC Inv.

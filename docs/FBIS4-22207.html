			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysytsya, special </F> correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA: "Flight Safety: The Desirable  and the Possible"]    [Text] In most cases, man's first attempts to leave the  earth and fly above it like a bird for even a short while ended  in tragedy. Thus, from the very birth of aviation, the problem  of flight safety assumed paramount importance for those who  tried to conquer the skies. It was, after all, not enough to  rise into the air; just as important was the ability to land  safely without injury either to self or flying machine. This was  the goal towards which inventors, designers, and pilots worked  -- all those who were fascinated by the idea of "wings." And as  history confirms, as aviation engineering and science developed  and piloting skills were mastered, the probability of accidents  during flights fell hundreds of times, and it became much safer  to rise into the air.    Still, even with our modern aviation equipment, highly  perfected means for ensuring the safety of flights, and  thoroughly equipped airfields, tragic accidents, or flight  incidents as aviators call them, or even catastrophes, do  happen, unfortunately. Consequently, flight safety remains and  will probably continue to remain perhaps the most important  concern of aviators, and especially of military aviators.    To some extent, objective circumstances have made this  problem even more acute for the Air Force of Ukraine. Some of  these reasons were discussed at the conference on flight safety  recently held by the 14th Air Army.    To begin with, it was noted that the shortage of fuel and  lubricants, spare parts, and funds has caused the intensity of  flight training to decrease substantially, and the expertise of  pilots in the principal categories of training, especially in  difficult weather conditions [SUM] and at night, to drop. The  expertise of the flight operations groups (HKP) has decreased  for the same reason. A significant number of specialists have  been discharged into the reserves. They have been replaced by  new people who lack sufficient experience in flight operations  and control.    Objective difficulties in obtaining spare parts and  machinery  for communications equipment and for the electronic support of  flights and for airfield equipment are reducing the reliability  with which these function; and this, too, has a negative impact  on flight safety. Aviators are also plagued by other problems  with respect to material-technical supply. However, despite  everything, last year the 14th Air Army had no serious flight  incidents -- at least, there were no catastrophes. There is no  point in discussing at length how they managed this. The most  important thing, after all, is to hope that disasters continue  to pass by the aviators this year as well. Relying on God alone  is hardly enough; concrete steps need to be taken to ensure  flight safety. One such measure was the conference we have  already mentioned. The goal of the conference was to prevent the  level of flight safety from dropping in our difficult times by  having experienced pilots and other specialists prepare specific  recommendations on the basis of a detailed analysis of flight  incidents and their causes.    Sad though it may be, in matters pertaining to preventing  accidents, aviators learn from their mistakes and the mistakes  of others. And, as we know, it is better to learn from the  mistakes of others. Hence, in their collectives, they analyze  each accident, catastrophe, and the causes of each in  considerable detail. This was also done at the conference.    A detailed analysis of the flight safety record of the  formation's units during the last five years was conducted.  There were four flight incidents in the air army during this  period -- one catastrophe, one accident, and two incidents in  which planes were damaged. Four men died, an MI-24 helicopter  and a MIG-29 were lost, and two other planes were damaged: an  AN-12 and a MIG-29. A few other tragic air accidents occurred in  the units that were recently added to the 14th Air Army. As we  can see, there is plenty of negative experience here from which  to learn.    What are the main causes of accidents and catastrophes? The  results of the investigations conducted in the case of each  accident confirm that the leading causes are pilot errors  resulting from an inadequate level of professional training on  the part of fliers. Moreover, the majority of accidents involved  young specialists who held the post of airman or senior airman.    In addition to the leading causes of flight incidents, the  other subjects considered included shortcomings in the  organization and ensuring [zabezpechennya] of flights and in the  performance of personnel in the flight operations groups, who  were responsible to some degree for the negative outcome in each  specific case.    Here is what happened in each specific instance. Senior Lt.  Airman V. Burskyy, flying at a low altitude in an assigned area,  after performing a 360-degree banked turn, decided to change the  sweep angle of the wing. As a result, he turned his attention  away from his altitude and the wing of his plane caught the tops  of the trees. The result was a crash.    On 16 May 1991, Senior Airman Lt. I. Halchenkov was flying a  MIG-29. His mission was to carry out an air "battle" with a  low-altitude slow-flying air target. The pilot found himself in  an emergency after completing his fourth attack. At a height of  a little over a kilometer, he failed to pay careful attention to  the indicators on his instrument panel and lost lateral control.  The pilot became confused and, persuaded that the airplane was  not responding to the control stick, he ejected. The plane  crashed into the ground...    The most typical accident caused by shortcomings in the  organization and flight operations control occurred on 24  January 1989. The crew of a MI-24 helicopter led by Capt. S.  Roztorhuyev was performing an uncomplicated flight exercise. One  minute and 40 seconds after takeoff, at an altitude of 220  meters, the helicopter, banking to the right and increasing its  angle of descent, hit the ground and burned.    The direct cause of the catastrophe was the loss by the  commander of the crew of his sense of direction as he suddenly  found himself in the clouds, because he had insufficient  training to fly in such conditions. In addition, he had turned  away his attention to visually search for a second helicopter  flying alongside. But the principal cause was a series of  serious violations and shortcomings in the organization and  control of flights, which, unfortunately, became evident only  during the investigation following the crash. Capt. S.  Roztorhuyev came to the regiment from Afghanistan and did not  begin to fly until three months later. Such a long gap is  inadmissible. The number of actual flights required to restore  lost piloting skills before being put into active service had  been cut in half. Before the day of the catastrophe, the pilot  had not refreshed his training to operate a helicopter at night  or in difficult weather conditions. As a specialist third class,  he had virtually no experience in this kind of flying. Moreover,  the commander of the regiment had scheduled flights in normal  weather conditions, whereas by then the conditions were in fact  difficult and growing worse.    The flight operations officer on the landing ground, Maj. P.  Zhreleyev, lacking adequate professional training, did not apply  safety measures in the zone for which he was responsible in  time. When the situation in the air became an emergency, he lost  his head and gave no command.    The sad conclusion drawn from the above -- a chain of  violations of flight regulations and negligence in the  performance of their jobs by a number of people in responsible  posts.    What conclusions can be drawn from the examples cited above?  First and foremost, there must be a scrupulous and very concrete  approach in full compliance with all regulations to allowing a  pilot to fly, depending on weather conditions, the difficulty of  the flight mission, and the level of the pilot's training and  experience. This must be implemented on the basis of accepted  standards outlined in existing regulations.    In connection with a rather marked tendency towards a  decline  in the professional level of flight personnel for reasons cited  above and the lack of opportunities for conducting the necessary  number of flights, much more attention must be devoted to the  ground training of the air soldiers. This training should  include theoretical studies, as well as training in the cabins  of airplanes and helicopters, and such. The flight simulators,  which often stood idle in the past, should also be used to full  capacity.    The specialists in the aviation-engineering service must  triple their level of care to prevent the possibility of flights  being undertaken in winged machines that are in a state of  disrepair. Particular attention should be paid to those  airplanes and helicopters that are reaching the end of their  service life or require repairs. You cannot, after all, fix a  breakdown in the air. Just as much diligence, a responsible  attitude to their jobs, and reliable care for equipment and how  it performs are required of all specialists in airfield,  weather, and medical services, flight operations groups, and  others.    Obviously, the best way to improve flight safety is to  supply  all the necessary fuel and lubricants and spare parts needed for  conducting the full schedule of flights on regular aviation  equipment. This, however, is something that we can only wish  for. Our present reality is somewhat different. And it requires  that we do everything possible, and even the impossible, to  ensure that the number of landings equals the number of takeoffs  by the airplanes and helicopters of the Air Force of Ukraine.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At least 50 Palestinians expelled by Israel for  intifada-related activities will be allowed to return home this  week, a Palestinian spokesman said Friday [1 April]. Many of  over 2,000 Palestinians expelled for political reasons since  1967 were tipped to return in May 1993 when Israel allowed a  token 30 to return, but refused to allow those who had been  expelled for intifada-related activities go home.    "The names should be agreed upon by Sunday if all goes  well,"  a PLO official in Amman told the JORDAN TIMES on Friday.  Tunis-based spokesman Marwan Kanafani confirmed that "there are  plans for the return of deportees this week," but refused to  give further details.    Former student union president of Bir Zayt University Marwan  Barghouti, Palestine Peoples Party executive committee member  Taysir 'Aruri and 'Ayshah 'Awdah, a prominent political party  activist, are expected to be among the first batch of expellees  allowed to return. Some PLO officials had tipped that a return  may be possible as early Monday or Tuesday.</p>

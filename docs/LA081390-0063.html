			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAVERICKS' LETTER TURNED OFF PERKINS  </P> <P> Sam Perkins said he was prepared to stay with the Dallas Mavericks until the  team sent him a letter wishing him good luck with his new team.  </P> <P> Although the Mavericks offered him a six-year, $18 million deal, Perkins joined  the Lakers last week.  </P> <P> He said the rift that developed between himself and Dallas management was too  great to stay.  </P> <P> The last straw, he told the Dallas Morning News, was a letter he received Aug.  2 from Norm Sonju, the club's general manager.  </P> <P> The NBA salary cap increased Aug. 1. One of four teams -- Perkins wouldn't say  which one, but it wasn't the Lakers -- offered him a six-year, $20-million  contract.  </P> <P> "We were told to match the offer. That was our only option," said Sonju, who  wished Perkins the best if he joined another team.  </P></p>

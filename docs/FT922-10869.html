			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Borland Yesterday's full year results from Borland International, the US software group, showed why its shares have nearly halved to Pounds 26 in the last three months. The Dollars 146m cost of integrating the Ashton-Tate acquisition resulted in a net loss of Dollars 110m for the year. On the face of it, the Borland fairy tale has ended nastily. It is thus worth recalling that even now the shares have outperformed the market more than threefold since the start of 1990. Borland argues that progress last year was hindered not just by Ashton-Tate but by preparing the now imminent launch of a new generation of products. It professes confidence that its bottom line will be restored to health this year. Given that rival Microsoft recently announced its intention to enter Borland's market for database software, the going may be tougher thereafter. Investors should wait to see how the new products fare before taking a view.</p>

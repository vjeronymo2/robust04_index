			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Ashdown's army advances outside its heartlands If it was difficult for Conservative Central Office to dismiss the view of one backbencher that the government suffered its 'nightmare scenario' in the local elections, it was harder to work out who was the clear winner. Both Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed that mantle. Labour saw its share of the vote rise from 40 per cent to 42 per cent while the Liberal Democrats increased their vote from 18 per cent to 27 per cent. Mr Smith dismissed suggestions that there had been significant tactical voting. 'Apart from a bit here and bit there, there was not much,' he said. As the Liberal Democrats took control of Eastleigh council - taking two seats from Labour - Mr Smith's comments on the relative absence of tactical voting might suggest that he should now run up the white flag in the Eastleigh by-election. But the Labour leader said he would do no such thing, promising to redouble the party's efforts to win the parliamentary contest. Professor Anthony King, professor of government at the University of Essex, says the lack of tactical voting was one of the more interesting features of the local elections. He argues that the trend in national and local elections over the past 10 years has been the establishment of two zones: Labour versus Conservative in the inner cities and in northern England while Liberal Democrats battle with Conservatives in the suburbs and south. The local election results appear to confirm this trend. Outside London, the Liberal Democrats' share of the vote in the south was about 40 per cent compared with their national share of 27 per cent. Many of their biggest gains, from Bath to St Albans, were in their southern stronghold. But Professor King asks how then can the result in Sheffield, where Labour lost eight council seats to the Liberal Democrats, or Bromley where the Liberal Democrats gained 14 seats while Labour lost four, be explained? Mr David Butler, a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, says the key point arising from the elections is how the Liberal Democrats won a toehold - 'no matter how small' - in almost all the councils. Mr Ashdown claims to have taken on, and in many significant areas defeated, 'municipal socialism' in Sheffield, Liverpool and Southwark. Mr Butler believes many defecting Labour voters may return to the fold in the general election. It was perhaps the forgotten parliamentary by-election at Rotherham that underlines the argument that tactical voting played only a small part in the elections. Labour, which easily held the seat, polled its second-worst share of the vote in more than 30 years. Mr Denis MacShane, the Labour candidate, saw the majority fall by more than 8 percentage points from 63.9 per cent to 55.6 per cent. The party only did worse in the 1983 election. In contrast the Liberal Democrats made significant headway, pushing into second place with 29.7 per cent of the vote, against 12.3 per cent two years ago. Mr Ashdown's claim to be an established party of government and the main challenger to both 'old parties in their heartlands' is borne out by the results. In scores of councils the Liberal Democrats are no longer the 'third party', but one of three parties. Tower Hamlets appears to be the exception. The Liberal Democrats lost 22 seats, the biggest single defeat for any party in any council in England. Labour declared that they had 'trounced' their competitor in the only straight fight between Labour and Liberal Democrats. But Mr Ashdown's explanation that his party has paid the price for 'the ill-judged actions' of two or three of his activists was nearer the truth. Similarly, Labour's loss of Lambeth had more to do with the behaviour of leftwing councillors expelled from the Labour party as the council was accused of more than Pounds 20m of unlawful expenditure by the district auditor.  ----------------------------------------------------------           WHERE THE BALANCE OF POWER LIES NOW  ----------------------------------------------------------                 Total   Change in     Seats    Net change Party         councils    control       won     in seats  ---------------------------------------------------------- Lab               93        +4        2,769        +88 Lib Dem           19        +9        1,098       +388 Con               15       -18          888       -429 Ind                6        -1          217        -37 No control        65        +6 SNP                                      73        +19 Plaid Cymru                               3         +3  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

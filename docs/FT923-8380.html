			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Trinity term Berg Sons and Co Ltd and others v Adams and others (FT, July 10) In the present case, a winding up of the first plaintiff, Berg Sons &amp; Co Ltd, was made on the petition of a creditor, Union Discount. Both Berg and Union Discount alleged breach of duties owed to it by Berg's auditors, relating to an unqualified certificate signed by the auditors which, it was alleged, failed to give a true picture of the state of affairs of the company. In Al Saudi Banque (1991), Ch 313, Mr Justice Millett held that foreseeability that a lender might rely on audited accounts was not, without more, enough to establish the duty of care. There had to be a specific relationship between the function which the auditor was requested to perform, and the transaction in relation to which the plaintiff said he had relied on; see also Caparo (1990) 2 AC 630. The statutory audit had a restricted purpose so that there was also a restriction on the scope of the duty of care that arose simply from carrying it out. In the present case the person who had a proprietary interest in the company and was concerned with its control did not rely on the accounts in order to further his business activities and the accounts were not a critical factor for the substantial credits extended to Berg. The Nicholas H (FT, July 15) The owners of the cargo carried on Nicholas H began an action against the shipowners and the Japanese classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyoshai. The claim against the owners was settled for Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 261,800) but the action against Nippon was for the sum of Dollars 5.5m for alleged breach of a duty of care to the cargo-owners. On the facts assumed for the purposes of the preliminary issue only, it was stated that cracks had developed in the hull of the vessel and arrangements had been made for Nippon to survey the vessel at anchor. An initial survey recommended permanent repairs but only temporary repairs were carried out. The vessel then continued with its journey on the surveyor's second recommendation but it sank with all the cargo. Mr Justice Hirst stated that the proximity criterion for a duty of care in tort was essential in the present case, particularly since there was such a wide variety of circumstances where a party not in contractual relationship with Nippon might seek to establish liability. On the assumed facts there was a very close degree of proximity between the surveyor and the cargo-owners. Although there was no direct physical control over the vessel the decisive influence on the shipowners which the second recommendation must have had, and would reasonably be foreseen to have, was very akin to control. The Depositors' Protection Fund v Dalia and another (FT, July 16) To alleviate hardship when a bank became insolvent, the Banking Act 1979 set up the Depositors' Protection Fund and money from the fund was payable to depositors on the insolvency of a recognised bank or institution. The fund was continued under the Banking Act 1987, under which the maximum amount of a protected deposit was increased to Pounds 20,000. After the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ceased trading but before it was wound up, BCCI depositors assigned part of their deposits to family members or close friends so that each assignee could look to the fund for maximum compensation payable. The transfers totalled several million pounds with more than 200 assignees. Giving judgement for the assignees, the vice-chancellor stated that for compensation purposes the position was the same as with regard to a statutory assignee. There was no reason in principle why, for the purposes of the deposit protection scheme, an assignee of part of a deposit should be treated any differently from an assignee of the whole. Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways and another (FT, July 17) Kuwait Airways Corporation obtained judgement against Iraqi Airways Co for delivery of commercial aircraft and damages assessed at Dollars 489.455m. The case had arisen as a result of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq when six Kuwaiti civilian aircraft, owned by Kuwait Airways, were flown to Iran and interned and four other Kuwaiti civilian aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Iraqi Airways claimed immunity under section 14 of the State Immunity Act. However, in refusing a striking-out application, Mr Justice Evans stated that the scheme of the act was such that a state had no general immunity, except with regard inter alia to 'commercial transactions'. The government of Iraq had identified the 10 particular aircraft involved as required for a civilian operation by Iraq Airways and there was no evidence to justify a finding that the purpose was governmental rather than commercial. Iraqi Airways had been incorporated as 'being operated on a profit and loss basis' under Iraqi law. Moreover, under the Companies Act 1965, a writ had to be served on an overseas company at its registered address of any place of business established in Great Britain. In the present case the writ had been properly served on the accountant of Iraqi Airways as acting manager of its business at its Regent Street offices in London. Napier v Kershaw (FT, July 22) A Number of Lloyd's Names, who belonged to the Outhwaite syndicate, had formed an association to claim against RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agencies Ltd and members' agents at Lloyd's to recover losses attributable to allegedly negligent underwriting. Under a settlement in March 1992, Pounds 116m was paid by the Outhwaite defendants to Richards Butler on behalf of the Names. The defendant stop-loss insurers were joined as representatives of other Lloyd's syndicates which wrote stop-loss insurance policies for 1982 for individual Names and claimed that the Names were constructive trustees of the recovery monies, and that the amounts due to to the insurers were traceable in equity in the monies held by Richards Butler. Dismissing their appeal in part, the Court of Appeal stated that the intricacies and doctrines connected with trusts ought not to be introduced in to commercial transactions. However, in allowing in part the appeal, the Court of Appeal also stated that the Names had contended that they were entitled to recoup the excess in each policy out of recoveries. Those contentions were inconsistent with the agreement that there was to be an excess which was to be borne by them; the insurers' argument that recovery should be applied from the top down leaving the excess the last to be recouped, was preferable.</p>

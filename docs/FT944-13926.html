			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Portillo claims Jobseeker's Allowance will save Pounds 200m a year The government yesterday unveiled details of its new Jobseeker's Allowance, describing it as 'a major step forward in the reform of the benefit system and in the help given to the jobless'. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said the government estimated the scheme would mean a Pounds 100m net cut in its spending on unemployment in its first financial year 1996-1997, followed by reductions of Pounds 200m for every succeeding year. But he was unable to say what impact the allowance would have in reducing the number of registered unemployed. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said an estimated 150,000 unemployed people a year should benefit from the introduction of the back-to-work bonus, an accumulated credit of up to Pounds 1,000 for part-time work done while unemployed, paid after moving into full-time employment. He told the Commons the allowance would 'help Britain generate more jobs and give better value for taxpayers' money'. Mr John Monks, the Trades Union Congress general secretary, condemned the allowance as 'mean-spirited and irrelevant'. Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's new shadow employment secretary, said the allowance would 'not help a single person back into work and is simply a new penalty against the unemployed'. Since 1986 gradual steps have been taken to tighten up the benefit system to stamp out false claims and increase pressure on the jobless to find work. The allowance will introduce a simpler way of assisting the unemployed than before. It will be paid instead of unemployment benefit and income support to any eligible person without work for six months or less, and dealt with through a single office - the existing Jobcentre. The complex system run by the employment and social security departments with different rules, locations and bureaucracies will be swept away. The allowance, based on current income support levels, will not be means-tested for the first six months of receipt. At present unemployment benefit is paid automatically for the first 12 months a person is without work. The unemployed will have to sign an agreement to receive the allowance. This will require a jobseeker 'to be available for any work which they can reasonably be expected to do', in line with the current benefit requirement requiring a claimant to be actively seeking work. The employment service will - as now - be able to insist on allowance claimants participating - if asked - in its many programmes designed to help the jobless back to work. After six months only a jobless person with no money or only a small amount will qualify automatically for the allowance. Everybody else will be means-tested. Anybody with capital resources amounting to more than Pounds 8,000 will be ineligible. The government estimates that 90,000 claimants will lose their benefit entitlement in the first year of the allowance with a further 150,000 having to switch to means-tested benefits, often at reduced rates. Mr Portillo may be keen to make the incentive for the jobless to find work more attractive but his white paper falls far short of doing this. At present an unemployed person can keep only Pounds 5 a week of any money earned while receiving the allowance. After that benefit is reduced by a pound for every pound of earnings. This provision has not been uprated for six years - nor will it be under the new allowance. But the government is introducing a 'back to work bonus' for anybody unemployed for three months or more, built up as a lump sum entitlement based on part-time earnings. As now, they can still keep the first Pounds 5 a week of any part-time earnings while a couple retains the first Pounds 10. In addition, for every pound earned over that level they will build up a 50p credit entitlement paid out as a bonus only when the jobseeker secures a full-time job. The maximum bonus amount accumulated at any one time can be Pounds 1,000. But this means a jobseeker will receive no extra money immediately for part-time work - hardly an incentive.</p>

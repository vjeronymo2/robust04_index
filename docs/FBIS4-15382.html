			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 8 (AFP) -- Former Russian vice  president Aleksandr Rutskoy has called for early general  elections, saying this was the only way to establish  "legitimate" authority in Russia, and said he would run for  president if asked. "Only early, simultaneous presidential and  legislative elections can bring legitimate power to the  country," Rutskoy said in an interview conducted Thursday [7  April] with AFP.    Rutskoy, 47, said it was still to early to speak in detail  about his plans for becoming a presidential candidate, noting  that Russia still had no law on presidential elections and that  no date for the vote had yet been fixed.    "It is not enough simply to want to run," Rutskoy stated.  "But if I am asked to run I believe I would accept because I  know what to do and how to do it to stop the current chaos and  assure that Russians have a life worthy of citizens of a great  country," he said.    Rutskoy, who provided written and oral responses to  questions  from AFP, denied he favored rebuilding the Soviet Union, but  called for a "new union" based on the Russian empire as it  existed prior to 1917, excluding Poland and Finland. "The  creation of a new, powerful, federal state which would be called  Russia can be done," Rutskoy stated.    He also sharply criticized President Boris Yeltsin's plan  for  all the main political forces in the country to sign a pact  known as the "Agreement on Obtaining Civil Accord" which the  Kremlin says is needed to curtail extremism in Russian politics.    "An accord with whom and for what?" Rutskoy said. "I don't  want to sign anything with the people who have devastated the  country and fired on its parliament and its people."    The former Afghan war hero, elected vice president in June  1991 as President Boris Yeltsin's running mate, was dressed  casually and appeared relaxed during the 40-minute interview,  conducted in an office in his central Moscow apartment. He said  he had spent a good deal of time reflecting on the state of  Russia during the five months he sat in Moscow's high-security  Lefortovo prison after being jailed for his role in leading the  October 1993 parliamentary revolt.    Referring to the latest spate of rumors on his former boss's  health, Rutskoy said the country had a right to be kept informed  on the physical and psychological condition of the head of  state. "All the more so when you're talking about a nuclear  power," he stated.    Rutskoy repeated his previous criticism of reforms carried  out over the past two years, saying during that time Russia had  become "a third-rate, colonial, mafia, totalitarian and corrupt  state." "The dollar has become the national money and the ruble  a crumpled candy wrapper," he stated.    Rutskoy said his new ideology was based on a combination of  religious faith and a "national spirit" that had been forgotten  by many during the seven decades of communist rule and in the  past two years of democratic change. Implementing this ideology  "will produce the most important thing: the rebirth of Russian  power," he stated.    Rutskoy has joined a newly-created opposition bloc known as  "Accord for Russia" which is due to hold its founding congress  next month and which some analysts view as the organizational  springboard for his presidential bid.    He said he was currently working on two books -- "Collapse  of  a Power" and "The Discovery of Faith" -- recounting his personal  experiences and his views on the events that have rocked his  country in recent years. "I will make an objective study of  what has happened to us and how we have found ourselves in this  shameful situation," he said. "There will also be new  approaches on building the state and economic reforms" in the  books, Rutskoy stated.    [Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian on 8 April, page 2,  runs an INTERFAX report under the "Opposition" rubric, which  adds: "The constituent congress of the "Accord for Russia"  movement will take place in Moscow on 19 May, said Vasiliy  Lipitskiy, leader of the `Free Russia' People's Party and a  State Duma deputy. This date was set 6 April at the meeting of  the movement's group of activists, attended by former Vice  President Aleksandr Rutskoy, Constitutional Court Judge Valeriy  Zorkin, Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin, Petr Romanov, and  Amangeldy Tuleyev, as well as Federation Council deputies and  other signatories of the declaration on setting up the  movement."]</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCCLURE AGREES TO 1-YEAR DEAL;  </P> <P> ANGELS: PITCHER COMES TO TERMS JUST BEFORE ARBITRATION HEARING. MINTON DECLARES  HIMSELF A FREE AGENT.  </P> <P> Relief pitcher Bob McClure agreed to a one-year contract Friday, moments before  his arbitration hearing, paring a seventh name off the list of 12 Angels who  had filed for arbitration last month.  </P> <P> McClure, 6-1 last season with a 1.55 earned-run average, will be paid $825,000  in 1990, closer to the $880,000 figure he filed than the $650,000 figure the  Angels had filed. The contract contains no incentive clauses. McClure was paid  $200,000 last season plus $275,000 in bonuses.  </P> <P> McClure's agent, Alan Meersand, said he made the decisive overture to Dan  O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president, Friday after the parties had  entered the hearing room at a Los Angeles hotel.  </P> <P> Meersand said he and his client decided they had more to lose than gain by  going through the hearing.  </P> <P> "You have to look at what you have in hand," he said. "You have 825 (thousand  dollars), then you go to the hearing and you only stand to make 55 more. You  stand to lose 175 from where we were at 825 if the arbitrator gives you 600.  Bob didn't want to take that chance."  </P> <P> Pitchers McClure, Chuck Finley, Willie Fraser and Mike Witt, catcher Bill  Schroeder and outfielder Max Venable agreed to contracts before going to  arbitration.  </P> <P> Still scheduled for hearings are first baseman Wally Joyner, whose case is due  to be heard Monday in Los Angeles; center fielder Devon White, Tuesday in Los  Angeles; pitcher Scott Bailes, Friday in Chicago; pitcher Kirk McCaskill, Feb.  19 in Chicago, and third baseman Jack Howell, Feb. 20 in New York.  </P> <P> Pitcher Greg Minton also filed but was told by the Angels that they would not  go to arbitration with him. He declared himself a free agent Friday. Minton,  who last season earned a base salary of $630,000 plus $100,000 in bonuses, had  filed for arbitration at $1,150,000. The Angels had filed at $780,000.  </P> <P> The 38-year-old right-hander was 4-3 with a 2.20 ERA and eight saves in 62  games last season, but he became expendable after the acquisition of Mike  Smithson and Bailes and Fraser's development as the right-handed setup man.  Minton cannot sign with the Angels again until May 1.  </P> <P> The Angels said that right-hander Mark Clear, 33, who missed last season after  surgery to repair a ligament in his right elbow, agreed to a one-year contract.  His salary will be minimal, but could be boosted by incentive clauses.  </P> <P> The Angels also signed infielder Gary Disarcina, who played most of last season  with double-A Midland. In 126 games, he hit .286 with 54 runs batted in.  </P></p>

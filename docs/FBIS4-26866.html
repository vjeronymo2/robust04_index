			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F> 3768): "U.S., Russian Navies' Joint Exercise at Vladivostok"]    [Text] The U.S. and Russian navies held joint military  maneuvers in the Slavyanskiy Bay [si la bi yang si ji wan 2448  2139 3024 2254 2448 1015 3494] near Vladivostok, in the Russian  Far Eastern region, from 20 to 21 June. Participating in this  operation were, on the Russian side, 180 officers and soldiers  from the Russian Pacific fleet, and a large-to-medium sized  landing fleet; and on the U.S. side, 250 Marines and a number of  warships, including helicopter carriers and landing ships. The  U.S. and Russian navies' joining forces with each other no doubt  has drawn the world's attention.    The U.S.-Russian joint military exercises were a simulated  joint operation conducted by the two navies in order to carry  out joint disaster relief missions in cases of natural disaster,  such as an earthquake or flood, that might take place somewhere  in the world. For this reason, both sides deployed landing  ships, helicopters, and amphibious tanks to conduct the military  exercises. The landing site was the Keleierke [0344 7191 1422  0344] Peninsula, 50 km to the south of Vladivostok. Both U.S.  and Russian Marines carried out antidisaster and  personnel-rescue exercises.    This joint military maneuver was carried out according to  some provisions of the U.S.-Russian memorandum on military  cooperation which was signed last September. Although the  central task of this military maneuver was confined to  disaster-fighting missions, it was, after all, a joint military  operation run by the two military superpowers, an event that  would have been absolutely unimaginable in the past.  <H5>  The Two Superpowers Each Have Their Own Purposes in Military </H5> Cooperation    Russia has been facing numerous economic difficulties  following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but it remains  a world-class military superpower. To be sure, this military  maneuver was focused on joint disaster-fighting operations, but  it still created an impression to the world that the two  military superpowers are intending to join forces to dominate  the world or to intervene in regional affairs when necessary.  Russia itself does hope to work together with the United States  and have a say in world affairs, as the United States does.  Referring to the Korean nuclear issue, the United States  recently pledged to press the Security Council to impose  economic sanctions. In response to this, Russia reproached the  United States for failure to consult it beforehand, and  therefore it expressed discontent with the United States and  voiced objection to the U.S. action. Russia's purpose is to  fight for a say in world affairs which is equal to that enjoyed  by the United States.    Following the end of the Cold War, the world situation has  been developing in a diversified manner. As far as diplomacy is  concerned, Clinton has frequently flaunted his "strength," but  the U.S. strength is not equal to its ambition. Either its  hard-line diplomacy or tactic of using military force is  ineffective in many cases -- in the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil  war, the Somali rebellion, the Rwanda civil war, the Haiti coups  d'etat, and the Korean nuclear issue, for instance. The United  States has been facing criticism, both at home and abroad,  throughout the process of military intervention in Somali, from  the deployment of U.S. troops to the pullout from the country.    Being busy dealing with the economic crisis, today's Russia  is much less influential than the Soviet Union of the past. As  civil war burst out in the former Yugoslavia, the West  repeatedly urged Russia to play a leading part in pressuring the  militarily aggressive Serbs, but so far the West's appeals have  been to no avail.  <H5>  The United States and Russia Are To Jointly Explore Space </H5> Technology    Both military superpowers are experiencing a decline in  their  control over and influence in the world. Both sides wish to  cooperate and support each other to seek a greater say in world  affairs.    On 21 June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev announced that  Russia and the United States would jointly propose to the  Security Council a bill on easing the nuclear crisis on the  Korea Peninsula. This bill consists of a proposal to call an  international conference and a scheme of stage-by-stage  sanctions against Korea. The only new point in this bill lies  in that it is a "U.S.-Russian cooperation project."    The United States and Russia also have decided to step up  scientific and technological cooperation in the areas of space  exploration and environmental protection. As scheduled, Russian  Premier Chernomyrdin, who will be on a visit to the United  States, will attend an accord-signing ceremony on 23 June, by  which the United States will join the space development plan to  be run on Russia's Mir space station.    "U.S.-Russian cooperation" may be extended to other fields  in  the future. It can be beneficial to both sides, and it also can  be used, when necessary, to demonstrate to the world the  intention of the United States and Russia to dominate the world,  both militarily and politically.</p>

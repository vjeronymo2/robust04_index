			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Kravchuk set for tough UK talks A HIGH-PROFILE public welcome, accompanied by tough talking on nuclear, economic and non-nuclear security issues, awaits Mr Leonid Kravchuk on a three-day state visit to Britain as the first president of the newly independent Ukrainian state. Speaking in Kiev on the eve of his visit, which starts today, Mr Kravchuk called on the west to provide greater economic assistance soon or face dangerous consequences. 'Western aid will determine which path Ukraine and other former republics choose, whether or not our countries become democratic,' he said. But if he repeats recent calls for billions of dollars to finance the scrapping of nuclear weapons, improve the safety of nuclear plants and kick-start the ailing Ukrainian economy when he meets Prime Minister John Major, senior political and business leaders and Mr Jacques Attali, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he will be told bluntly that billions are not on offer. He will also be warned that Ukraine, whose previous government mishandled the issue of a new Ukrainian currency and made little progress in reforming inherited communist structures and power networks, will only attract serious private investment when it starts to tackle macro-economic imbalances. The point has already been taken by the present government led by Mr Leonid Kuchma. The Ukrainian leader will also be urged to ratify the Start 1 strategic arms reduction agreement treaty as soon as possible. In Kiev yesterday Mr Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine remains committed to becoming a non-nuclear power but insisted that ratification would depend on financial aid and security guarantees from the nuclear powers. Mr Major and other senior officials are expected to emphasise the need for Ukraine to make the best use of what assistance is realistically available from the west and take a more flexible line with Russia over co-operation in the destruction of nuclear weapons. In the past, Ukrainian leaders have tended to play down the importance - and the likelihood - of substantial western financial aid. But Mr Kravchuk, a former senior communist official who successfully transformed himself into a Ukrainian nationalist and won last year's presidential elections with a big majority, now appears to be counting on a high level of western aid after last year's sharp economic decline. The UK visit comes as the Ukrainian government is poised for talks with the International Monetary Fund about a stabilisation fund.</p>

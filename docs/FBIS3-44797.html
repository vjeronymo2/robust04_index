The exchange was bought from the Motorola company of the  U.S.    The number of mobile telephone users has increased rapidly  in  China in the past few years, and Shanghai's original mobile  telephone system had reached its full capacity before the  exchange was introduced.    Sources at Motorola's Beijing office said the equipment of  the EMX 2500 digital telephone exchange system belongs to the  latest generation of the company's cellular products.    Pertti Johanson, vice-president and general manager of  Motorola's international cellular infrastructure division, said  that, so far, more than 120 Chinese cities have introduced  cellular systems from Motorola.    The software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has  been modified to better meet the requirements of China's  telecommunications networks, he added.    The introduction of the large-capacity telephone exchange in  Shanghai will not only enhance call-processing speed, but also  lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to expand.</p>

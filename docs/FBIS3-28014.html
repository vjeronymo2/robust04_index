An open advocate of struggle for mass-oriented politics,  Chonnong has led numerous violent demonstrations against the  opening of domestic rice markets and for the government's  purchase of more rice ever since its inauguration.    With approximately 100,000 members, Chonnong has subordinate  organizations in 90 counties throughout the country.    Chonnong's predecessors are the Christian Farmers'  Association [Kinong] and the Catholic Farmers' Association  [Kanong] which was organized by Catholic priests in 1966 to  protect farmers' rights and interests.    Also participating in last night's rally in Seoul was the  Central Association of the Young Prosperous Farmers and  Fisheries [Hannongyon], which is an even larger organization  than Chonnong. However, the rally was led, for the most part, by  the Chonnong and students belonging to the General Federation of  Univerity Students Associations [Hanchongyon], and this caused  the rally to be more violent.    A moderate organization, the Hannongyon was organized by the  government in 1981 in an effort to prevent farmers from leaving  their rural villages with 47,000 select farmers and government  financial support.</p>

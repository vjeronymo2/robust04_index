			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Sales fall as shoppers wait for tax rises An abrupt fall in shop sales last month appeared to confirm that consumers are holding back spending ahead of higher taxes in April. But a significant upwards revision of January's figure means that the overall message from yesterday's official retail sales figures is ambiguous. The Central Statistical Office said that in February, sales volumes fell by 0.5 per cent on the month, to stand 2.5 per cent up on a year ago. This was the slowest year-on-year growth rate since May last year and compared with a rate of 3.7 per cent in the year to January. However, January's provisional increase in sales of 0.6 per cent was revised upwards to 0.9 per cent, one of the strongest monthly rises in the last 12 months. Earlier this week, the CBI's distributive trades survey showed two consecutive months of slowing retail sales growth. That, together with yesterday's official February figure may add to government concerns that tax increases next month will take the wind out of the recovery. On the other hand, the trends in the latest three months indicate that there is enough momentum in consumer demand to weather the effects of fiscal tightening. In the three months to February the volume of sales was 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and 3.4 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The only sector that saw a rise in sales in February was food retailing, up 0.7 per cent after a flat January. The 'other non-food' category - which covers the more discretionary side of spending - suffered the biggest drop in sales. It fell 1.2 per cent on the month, and within this category, household goods - big ticket items - dropped 1.6 per cent, after a 3.5 per cent rise in January. Mixed retail sales volumes fell 1 per cent. Sales by clothing and footwear retailers fell 0.4 per cent in February, reversing January's 0.3 per cent rise. Yesterday's figures received mixed interpretations from analysts. Economists at James Capel said the figures show that spending was being increasingly concentrated in months such as January, when discounts are available, at the expense of February. Since the CSO's seasonal adjustment was unlikely to pick this trend up, the official data probably overstated the true level of sales in January and understated them in February. The British Chambers of Commerce said the figures show that the economy was performing better now than a year ago.</p>

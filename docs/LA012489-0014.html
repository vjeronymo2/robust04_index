			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Sylvester Stallone will star in another "Rocky" sequel for United Artists, but  there ends Stallone's relationship with the troubled studio that recently was  put up for sale. On Monday, Stallone announced that he was transferring a  production deal with his White Eagle Enterprises from UA to Tri-Star, the  studio that distributes Stallone's "Rambo" films. Three years ago amid much  fanfare, White Eagle signed a six-year, 10-picture deal with UA, but not a  single film came out of it. The first planned project, an untitled drama in  which Stallone stars as a prison convict, will now be produced for Tri-Star  this spring. Under the new deal, Stallone must star in at least five films but  is otherwise free to choose his own projects. "That's the beauty of the deal  for Stallone," said Tri-Star President David Matalon. Carolco, which produces  the "Rambo" films, gains worldwide TV rights as well as video and foreign  theatrical rights, to all White Eagle productions. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

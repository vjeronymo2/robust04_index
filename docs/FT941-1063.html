			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Granny bonds stir societies to hit back Competition from National Savings granny bonds has forced building societies to respond with competitive products. In recent weeks the number of fixed-term, fixed-rate accounts has increased. These are intended to at combat savers' worries of continued base rate cuts and lower interest rates. Last week, the National &amp; Provincial introduced a five-year term account with 7.3 per cent guaranteed until September 30 1999, paid yearly from Pounds 500 with a monthly option of 7.10 per cent. And Northern Rock this week launched a postal bond paying 7.50 per cent monthly from Pounds 5,000 until April 1 1999. Other societies have introduced escalator bonds in response to savers' fears of tying into an investment at the bottom of the interest rate cycle. Although these are still five-year term accounts, the rates are guaranteed to rise annually. The Halifax introduced its bond last month and the Britannia and Yorkshire were quick to follow. The Halifax responded by increasing its rates. This week has seen the launch of similar bonds from the Newcastle and the Leeds &amp; Holbeck. The latter starts with rates at 6 per cent, rising by 1 per cent a year to 10 per cent from Pounds 1,000. All offer a monthly interest option. Rates on other building society accounts tend to have been tweaked down lately, although often by very small amounts such as 0.1 per cent. But the Progressive dropped a bit more and its Tessa (featured recently in the Savers Selection) is now down to 7 per cent. Postal accounts still have the edge over branch-based accounts. Britannia has withdrawn its market-leading index-linked account, which was tied to inflation rates.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Catholic woman awarded Pounds 16,500 A Catholic woman victimised and abused by Protestants in the factory where she worked was awarded Pounds 16,500 compensation yesterday. O'Kane Poultry agreed at a Fair Employment tribunal hearing to pay compensation after the woman took an action for unlawful religious discrimination against the company and her former departmental supervisor who, the tribunal heard, had called her a 'Fenian bastard'. He was later disciplined and no longer works for the company.</p>

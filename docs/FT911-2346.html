			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Boeing forecasts sharp rise in second quarter BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported slightly higher first quarter income on lower revenues but said it expected second quarter sales and deliveries to be substantially above those in the first three months of this year. Net income was Dollars 309m or 90 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 6.09bn, compared with Dollars 302m or 87 cents on sales of Dollars 6.44bn in the same period last year. Commercial aircraft earnings were below those for the first quarter of 1990, due to lower sales volume and higher research and development costs, principally for the 777 airliner programme. Offsetting this were lower defence and space operating losses, higher other income and a lower tax rate. Mr Frank Shrontz, the chairman, told the annual meeting the company expected sales to be substantially higher in the second quarter, while total 1991 sales were projected to be around Dollars 28.5bn, up from Dollars 27.6bn in 1990. The increase would result from higher commercial jet transport deliveries, primarily 737s, partially offset by a small decrease in defence and space sales. He said airline requests to reschedule deliveries as a result of reduced traffic had affected a relatively small number of aircraft and that there had been no cancellations.</p>

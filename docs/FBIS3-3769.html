Experts believed that the vehicle is soon to enter average  urban households.    Whenever the new red-and-white model is parked somewhere in  Tianjin, it draws a crowd. Some say they want to buy one  immediately.    The small car, 2.3 meters long and 1.3 meters wide, can  squeeze through narrow lanes. Its top speed is 70 km per hour,  and it sells for about 20,000 yuan.    Car experts from the China automobile technology research  center refer to the new model as China's "Star of Hope," meaning  the car is made for average wage-earners.    Making family cars in China has remained a hot topic for  many  Chinese sociologists and car-makers. Many of them are setting  their sights on the cheap mini-car as more expensive models will  be out of the reach of most of Chinese urban families.    Thus far, more than 30 institutions are conducting studies  into mini-car models and four types have emerged for  recommendation, according to experts from the Automobile  Technology Research Center.    Preliminary tests by the research center show that the new  model in Tianjin can be used to carry both people and goods and  that it is most desirable in terms of its performance, cost and  low level of exhaust emission. It is an advanced model of  mini-car in China, they say.    Huang Jianwu, a senior engineer and head of the Tianjin  mini-car research team, said that the new model, something in  between the motorcar and motor-tricycle, is cheap and suitable  for a family of three and therefore has a bright market  potential.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament will today take up discussion on the new  World Trade Treaty to replace the GATT agreement. This will  follow a suo moto statement by the government in both the houses  of Parliament today. The parliamentary affairs minister, Mr.  V.C. Shukla, told our correspondent that this was decided in the  speaker's chamber yesterday in the presence of the leaders of  the opposition.    The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has defended the  signing of the treaty by India. He asserted that the  opposition's criticism against the government for taking the  step will be warded off. Speaking at a function after  presenting G.D. Birla awards for scientific research in New  Delhi yesterday, he said that the Indian economy should be  integrated with the world economy. This, he said, cannot be  achieved without science and technology in the country  integrating with that in the world. The awards were received by  Dr. Masilkar and Professor Raghuwamsh. The awards carry 1 lakh  rupees each.    Addressing the annual session of the Confederation of Indian  Industry, [Commerce Minister] Mr. Pranab Mukherjee said the  agreement provides both challenges and opportunities to step up  the export of agricultural products and textiles.</p>

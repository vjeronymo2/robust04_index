			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Toyota may use Ford components in its cars TOYOTA will start design-in development with Ford Motor's automotive development group in a deal which could lead to the Japanese car group using Ford components in its cars for the first time, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Through the design-in development agreement, Toyota will be studying whether Ford's cruise control system might be appropriate for use in its own cars, Toyota said. The Japanese company already buys components such as shock absorbers and radiators from General Motors, for use in its cars manufactured both in the US and Japan. Toyota cited the need to co-operate with foreign companies and to study what components could be bought from foreign companies as an important factor behind its decision. Toyota currently uses cruise control systems developed in Japan by its main Japanese components suppliers such as Nippon Denso. Growing trade friction with the US, however, has forced Japanese carmakers to consider buying more components from US manufacturers.</p>

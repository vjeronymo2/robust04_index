			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEGINNER'S LUCK HELPS BOLES AT VENTURA  </P> <P> It took a little luck and some hard driving, but Allen Boles of San Fernando  won the 15-lap Street Stock main event at Ventura Raceway on Friday night.  </P> <P> Boles, in his first race at Ventura, drove the one-fifth-mile dirt oval as if  he had been driving the track the entire season. And a little bit of luck  didn't hurt either.  </P> <P> Street Stock points leader Charles Utts of Camarillo was leading the 17-car  pack when a broken fan belt put him out of the race and allowed Boles to take  charge in his 1968 Camaro.  </P> <P> Gary Curtis of Camarillo edged figure 8 points leader Rock Ake, Jr. of Moorpark  by half a car length in the six-lap Mini Stock figure 8 main event. With the  win, Curtis' sixth, he ties Ake for the most figure 8 main event victories this  season.  </P> <P> Richard Webster of Camarillo was third.  </P> <P> Curtis also won the 20-lap oval track main event. The victory was Curtis' 14th  main-event title of the season, which reached its midway point Friday.  </P> <P> John Christensen of Palmdale overtook Tom Stephens of Ventura on the final lap  of the eight-lap Street Stock figure 8 main event to score his third such win  of the season. Stephens and Don Famularo of Canyon Country finished second and  third, respectively.  </P> <P> Utts continued his winning ways earlier in the evening with a hard-fought  eight-lap heat-race victory. Utts overtook leader Mike Johannes of Van Nuys on  Lap 6 after working his way up from the back of the pack. Johannes finished  fourth after hitting the backstretch wall on Lap 7.  </P> <P> Phil Barrow of Oxnard and Boles finished second and third, respectively.  </P> <P> Camarillo's Jeff Bosley won the other Street Stock heat race. Paul Moore of  Oxnard and Nick Magley of Ventura won the Mini Stock heat races.  </P> <P> Sue Pittinato of West Hills captured the four-lap Street Stock trophy dash, and  Curtis won the Mini Stock division.  </P></p>

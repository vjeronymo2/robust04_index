A city ecological soviet was established for the purpose of  coordinating environmental protection activity, and two  environmental protection procuracies and a sanitary-ecological  militia are working actively. A system of payments for  discharges (disposal) of polluting substances into the  surrounding natural environment has been introduced. A city  off-budget ecology fund has been organized. Together with budget  appropriations, resources of the ecological fund were expended  on city environmental protection measures that were approved by  the city ecological soviet and the permanent commission on  questions of ecology and the protection of the health of the  population; a radiological survey and a decontamination of  polluted sectors were conducted; work was continued on improving  the sanitary conditions of Lake Kaban and other reservoirs of  the city; work is being done on the development of a  comprehensive territorial environmental protection plan  (TerKSOP) of the city of Kazan and the surrounding Kazan region,  a plant TER [not further identified] has been developed on the  utilization of everyday and industrial wastes, and work is being  concluded on the construction of a unit to remove mercury from  mercury lamps, etc.    A long-range program to increase the ecological reliability  of waterline-sewer networks and structures and of engineering  structures for the protection of the city has been developed and  approved, and a program for the ecological improvement of the  storm water drainage system is in the developmental stage.    All of this, together with the drop in the volume of  production, made it possible in just the last year to reduce the  discharges of harmful substances into the atmosphere by 12  percent, and into open reservoirs--by 15 percent.    At the same time a number of tasks set by the decision of  the  third session remain unfulfilled. In particular, the  construction of car wash facilities at the entrances to the city  is being delayed, and questions are not being resolved on  providing the city with nonethylated gas    The Kazan City Soviet DECIDED:    1.

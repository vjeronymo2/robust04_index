			<p>BFN     [Text] This is a summary of fighting on the Pailin  battlefield between 9 April and the morning of 11 April 1994.  The following is the outcome of the fighting:    1. We have completely liberated the area from the west of  Pailin to the border.    2. We have captured 350 invading troops of the communist  Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government. Some of them  have fled for their lives through the bamboo-covered jungle.    3. We completely control Sala Krau village.    4. We also completely control (?Phnum Spin).    5. We are continuing to block the stretch of road between  Sala Krau and O Ro-el completely.    6. We are continuing to block the stretch of road between  O Tavai and Suosdei completely.    7. The invading troops of the communist Vietnamese  puppets and the two-headed government are being encircled and  smashed to bits from all directions. They have been routed and  forced to flee through the thick bamboo-covered jungle, where  strings of mines previously laid by the communist Vietnamese are  everywhere. They have run out of water and food. They have  come down with malaria and typhoid and are dying one after  another -- two or three here; four or five there. Their  supplies have been completely cut off.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Old-fashioned excellence - Investment Trusts / A Scottish fund that offers an above-average yield SECURITIES Trust of Scotland is an old-fashioned international trust and none the worse for it. Founded in 1889, it had an excellent record in the 1980s and still offers private investors an above-average yield - 5.1 per cent - on a diversified portfolio. This decade inevitably is proving more difficult for STS which, early in the 1980s, committed itself to a policy of income growth at a time when generalist trusts were seeking ways to differentiate themselves in the face of coolness from the institutional investor sector. UK companies increased their dividends substantially in the 1980s, and funds such as STS reaped the benefit. But the 1990s' recession has hit companies' dividend-paying ability and this has fed through eventually to the investment trust sector. In each of the past two years, STS has paid a final dividend that has not been covered fully by its earnings. Trusts build up revenue reserves so they can cope with just this kind of cyclical downturn; and STS says it can maintain its dividend from reserves for another three years even if earnings do not grow from their present level. It will be a while before shareholders again enjoy the phenomenal dividend growth achieved during the 1980s - the payout quintupled between 1982 and 1992 - but the assets, at least, continue to grow. This week, the trust announced that net assets per share rose 20.5 per cent to 84.5p in the second half of the financial year. STS is managed by the Edinburgh-based Martin Currie, which assumed responsibility in 1972. Michael Gibson, who has worked for Martin Currie since 1982, is in charge of the management team. Asset allocation policy is decided by the board following recommendations from Gibson and his number two, Tim Hall. They then supervise its implementation by specialist geographical teams. The portfolio's geographical split at the end of March was UK (69 per cent), US (15 per cent), Hong Kong (6 per cent) and continental Europe (8 per cent). STS also has a tiny holding in Japan, mainly in warrants, but Gibson says dividends are too low there to meet the trust's income growth criteria. During 1991 and 1992, STS had heavy holdings of convertibles and high-yielding preference shares because of the difficult economic conditions. By the middle of last year, though, it had begun to switch into lower-yielding equities that can produce above-average dividend growth. The 10 largest holdings at the end of March were BT, Shell, British Gas, BAT, Allied-Lyons, GEC, Macdonald Martin, Bass, Commercial Union and Hanson. The only non-Footsie stock among these is Macdonald Martin, which produces Glenmorangie whisky. The performance of STS is a good illustration of how a well-managed international trust can be very profitable for private investors over the long term. The trust is top of the sector over seven years, with growth of 164.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income re-invested), according to Finstat. It is second in the sector over both three and five years. But the international income sector is very small, so a more relevant statistic is that STS has outperformed substantially both the FT-A All-Share index and the investment trust sector over the past 10 years. Stephen Magrath, analyst at NatWest Securities, says STS 'has not compromised its capital performance by going all out for yield. It is an attractive investment for someone who is conscious of total return - a 5 per cent yield with international exposure looks appealing.' Lewis Aaron, of SG Warburg Securities, adds: 'In the short term the trust's record has not been outstanding, but over the long term its performance has proved the effectiveness of the high-yield strategy. With its high yield, the trust would probably be a good choice for a personal equity plan.' Key facts At the end of March, the trust's net assets were Pounds 273m and the gross assets Pounds 310m. On April 20, NatWest Securities estimated the nav per share at 83.6p - putting the shares, at 81.5p, in a discount of 2.8 per cent. The yield was 5.1 per cent. Martin Currie's annual management fee was 0.35 per cent. Board Bill Morrison, the chairman, is a former chief executive of Scottish Life. Other directors are David Birrell, senior partner of lawyers Dundas &amp; Wilson; Richard Cole-Hamilton, former chief executive of Clydesdale Bank; Ian Macpherson, chairman of both Watson &amp; Philip and Low &amp; Bonar; Ronald Miller, executive chairman of Dawson International; Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle; and Michael Kennedy, chief executive of Martin Currie. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 20 a month, or Pounds 200 for a lump sum. There are no charges (except stamp duty) for buying but there is a Pounds 10 charge for selling. For a Pep, Martin Currie imposes an initial fee of Pounds 50, with an annual charge of Pounds 60 at Pounds 5 a month. Subsequent investments, or withdrawals, cost Pounds 20.</p>

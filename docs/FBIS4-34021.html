			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Castro at the Fourth </F> Ibero-American Summit at the India Catalina Convention Center in  Cartagena de Indias -- live]    [Text] Esteemed President of Colombia Cesar Gaviria, Your  Majesty, Excellencies: Our summits, initiated in Guadalajara,  have been an inspiring example for our countries to draw closer  and to unify. We have reaffirmed our decision to meet without  the permission of third countries and without any significant  exclusions. Our efforts have borne fruit in many respects; the  advances of the Latin American Integration Association, the  Andean Group, the Central American Common Market, the Southern  Cone Common Market, and the increasingly important Latin  American economic system demonstrate this.    It seems that some were worried by this new, independent  method of action. Our powerful northern neighbor now calls for  another summit that is to take place in Miami, of all places; it  is for a mature hemispheric association. There have already  been alliances for progress and initiatives for the Americas  that no one remembers today. From decade to decade and centery  to century, we have gone from slogan to slogan, from deceit to  deceit. There were also wars, interventions, and conquest of  territories at the expense of our America. What can we expect  from that powerful country, invariably expansionistic,  egotistic, and hegemonic.    Cuba, a country attacked and blockaded for over 30 years, is  prohibited by the alleged owners of the hemisphere to  participate in that meeting. How much cowardice, mediocrity,  and political poverty is truly reflected by this exclusion.  Cuba does not oppose, however, that summit. We are pleased  that the brother countries of Latin America and the Caribbean  will have an opportunity there to defend with complete firmness  and strength the interests of our peoples.    First of all, it is time to demand a right to healthcare;  education; an honest paying job; a cultural and ethnic identity;  that all forms of racial and sexual discrimination cease, an end  to abandoned and homeless children as well as victims of all  types of exploitation, violence, and sexual abuse; an end to  honger; a cessation of conditions that allow millions of people  to die each year who could be saved. These are among the  fundamental rights of man and should be respected.    Cuba has resolutedly supported the revolutionary struggle  for  democratic processes in Central and South America and is happy  that the current U.S. Administration will not foster, as others  have done, cruel military dictatorships subordinate to U.S.  interests. Cuba cannot tolerate U.S. efforts to become the  model and supreme judge of Latin American political guidelines.    Cuba determinedly defends the principle of national  sovereignty. It would be willing to defer only to a united Latin  America, but under no circumstances will it tolerate the  meddling of U.S. power circles in the internal affairs of  countries in the region.    Nothing would please Cuba more than to see the United States  offer all countries of the region, especially the lower income  countries, free access to its markets as a contribution to the  economic development of those countries.    Cuba also finds foreign investment, including U.S.  investments, necessary as a contribution to development on this  continent, but Cuba is concerned about the denationalization of  important sources of wealth and natural resources, a process  under way in the countries of the region.    Trade and foreign investments are not enough to guarantee  the  development of national economies. It is necessary to increase  the influx of development aid, something that the current U.S.  Government has reduced.    Now that the Cold War is over, that country should use part  of its currently unjustifiable military expenditures to  establish a fund to promote the development of Latin American  and Caribbean countries.    The United States should foster a radical and definite  solution to the region's foreign debt, which is already $487  billion. It should stop using intellectual property as a  negotiating weapon. It must derogate the arbitrary Super-301  special disposition that unilaterally punishes trade partners.  It must exempt the Latin American and Caribbean countries from  the brutal demand of having unrestricted access to services, a  demand imposed at the Uruguay Round.    Cuba is happy that the United States is proposing, at least  theoretically, the implementation of what it has called second  generation economic reforms to resolve the continent's social  problems. The resources allocated for this, however, are  absolutely insufficient.    Cuba is pleased to hear that the United States wants to  modify inter-American security precepts prevalent during the  Cold War and to work for a new relationship not connected to the  presence of U.S. military bases in the region.    To be consistent with that policy, the United States must  dismantle the Guantanamo Naval Base and return to Cuba a  territory it has occupied for almost 100 years.    It must withdraw its bases from Panama, as the treaty  establishes, and from any other Latin American country.    If the United States is concerned about sustainable  development in the region and environmental pollution, it must  sign Agenda 21 of the Rio summit.    Cuba agrees with the establishment of mechanisms of  hemispheric cooperation to fight drug trafficking. This must not  be at the expense of the sovereignty of the involved countries,  however.    The concerns of the continent's armed forces which refuse to  act as counternarcotics policemen are valid. The demands for a  reduction in U.S. drug consumption are also valid.    The United States must change its immigration policies for  Latin America and the Caribbean. It must promulgate a law that  automatically legalizes the status of citizens from this region  who enter the United States, as it is doing with Cuba's citizens.    Now that the Berlin Wall no longer exists, the wall erected  along the Mexican-U.S. border should come down.    Cuba deems positive the U.S. idea of convoking the  continent's nongovernmental organizations to make  recommendations about the agenda, but all such organizations  must be invited and the demands of Indians, women, peasant  organizations, labor unions, and other representatives of civil  societies, who have much to say about the issues to be discussed  at the summit, must also be heard without unfair exclusions.    Finally, this is a fitting occasion to demand that the  United  States comply with the UN resolutions on the criminal and unjust  blockade against Cuba, the intention of which is to spill blood  and force our people to surrender out of hunger.    If these issues are discussed at the Miami summit, Cuba  wishes it success, but if all it comes down to is an attempt to  draw lines on the hemisphere, to isolate Cuba, to control the  Latin American and Caribbean market, and to check Europe, Japan,  and the rest of the world, then we would have to recall what  Jose Marti said in judging a similar meeting that took place in  Washington 105 years ago: After seeing with inquiring eyes the  record, rationale, and factors involved in the invitation, it is  necessary to say, because it is true, that the time has come for  Spanish America to declare its second independence.    Thank you.</p>

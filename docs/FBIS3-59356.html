Too  high inflation has a destructive impact on the normal growth of  a national economy. While the formative mechanisms in China's  inflation of recent years are complex, an analysis of their  mutual impact constitutes the basic analytical framework for and  policy thinking on inflation. Since the beginning of 1993,  sustained strong demand has pulled and supported hyper economic  expansion, gradually becoming a key factor in the new round of  runaway inflation. This should arouse our full attention.  <H3>  I. The Basic Current State of Market Prices: Moderate  Inflation </H3>   Since the beginning of 1993, as our national economy has  continued to grow at a high rate, while our pace of conversion  of price formation mechanisms has accelerated, potential  inflationary pressures have been released faster, with market  prices showing a strong upward momemtum. Having topped 10  percent for the first half, our inflation rate for 1993 will  undoubtedly reach double digits at that rate, with it already  being a foregone conclusion that it will exceed the planned  controlled-price index of 6 percent, to make 1993 our inflation  peak since 1988. Our key current inflation features are:    1. Inflationary energies are being released faster, with all  categories of prices on a clear upward trend. Under the dual  impact of price-reform policy results and rapid growth in public  demand, our market prices in 1993 are in a state of all-out  rapid increase, with particularly sharp rises in the prices of  capital goods and labor. For the first five months, purchase  prices were up 31 percent from the same period in 1992 for  energy and raw materials, 11.2 percent for agricultural capital  goods, 27.2 percent for service projects, and sharply also for  capital and foreign exchange. From an urban and rural  perspective, while urban prices sustained high increases, rural  prices were also in a clearly rising state. For the first five  months, our national cost-of-living price was up 12 percent from  the same period in 1992, including rises of 12.8 percent for  cities and towns (16.7 percent for the 35 large- and  medium-sized cities), 11.3 percent for rural areas (with rural  wholesale and cost-of-living prices both higher that those for  cities in May), and 10.2 percent for national retail prices.    2. Retail prices, on the heels of their higher base for the  fourth quarter of 1992, have shown a monthly upward momentum. In  comparison to the same months in 1992, they were up 8.4 percent  for January, 8.7 percent for February, 10.2 percent for March,  10.9 percent for April, and 12.5 percent for May, with retail  price rises averaging 10.2 percent for the first five months,  and estimated to have risen 10.5 percent for the first half, for  an increase close to or exceeding that for the first half of  1988, showing the beginnings of a new price-rise peak period. In  1993 in particular, cost-of-living prices in our 35 large- and  medium-sized cities have grown monthly in comparison to the same  months in 1992, being up 14.7 percent for January, 15.3 percent  for February, 17 percent for both March and April, 19.5 percent  for May, and 21.6 percent for June, for an average of 17.4  percent for the first half (including 14.7 percent for consumer  goods and 38.9 percent for service projects), with the  first-half rise being higher than the 14.5 percent for the same  period in 1988, to make 1993 our highest price-rise peak since  1990.    3. As to our price-change structure, the lagging impact of  1992 price rises made up about one-third. In 1992, the state and  localities speeded up their pace of reform, raising grain buying  and selling prices, adjusting prices of capital goods, such as  railway freight, coal, and natural gas, and devolving pricing  jurisdiction or deregulating prices on a large scale, which  further expanded the market price-regulation percentage. It is  estimated that 3.3 points of the market retail price rise for  the first five months of 1993 were due to the lagging impact of  1992 prices, which impact was nearly one-third, while new  price-rise factors in 1993 (including spontaneous rises and  structural adjustments) made up the other two-thirds.    As to our price-change regional structure, rural retail  price  rises were close to those for cities and towns, with  particularly high price increases in our 35 large- and  medium-sized cities. Comparing the first five months of 1993 to  the same period in 1992, rural retail prices were up 9.9  percent, only 0.6 points lower than the urban retail price rise  (10.5 percent), including April and May when retail prices rose  even more in the rural areas than in the cities. This was due  mainly to the lagging impact of the successive upward  adjustments in recent years by the state of energy, fuel, and  oils and foodstuffs prices showing up gradually on rural  markets. It is predicted that for 1993, retail price rises may  be higher in the rural areas than in cities and towns.    4. As to the commodities driving price change, price changes  were larger mainly for ones, such as grain, building materials,  fuels, agricultural capital goods, and service projects.    A) The deregulation of grain prices, pushing up food prices,  has also become a key factor in the high retail-price rises.  Comparing the first five months of 1993 to the same period in  1992, retail food prices were up 10.4 percent, including a  retail price rise of 27.9 percent for grain, which one item  alone caused 1.9 points of the retail price rise, meaning that  about 20 percent of the impact came from the grain price-rise  factor, and a retail price rise of 8.7 percent for nonstaple  foods (including 1.6 percent for fresh vegetables, 10 percent  for meat, poultry, and eggs, and 13 percent for aquatic  products).    As to manufactured consumer goods, a comparison of the first  five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992 shows retail  prices up 39.7 percent for fuels and 25.9 percent for  construction and decoration materials, with these two items  having a joint impact on retail price rises of 2.9 points, or as  much as one-fourth. Various other commodity retail prices were  respectively up 4.3 percent for clothing, 3.7 percent for  everyday commodities, 5.4 percent for books, newspapers, and  magazines, and 9.7 percent for drugs and medical articles, but  down 1.1 percent for cultural and recreational articles.    B) Agricultural capital goods prices are up sharply.  Comparing the first five months of 1993 to the same period in  1992, agricultural capital goods retail prices were up 11.2  percent, causing 1.3 points of the retail price rise. This  includes prices up from the same period in 1992 by 8.8 percent  for chemical fertilizer, 46.7 percent for farm-machinery  gasoline, and 2.6 percent for agricultural plastic film, but  down 2.3 percent for pesticides. This was due mainly to the  greater impact of new price-rise factors in 1993. The monthly  comparative indexes for the first five months were respectively  102.5, 103.3, 104.3, 102.5, and 101.6. An analysis of the year's  trends shows agricultural capital goods prices were impacted by  higher costs and expenses in the production and marketing links,  with the rises likely to grow still further.    C) Service price rises are growing steadily. Service price  rises have been in double digits ever since August 1992, with a  comparison of the first five months of 1993 to the same period  in 1992 showing service prices up 27.2 percent (for January  through May respectively 22.9 percent, 25.9 percent, 28 percent,  29.3 percent, and 29.9 percent), exceeding 1988's 16.2 percent  and 1989's 23.9 percent, and causing 3.1 points of the  cost-of-living price rise. This was due mainly to all areas  generally raising train and long-distance-bus ticket prices, as  well as deregulating or adjusting prices for items, such as  telegrams, tuition and miscellaneous expenses, child-care  charges, bathhouse, rest home, and park admission tickets, and  movie tickets.  <H3>  II. The Immediate Impact of Inflationary Pressures on the  Economy: A Further Analysis and Forecast </H3>   While China's economy has maintained a high growth rate  since  the beginning of the 1980s, with our GDP growing at an average  rate of 8.9 percent a year, including a high of 11.5 percent  from 1984 to 1988, our rapid economic growth has been  accompanied by progressive price rises, with the high inflation  accompanying the rapid economic growth in 1988 in particular  being a direct factor that forced the improvement and  rectification campaign. As higher economic growth rates  usually are accompanied by higher inflation, with the two  showing a feature of changing in the same direction, which has  been proved in both domestic and overseas economic practice, the  period of high growth that our economy entered in 1992 due to  rapid investment growth has steadily raised the attention of  those in all walks of life toward the inflation problem, with  some in both theoretical circles and actual working departments  continuously calling for vigilance against an inflationary  rebound, and anti-inflation also remaining a key item in  macroeconomic monitoring and government macroeconomic regulation  and control.    We hold that there now exist both factors that are  sharpening  inflationary pressures, as well as ones that are curbing and  easing inflation. At present, the latter factors are weakening  in impact, while the former ones are growing. In light of the  market price-rise features and factors manifested in the first  half, which are similar to those in 1988, we predict that it  will be hard to curb the price rise momentum in the second half,  for which our key grounds are:    1. Increasing public demand will strengthen the [upward]  pull  on market prices. As demand-driven inflation has a lag period,  such inflation shows up first in higher capital goods prices.  As to our current capital goods price changes, the upward  momentum still shows no clear signs of containment. This means  that for enterprises with currently weak consumption capability,  higher basic product prices will eventually result in retail  market prices rising correspondingly. And investment, after a  certain lag period, will generally be 40-percent converted to  consumption funds. While such conversion is certainly not  evident in today's market, it will be reflected somewhat on  markets as time passes. Then it will spur consumer demand to  faster growth, increasing market demand pressure, to turn the  upward pull on market prices from a possibility into a reality.  On the other hand, our money supply is now obviously growing  faster than our economy. Due to the changes in our overall  assets-liability items in particular, there is still great  pressure to put money into circulation. While our GDP grew 13.9  percent in the last half, our current M&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt;  is growing  at a high rate of more than 50 percent, with our M&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt;  demand elasticity nearing 4 (and our M&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  and  M&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  demand elasticity coefficients also similar),  much higher than the normal value of 1.5-2, and higher even than  1992's 3.    2. The gradual conversion to market-oriented price-formation  mechanisms will further strengthen spontaneous price-rise  factors. China is now in a stage of conversion to markets,  requiring rationalization of longstanding too- low basic product  prices, which is inevitably accompanied by a high price-rise  period. In particular, as tertiary industries further expand,  the trend of higher labor prices will grow more evident. And in  the current state of our still imperfect market system and  relatively weak price-control oversight, spontaneous commodity  price rises will be unavoidable. The last few months of market  price changes show that spontaneous price-rise factors are  growing steadily. On the other hand, cost-driven pressures are  continuing to grow. As intermediate investment product demand  is up, in addition to the larger change in capital goods prices,  prices are clearly rising. In the first quarter, our national  manufactured goods factory-price index rose about 18 percent,  while the comparable product costs of budgeted state-owned  industrial enterprises rose 11.1 percent. Based on monitoring  by our commodity sector, our key commodity market prices are now  all in a general upswing, with some commodity prices rising  sharply, to exceed international market prices. In the first  quarter of 1993, our commodity system's capital goods prices, on  the heels of 1992's higher price base, continued to rise 38.2  percent. Meanwhile, the price rises are still continuing to grow  in scope, with the larger increases being mainly for items, such  as rolled steel, lumber, cement, machinery and electronic  products, and motor vehicles, which merits attention.    3. The follow-up impact of higher business taxes will  gradually show up. In May, the state raised the commodity  retail business-tax rate from 3 percent to 5 percent. The  projection is that if the retail sector (business) incorporates  all of the higher business tax into sale commodity prices, this  will push 1993's retail commodity prices up about 1.3 points.  All areas report that the increase in the business tax has  pushed market prices up 3-5 percent, or more than the  business-tax increase itself. In addition, some regions have  delayed putting the new business tax into effect, which will be  bound to increase the retail market price rise for the last half.    4. GATT membership will impact China's market prices. Once  we rejoin the GATT, China's prices will get on track with those  on international markets, which will inevitably tend to raise  our price levels. On the other hand, along with  foreign-exchange system-reform, the force of lower exchange  rates to encourage exports and curb imports will strengthen,  with higher purchase prices for export commodities pulling up  similar domestic commodity prices to a certain extent. In  particular, since the last half of 1992, our market  foreign-exchange conversion price has seen a sharp increase.  Our foreign-exchange quota conversion price per U.S. dollar was  0.45 yuan at the beginning of 1992, up to 1.74 yuan by the end  of 1992, over the 2-yuan mark for the first quarter of 1993, up  to 5 yuan by the second quarter, and above 10 yuan by the end of  June, even higher than 11 yuan on some black markets. While the  effects of our macroeconomic regulation and control policy have  brought certain new changes since July, there is still quite a  large gap between this [market]-conversion price and our  official exchange rate.    An analysis of the historical data and China's current  sustainability in all areas shows that in China, price rises  constitute low inflation at 4-8 percent, moderate inflation at  9-14 percent, severe inflation at 15-18 percent, and runaway  inflation when over 18 percent, meaning that 1993 will be a year  of moderate inflation. But as our current material base and  public psychological and economic sustainability are much  stronger than in 1988, short of an abrupt change, we will not  see the sharp panic-buying and social unrest of 1988, for which  our grounds are:    1. From the perspective of the economic growth in all  countries throughout the world, price rises due to inadequate  infrastructures and raw material shortages are a normal  market-economy phenomenon, as well as the price that China must  pay for reform and getting onto track with international prices.  China's current order of too low basic product prices with  higher manufactured goods prices has not yet been basically  reversed. As we make the conversion from a planned to a market  economy, the products formerly regulated and controlled by the  state will enter markets, bringing quite glaring conflicts  between supply and demand. When our old administrative  regulation and control means have lost effectiveness, while the  new market restraint forces have not yet been genuinely  established, the market-driven operations will inevitably touch  off price rises. On the other hand, China's GATT membership  will also require us to speed up our pace of price-mechanism  conversion, spurring China's pricing system to shift to an  international orientation. This will require us to sharply  raise our basic product prices to keep them from flowing on a  large scale to overseas markets, which would exacerbate our  supply shortage of domestic market-resource products.    2. From the angle of China's economic-system reform  experience, during periods of high economic growth, price  structural adjustment is bound to cause price rises. In  China's current economic system, high economic growth relies  mainly on the drive of high investment and industrial production  growth. Generally speaking, a high-growth economy cannot be  founded on the basis of price stability, but rather needs prices  to be adjusted and stimulated through constant change. Or it  could be said that a certain amount of inflation is a  hard-to-avoid price for economic growth.    3. As to overall supply and demand balance, our supply and  demand differential for the first half of 1993 was only 6.1  percent, lower than the normal level of 10 percent. But this  demand exceeding supply was seen mainly in staple capital goods,  while the opposite order of supply exceeding demand on consumer  goods markets had not yet changed. As to the supply and demand  order of over 700 staple manufactured consumer goods for the  first half of 1993, commodities for which supply exceeded demand  or where supply and demand were in balance made up 90 percent.  In addition, our improved agricultural situation in 1993 gives  our market a solid foundation. But in 1988, supply and demand  were severely out of balance, with demand 7.7 percent higher  than supply, far exceeding the normal 5 percent, and the gap of  demand exceeding supply being larger mainly for consumer goods.    4. As individual income is growing more than prices are  rising, economic sustainability is up. Comparing the first half  of 1993 to the same period in 1992, urban residents' monthly  income for living costs was estimated to be 186 yuan, up 27.9  percent from the same period in 1992 and, corrected for  inflation, up a real 13.8 percent (which figure was up only 2  percent for the first half of 1988, and down 3 percent for the  first half of 1989).    5. Political and social stability are maturing the consumer  mindset. As consumer demand is now diversified, with no new  consumer fever yet formed, and consumer mindset matured,  unchecked competitive consumption out of line with incomes is  now extremely rare. Urban and rural savings deposits, under  sharp attack by a great wave of all types of bonds, stocks, and  public fundraising, still showed a balance of 1.2789 trillion  yuan by the end of June, up 124.3 billion yuan from the  beginning of the year. While panic buying was experienced by  some some areas in 1993, it was focused mainly on items, such as  gold jewelry, foreign currencies, and imported and domestic  brand-name household electronics and expensive wool textiles,  lasting for a shorter time. But the panic buying in 1988 was on  a large national scale, involving commodities all the way from  refrigerators and color TVs to needles and thread, as well as  lasting considerably longer.    In addition, through 14 years of market-oriented reform,  China's economic climate and growth mechanisms have undergone  great changes, so that our inflation-formation mechanisms and  manifestations are correspondingly somewhat different than in  the past, which point also needs attention when we analyze  current price conditions and future trends. We hold that there  now exist both factors that would set off inflation, such as  rapid economic growth, sharply higher fixed assets investment,  new loans and currency put into circulation far exceeding our  economic growth rate, and rising product costs, as well as ones  that would curb too fast price rises. So our real price changes  are the result of the contest between these two factors, with  the ones that would touch off rapid price rises now temporarily  having the upper hand.    So as to our current price rises, we should neither be  panic-stricken or lower our guard, but rather should tighten our  macroeconomic regulation and control, by taking the right steps  to keep price rises from exceeding the warning line. As to our  economic operating trends for the last half, the choice of  regulation and control targets gives us two possibilities: 1)  We could take forceful regulation and control steps for an  overall retrenchment, to provide an overlapping of policy  effects and economic cyclical impact, which might quickly bring  our economy from the "red-light zone" into a sharp decline, for  a great fluctuation; 2) or we could apply moderate fine-tuning  to sharply strengthen our structural adjustment, in which case  our economy might make a soft landing from the "red-light zone"  onto a basically normal operating field (the "yellow-light  zone"). Our analytical projection is based on the second  possibility.    As to the various factors impacting our second-half economic  growth, the favorable aspects are: 1) the second-half is driven  by a high-speed economic growth momentum; 2) the  market-regulation impact is stronger; 3) comsumer goods market  sources are abundant, with supply greater than demand as before,  and public purchasing mindset basically stable; 4) incomes are  growing more than prices are rising, bringing somewhat greater  reform sustainability; 5) while our economic operations are  subject to many problems meriting attention, they are generally  still within the limits of possible macroeconomic regulation and  control, with previous adjustment experience and lessons that  can be drawn on. The unfavorable aspects are mainly that our  current management system has too many links to be efficient,  and that all macroeconomic fine-tuning steps are subject to too  long of a time-lag, which might further exacerbate the various  currently existing conflicts and problems. In addition, our  regional and industrial growth is uneven, with all interested  parties not having a consistent understanding of conditions,  adding to macroeconomic regulation and control difficulties.  Based on an overall analysis of the abovementioned conditions,  premised on taking fine-tuning steps, and short of the  unexpected, our key 1993 economic growth indexes will end up in  the following manner:    -- Our economy will maintain its high growth. Our 1993 GDP  is predicted to reach about 3 trillion yuan, up around 12  percent from 1992.    -- Our industrial growth priorities will be heavy, coastal,  and nonstate industries. Affected by "bottleneck" restraints  and 1992's large bases, our second-half industrial production  rate will recede somewhat. Our 1993 GVIO is predicted to top 4  trillion yuan, up about 22 percent, including heavy industry up  approximately 23 percent, and light industry up around 21  percent.    -- Our agriculture will expand steadily. While our 1993 GVAO  is predicted to grow about 4 percent, our grain, cotton,  oilseed, and sugar output will be down to varying degrees, with  our livestock and aquatic breeding industries continuing to  maintain their growth momentum.    -- Our investment will grow rapidly. Fund shortages in the  last half may make the growth decline. Our 1993 overall fixed  assets investment is predicted to reach nearly 1 trillion yuan,  up about 40 percent from 1992 and, corrected for inflation, for  real working growth of around 20 percent.    -- Our domestic market sales order will be rapid growth of  investment products and acclerated growth of consumer goods.  Our 1993 retail commodity sales turnover is predicted to reach  about 1.35 trillion yuan, up around 21 percent, with our capital  goods sales turnover growing more than 40 percent.    -- It will remain hard to change our foreign trade order of  high import growth and low export growth. Our 1993 exports are  predicted to amount to $92 billion, up about 8 percent, while  our imports will top $100 billion, for growth of approximately  25 percent. Our national cash reserves will be below the $20  billion mark.    -- While our national credit scope is expected to be  basically controlled, a lot of currency will be put into  circulation. It is predicted that while our 1993 new bank loans  will amount to approximately 410 billion yuan, our currency  issue is likely to reach nearly 165 billion yuan.    -- Our urban and rural individual income growth will be in a  state of "one fast, one slow." It is predicted that our 1993  urban resident cost-of-living income will average 2,300 yuan,  for real growth of about 11 percent corrected for inflation,  while our rural individual net income will average around 870  yuan, for growth of approximately 3 percent corrected for  inflation.</p>

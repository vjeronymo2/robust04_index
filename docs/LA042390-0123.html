			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 155 SEIZED IN 'GREEN' PROTEST ON WALL STREET  </P> <P> At least 155 demonstrators were arrested this morning outside the New York  Stock Exchange as several hundred people assembled in a post-Earth Day protest  against U.S. companies they branded as polluters.  </P> <P> Banner-waving protesters chanted and danced up and down Exchange Place near the  world's biggest stock market, but the gathering was calm and trading was not  interrupted.  </P> <P> "It is absolutely normal," NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said.  </P> <P> A police spokeswoman said 500 officers had been assigned to the area,  outnumbering the roughly 400 demonstrators, in an effort to keep protesters  away from the NYSE building on Wall Street.  </P> <P> The early morning protest in the heart of the nation's financial district was  organized by a number of "green" political groups from New York to Quebec and  followed the observance of Earth Day 1990.  </P> <P> The demonstrators called in a handbill for people to gather to "shut down Wall  Street" in a nonviolent civil disobedience action.  </P> <P> Capt. Steve Davis, a New York Police Department spokesman, said most were  arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, blocking traffic and throwing  garbage. "Most who were arrested wanted to be," a police sergeant said.  </P> <P> Police cordoned off Wall Street and Broad Street outside the exchange, allowing  traders and other Wall Street officials to pass through and enter the exchange  and other buildings.  </P> <P> Men in pin-striped suits scurried up and down Wall Street, newspapers under  their arms and briefcases in hand, largely ignoring occasional heckling by  demonstrators, some of whom pleaded with the financiers to "take the day off".  </P> <P> "Fine with me," retorted one man in his early 30s, without breaking stride  toward his office doorway.  </P></p>

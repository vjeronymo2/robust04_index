			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / 20% of tankers 'below standard' ONE IN FIVE of the world's tankers is below international safety standards, the inquiry into the implications of January's Braer tanker disaster heard yesterday. The Chamber of Shipping, which represents UK owners and operators, told the inquiry that it blamed cut-throat pricing, and accused governments of lacking the resources and the will to police ship safety properly. It said freight rates had fallen in real terms from a 1973 peak of Dollars 69.4 a tonne to less than Dollars 12 a tonne in 1991. The chamber said a 'significant number of owners' were willing to cut corners on safety because of inadequate inspection by flag and port states, while some charterers did not care about the state of vessels. Inspections by oil companies had shown that '20 per cent or more of the world's tankers do not meet existing internationally agreed standards'. The inquiry continues.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MADONNA SUED BY NEIGHBOR  </P> <P> Pop star Madonna and a neighbor are locked in a legal battle over whether she  is complying with restrictions that require her to trim trees and hedges on her  property so the view of the city can be enjoyed by the neighborhood residents.  </P> <P> The struggle began in 1987 -- before Madonna bought the house -- when Donald  Robinson sued the previous resident to get the foliage trimmed at the Hollywood  Hills home.  </P> <P> The previous owners allegedly failed to abide by an agreement that applies to  all residents in the Beverly Highlands tract above Doheny Drive.  </P> <P> That agreement, according to papers filed in court, ensures "that all lots will  continue to enjoy (an) unobstructed city view."  </P> <P> Madonna countersued Robinson, accusing him of trespassing on her property,  "making threatening, abusive and derogatory statements to and/or about  (Madonna) and cutting various trees and plants" on her land, according to the  court papers.  </P></p>

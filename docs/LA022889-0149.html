			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DUTCH' TREAT INAUGURATES TAPER'S PAY-WHAT-YOU-CAN TICKET PLAN  </P> <P> The Mark Taper Forum this week introduces a pay-what-you-can policy at three  performances of "Dutch Landscape," Jon Robin Baitz's account of a troubled  American family in South Africa.  </P> <P> About 100 tickets for tonight's performance, and for those on Wednesday and  Thursday, can be purchased at whatever price the theatergoer chooses (minimum  payment: 1 cent) instead of the normal range of $20 to $26. The policy will  continue at one or two selected performances of each Taper main-stage  production.  </P> <P> Citing the competition of $6.50 movies and $1.50 videos, Taper managing  director Stephen J. Albert said: "The Taper has never wanted economics to be  the reason people don't come to the theater. When you have a show that isn't  selling out, you pick up people this way -- and they'll get into a  theater-going habit and later pay full price or become subscribers."  </P> <P> La Jolla Playhouse offers a similar deal at one performance of each show.  </P> <P> Taper information: (213) 972-7373.DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

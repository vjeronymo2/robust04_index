Sazhin] </F>   [Text] Despite measures aimed at the development of  military industry and increasing the scale of research and  development in the defense sector, India depends on the import  of new technologies necessary for organizing production of  modern types of weapons and military equipment. Advanced models  of armament (main battle tank, light combat aircraft, helicopter  gunship, missile systems) being developed in the country are  largely based on foreign technologies. Thus, American or  British-made equipment and assemblies are being chosen for an  aircraft being created; a German power plant and transmission  and a number of other systems and assemblies are being chosen  for a tank being created.    Overseas purchases of necessary technologies and materials,  as well as combat equipment and weapons, are entrusted to the  Directorate of Supply and Deliveries of the Department of  Military Production and Deliveries of India's Ministry of  Defense.    The policy of import purchases being implemented by the  Ministry of Defense today is determined basically by the  economic feasibility of developing production of one or another  type of weapon by Indian industry. At the same time, recognizing  some technology or type of weapon as strategically important  gives ground for allocating practically any amount for their  acquisition.    Usually, technical committees organize comparative testing  in  addition to a preliminary study of models and technologies  planned to be purchased both in India and abroad. The decision  to purchase one or another model is made only after expert  examination or testing. Priority is given to technologies and  materials used in the missile industry, new variants of weapons  and military equipment, and spare parts for systems that are in  service in the Indian forces. The total volume of imports of  machine building products is distributed in the following manner  (in percent): 17 for ships and vessels; 16.6 for control and  measuring equipment; 13 for communications equipment; 12 for  construction equipment. In addition, it includes aviation  equipment, computers, boiler equipment, and parts and assemblies  for motor vehicles. Petroleum, petroleum products, and  petrochemical goods take up a considerable share in India's  import balance (15 percent). About $3 billion were spend for  these purposes in 1990. The percentage of steel and steel  products delivered to the country is not great (3 percent).    Large transactions for the purchase of import products  exceeding 10 million rupees ($40,000 U.S.) are approved by a  government body -- the Secretariat for Industrial  Authorizations. Ministries, other government organizations, and  private firms have the right to conclude agreements with foreign  firms for lesser amounts. Industrial enterprises are authorized  to import without licenses, drawings and technical documentation  at a cost of up to 2.5 million rupees. More than 2,000 requests  to purchase technologies abroad were submitted to the  Secretariat for Authorizations during 1991. In order to attract  foreign technologies, the government of India exempted from  licensing joint ventures of 25 branches of industry located in  backward areas of the country.    At the same time, in the last seven years, imports of  technologies virtually did not affect branches of industry  associated with the production of military products. Metallurgy,  electrical machine building, transportation machine building,  and the services sector accounted for about 70 percent of the  agreements on cooperation with foreign firms. On the whole, the  percentage of agreements on technology transfer increased from  19 percent in 1984 to 27 percent in 1991, and the volume of  foreign capital investments in the Indian economy increased  12-fold.    The main developers and transferrers of new technologies in  the country are: The Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research (includes 39 scientific institutes and laboratories and  also two scientific associations), six specialized departments  of the country's central government (science and technology,  atomic energy, space, electronics, development of the ocean,  environment, and ecology), organizations of defense research and  development of the Ministry of Defense, branch scientific  research centers of other ministries and departments, private  scientific research centers (the largest belong to the groups  Tata, Birla, Singhania, Sri Ram), specialized planning and  design firms, and scientific research and development offices  and laboratories of industrial enterprises of the state and  private sector. The state plays the main role in financing all  scientific research and development work, providing more than 85  percent of the expenditures for this purpose.    The following countries have agreements on the transfer of  technologies to India or joint ventures with India: the United  States, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Great Britain, Japan,  France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland,  Canada, Denmark, and also Hong Kong. Agreements were concluded  in 1991 in the amount of about 1.5 billion rupees (1.077 billion  in 1987). The number of agreements signed with American firms  has increased constantly: 148 in 1984, 189 in 1986, 217 in 1988,  and over 200 in 1990.    India's import-export policy at the current stage provides  for 944 positions on a list of products authorized for import  into the country under an open general license. This import  practice extends to the software sector and other technical  documentation in the field of information science. Duties on  imports of computer programs have decreased 60 percent, but at  the same time the maximum proportion of loan capital in capital  investments increased to 80 percent. (This indicator is accepted  as 60 percent for industry as a whole). For all types of goods,  there is a widespread practice of pre- and post-shipment  crediting of exports with a term of 6 months at the rate of 9.5  percent annually.    Today the Indian leadership is encountering considerable  difficulties in purchasing arms and military technologies abroad  that have strategic importance. Restrictions of the Coordinating  Committee (COCOM) for controlling exports of the latest  technologies from NATO countries and Japan apply to it. These  countries closely monitor to see that India's military industry  and army do not receive access to the latest weapon systems. In  addition, the West continues to be concerned that India does not  transfer the technologies it has and products produced using  them to third-party countries, primarily Russia and other CIS  states. There presently are at least 150 American monitors in  India monitoring observance of the provisions of the  Indian-American memorandum on technology transfer (1985). At the  same time, its leadership has more than once stated its desire  to accomplish this monitoring independently, since the  above-mentioned referendum does not contain any articles about  conducting this type of inspections.    Recently, this position by the Americans has led to certain  difficulties for India and Russia when executing a joint  transaction for the sale of cryogenic engines for missile  systems. Indian programs in the area of creating ballistic  missiles and also nuclear research are in obvious contradiction  with the aspirations of the leading countries of the West to  limit the proliferation of missile technologies in the world and  also to narrow the range of states possessing nuclear weapons.  At the same time, India advances the argument that its security  today can be ensured only if it has at its disposal weapons  which its neighboring states have.    India's successful testing of the "Prithvi" missile system  in  September 1992 makes it possible to assert that the country is  already able to produce missile weapons. This event caused  considerable concern in the West.    It is known that Soviet models of weapons and military  equipment account for 50 to 70 percent of the armament of the  Indian Army. According to the Indian press, its operation over a  considerable period has demonstrated sufficient reliability and  the necessary combat qualities. The simplicity of its servicing  is also noted, which is also quite important for this country's  army. Weapons received from the USSR underwent testing during  combat operations in 1965 and 1971, and during operations  conducted by Indian armed forces in Sri Lanka.    Maintaining the achieved level of military and  military-technical ties between Russia and India is important  for both sides. The sphere of their cooperation may be expanded  in the near future by the introduction of new forms in addition  to tested forms, new ones taking shape in modern-day Russia.

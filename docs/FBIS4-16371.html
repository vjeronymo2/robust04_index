			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Tajikistan will evidently become the first partner  of Russia and Belarus in the ruble zone and economic union. The  announcement was made on Wednesday by Prime-Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin after talks with his Tajik counterpart Abdujalil  Samadov.    According to Samadov, Tajikistan's intentions are confirmed  by a preliminary understanding with Russia on the unification of  monetary systems as well as the agreement he signed in Moscow  after the talks on an 80 Bn ruble Russian loan to his country.    However, Chernomyrdin said that one should not simplify the  complex and lengthy process of forming an economic union on  which CIS members have agreed, as it is only a framework  agreement which provides for the signing of bilateral treaties.  The agreement with Belarus, for example, was under work for  eight months and required the drafting of over 30 legal  documents. This together with the difficulties accompanying the  growth of the CIS only go to prove that generally the economic  union belongs to the future.    The prime-minister said that Kazakhstan intended to be the  first one to sign such an agreement. But now that President  Nursultan Nazarbayev has suggested forming a Eurasian union the  contents and possibilities of which are so far vague, it is  difficult to say anything about his plans concerning the  economic union.    The formation of an economic union does not have the purpose  of trampling on the sovereignty of any third party, Chernomyrdin  declared. He strongly opposed attempts to accuse Russia of  having imperial ambitions and trying to subjugate former Soviet  republics.    Chernomyrdin stressed that economic integration with  Tajikistan will largely depend on the settlement of the  political situation in that Central Asian country. IF Note:  Talks are currently under way in Moscow between the Tajik  government and opposition. According to sources in the Russian  Foreign Ministry, the two sides have made considerable progress.  They agreed to sign a joint statement expressing readiness to  work for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Russian  diplomats think that even though the document is of general  nature it can be viewed as an impressive step to normalize the  situation in and around Tajikistan.</p>

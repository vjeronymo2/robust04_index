			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: Industry reeling from trade bans BRITAIN'S machine-tool industry has been decimated by the loss of business resulting from embargoes on Iraq. In 1986 the UK machine-tool industry had no exports to Iraq. This was before the Department of Trade and Industry sponsored British companies to take part in Iraq's first international trade fair following the end of the Iran-Iraq war. In the space of two years UK machine-tool manufacturers were enjoying sales of Pounds 31.4m, promoting Iraq to number three after the US and West Germany in the table of machine-tool export markets. Most of Britain's machine-tool makers had exports to Iraq. Many of the exports were being used for the manufacture of munitions. Seven years later, with the Iraqi market destroyed and with the refusal of the government to countenance a new market in Iran, the UK survivors of the high-technology end of the industry can be counted on one hand. Matrix Churchill, the company with the biggest Iraqi orders, is in receivership; Wickman Bennett of Coventry has also ceased production. It agreed a fine with Customs and Excise over exports to Iraq. Colchester Lathes, another exporter to Iraq and part of the 600 Group, has merged into its sister company. Bridgeport, which had been planning to produce machines under licence for Iraq, has closed part of its operations and trimmed others. Brown and Sharpe, which had subcontract work with Iraq, no longer makes machine tools in the UK. Executives of four machine-tool companies were questioned by Customs and Excise but charges were only pursued against three at Matrix Churchill. One case is outstanding - against Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA Tools. Customs officials admitted yesterday the prosecution was now in doubt but they said no decision had been made. Mr John Nosworthy, former director-general of the Machine Tools Technologies Association, said: 'It appears that HM Customs took some pretty drastic measures in investigating industry, but may not have been as thorough in investigating what government departments were up to.' He accused the government of damaging the industry by allowing the trial to proceed.</p>

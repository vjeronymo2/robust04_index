			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Burma revokes two martial law decrees THE Burmese military government has revoked the two martial law orders giving regional commanders the right to try suspected opponents before military tribunals. The decrees, in force since July 1989, have been revoked 'in view of the improved general situation in the country and in consideration of the interests of the people', said a report on Rangoon radio. The junta introduced the decrees to stamp out pro-democracy protests led by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. Other martial law decrees, including the banning of gatherings of more than five people, remain in effect. The government began freeing political prisoners after General Than Shwe replaced ailing hardliner General Saw Maung as its leader, but many senior opposition figures remain in detention. The decrees were revoked two days after an administrative shake-up in which commanders from the southern, central and northern military regions were appointed ministers.</p>

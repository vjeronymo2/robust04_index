			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Building as a road to recovery Sir, We employ more than 1,500 people in the electronics industry in the Rhondda and Aberdare valleys of south Wales and, to say the least, things are difficult. Fortunately, 30 per cent of our product is exported directly to EC countries and without that we would have been in more than extreme difficulties. We, along with most industrialists in the UK small and large, are under more pressure then ever before. I wish to suggest a simple remedy that would start the economy back on the road to recovery and create world-wide confidence. The quickest way to create jobs and confidence is to get the house building sector moving again; Mortgage interest relief should be increased from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 75,000 for a period of three to five years, subject to regular review; at the same time, mortgage tax relief should be increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent; Building houses is the quickest way of creating male jobs in all sectors of the community - and no one can deny that there is an urgent need for more houses. This scheme should really be self-financing because the cost of tax relief to first time buyers will be more than offset by the reduction in the benefits currently being paid to unemployed construction workers.

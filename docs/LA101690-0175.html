			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST HIKES FARES OVER FUEL  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines said today it will raise fares 5.8% on tickets purchased on  or after Oct. 31.  </P> <P> "The price increase is designed to further combat higher operating costs  resulting from fuel prices that have more than doubled since Iraq invaded  Kuwait Aug. 2," the airline said.  </P> <P> Northwest, the nation's fourth largest carrier, and other airlines already have  raised fares 9.5% in two steps since late August.  </P> <P> Since the start of the Mideast crisis, the spot price for jet fuel has jumped  from about 57 cents a gallon to $1.42 a gallon.  </P> <P> In another effort to cope with fuel costs, Northwest last week asked its labor  unions to consider a 10% wage cut for half a year in lieu of layoffs. But the  International Assn. of Machinists, the carrier's largest union, rejected wage  cuts.  </P></p>

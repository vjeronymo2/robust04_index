			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Venezuelan banks under pressure Venezuela's banking system, shaken by the failure of Banco Latino this month, is now facing a wave of heavy withdrawals by important clients, bankers said yesterday, Joseph Mann reports from Caracas. At the end of last week, corporations and wealthy individuals began to make large withdrawals from several commercial banks, and demand for US dollars spiralled to an estimated Dollars 350m-Dollars 500m last Friday, according to some estimates. These figures represent several times the usual daily volumes of dollar sales. Heavy withdrawals continued yesterday, bankers said, and demand for dollars remained strong. About 11 of the more than 40 commercial banks are reported on the central bank's 'watch list' and have had liquidity problems in recent days. Most holders of small accounts appear not to have been panicked by the crisis. The government yesterday began to provide banks suffering from 'temporary liquidity problems' with liberal financing under an emergency assistance plan announced last week. At the same time, officials and representatives of the banking community told the public to ignore rumours and trust the banking system. Hundreds of account holders at Banco Latino blocked traffic in central Caracas yesterday, demanding immediate payment of their deposits. The government has issued confusing information on when the bank will reopen and how much depositors will receive initially. Currently, the plan is to reopen the failed bank today or tomorrow and reimburse clients with deposits of up to Dollars 925 (Pounds 625).</p>

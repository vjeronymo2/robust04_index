			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): An air of unreality in the hospital Trainee anaesthetists will soon be taught how to tackle life-threatening situations without putting patients at risk, using a virtual reality training programme, writes Ben Vaughan. By donning a head-mounted display, the user enters a virtual reality world, which is an exact replica of the hospital's operating theatre, complete with a patient in need of treatment. A hand-held peripheral emulates hands and allows the student to pick the chosen treatment. The success of the treatment is immediately apparent as the patient and the monitoring instruments respond. The system was designed by Virtuality Group, of the UK and The Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. Virtuality Group: UK, tel 0533 337000; fax 0533 471 855.</p>

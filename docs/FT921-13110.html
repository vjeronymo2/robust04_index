			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Prising quits as head of Whirlpool in Europe WHIRLPOOL, the world's largest white goods producer, yesterday announced the surprise resignation of Mr Jan Prising as president and chief executive of Whirlpool International, the wholly-owned European subsidiary. Mr Prising was brought into Whirlpool in January 1990 to overhaul and strengthen the company's European white goods operation - the former Philips major domestic appliance business for which Whirlpool completed a Dollars 1.1bn two-stage takeover in July. Mr Prising said: 'I feel as if I have largely accomplished what I was asked to do. . . I want to spend more time with my family and pursue other business interests in Europe.' He is to be replaced on February 12 by Mr William Marohn, executive vice-president of Whirlpool's North American Appliance Group. Mr Marohn is based at Whirlpool International's administrative base in Comerio, Italy, as part of a job exchange with Mr Prising that was to have continued until April.</p>

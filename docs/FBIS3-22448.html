A study which was published  yesterday shows that more than 1 billion tonnes of radioactively  contaminated waste would have to be safely disposed.    The wastes, which contain radium, constantly release radon.  This leads to about six deaths from radiation per year just in  the east Thuringian area of Ronneburg, radiation biologist  Gerhard Schmidt from Darmstadt says. He called on the Federal  Government to quickly fulfill its legal duty to dispose of the  waste, because otherwise there would be unjustifiable long-term  effects.    According to the institute, there have been 5,000  job-related  deaths at the Wismut corporation since the beginning of uranium  mining in 1945. Over 40 years the Soviet Union gained about  220,000 tonnes of uranium from the ore in the south of the  former GDR as basic material for its military and civilian  nuclear program. According to estimates by the Darmstadt  institute, the defusing of the environmental bomb will cost far  more than the so far assumed 15 billion marks.</p>

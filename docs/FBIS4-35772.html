			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 3 (AFP) -- Tens of thousands of angry  mourners took part in funeral ceremonies in Beirut and around  Lebanon on Friday [3 June] for up to 45 Hizballah guerrillas  killed in a devastating Israeli air raid.    Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah told an  estimated 20,000 people in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern  suburbs: "The (anti-Israeli) Islamic Resistance has been born  anew." Nasrallah, frequently interrupted by mourners chanting  Islamic slogans and calling "Death to Israel" and "Death to the  United States," vowed that the guerrillas were ready for a  "Jihad (holy war) until victory." He called on Lebanon to pull  out of Middle East peace talks with Israel, following Thursday's  raid. "Giving peace and security to Israel is forbidden. We  call on all the mujahidin (Islamic fighters) in the world and in  occupied Palestine to consider this cause their own," he said.    Around 5,000 mourners also gathered in the Syrian-controlled  town of Ba'labakk for the funeral of five fighters, while 1,500  others paid their last respects to 13 guerrillas at a ceremony  in the southern port of Sidon.    The coffins of 10 fighters and the portraits of two others  were carried shoulder-high by mourners in the southern suburbs  of Beirut.    In the southern port city of Sidon, marchers chanted in  unison: "War, war until victory" and vowed to liberate Jerusalem  from Israeli occupation.    Ahmad Manna', 60, the father of one of 13 Hizballah  "martyrs"  from south Lebanon, told AFP: "I still have seven sons and I  will offer them for the sake of Allah and for liberating south  Lebanon."    Shaykh Nabil Qa'uq, a Hizballah official, said Hizballah was  determined to "strike Israel anywhere and at any time."    Lebanon has declared a national day of mourning and called  for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, branding the Israeli  raid a massacre and an attack on its sovereignty. Shops,  schools and public offices were closed. Radio and television  stations broadcast classical music or verses from the Koran, and  the authorities ordered that flags be flown at half-mast.  Airport traffic was also suspended for one hour.    The Iranian-backed group said 26 guerrillas were killed in  the raid and 40 others wounded. But Lebanese Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz put the death toll at 45 while hospital officials  in the al-Biqa' said 85 were wounded.</p>

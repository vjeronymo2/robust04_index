According to Bosnian Serb military sources in Zvornik, on  the  border with Yugoslavia where the cargo controls are made, 13  trucks of the UN High Commisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have  taken 72 tonnes of flour to Tuzla, north-east  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The International Committee of the Red  Cross has taken 61 tonnes of flour and 35 tonnes of family food  parcels to the same city.    Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, has  received 78 tonnes of flour and 10 tonnes of heating oil, and 10  tonnes of heating oil have been sent to the medical center in  Zvornik.    The international humanitarian organisation Duga from Skopje  has sent three trailers with food and medicine to be distributed  to both the Moslem and Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo.    The delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population  in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been hindered for months due to fierce  Moslem-Croat fighting in the central and southern parts of the  republic in which a war between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems  has been raging since April 1992. During all this time the only  safe way for the convoys is through the territory under Bosnian  Serb control.</p>

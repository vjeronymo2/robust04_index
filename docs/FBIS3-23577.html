			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Panfilov under the rubric "Tajikistan": </F> "The Opposition Demands Talks: The Government of Tajikistan and  the Russian Military Are Discussing an Armistice"]    [Text] Several meetings were held in Moscow during the past  week between officials of Tajikistan and the command element of  the CIS peacekeeping forces in that republic and members of the  directorate of the Coordinating Center for Democratic Forces in  the CIS countries. The so-called political opposition was  represented by the democratically oriented intelligentsia forced  out of Tajikistan and also by the leadership of political  parties and movements officially banned by the Dushanbe regime.    Naturally, the main thrust of armed opposition forces  penetrating across the Afghan-Tajik border is received by  Russian troops, and the concern of their command element is  apparent. The latest interviews given by Colonel-General Boris  Pyankov, the commander, remind one more of a show of force than  concern that peace and agreement are hardly possible without a  political settlement of the situation. Nonetheless, in two  meetings with members of the Coordinating Center in Moscow on 14  and 16 February Boris Pyankov attempted to get the moderate  opposition to reject the "formation of bands" in Afghanistan,  probably with a view to splitting up the entire opposition and  shifting all of the blame for the conflict onto armed refugees  in the neighboring country. The conclusions drawn by the  Coordinating Center are that they consider the beginning of  talks to be the main problem. These conclusions were ultimately  accepted, but how seriously they will be regarded will become  clear only after Pyankov has told the same thing to Imamali  Rakhmanov, Tajikistan's leader. Neither Rakhmonov nor anyone  else from among the Tajik officials has yet voiced support for  holding talks with the opposition, however. The first documents  have been joint proposals submitted to the Russian government,  the presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan and the foreign  ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, as  well as Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon, representative of the UN  secretary general, by the Coordinating Center, the Council for  the Resistance in Afghanistan and the Democratic Party. The  ambassador has already given his agreement to facilitate the  talks. There has still been no official response from  Tajikistan, however, with the exception of an interview given  the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA by Imamali Rakhmanov in which he  continues to divide citizens of the country he heads into good  and bad.    On the other hand, delegations from Dushanbe began arriving  in Moscow to meet with the refugees and convince them to return.  The first trip, by Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy chairman of the  Supreme Soviet, at the end of last year ended in failure. In his  interview on Tajik television, however, he depicted it as an  achievement. His second trip to Moscow, made on 15 February, was  also unsuccessful. Neither the Coordinating Center nor the  Foundation for Aiding Refugees agreed to discuss anything with  Koimdodov, but this time a MAYAK correspondent sent out a report  on the delegation's successes from Dushanbe. "This can be called  nothing other than a provocation," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent was told by Otakhon Latifi, head of the center,  and Khabib Sanginov, chairman of the foundation. Furthermore,  they do not believe that the delegation was empowered by the  republic's Supreme Soviet to conduct any kind of talks.    Be that as it may, it appears that Dushanbe is attempting to  gain time, and Russian troops are paying for that. Most likely,  after the Ramadan fast, the conflicts in Tajikistan will flare  up with new force. According to the Russian military, however,  they will occur not on the border but inside the republic. It is  not clear at this time how the military themselves will react to  these proposals. It is known, however, that coalition forces are  planning to conduct exercises, and an additional contingent will  be sent to Tajikistan.    The actions of the Tajik authorities and the Russian  military  can be explained by their fear of a dangerous escalation. This  was probably not a coincidence, but General Boris Pyankov, Prime  Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov, Kozidavlat Koimdodov, deputy  chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Mecheslav Senkevich, the  Russian Federation's ambassador to Tajikistan, (known for having  provided diplomatic support for armed detachments of the former  chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Safarali Kendzhayev, in the  capture of Dushanbe), all found themselves in Moscow at the same  time.</p>

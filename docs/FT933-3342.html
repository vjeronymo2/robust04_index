			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: D-Mark's slip dampens enthusiasm for bunds THE D-Mark's slippage against the dollar and several European currencies dampened demand for bunds, but helped boost prices in other continental European markets. After range-trading all day, German government bonds were sold towards the close, with the December bund future hitting a low of 98.30 in after-hours trading. THE Belgian franc's recovery against the D-Mark boosted Belgian bonds, which rose  3/8 point on the day. The franc was not dented by the Belgian central bank's cut in its end-of-day rate to 12 per cent, which fuelled hopes for further rate cuts. The medium-dated sector outperformed the long end, and five-year Belgian bonds now yield some 87 basis points over their German counterparts, down from a spread of 107 basis points at yesterday's opening. The 10-year yield spread shrank to 97 from 105 basis points. FRENCH government bonds gained in the morning on growing hopes that the Bank of France might cut its 6.75 per cent repo rate. However, when that rate was left unchanged, 10-year bond prices eased from their highs to end only slightly stronger. Two- and five-year notes fell slightly as traders set up positions ahead of Thursday's new supply. The franc's gains against the D-Mark underpinned sentiment and kept hopes for a near-term easing alive, with some traders betting on a rate cut at Thursday's repo operation. UK GILT prices ended little changed after slipping back just before the close of the market. In an otherwise lacklustre trading day, the index-linked sector performed well. The 2024 index-linked gilt ended 1 1/2 points higher, to yield 3.16 per cent, down from 3.23 per cent. The Bank of England took advantage of the price surge to announce a Pounds 250m tranche of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2030 today. AFTER resuming its upward trend late last week, the Treasury long bond firmed slightly in quiet trading yesterday, as the market awaited today's figures on August retail price inflation. Prices slipped at the short end, however. By the day's end, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 105 9/32 , yielding 5.871 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.808 per cent. Traders yesterday were biding their time in anticipation of the government's release of last month's consumer price index, expected to show retail prices edging 0.2 per cent higher, following a 0.1 per cent increase in July and no change in June.</p>

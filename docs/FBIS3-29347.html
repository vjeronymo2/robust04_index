Kim has not been shown on television, even on his birthday, and  has recently made no public appearances, Yi told reporters,  adding that Kim's injuries were so bad that he may not be able  to do his job properly even if he succeeds his father, President  Kim Il-song.    "I don't know if Kim was hurt in a car accident or from a  gunshot, but it doesn't look like a natural illness," Yi said.  He preferred that his source remain anonymous, except to say  that he or she is a foreigner. DP insiders said Yi probably  heard the news from a North Korea expert with whom he had  communicated while trying to arrange a visit to North Korea.    The Japanese press has been reporting that the succession  hopes of Kim Chong-il have suffered a severe blow, citing "the  dear leader's" financial woes. Government officials dismissed  the rumors about Kim.    "There have always been rumors about Kim Chong-il and rumors  are just tales that are groundless," one official said, adding  that Kim did not appear on television on his previous birthdays.</p>

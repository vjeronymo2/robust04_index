			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 29 (AFP) -- Ukraine has signed a draft  agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to  allow the UN atomic watchdog agency to inspect its nuclear  installations, an IAEA statement said Wednesday [29 June].    Under the preliminary accord, "Ukraine undertakes to use the  nuclear material and facilties under its jurisdiction or control  exclusively for peaceful purposes."    The draft safeguards agreement, as it is known, was reached  in two days of talks with Kiev officials at IAEA headquarters  here and must be approved by the agency's Board of Governors  takes it up in September.    It also provides for "the application of safeguards by the  IAEA to all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities  of Ukraine."    IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer said the draft accord is  a key first step towards Ukraine's joining the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty.    Ukraine is the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear  disaster, caused by a meltdown in the number four reactor at its  Chernobyl nuclear plant on April 26, 1986.    Western states have been applying pressure for the plant to  be totally shut down but President Leonid Kravchuk has brushed  the demands aside, saying his country needs to keep it going for  at least several more years to cover Ukraine's energy shortage.</p>

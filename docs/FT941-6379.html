			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Wisdom in hills above Nice Case Study: Sophia Antipolis, science park On France's sun-filled Mediterranean coast, scientists strive to commercialise laboratory ideas. Not everyone, however, can find the winning formula Half-buried on the hills outside Nice in the south of France sits a unique cluster of high-technology companies and research establishments. Off-duty scientists jog by low-slung buildings, housing pharmaceutical laboratories and computer centres that handle world-wide transactions for clients like Citibank or Air France. This is Sophia Antipolis, set up at the end of the 1960s to bring top-class brainpower to a landscape of Mediterranean pines and solar-powered street lights. The science park, named after the Greek word for 'wisdom' and the historical name for nearby Antibes, has grown into a small town. It provides jobs for 16,000 people of 40 nationalities, as well as places for 2,000 students at an extension of Nice university. Sophia Antipolis - about to celebrate its 25th anniversary this summer  - has come of age. However, it is still struggling to make an impact in overcoming the main problem faced by European science: leaping the hurdles between the laboratory and the marketplace. Mr Philippe Boulanger, the youthful managing director of a five-year-old telecommunications concern, Access Privilege, illustrates one way the obstacles can be overcome. After receiving a doctorate at Nice university, he established his company with three partners in a small office complex offering stunning views of the Alps. His company has just been bought by the Sagem telephones group, in a deal that will make him a millionaire. Mr Boulanger says his success has been based on specialising in a field (in his case, networks using Apple computers) where there was effectively no competition. He admits, however, he knows only one other person in France who has had a similar breakthrough. Another success story is FDM Pharma, based here since 1981. This 200-strong company, which has hitherto doubled turnover every year, uses sophisticated computer technology to record hospital drugs tests for US and European pharmaceutical companies. Mr Benoit Bouche, the 33-year-old chairman, says he brought the company to the science park after a top US scientist he wanted to hire refused to move to its original headquarters in Lille in northern France. The official tally of corporations - totalling 980 - highlights the site's attractiveness. Those present range from large concerns like Thomson, Digital Equipment, AT&amp;T and Wellcome to many small businesses employing less than 10 people. Companies in the computer field have, however, been facing difficulties. The international downturn in the computer industry has led to 400 job losses at Digital (now down to 600 staff) and similar cuts at nearby research establishments of IBM and Texas Instruments. Mr Pierre Bernhard, director of the Sophia Antipolis branch of the public sector computer research institute Inria, says the site's magnetic qualities affects even those who have lost their jobs. Many computer engineers who have recently been made redundant have stayed on to start new businesses. Sophia Antipolis places a lot of hope on companies in the health care sector. Mr Jacques Le Guillerm, managing director of the local offshoot of Cordis, the US medical group, says the science park has been saved by its multi-disciplinary structure. 'If we had simply had information technology here, it would have been catastrophic.' Cordis research and production staff here has grown from 150 to 200 during the last 18 months. Mr Le Guillerm praises exchanges between pharmacological engineers and information technologists at Sophia Antipolis. 'Synergy is now starting to take off.' A long journey, however, still lies ahead.</p>

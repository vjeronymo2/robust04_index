			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Checked. No Mines, But There Could </F> Be"]    [Text] The Pacific Fleet Command has notified the  inhabitants of Maritime Kray (Far East) of the completion of  work on clearing the territories of population centers and  agricultural land in the proximity of the Pacific Fleet's arms  dump at Novonezhino (70 km from Vladivostok).    A fire and an explosion occurred at that dump 14-15 May as a  result of servicemen's negligence, causing economic damage to  the region in excess of 30 billion rubles.    The explosion scattered a large quantity of ammunition  around  the nearby areas, posing a threat to the population.    Sappers and others involved in eliminating the aftermath of  the explosion have also fully inspected a 3-km-wide belt around  the dump and rendered harmless dangerous explosive objects.    The population can now embark on normal activities, while  being urged not to slacken vigilance. On 31 May a 2-meter  rocket thrown out by the blast wave 15 days previously was  extracted from the ground in the truck garden of a resident of  the village of Romanovka, which is approximately 10 km from the  epicenter of the explosions, the newspaper VLADIVOSTOK has  reported.</p>

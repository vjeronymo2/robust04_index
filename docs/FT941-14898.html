			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher makes Dollars 25m fresh produce purchase Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is paying up to Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) for certain assets of Fresh Western Marketing, a Californian supplier of fresh produce. Fresh Western operates under the River Ranch brand. Through relationships with growers and joint ventures it grows, stores and distributes a variety of produce to the retail sector and food service distributors across the US. Albert Fisher said that as well as being a leading supplier of salad mixes, Fresh Western also brought to the group patented technology for extending produce shelf life. This used a two-way breathable membrane to control the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the sealed package, thereby considerably extending the life of certain items of fresh produce as well as other food products and flowers. Albert Fisher said the acquisition was expected to enhance earnings in its first year. The initial cash payment will be about Dollars 7.8m, the book value of the net assets acquired. The profit-related deferred consideration is payable in cash to a maximum Dollars 25m. Fresh Western's turnover in 1993 was about Dollars 200m, of which about 25 per cent was exported, principally to east Asia, for an estimated pre-tax profit of Dollars 4.5m. Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, said: 'The addition of Fresh Western's technology, markets, produce expertise and grower connections represents an important extension to our capabilities in the fast-growing prepared salad markets for retail and food service customers. 'The operations complement the Albert Fisher North American distribution and regional processing companies in produce range, procurement, services and markets.'</p>

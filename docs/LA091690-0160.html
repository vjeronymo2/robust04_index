			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SRI LANKA TROOPS ADVANCE THROUGH REBEL-HELD TOWN  </P> <P> Government troops advanced through booby-trapped buildings and mined streets  Saturday, seeking to capture a hospital building and gain a strategic edge in  war-ravaged Jaffna, military officials said.  </P> <P> The hospital is in the center of the rebel-held town and about a mile from  Jaffna Fort, controlled by government troops that claim they defeated Tamil  separatist guerrillas Thursday to end a three-month siege.  </P> <P> The government, meanwhile, warned citizens of possible attack by Tamil forces  in the northern Jaffna region, most of which is controlled by the rebels.  </P> <P> "Due to the success of the security forces in the Jaffna Peninsula, the (Tamil  Tigers) hierarchy has instructed its cadres to attack civilians," said a  defense ministry statement issued Saturday.  </P> <P> Military officials did not say how far their men had advanced toward the  hospital. But a senior officer said troops were under constant rebel fire and  progress was slow because of mines buried in the streets and booby traps hidden  in buildings along the way.  </P> <P> Control of the hospital would give the Sinhalese-dominated government a major  base in the town of 60,000 people and, more importantly, a chance to win  support among residents by resuming medical services.  </P> <P> The overwhelmingly Tamil town 185 miles northeast of the capital city of  Colombo has been a rebel stronghold since the separatist war against Sri  Lanka's Sinhalese majority began in 1983.  </P> <P> But recent battles in the area and the rebel's strong-arm tactics of soliciting  funds have sapped enthusiasm for the guerrillas' cause in Jaffna, visitors to  the town said.  </P> <P> At least 14,000 people have been killed in the civil war.  </P> <P> The government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least 136 wounded since  the siege on the 17th-Century fort was broken Thursday. It claims more than 100  Tamil rebels have died.  </P> <P> The Tamil office in London, however, denied the siege had been broken.  </P> <P> The rebels seek political autonomy or independence for the Tamil minority,  claiming Sinhalese discrimination in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala  language.  </P> <P> The Sinhalese, who comprise 75% of the nation's 16 million people, control the  government and the military.  </P> <P> Tamils account for 18% of the people who live in the island nation. Muslims  make up 7% of the population.  </P></p>

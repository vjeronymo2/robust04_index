			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: The jargon explained Executive pension plans are company pension schemes designed for individuals or small groups of senior executives and directors. Employer contributions at present are virtually unlimited provided the pension at retirement does not exceed two-thirds of final salary (restricted for some higher earners). New rules from September 1 will cut total contributions in the early years from more than 100 per cent of salary a year to about 30 per cent. With an EPP the administration and investment are combined under an insurance company package so all of the contributions must go into the provider's funds. Small Self-Administered Schemes are more flexible than EPPs since you can run your own portfolio, as Leslie McClements does (right), or you can appoint a stockbroker. SSASs are available from firms of consulting actuaries and insurance companies and are particularly popular with small family businesses. Self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) are a special type of personal pension that can be used by employees, the self-employed and partnerships and are available mainly from life offices. Total annual employee and employer contributions are limited to 17.5 per cent of earned income for younger employees (restricted for higher earners) but there is no monetary limit on the final pension which is bought in the form of an annuity from a life office.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Goldman calls lawsuit frivolous GOLDMAN, Sachs, the New York investment bank, yesterday accused a US subsidiary of Prudential, the UK insurance group, of an attempted 'hold-up' in filing a lawsuit this week against Goldman. The suit, filed on behalf of Prudential-owned Jackson National Life, accused Goldman of 'fraudulent conveyance' in the 1988 leveraged buy-out of Bucyrus-Erie, a manufacturer of mining equipment, which was organised by Goldman. It seeks unspecified damages. Jackson brought Dollars 60m of bonds in Bucyrus, which recently failed to meet bond interest payments, through a private placement in 1990. Its suit is the latest of several seeking to portray 1980s buy-outs which have gone sour as fraudulent deceptions of investors. Such suits have not had great success in court. Goldman yesterday dismissed the lawsuit as a 'frivolous complaint without any merit'. It said Jackson National was a Dollars 16bn, sophisticated insurer which, following its own due diligence review, had made a private placement investment in Bucyrus 'more than two years after the original leveraged buy-out was completed'. It added that Bucyrus had been operating in a depressed industry in a difficult economy. 'Jackson National and their investment advisor, PPM America, are apparently upset and are trying to hold someone up because their investment in Bucyrus-Erie hasn't fared well,' said Goldman. PPM also claims the terms of the LBO 'placed the Goldman group in control of (the company) so that they could realise all the benefits of operating BE while BE's unsecured creditors assumed all of the financial risks associated with such operations.'</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Follow those directors / A look at boardroom share deals in 1992 SHARE DEALS by directors tend to be studied for the clues they give to the prospects of the individual company concerned. But they can also be assessed on a larger scale. We can examine movements in the buy/sell ratio, produced by dividing the total number of purchases by directors by the number of sales. In the US, where this data has been collected for many years, the long-term average is around two sales for every purchase. Our experience is rather more limited - we started in May 1990 - but tells a different story; the UK average is two purchases for every sale. The fact that stock market conditions have been difficult over the past three years might help to explain the difference. In happier times, the UK ratio would, no doubt, move closer to that in the US. The year started with just over two purchases for every sale. Between February and April, the volume of selling rose, driving the ratio down to its low point for the year - in May, we recorded just 1.26 purchases for every sale. Historically, directors' transactions have proved an accurate indicator of market movements but, in this instance, political uncertainty caused even traditionally resolute directors to take profits. The prospect of higher personal taxation proved a distorting factor. Thereafter, the buy/sell ratio resumed its role as a leading indicator. As the market fell back in July and August, directors accumulated shares at a prodigious rate so that, in August, the buy/sell ratio had soared to 4.87:1. This volume of buying was far greater than anything seen since we began monitoring directors' transactions. It also marked neatly the turning point for the market. In November, the buy/sell ratio stood at 2.8:1, almost back at the level it started the year. At the individual company level, any scientific summary of performance is well nigh impossible in a weekly column, but there is a mass of evidence which lends credibility to the predictive ability of directors. Some sectors achieved a high profile because of the greater propensity for directors to deal, be it buying or selling. The buying sectors included building materials, contracting and construction, oil and gas, stores and property, while directors of insurance brokers and food retailers were conspicuous sellers of stock. Many companies in these sectors have featured regularly over the past year. One such is Berkeley Group, the house-builder. Two directors bought shares at 224p in July and six directors then bought more heavily a few weeks later at the low point of the year, just 186p. Since then, the shares have recovered strongly and now stand at around 300p. The UK construction industry has endured what many would describe as its worst recession since the war. But a bargain is still a bargain, so readers should have noted purchases totalling 150,000 shares by three directors in Taylor Woodrow in October. The price paid was around 36p; the price now is close to 60p. Directors of Tarmac have been accumulating stock off and on for most of the year, but the most remarkable purchase was the 200,000 shares bought by Sir Anthony Bamford at 70p at the end of July. He is already sitting on a profit of more than 50 per cent. Boardroom buying might have been most conspicuous among construction companies but the prize for consistent purchases almost certainly lies with Burton, the high street chain which includes Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins. Over the year, we recorded a total of 10 purchases by eight different directors. They averaged about 34p, just half the present price. The purchase of shares by someone newly appointed to the board should be studied carefully. If it is an internal appointment, then the share buying should prove more instructive, but beware of token purchases by outsiders. In August, Charles Allen was appointed to head Granada's television operations and, at the same time, he bought 85,000 shares at 235p. Three weeks later, Gerry Robinson, who had been appointed chief executive earlier that year, acquired just under 300,000 shares at 247p. Recent results revealed profits far in excess of brokers' forecasts and the shares have soared to 331p, close to their high for the year. Close scrutiny of the sales can be equally rewarding. Our vote for best-timed sale of 1992 goes to Peter Linacre, chief executive of Caird Group, the land-fill and waste treatment company. On March 27 1992, he sold 2,622,270 shares at 85p. He did not hang on to a single share. With the price now languishing at 14p, he saved himself a cool Pounds 1.88m. Sometimes, trends continue from one year to the next. In 1991, Paul Hyde-Thompson sold well over 500,000 shares in Ibstock Johnsen, the brick manufacturer, at prices around 93p. He sold a further 163,000 shares at much the same price in May this year, since when the shares have been on the slide. One of the few companies in that sector not to enjoy a post-devaluation rally, they are stuck at their low point for the year - just 36p. While there have been instances of directors getting it wrong in 1992 - Cyril Stein at Ladbroke is perhaps the best example - the evidence suggests that they are still well worth following.</p>

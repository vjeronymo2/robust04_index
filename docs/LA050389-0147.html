			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COSMETICS FIRM 'NOT FOR SALE';  </P> <P> TWO SUITORS CALLING, AVON SAYS, BUT IT CLOSES DOOR  </P> <P> Cosmetics giant Avon Products Inc. today disclosed that corporate raider Irwin  Jacobs and door-to-door home products seller Amway Corp. together bought 10% of  its stock, but Avon said it is not for sale.  </P> <P> Avon stock jumped $4.875 to $37 in initial trading after the news was  announced.  </P> <P> Avon refused any further comment on widely circulated market rumors that Jacobs  and Amway have made a buyout proposal.  </P> <P> The company said only that it "has been notified" that the partnership owns  their stock, but Avon would not say who approached the company.  </P> <P> Avon is a worldwide cosmetics and direct selling company with sales of $3  billion in 1988. But it lost $404 million in the year due in part to the costs  of a restructuring.  </P> <P> While declining to comment on whether an actual buyout proposal had been made,  the company said, "We believe that Avon can provide the best value to its  shareholders by remaining independent."  </P> <P> For several days Minneapolis-based Jacobs has been rumored as a possible suitor  for Avon and its stock has been actively traded. The entry of Ada, Mich.-based  Amway was a surprise.  </P> <P> Jacobs was not immediately available to comment. Other parties rumored to be  interested in Avon include Unilever PLC of Britain and Revlon Group Inc. chief  Ronald Perelman.  </P> <P> Unilever has declined comment and Perelman was not immediately available to  comment.  </P> <P> Takeover talk surfaced about Avon after Unilever last week said it ceased  negotiations over the purchase of U.S. toiletries firm Faberge, analysts said.  </P></p>

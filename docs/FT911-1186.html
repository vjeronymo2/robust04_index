			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bank of Ireland First Holdings shows loss Bank of Ireland First Holdings, the holding company for the Bank of Ireland's US subsidiary First NH Banks, reported a loss before tax for the quarter to March 31 1991 of IRPounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.93m). This follows a loss of IRPounds 19m in the preceding quarter, and of IRPounds 3.3m in the first quarter of 1990, a record which prompted the resignation of Mr Mark Hely-Hutchinson, the Bank of Ireland's chief executive, last year. However, progress has been made in reducing operating costs, which, at Pounds 15.9m against Pounds 16.6m, were 4 per cent down on the same period last year. But loan loss provisions remain 'unacceptably high', and income continues to be adversely affected by a high level of non-performing assets. The capital position of First NH Banks was strengthened during the quarter by an investment of Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.57m) in equity from the group.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms sector active TELECOMS sector shares reacted badly to the launch of Mercury's new 'One-2-One' cellular system as investors became fearful of a price war in the lucrative mobile telecoms business. However, telecoms analysts were more sanguine, describing the share markdowns as no more than a mere knee-jerk reaction and an excuse by some investors to take profits in a sector which has recently had a successful run. Mercury, which is a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless, said its new mobile system would offer domestic users free air-time in selected off peak hours in the M25 London area. BT was considered to be potentially the main loser among the telecoms group as current standard customers considered switching to cellular on the back of the Mercury offer. Mr Chris McFadden at Smith New Court said: 'Today's move is fundamentally positive because it opens up the mobile telecoms market to the mass public. The cake will now get bigger.' However, specialists also pointed out that the response of the other cellular phone groups and of standard telephone operators could deter investors from the sector in the short term, and that shares were most likely to be in for a dull time. C&amp;W shares tumbled 19 to 850p, BT ordinary 6 to 420 1/2 p, Vodafone 19 1/2 to 490 1/2 p and Securicor 29 to 710p.</p>

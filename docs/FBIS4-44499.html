			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Ying (2110 1305) entitled: "Hainan Pays </F> Close Attention to Development Trends in Taiwan Singapore  Cooperation"]    [Text] Taiwan's Executive Yuan head Lien Chan in early  January engaged in a week of "vacation diplomacy" in Malaysia  and Singapore, and at one point became a media focal point; the  repercussions on Taiwan amounted to fervor for investment in  Hainan.  <H5>  Intensity of Beijing's Reaction Yet To Be Determined </H5>   The diplomatic technique the CPC has used with the upper  levels of Taiwan's government has reflected a low-key approach.  CPC officials, through diplomatic personnel stationed in  Malaysia, lodged protests, but these lacked any new content.  After the event, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's  statement on where China stands on the issue also did not go  beyond past statements, but pointed out that Lien Chan's  so-called "vacation diplomacy" in essence is a new type of  flower involving a "diplomacy elastically stretching to  encompass real affairs," the goal of which is to have "two  Chinas" and "one China one Taiwan." He expressed China's  "resolute opposition" to this approach.    On 2 January, Lien Chan arrived in Singapore, and the CPC  adopted an look but not talk approach, perhaps being unwilling  to cause problems for old friend Lee Kuan Yew.    The CPC-controlled media remained silent, and Renmin Ribao  and provincial level party papers did not report any news  concerning this event.    However, XINHUA's "reference dispatch" was different than  others, and though it never directly published the official  position, it provided a wide-ranging commentary on foreign media  reporting and the bent of Taiwan and Hong Kong press  commentaries, hence it is possible to ferret out the CPC's  attitude on this event. The Hong Kong Taiwan edition of the  "reference dispatch" for the first 10 days of January described  Taiwan, and the CHINA TIMES, Joint Report, and NEW NEWS reports,  editorials, and commentaries related to Lien Chan's visit all  paid particular attention to Taiwan's "go south policy," and "go  west policy," and the issue of Taiwan Singapore joint investment  in Hainan became a focal point of commentary.  <H5>  Singing the Same Old Tune, Affirming Investment </H5>   Hong Kong's leftist periodicals, though they did no news  follow up on Lien Chan's trip, after the event (10 days after  Lien had returned to Taiwan), took a comparatively "official"  position, using commentaries to attack Taipei's "vacation  diplomacy," not only several steps later than the Foreign  Ministry statement, but also singing the same old tune, with not  a shred of anything new.    Hong Kong's newspaper commentaries, when discussing the  results of Lien's visit to Singapore, were also brimming with  affirmation and admiration. This was all due to the fact that  news of Taiwan Singapore cooperation in investing in Hainan "has  already received the approval of relevant quarters on Taiwan,"  and Taiwan authorities "are actively appraising the feasibility  of this plan." The commentators believe that Lien's proposal to  develop Hainan is "implementing a mainland policy by moving to  take the initiative," and "there is no doubt that many  investment opportunities will be provided to Taiwan businesses."  The commentaries describe Taiwan business circle figures as  having the following view on this trend: "it will help in  bettering relations between the two sides, and develop the  aspect of mutual benefit."  <H5>  "Association for Economic Promotion" Establishment Not By </H5> Chance    At the same time as CPC officials are criticizing Taiwan for  "vacation diplomacy," and going all out in engaging in a "one  China, one Taiwan" plot, high level leaders on Hainan are not  listening to the sounds coming from the center, and have made  economic circles in Hong Kong and Taiwan focus attention on the  announcement of the establishment of the "Hainan-Taiwan (Hong  Kong and Macao) Association for Economic Cooperation"  (abbreviated the Association for Economic Cooperation). This  seems to manifest an attitude of "you in the `center' talk about  political principles, and we will talk about economic benefits."    This "Association" is by no means a makeshift creation of  the  Hainan provincial party committee. Earlier, in May of 1993,  Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu, during an interview with the  Taiwan media, disclosed that tentative concept that the province  was "strengthening cooperation with Taiwan." In July, concrete  appraisals and preparations got under way. When the  "Association" registered its establishment, though Taiwan only  had two of the fourteen founding enterprises (Hainan had eight,  and Hong Kong four), the provincial Taiwan affairs office had  considerable influence among the players.    It was decided to call the association "Hainan Taiwan" and  not "Hainan, Hong Kong, Taiwan," a fact that appears to have  significant import. The provincial Taiwan affairs office on its  own facilitated the "Association" by stressing it is a "popular  organization," and also indicates that Hainan does not wish to  reveal its political essence. Vice Governor Mao Zhijun stated  that if an enterprise wants to join the "Association," it must  first support the unification of the "deeply loved motherland."  In sum, Hainan Province, at the time it announced the  establishment of the "Association," was clearly indicating that  it was unwilling, because of central political principles, to  abandon the benefits of Taiwan business investment in Hainan,  and that its approach would be different from the way the CPC is  handling Sino-British relations, which is pinning down economic  projects, and from the approach six months ago of using economic  sanctions against France to protest French arms sales to Taiwan.  <H5>  Provincial Party Committee Paying Close Attention to Effect </H5> of Lien Chan    Lien Chan, when he met in Singapore with Prime Minister Goh,  proposed the tentative idea of linking hands to develop Hainan  and making Hainan into the economic hot spot of southeast Asia  in a short space of time. The Hainan Provincial Party committee  is playing close attention to news relevant to this and to the  reaction on Taiwan, and in addition to strengthening the flow of  information, provincial officials issued a directive on it to  the Hong Kong Longtou Corporation (Huahai), requesting that  Huahai use its "window" role, and thoroughly evaluate "the  effectiveness of Lien Chan" on the trend of Taiwan investment in  Hainan. The close attention paid by the Hainan provincial Party  committee to Lien's visit to Singapore includes the following  points:    1) The specific content of Lien and Goh's tentative plan to  cooperate on investment in Hainan;    2) Singapore's support for Taiwan to become a "dialogue  partner" of ASEAN, and the reaction to this in the region;    3) The concrete plan of the Taiwan side to "develop"  Zhongnan  Peninsula;    4) The situation in the past when Taiwan businessmen in  Singapore jointly invested with new countries in the mainland  market;    5) What specific actions and reactions Taiwan businesses  have  had, etc.  <H5>  Overseas Organizations Work To Coordinate Techniques </H5>   "Huahai" Corporation is the top organization Hainan  officials  control in Hong Kong and Macao. Looking at the corporations's  major achievements in the eight years since Huahai became  stationed in Hong Kong, its diversified management, and the  overall leadership of the province's small and large Hong  Kong-based organizations and enterprises, the corporation's  special advantages and position can clearly be seen. Businesses  overseen by Huahai not only include trading, real estate, and  financial businesses, but also visa brokers.    Recently the affairs of the Huahai Corporation seem to have  become even busier. The tentative plan for Taiwan and Singapore  to jointly develop Hainan has brought a new turning point to the  development of the island. The director of the Huahai  Corporation says that in order to adapt to a foreign oriented  economy, he welcomes potential investment in Hainan, tourism is  riding a new high tide, and the Huahai-subordinate Hainan  Tourism Corporation will be supplying a series of business  tourist services convenient for Taiwan businesses, from plane  chartering services to arranging complete full-service tours of  Hainan, and consulting services to enhance Taiwan, and other  foreign business investment. Huahai's external publicity  material in particular stresses that Hainan supplies "on ground  visas" for travelling traders, and for Taiwan and foreign  businessmen staying for no more than 15 days this eliminates  visa hassles.    The special environment of Hainan Island makes it convenient  for the Hainan Special Economic Zone to implement special  preferential policies for foreign businesses. It is understood  that central authorities have given Hainan even greater leeway.  The Yangpu Development Zone, which has been controversial, going  from being "patriotic" to "selling the country," has entered  full bore into the process of attracting business, and the zeal  with which Hainan Province is seeking foreign business  investment is evidenced by the province's implementation of the  "first approve the corporation, then on to the project" approach.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: New challenges for BES investors - Scheherazade Daneshkhu surveys the options as the deadline for abolition draws nearer THE BUSINESS expansion scheme is posing investors new challenges. Those spurred to put in money before the BES is abolished on December 31 have two main choices: a fixed price return or a variable rate linked to a rise in the FT-SE 100 index. The annual amount that can be invested in a BES by one person is Pounds 40,000 but a married couple can put in Pounds 80,000. The money can be spread among a number of schemes. Tax relief is given at the investor's marginal rate so long as the shares are held for five years; thus, a higher-rate taxpayer parts with only Pounds 24,000 for a Pounds 40,000 investment. There are a few trading company schemes around but the BES market is dominated by assured tenancies. Most of these fund student accommodation. To solve the problem of finding buyers for shares after five years, sponsors often get the institution for which the money is being raised to commit itself to buying them. What, though, if the institution does not have enough money for this? The buy-back promise is often reinforced through cash backing (setting aside a sum of money which will accrue with compound interest to reach the exit price after five years for all the shareholders) or a bank guarantee. 'Arranged exit' schemes now dominate the market. Of those still open, Nationwide Aegis offers an exit price of 117.5p for every 100p invested, which represents an annual return of 13.5 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer. Anglia Residences and Homemaker do even better, with 123p; this equates to an annual return of 14 per cent. (Investors should note that the annual returns depend on the sponsors sending out the BES 3 certificates, which enable investors to claim tax relief, in time for them to get their full rebate in that particular year. A delay will result in lower annual returns). The fixed returns on offer are historically high for the BES - but will they continue? Nick Percival, director of BESt Investment, believes not. 'We are seeing prices peak at the moment, but it cannot last because of the fall in interest rates. Those purchasing five-year money for the cash-backed schemes will not be able to offer such high returns from now on.' Percival says the supply of schemes is also greater than demand because of the requirement for BES companies to buy property with vacant possession. He expects demand to overtake supply after October when the universities will be out of the market (unless they are funding new buildings), but this is when the building societies may enter to off-load their repossessed properties. Of the arranged exit cash-backed schemes still open, David Harris - of Chantrey Financial Services, an independent adviser - recommends Close Brothers' BESSA Oxford Fixed Return and Accumulus King's (Cambridge), sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital. 'Both pay 120p after five years, equating to an annual return of 13.6 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer.' While both schemes are cash-backed fully, Harris warns: 'It would be a mistake for people to think there is no risk at all, although I believe these schemes to be very low risk.' The other option is the innovatory stock market-linked schemes, of which two are open: Close Brothers' BESSA Oxford and Matrix Securities Stock market BES. Since there is no capital gains tax to pay on the disposal of a BES company's shares, this is a way of investing in the stock market without facing a CGT bill. But this tax break exists already through a Pep, which gives investors greater flexibility since they are not constrained by a five-year timetable. The lump sum investment through the BES is higher than for a Pep, but this might not be a good thing given the present stock market high. In any case, the annual maximum for a Pep investment of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company version) builds up to a total investment of Pounds 45,000 over five years - with the further advantage of being staggered. Still, the wealthy investor who already has a Pep and a fully-funded pension, and believes the stock market will rise enough over five years to give a good return, can consider these schemes. Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge group, says: 'These deals are illiquid. In a market as volatile as equities, this is a serious drawback.' It prefers the Matrix Securities scheme which offers automatic 'lock-ins' at 60 per cent and 90 per cent of FT-SE growth to protect gains against the danger of a fall in the market near the end of the five-year period. Matrix also guarantees a fixed return of 75p compared with 60p for Close Brothers' BESSA Oxford. But, as Allenbridge notes, the cost of the guarantee reduces the potential return. The advantage of a BES Footsie-linked return, compared with a building society guaranteed equity bond, is the tax relief. Instead of costing the investor Pounds 1, it is costing him only 60p; hence the potential for higher returns. Investors, however, should take independent financial advice and remember that it is rarely a good idea to make an investment solely on the grounds of tax efficiency.</p>

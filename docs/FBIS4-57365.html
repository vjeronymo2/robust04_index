			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani said today that he does  not recognize the government installed in Haiti by a group of  legislators supported by the Army of that country. He said this  move is only a measure to ease international pressure applied  mainly by the United Nations and the OAS on the Republic of  Haiti, but these appointments do not reflect the people's will.    Yesterday, a group of legislators supported by the Army  swore  in a new president in Haiti, and according to international  reports, this is a measure to complete the toppling of  constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has been in  exile since 1991. The new president is Emile Jonassaint, 80, a  former magistrate of the Haitian Supreme Court, but  international news dispatches indicate that his government lacks  the support of the international community and of most Haitian  legislators.    During a news conference Cristiani also commented on the  progress in peace agreements compliance only days before he  concludes his term. He said that the only agreement that will  be left pending pertains to public security, because, as he has  stated before, the government thinks that it is necessary to  prolong the transition from the National Police [PN] to the  National Civilian Police (PNC) as a result of the increased  crime rate in the country. Cristiani had said that the  dismantling of the PN could last another six months until the  PNC gets enough members to fight crime.    We think that it would be a serious mistake to leave the  country with 5,700 agents and conclude the dissolution of the  PN," the president said. [no opening quotation marks as  published] He proposed that "the PN continue operating, and of  course, also reduce its size while the Public Security Academy  supplies the PNC with agents." Cristiani said that public  safety is still a priority, and thus, the next government will  continue to support efforts in this area and to support the  Public Security Academy, which is tasked with training the  agents of the new security corps.    As for the reports of kidnappings, the president reaffirmed  that the government is tackling this problem by deploying PNC  agents to Santa Ana. He added that these are not "groups of  organized kidnappers that we have seen in the past but criminal  groups that will not be difficult to bring to justice. We hope  to be able to neutralize this wave of extortions in Santa Ana in  the short run."    President Cristiani today inaugurated the Second  International Environmental Conference in San Salvador.</p>

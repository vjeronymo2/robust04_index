			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cash points - the next generation A NEW generation of machines, called TouchBank, has begun to appear in branches of Barclays Bank. They look like cash machines, but the one thing they cannot do is dish out money. Instead, by touching their colour screens, customers can obtain services including: ordering statements; printing an on-the-spot list of standing orders and direct debits; paying bills, or transferring money between a savings account and a current account. TouchBank can also be used to buy immediate travel insurance. The machine guides the customer through a series of questions and offers a printed quote. If the customer accepts, it then debits the money from his or her current account and sells the policy. It can also perform the same service for a mortgage, asking the customer whether he or she wants an repayment, endowment, or pension mortgage and other details about their age and income, finally coming up with a printed quote. At this point the person using the machine - who need not be a Barclays customer - will probably want to make contact with branch staff before taking the deal further. The quote can be used as a benchmark against which other mortgage offers are assessed. Quotations for home insurance can also be issued straight away and foreign currency and travellers' cheques can be ordered and paid for directly out of your account. To activate the machine, a Barclays' customer inserts his or her Connect card, types in their PIN number, and then touches the screen at appropriate points as images appear. The bank has installed the first nine experimental TouchBanks at branches including Cheapside and Victoria, London.</p>

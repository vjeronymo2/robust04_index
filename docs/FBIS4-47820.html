			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] With just over half the ballots counted in the South  African elections, one party which looks to have failed badly is  the Pan-Africanist Congress, the PAC. It is currently in sixth  place with just over 1 percent. It is unlikely to reach the 5  percent of the vote needed to secure an automatic cabinet post.  On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked the PAC's  chairman in the central Transvaal region, Moses Mavundla, if he  was disappointed with their result:    [Begin recording] [Mavundla] Yes, we are obviously shocked  at  the results. We did not expect them to be as they are. That's  why we have had reservations about the entire process when it's  being done without the direct involvement of the international  community.    [Ecott] But what do you feel specifically has been wrong  with  these elections from your point of view?    [Mavundla] Well, to start with the leveling of the playing  field. That was the major aspect. The monies were released  rather too late and by the time we received the monies we were  already disadvantaged, whereas if the monies had been released  much earlier I am sure our campaign machinery would have been  much more effective.    [Ecott] Your critics, of course, will say that the poor turn  out in the polls just proves that the PAC was always a very  marginal political force in South Africa.    [Mavundla] The question is if the regime had that belief  that  we were marginal, when we called them to meet PAC outside the  country in Zimbabwe and in Botswana, why did they to start with  bother to meet us? If they believed that we were that marginal,  surely they would not have bothered to waste time with PAC. But  we believe that we are not marginal. We represent a broad  spectrum of the people in the country.    [Ecott] But at the moment you are showing less support than  people like the Democratic Party and even the Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front] [name as heard].    [Mavundla] Well, you have got to understand that people had  to exercise their choice. Our supporters may have decided that  the important thing is to oust the regime and by supporting,  throwing some of their votes toward one of the liberation  movements, particularly a single liberation as it has won now --  ANC -- they may have believed that by so doing they would  enhance the oppressed masses in ousting the regime. The  important thing is that PAC is not out. PAC is still in and we  still believe that we still have a contribution to make toward  the final liberation of our people, in particular with regard to  the return of the land to the rightful owners.    [Ecott] Mr. Mandela has already indicated that parties which  have not done particularly well in the polls will probably still  get a chance of serve in the cabinet. Are you still prepared to  work with him?    [Mavundla] As soon as Mr. Mandela has met with our president  and that issue with regard to the concomitant terms or  conditions, those that would be discussed by PAC and a decision  will be taken whether or not to accept that.

Status and Listing History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The saltwater or estuarine crocodile ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crocodylus porosus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) ranges from southwest India and along its eastern coast, throughout Southeast Asia and through the Pacific Islands as far east as Fiji and south to the northern coast of Australia. The majority of populations have been reported from the following countries:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. It is the largest crocodilian species, reaching lengths well over 20 feet (6.1 meters). The species inhabits estuaries, mangrove swamps, and tidal reaches of rivers (The World Conservation Union (IUCN) 1975).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the 1979 meeting of the Parties to CITES, the saltwater crocodile was transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I, except for the population in Papua New Guinea which was retained on Appendix II. On December 16, 1979 (44 FR 75074), the Service listed all saltwater crocodile populations outside of Papua New Guinea as endangered. Both of these actions were taken because the species had suffered serious losses of habitat throughout most of its range and it had been subject to extensive poaching for its hide. At their 1985 meeting, the CITES Parties voted to transfer the Australian population from Appendix I to Appendix II of CITES pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 (ranching) and to transfer the Indonesian population from Appendix I to Appendix II pursuant to resolution Conf. 5.21, making Indonesia subject to export quotas approved by the Parties. Under current Australian law, the effect of this action was to allow trade in captive-bred specimens and specimens taken from approved crocodile farm operations based on controlled collecting of eggs or hatchlings or nuisance animals from the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June 1990, the Service received a petition from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) requesting the reclassification of the captive (i.e., captive-bred and ranched) populations of saltwater crocodile in Australia from endangered to threatened. The petition contained information on the management of wild and captive populations, population surveys, and legal status. The Service had previously reviewed almost the same information, which was considered substantial, and the Service was in the process of preparing a proposed rule based on the earlier information when the petition was received. On September 27, 1990, the Service, acting on this assessment but without issuing a formal finding, published a proposed rule (55 FR 39489) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater crocodile to threatened status. The proposed rule included a special rule which allowed for the commercial import of parts and products of ranched saltwater crocodiles from Australia directly into the United States, or through a third party if that receiving country was a CITES member that filed annual CITES trade reports and any re-exporting country was also a CITES member. In the absence of a required universal tagging system for crocodilian skins, however, trade controls were considered insufficient to justify uncontrolled trade through third parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication of the final rule was delayed beyond the 12 months normally allowed because of concerns about allowing trade in products of one crocodilian species without adequate control of trade in other crocodilians and pending acceptance of universal tagging procedures for crocodilian skins in international trade. Resolution Conf. 8.14 adopted at the 1992 Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, established a new marking system that will provide for strict regulation of trade in all crocodilian skins. The new marking program should be in place as of January 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of Comments on the Earlier Proposed Rule on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saltwater Crocodile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of September 27, 1990, (55 FR 39489) the Service announced that available information indicated that both wild and captive populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia should be reclassified from endangered to threatened, and issued a proposed rule to that effect. In that proposal, all interested parties were requested to submit comments and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine comments were received: two from ANPWS; one from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Division of Wildlife and Ecology; three from the trade industry; and one each from the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group for Eastern Asia, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia, and TRAFFIC-USA. All supported the proposed reclassification, but some had objections to the proposed special rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPWS fully supported the reclassification of the Australian population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crocodylus porosus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Dr. Graeme Caughley, Chief Research Scientist of CSIRO, stated that he saw no reason that ESA and CITES should necessarily coincide, but in the case of the Australian saltwater crocodile, he favored the controls on trade that were established under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Grahame Webb, Vice Chairman for Eastern Asia_Crocodile Specialist Group, supported the proposed changes. He reported that crocodile populations within Australia are particularly well-managed and that all skins exported are tagged and clearly identified as having come from Australia. Several crocodile farmers and traders (Crocodile Farmers Association of Australia, G. Webb Pty. Ltd., and Mainland Holding Pty. Ltd.) all supported the reclassification of the saltwater crocodile in Australia to threatened status. They stated that the detailed survey work confirming the expansion of populations and monitoring of habitat justifies this action. The recovery of the population in Australia since protection and the present management of and research on the species was said to warrant the proposed change in regulation by the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

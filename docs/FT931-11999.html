			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Pounds 100m relocation approved for MoD purchasing unit ONE of the biggest job relocations in the UK has been approved by the Ministry of Defence which is building to the north of Bristol a new headquarters for its military equipment purchasing arm. The Defence Procurement Executive is responsible for spending more than Pounds 9bn a year for the three armed services and operates from 'dozens of offices' in southern England. The ministry said it will be more efficient to house the operations in a single development. The new headquarters will house 5,500 staff, of whom about 1,000 are expected to be recruited locally. The headquarters of 10 buildings is expected to cost more than Pounds 100m to build. Mr Jonathan Aiken, minister for defence procurement, said: 'This ambitious project will provide not only a considerable stimulus to the local economy but also for the hard pressed construction industry which will be competing for the work.' The Bristol region, which has strong aerospace industry links, has seen unemployment rise sharply as demand from civil aviation and defence industries has fallen. Unemployment in the region was close to 10 per cent at the end of last year. Mr Richard Workman, development control officer for Northavon District Council, where the new headquarters will be situated, said: 'The two largest employers in the area are British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce. We are delighted to have been given this opportunity to create new jobs to replace those which have been lost.' A further 1,500 jobs are likely to be created during construction, which is expected to start this spring and be completed by autumn 1995.</p>

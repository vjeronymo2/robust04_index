			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Boycott was no big deal, says UK industry  -Relief among exporters as normal trade resumes The seven-month boycott by the Malaysian government on British goods and services does not appear to have lost the UK large amounts of business with the exception of big construction contracts on the new Pounds 3bn (Dollars 4.6bn) Kuala Lumpur international airport. Many companies have continued to negotiate for work, in the hope that the ban would be lifted. These yesterday welcomed the Malaysian government's decison. The Confederation of British Industry said: 'Some companies will have lost business as a result of the ban, but the immediate effect has not been profound.' The CBI said UK exports to Malaysia for the first six months of 1994 had amounted to Pounds 667m, an increase on the same period in 1993 of Pounds 364m. Imports from Malaysia for the same period declined from Pounds 774m to Pounds 582m. A long running ban, however, would have threatened large scale construction and development projects. Lord Prior, chairman of General Electric Company said: 'Billions of pounds of British orders and contracts had been in jeopardy until now. . . It is good that we have a level playing field again.' Malaysia is an important market for the group which was part of the consortium which drew up development plans for the new airport. Lord Prior said GEC had not lost work as contracts it had been bidding for had still to be awarded. Other companies have not been so fortunate. A joint venture between British engineering groups, Trafalgar House and BICC, had been expected to win the construction management contract for the airport. The contract is understood to have been awarded to KLIB, a Malaysian state body with which Trafalgar and BICC had been negotiating. Tender lists for the Pounds 300m airport terminals also have closed without any British companies being allowed to bid. Japanese, German and Korean groups are thought to be among the 20 contractors seeking the work. BICC and Trafalgar said yesterday they were considering tendering for other large contracts at the airport which had still to be awarded. Both companies have continued to carry out a Pounds 70m earthworks contract won just before the ban. The length of time it takes to negotiate and place contracts for big projects such as roads, power stations and water treatment plants has meant that UK companies will have missed few opportunities during the short-lived ban. Rolls-Royce's Parsons Power Generation Systems had submitted a bid to supply turbine generators for the Port Klang power station before the ban. Rolls-Royce said yesterday that it had kept in contact with the customer, the Malaysia state electric utility and hoped negotiations would resume. It also hopes that a joint venture with EPE Power of Malaysia to meet the growing demand for power transmission equipment in Malaysia could also be resumed. The ban did not include private sector contracts, but it had been feared that non-state owned Malaysian companies would follow the government's lead. Mr Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export said there was no evidence that this had happened. Major projects which had already started or had just been negotiated with British companies also have been unaffected. The largest of these is a management construction contract with Bovis for a Pounds 1.2bn Kuala Lumpur city centre development involving the construction of twin towers of almost 1,500ft which would become the world's tallest buildings. At one stage Bovis had feared that it might be replaced. A project management contract with John Laing construction group for building and civil engineering for two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir Gudang and Paka also was signed just before the boycott was imposed. This too has been unaffected. John Laing has just finished a Pounds 25m contract at Sibu airport in Sarawak and is due to complete a Pounds 150m contract for 12 hospitals next year. Taylor Woodrow which has previously managed the construction of sections of the country's strategic north-south highway is involved in the construction of the Pounds 300m first phase of a privately financed light rail system linking Kuala Lumpur with surrounding areas. Taylor Woodrow owns 15 per cent of the equity with its partner AEG Westinghouse of Germany holding a similar stake. Taylor Woodrow through its majority-owned Malay subsidiary is understood to have maintained contact with the Malay authorities and hopes to win further work when the extension to the railway is built. Trafalgar House and BICC also have continued to work on contracts awarded before the boycott including the controversial Pounds 400m Pergau Dam which is due for completion in 1997. Trafalgar House is building a steel fabrication plant in a joint venture with Edaran Otomobil Nasional which is due to open next year. Costain, another British contractor, said it had been pursuing work worth about Pounds 1bn, including the airport terminal contract at Kuala Lumpur, when the ban was imposed. It added: 'We will now be looking to see how much of this work is still available. We are very hopeful.' The UK Export Group for the Constructional Industries said yesterday it was delighted by the lifting of the ban. 'We hope that the short-lived nature of the ban means that little harm will have been done to British interests.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received 42 timely items of correspondence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to the December 31, 1990 interim final rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were from professional organizations, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments, hospitals, consumer organizations, suppliers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography equipment, and individual practitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of these 42 items, 30 of them dealt exclusively with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quality standards described in 42 CFR part 494,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart B, and only 12 of them offered any comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other provisions of the interim regulations relating to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment, coverage frequency, and other provisions. Since we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are deleting the quality standards in subpart B and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacing them with a cross-reference to the applicable FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, as discussed in section IV. of this preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is no longer necessary to respond in this rule to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments that were received on those standards. The other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and our responses to those comments, however, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Payment Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the professional and technical components for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammogram should be the same as for a diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammogram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the interim final rule (55 FR 53512), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used the same allocation between the two components of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammogram that we had in place under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiologist fee schedule for diagnostic mammograms because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it was the best information we had available at the time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the lack of a persuasive argument that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be different allocations for the two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammograms. In this final rule, we are changing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportionment between the professional component and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical component, effective for services furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning January 1, 1995, to reflect the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the relative value units established for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians' services for the year in question. We will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the percentages for the professional component and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the technical component in this final rule because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specificity requires a time-consuming rulemaking process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when we modify the apportionment. We will announce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportionment of the payment limits between the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components for 1995, and each year thereafter, at the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time as we announce the statutory payment limit in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for that year. At this time, we anticipate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportionment of the payment limit in 1995 will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32 percent professional component and 68 percent technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter objected to the discussion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble of the interim final rule (55 FR 53513) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty rural hospitals have in furnishing the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of a screening mammogram within the payment limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the rural hospitals may have a low volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The commenter believed that, if a hospital and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiologist entered into an agreement stating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiologist would accept a lower amount for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation than Medicare would pay the radiologist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly for the interpretation, the agreement would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a ``kickback'' of a portion of the radiologist's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee to the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

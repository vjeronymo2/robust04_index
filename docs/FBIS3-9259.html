Since the two  world wars started in Europe, and the Cold War between NATO and  the Warsaw Pact was most palpable in Europe, in 1973 the CSCE  was founded in Helsinki to prevent possible cataclysms. Ever  since, the CSCE member-countries (the European countries, the  United States, and Canada) have been working systematically to  strengthen mutual trust by solving problems in three domains  (security, economics, and humanitarian aid). Without  diminishing the importance of the last two, security is still  the most important, because it clearly puts member-countries  under an obligation to observe the established principles with  regard to international affairs, particularly in terms of  supplying information and making it possible to view the  condition and activities of their armed forces. Intense  negotiations on disarmament were crowned by the Vienna Document  in 1990, by which Soviet military dominance (and power) in  Europe was eliminated. Before that, at the CSCE meeting in  Paris (from 19 to 21 March 1990) the Charter for a New Europe  was adopted, which announces the cessation of the Cold War and  presents the conceptual arrangement of future relations in  Europe. The violent disintegration of former Yugoslavia and a  war whose end is still not in sight best show to what extent the  CSCE member-countries have stuck to the Charter (it does not  anticipate the possibility of war breaking out).    The dynamics and character of the political and military  processes in Europe in the course of 1990 created the illusion  that finally a time of peace and well-being had come about.  However, some significant facts were overlooked, which warned  of the evidently misjudged situation. The facts are: Nobody  mentioned that NATO should be dissolved, although there was no  more need for its existence; NATO was rejoicing over victory  against its main opponent, that is, the Warsaw Pact, and  ignoring the warning of a USSR official that something horrible  would come about with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact -- NATO  would remain without an enemy; the Warsaw Pact member-countries  naively believed that they would be swamped with the capital of  the rich West; German unification was underestimated, while some  vital goals and interests of Russia were disregarded.    Therefore, inexplicably, the role of the CSCE since 1990 has  been pushed into the background. There is a good chance that  NATO might take up the role of the CSCE, because the steps that  are being taken these days point to that possibility quite  clearly. Of course, that possibility has primarily to do with  the expansion of NATO, which is the plan that NATO is trying to  camouflage with the "Partnership for Peace" project. Many facts  indicate that it will be a cause of more discord in Europe  rather than peace.    The essence is in the following: NATO was formed to keep the  Russians out of, the Americans in, and the Germans subdued in  Europe. The first task has been accomplished, but the second  and the third are still facing many difficulties, the cause of  which is to be found in the smoldering rivalry between the  former boss, NATO (or rather the United States), and the new  rival, Germany. These two, guided by the knowledge that the  open rivalry between them at an inconvenient moment might have a  negative effect on NATO's cohesion, have opted for a detour,  which is to say, they are trying to preserve the Alliance (the  United States), and to ascend to a dominant position (Germany)  at the expense of the Eastern European countries, and in such a  way to postpone the moment of direct confrontation.  Consequently, under the pretext that NATO wants to help its  former enemies, the United States and Germany have started a  massive humanitarian mission in the East, of course only to  accomplish their own goals and interests. Even this covert  conflict may have a certain negative impact on NATO's cohesion.  However, there is no doubt that the Eastern European peoples  will be the ones who will eventually suffer and pay the highest  price.    And what has actually happened? Just as in the past, the  aggressive Germans have shown their proneness to hasty actions.  By putting pressure on the European Community and the United  States to recognize unconditionally the forceful secession of  Slovenia, Croatia, and thereafter the former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Germany scored the first points among the allies. Of course,  with that Germany only announced its global aspirations. They  became evident in 1993, when Germany signed agreements on  military cooperation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and the former Soviet Baltic republics.    The fact that German military circles make decisions on all  the important questions regarding the system of defense and the  armed forces of the Czech Republic is a reliable indicator of  what kind of agreements that it is all about (partnership should  mean reciprocity). Such colonial-like successes of Germany in  the East have caused skepticism on the part of the United  States, while patriotic forces in Russia have felt that as a  direct offense.    A reaction ensued in a flash. The United States decided to  legalize their colonial interests in some former socialist  countries by launching the Partnership for Peace project, in  which all the NATO member-countries are supposed to take part,  and to act as a monolith, while it is well known that in Albania  it is solely the U.S. advisers who have been placed at all  levels of the Albanian state administration, and that important  political decisions must not be made without their approval.    It is naive to think, let alone believe, that the United  States and Germany can accept former socialist countries as  equal partners in decision-making, be it with regard to military  issues, or any other issues. The attitude that the partners  will have a right to consult with NATO on whether there is a  direct or indirect danger to their security shows more than  clearly that the Partnership has nothing to do with partnership,  but rather with the typical U.S. patronage toward former  enemies. Moreover, how NATO assesses whether the security of  their partners is endangered, and to what extent, can be seen in  the following: The fact that every fourth Russian voter voted  for Zhirinovsky, while every seventh voted for the Communist  Party, is reportedly a very great danger that threatens Russia.  However, despite this and other alarming facts, the former  Warsaw Pact member-countries (in the so-called neuralgic zone)  are still naively hoping that the NATO countries (the zone of  prosperity) will accept them as equal partners and make fair  plans for their future.    The implementation of this project, which was started  without  a clear vision of what the future European defense system should  be like, will probably exact a very high price. Who will pay  that price is hard to say at this moment. However, the  determination of the main rivals within NATO to involve the  former enemies in their struggle for power and dominance within  the Alliance is already giving hints to whom the bill will be  delivered. Therefore it is wrong to expect that such a process  will have a positive impact on European security. It is more  probable that Europe will be thrown back to the time when it was  the arena in which world wars were triggered. Is not the NATO  ultimatum to the Serbian republic a good enough argument for  that?</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Time for audits 'not long enough' JUNIOR STAFF in accountancy firms believe that the time allowed for their work for audit clients is not sufficient, the British Accounting Association annual conference was told yesterday. The findings, based on an initial analysis of 36 accountants at all levels of seniority in response to a fictitious auditing case study, are contained in a study by Mr John Dunn and Ms Anne Fergusson of the University of Strathclyde. Mr Dunn suggested that this might show the perceived level of low tendering by accountants did not lead to short cuts in auditing but to greater pressure on staff to maintain standards. But more senior managers and partners believe that the time allocated through budgets was sufficient. Mr Dunn stressed that he had found no evidence that time pressures on staff reduced the quality of the audit. None of the respondents spent more than 8 hours a week on a client beyond the amount of time allocated. Most coped with the extra workload by coming in early or working through their lunch hour. Partners in Irish accountancy firms back efforts to limit the threat of litigation against them, the conference heard yesterday. A survey by Mr Peter Green and Ms Jacqueline Granleese of the University of Ulster found that accountants also recognised that any attempt to limit their exposure would be seen as not providing the best protection for investors using audited accounts.</p>

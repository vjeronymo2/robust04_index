			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Hannibal-style habits / Consider the evidence of human sacrifice IS HUMAN sacrifice a nasty habit or is it deeply rooted in tradition? The truth is: a bit of both, and archaeology keeps finding new and startling evidence of the practice where we least expect it. Recently I saw the latest find, among the foundations of a new hotel at Amathus, near Limassol in Cyprus. The Phoenicians of Lebanon probably introduced the practice: they had a long history of human sacrifice, and were a power in Cyprus. But other stories come to mind, from Greece, from Abraham and Isaac, and that of the Lindow Man, a well-manicured, upper-class 25-year old who was hit on the head, garroted and had his throat cut before he was placed in a marsh in Cheshire as an offering to the Celtic water god. The custom of offering young humans to a god as gifts is old and universal, but not frequent. It was best to give one's own child, preferably a first-born male; if he was not available, a daughter would do, or prisoners of war. In Greek stories the habit is not common. It was seen as something reprehensible that created blood pollution, but at times could not be avoided. The tragedians made good use of it. When the gods deny the Greeks a fair wind to sail to Troy, Agamemnon, their leader, has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigeneia. His wife Clytemnestra is furious and has 10 years at home during the siege of Troy in which to nurture her bitterness. When Agamemnon comes home she hurls snide fury at him, encourages him into a hot bath and stabs him. The next step is for their son Orestes to kill his mother, for which he is condemned to wander in exile, until he reaches the Crimea where he is reunited with his sister Iphigeneia, and the pollution ends. It is difficult to find examples of human sacrifice from the 5th century BC when the tragedians were writing about it. But 800 to 1,000 years earlier, in the Bronze Age, it was certainly happening. Children were buried under thresholds, presumably as an offering of first fruits for the prosperity of house and home. At Knossos in Crete childrens' bones were found a few years ago with butchery cuts as on animal bones. They are probably the left-overs of cannibalism, perhaps a ritual to avert a disaster. The leading sacrificers of the ancient world were the Phoenicians, who traded throughout the Mediterranean and founded colonies in Sicily, Sardinia and North Africa. At their settlement at Carthage in Tunisia - Rome's great enemy - you can see the place of sacrifice, called a tophet, by the harbour. Here thousands of vases were found, all of the same type, containing burnt childrens' bones and animal or bird bones. Stones mark the sacrifices. The victims were placed in the hands of a bronze statue, wrote Diodorus Siculus, and then dropped into the flames. Relations were forbidden to weep, perhaps because tears diminished the sacrifice or perhaps rather that they were inappropriate when it led to a desirable end: the children's deification. The young blood rejuvenated the god and bound him to the person who had offered it. But in 310 BC, after Agathocles of Syracuse defeated them, the Carthaginians thought they had offended the gods by replacing nobles' children as victims with children of low birth. When to make amends they decided to offer 200 of the best, so many noble parents volunteered their young that they had 300 to choose from. They also sacrificed prisoners of war, 3,000 of them after they captured Himera in Sicily in 409, and continued these gruesome habits for centuries, until the Romans defeated them and stopped the bloody business. The newly-discovered tophet in Cyprus is on the Phoenicians' route to their western settlements. Now cleared by archaeologists, it looked like a disused rabbit warren when I saw it last month. Like Carthage, it is by the sea. A slope runs up from the beach and vanishes beneath the concrete of what will soon be bedrooms in the Four Seasons Hotel. Five hundred pots were found, as at other tophets all of the same shape. Originally there would have been many more. Children, animals and birds burnt in tophets give poignancy to the story of Abraham and Isaac. When they reach the high place on the mountain, Isaac, carrying the wood for his own pyre, asks: 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?'. And at the last moment when Abraham has the knife in his hand, God stops him. He may substitute a ram, a male sheep, caught in a nearby thicket. The tale leads straight to the theology of the sacrifice of Jesus, God's only son and also the lamb of God. If you have booked into the hotel at Amathus and have a room on the beach, sweet dreams, and sleep well.</p>

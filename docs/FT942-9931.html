			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / MPs of all sides unite in grief The Commons is not without its moments of drama. The disgrace, dramatic resignation or death of a parliamentarian can bring a dignified hush to a highly partisan chamber. However, by common consent yesterday's mood, after the death of John Smith, was of an altogether different intensity. MPs with more than 20 years of service could not remember an event which had left members on all sides of the House so despondent. Some Labour members could hardly bring themselves to speak above a whisper; others were unable to say anything. Political differences were brushed aside. Instead of the usual cabals forming along political lines, the corridors and lobbies of Westminster were cluttered with groups of MPs of all political persuasions. 'It may sound glib or even a cliche to say this,' said one Tory backbencher, 'but I have never seen the House so united in its grief.' Ministers who spotted their Labour shadows were quick to offer sympathy; many Tories sought out their Labour pairs - MPs with whom they have agreed to co-ordinate their Commons appearances for votes - to express sadness. Although MPs on both sides were willing to talk of the implications for respective parties, most did so by peppering their remarks with nostalgic memories of Mr Smith. He may have had something of a reputation for not suffering fools gladly, but few MPs could claim to have made so many friends across the political divide. Every member had their own favourite story which they wanted to tell. Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North and a member of Labour's national executive committee, appeared to sum up the mood of many when he said he could think of nothing but Mr Smith. 'He recently came to St Helens to a fundraising event and the public were literally lining up for his autograph,' he said. Another senior Labour MP, who served in the last Labour government, said he had not seen such melancholy in the House since the death of Hugh Gaitskell in 1963. But those MPs who could remember the mood after the death of that Labour leader said the big difference was that the whole Labour movement mourned Mr Smith. 'Hugh was loved by the right and never forgiven by the left,' one said. Yesterday there were plenty of leftwingers, such as Mr Dennis Skinner, who appeared genuinely moved.</p>

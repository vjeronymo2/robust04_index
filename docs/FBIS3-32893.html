Mendiandua: "Territorial </F> Self-Sufficiency"]    [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Self-sufficiency in  animal protein and increases in agricultural production in the  municipalities are other alternatives that Cubans are testing to  increase their consumption and improve the quality of the food  supply.    The project's goal is to foster a broad self-sufficiency  program in agricultural products in each administrative  political unit. The programs will be under the supervision of  the people's councils, the power organizations in each territory.    In the short term the goal is to achieve 24 grams of animal  protein for each inhabitant as a complement to the nation's  production system. This is in addition to developing agrarian  exploitation in marginal areas, according to what Humberto  Muniz, agriculture and fishing director of the Academy of  Science, explained to PRENSA LATINA during an interview.    This level of protein, superior to those currently existing  in most Latin American nations, should be obtained by mixing the  natural resources available at each site. This is particularly  true of those that serve as the basis for animal feed, added  Muniz, identified as one of the program's organizers.    The search for territorial self-sufficiency arose as a  strategic need of the nation in the event the island were  militarily blocked during a war and the possibility of receiving  supplies from abroad decreased to zero.    Given the sudden crumbling of the European socialist bloc,  with which 85 percent of economic trade was carried out, Cubans  were left without supplies of fertilizers, pesticides, and feed  that originated from that area. This produced serious setbacks  in local production and foreign trade.    Faced with this situation, the nation had to step up efforts  and initiatives aimed at replacing foreign supplies and  reactivate its production. This was particularly true of  agricultural production as a source of food and industrial raw  materials.    Territorial self-sufficiency, adapted to the current special  period in peacetime, is an alternative to the nation's  production system, and its results will directly benefit the  people in the region where it is applied.    The project is based on the state-of-the-art use of the  natural resources in each area of the nation and the use of idle  areas. In the economic aspect it is based on applying incentives  for work productivity, the agriculture engineer indicated.    There are places where self-sufficiency in milk is being  achieved with the construction of small dairy farms  (microvaquerias), while pisciculture is encouraged through the  delicate reproduction of tilapia [African fresh water fish],  "tecnas," or other river, lake, or dam species by making use of  industrial residues.    This last alternative serves the productive goals and  removes contamination from the environment. This benefits the  area and strengthens the incentive system on which the project's  success is based.    Each region draws up its own strategy in keeping with its  possibilities, production potential, or eating traditions and  only receives technical assistance from the state's central  levels.    The project leaves room for individual or collective  initiatives and for creativity in searching for ways to meet the  food supply demand within the municipalities, allowing savings  in transportation, fuel, and material resources in general.    This encompassing movement proposes to stimulate and include  the self-sufficiency systems that exist in the schools, state  enterprises, and with small producers. The goal is to make  rational use of the natural resources available on a regional  level.    To achieve this perfection, research is conducted on the  current variables such as raising pigs outdoors, porcine  enclosures, collective pig raising farms, raising chickens in  backyards, and raising fish in ponds.    There is also work on the use of agricultural waste, food  recycling, and using all sources of food available, together  with a broad dissemination program.    Seed production and animal breeding are also part of the  program in each region as a basic element to guarantee the whole  system. Likewise, there is hard work to eliminate the  traditional dependency on fuel by using animal transportation,  renewable power, and non-conventional sources.    With regard to organization, the method consists of  achieving  an adequate balance between what is produced and what is for  direct or social consumption by the people, thereby stimulating  efforts made by each region in keeping with the increase in  their levels of production.    Although the whole project is based on craftsmanship methods  of production, many initiatives are encouraging incorporation in  the scientific and technical fields to seek efficiency and  better economic results, according to its organizers.    Currently, while the project's implementation progresses,  the  most diverse technical systems and the most adequate  distribution methods are being studied, and the exchange of  information among territories is encouraged.    Some of the most commonly asked questions are: How do we  make  popular and develop community farming? How do we get the maximum  use out of various animal species? What organizational structure  should be given to the self consumption activity in each  municipal or people's council.</p>

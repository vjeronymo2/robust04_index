			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY BIDS WARSAW PACT FAREWELL;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE: THE AGREEMENT COMES JUST NINE DAYS BEFORE REUNIFICATION. IN  BONN, THE UNITY TREATY IS SIGNED.  </P> <P> East Germany, discarding two of the Communists' most cherished symbols just  nine days before reunification, left the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on Monday and  bade farewell to foreign ambassadors.  </P> <P> Disarmament and Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann, a pacifist pastor, signed  the historic agreement to quit the pact with the alliance's supreme commander,  Soviet Gen. Pyotr Lushev.  </P> <P> "I wish you all the best for the future," a grim-faced Lushev told Eppelmann at  the ceremony, which in five minutes ended 35 years of active military  cooperation.  </P> <P> The East German news agency ADN said the signing ceremony's "mood was like that  at a funeral" and described the atmosphere as "realistic and chilly."  </P> <P> Acting head of state Sabine Bergmann-Pohl officially said farewell to all  ambassadors accredited to East Germany at a separate reception at her  headquarters on Marx-Engels Square.  </P> <P> In Bonn, meanwhile, with the stroke of a pen Monday, the unification process  became official.  </P> <P> In a private ceremony witnessed only by press photographers, West German  President Richard von Weizsaecker signed the 1,000-page unity treaty that  details the legal and social unification of the two Germanys that will take  effect Oct. 3.  </P> <P> On leaving the Warsaw Pact, East Germany will hand over sensitive equipment,  withdraw from the command structure and stop paying funds to the alliance.  </P> <P> It became the first country to pull out of the seven-nation pact since the  peaceful revolutions that swept Eastern Europe last year.  </P> <P> Formed in May, 1955, the Warsaw Pact squared off against NATO forces in the  West during the tense years of the Cold War.  </P> <P> East Germany's National People's Army was regarded as the most efficient  fighting force in the pact, but next week its 50,000 troops will be absorbed  into a unified German army.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Soviet Union's 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany will  be sent home only gradually in a phased operation ending in 1994.  </P> <P> This means Warsaw Pact forces will remain in part of Germany, even though the  country as a whole will belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> At the reception for more than 100 ambassadors and charges d'affaires  accredited to East Berlin, Bergmann-Pohl thanked them for their understanding  of the dramatic events that put them out of jobs.  </P> <P> The ambassadors will leave by Oct. 2, the day before the two Germanys formally  unite, and their missions will become consulates or branches of their  countries' Bonn embassies.  </P></p>

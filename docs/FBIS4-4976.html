			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A visiting  British minister expressed the hope that it will not be long  before the first step is taken towards normalising  Anglo-Malaysian relations.    Secretary of State for Education John Patten said effort  needed to be made to put mutual relations back into the warm  waters.    Malaysia barred British companies from bidding for public  sector contracts in February following publication of  unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Malaysian  leaders in the British media.    Speaking to reporters at the British Council here a few  hours  after his arrival yesterday, Patten said he was disappointed by  the effect of reports in the British press on the relationship  between the two countries.    As Douglas Hurd (British Foreign Secretary) said in the  House  of Commons last Wednesday, we should not allow the press to come  between us, he said.    He said both Hurd and Trade Secretary Richard Needham had  made it clear that Britain wished to see a resumption of normal  relations as soon as possible.    Patten added Britain would continue to work vigorously to  bring about a situation in which the Malaysian Government felt  able to lift its ban on public sector contracts for British  companies.    Certainly the British press had been pretty quiet on this  issue over the last two or three weeks, he said.    Asked about Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's stand on  the matter, he said the Malaysian leader had always been a very  powerful advocate of Malaysia's case internationally.    He said Dr. Mahathir had made his views known especially in  a  very striking letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of London a few  weeks ago.</p>

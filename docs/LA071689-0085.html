			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A SPOUSAL TRAGEDY  </P> <P> The recent commentary ("Judge Mirrors Spousal-Abuse Myths," July 9) by Joyce  Faidley unfairly criticizes Judge Bernard E. Revak for comments he made during  the sentencing of Cmdr. Larry J. Evans for spousal rape. Faidley's passion for  the plight of battered women causes her to ignore facts that fully support the  comments made by Revak.  </P> <P> An orchestrated effort was made by battered-women groups like Faidley's to  intimidate Revak to make an example of Evans. The public pressure began with  television appearances by Mary Evans three days before Cmdr. Evans' sentencing  and was culminated by a courtroom filled with Mary Evans' supporters and a  petition signed by battered women (most of whom knew little about the details  of Cmdr. Evans' case) urging Revak to impose the maximum sentence.  </P> <P> Revak deserves credit for resisting this lynch-mob mentality and doing his job,  which is to impose sentence based on individual merits. Revak properly  considered that Larry Evans overcame poverty and segregated schools in the Deep  South to earn a scholarship to Harvard Dental School, the privilege to practice  dentistry and a distinguished 17-year military career.  </P> <P> Faidley fails to acknowledge that Mary Evans psychologically abused her husband  by carrying on an open affair with another man during the marriage. The stress  and anxiety resulting from Mary Evans' infidelity caused Cmdr. Evans to be  hospitalized with hypertension a few weeks before the sexual assault. Mary  Evans exacerbated this volatile situation by inviting Cmdr. Evans back into the  family residence, resuming a sexual relationship with him while continuing her  affair.  </P> <P> While Cmdr. Evans' violent reaction was deplorable, California directs Revak to  consider these unusual circumstances. They also support his comments that Mary  Evans bore some responsibility for the tragedy.  </P> <P> Faidley criticizes Revak for lamenting that state law required him to send a  man of Cmdr. Evans' caliber to state prison. Perhaps Revak understands that the  state prison population is bursting at the seams (approximately 82,000 inmates  in a system designed for 37,000). Incarcerating Cmdr. Evans will cost the  taxpayers of the state $19,000 per year.  </P> <P> Revak commented that it would be far more appropriate to require Evans to use  his skill as a dentist and perform community service for battered women or poor  people, rather than languishing in prison. Interestingly enough, this  alternative was proposed by a respected female forensic psychologist who  frequently evaluates offenders for state judges.  </P> <P> Faidley's commentary fails to mention that Revak protected Mary Evans during  the trial. He limited the defense's cross-examination of her, which sought to  elicit details of her sexual relationship with her boyfriend.  </P> <P> Over defense objection, Revak permitted Mary Evans to testify about prior acts  of spousal abuse committed by Cmdr. Evans, even though they were totally  unsubstantiated. These rulings contributed to the conviction of Evans.  </P> <P> Faidley criticizes Revak for imposing only an 11-year term. The judge could  have imposed as little as three years. Faidley cannot seriously argue that a  potential spousal rapist would not be deterred by 11 years in prison.  </P> <P> It is ironic that Faidley attacks Revak for being insensitive to victims of  domestic violence. As a prosecutor, Revak represented the interests of hundreds  of victims of violent crimes. He knows the physical and emotional trauma  suffered by them.  </P> <P> Finally, the motives of Faidley and the battered-women groups must be  questioned. Three months before Cmdr. Evans' trial, Mary Evans said she did not  want to see her husband go to prison and lose his military and dental careers.  Months later, Mary Evans was before the television cameras, with the  battered-women groups urging her on, demanding that her husband be sentenced to  prison.  </P> <P> But, once the camera lights dim, what about the future of Mary Evans and the  Evans' three children? Will Cmdr. Evansd' serving 11 years in prison solve the  complex problem of spousal rape? Are the three children better off with their  father in prison and unable to support them? Faidley seems to think so. Perhaps  Mary Evans will realize one day that Revak understands the tragedy of family  violence far better than Faidley and her battered-women groups do.  </P> <P> CRAIG E.

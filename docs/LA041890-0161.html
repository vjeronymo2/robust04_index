			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BILLS' JIM KELLY BEATS BACK SUIT  </P> <P> Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly today beat back a lawsuit filed by a woman  who claimed she suffered tooth damage when Kelly threw beer-filled balloons at  her during a picnic.  </P> <P> Marlene Edbauer's claim that she needed root-canal work after being hit in the  face with a balloon boiled down to a credibility contest between her and Kelly,  and she lost, Buffalo City Court Judge Michael L. Broderick said.  </P> <P> "A review of the evidence leaves unreconciled gaps and conflicts in plaintiff's  proof," Broderick said. "The proof itself was replete with conflicts,  contradictions, exaggerations, distortions and confusion."  </P> <P> Edbauer had been seeking $250,000 from Kelly, who signed a $20 million contract  recently that made him the NFL's highest-paid player. After testimony concluded  last week, she reduced her claim to $25,000.  </P> <P> Kelly was not present for the verdict.  </P> <P> Edbauer, 40, of Clarence, said she was hit in the face with a balloon during an  Aug. 16, 1987, picnic sponsored by a now-defunct Williamsville bar. The blow  caused a plastic cup to shatter against her face, damaging her front tooth so  that it subsequently needed a root canal, she said.  </P></p>

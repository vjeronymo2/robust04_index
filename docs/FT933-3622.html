			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Management: Governance goes global - The spread of shareholder activism In the annals of business history, 1993 may go down as the year that shareholder activism went global. Over the past few months, at annual meetings around the globe, boards of directors have found themselves facing shareholders who take an active interest in the performance and management of the business - and are willing to cast votes against executive resolutions with which they disagree. This so-called 'corporate governance' movement began in the US about a decade ago and has also become well established in the UK. But it has only begun to put down strong roots in continental Europe and Japan in the past couple of years. A significant landmark came last December at the annual meeting of the German energy conglomerate RWE, when a German shareholder association's resolution for a one-share, one-vote ballot system was strongly supported by the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the most forceful leaders of the US corporate governance movement. A new report from the Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent group which advises large investors on corporate governance issues, says the RWE case is a prime example of an important emerging trend in shareholder voting patterns. Indigenous shareholder groups are growing up in many countries - ranging from relatively new ones in Australia and Japan to more established European groups - and these are being supported in 'proxy' (shareholder voting) matters by increasingly active (and largely US-based) global institutions. 'These groups are beginning to find common ground on a wide range of corporate governance issues, and their efforts have brought these issues to the top of many an agenda,' says ISS. The report is an example of the increasing sophistication of international shareholder voting. It is the first of a regular quarterly series in which ISS will review proxy voting trends around the globe, country by country. This report covers the April to June quarter - the peak season for annual meetings around the globe - and says the most spectacular international corporate governance event was probably the successful fight by investors in the UK and US to prevent Britain's Hanson group restricting shareholders' ability to nominate directors and amend corporate resolutions. Other examples of international action during the period include: protests by the pension fund for local employees of Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment company about dividend policies at the shareholder meeting of Nestle, the Swiss foods group; and the defeat of a proposal giving the board blanket authorisation to issue capital at the Dutch chemicals group Akzo. The survey notes that a significant factor in the rise of the global movement has been the greater efficiency of global custodian banks, whose local affiliates are the holders of records for clients' shares. They have been putting more effort into obtaining proxy voting materials and English-language meeting agendas, and then taking responsibility for executing votes according to investors' wishes. However, the report also points to a problem facing investors in Japan, where 90 per cent of listed companies hold their annual meetings on the same day in late June. This year an unprecedented number of foreign institutions tried to cast votes on this day, yet many of the negative votes cast were never tallied at the meetings. Institutions whose votes were 'lost' include Calpers, which is looking for answers. ISS says this strengthens the view of many foreign institutions that their votes are not being handled properly in Japan. 'This is most likely true,' it adds, 'but as much for reasons of unfamiliarity on the part of Japanese banks as outright sabotage.'</p>

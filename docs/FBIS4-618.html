			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Erna van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 12 SAPA -- The government and the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] had a two-week "final  deadline" to get police salaries on par with that of the  National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] or face a boycott of election  duties, the South African Police Union [SAPU] warned on Tuesday  [12 April].    Describing the mood at grassroot level as "angry and  frightening" SAPU National Secretary Pieter-Don Brandt told a  news conference in Pretoria that the TEC's assurance on Tuesday  that police members' election period allowances would be trebled  to be on par with that of the NPKF had averted a SAPU strike  which would have begun on Wednesday. However, widespread  dissatisfaction remained about salaries.    SAPU grassroot members were bent on striking from Wednesday  but SAPU would not back any wildcat action, he said. Such  members faced expulsion from the union.    There were however still other "selective pressure  mechanisms" which would be backed and organised by SAPU during  the election period should the salary issue not be addressed.  While strikes were for the moment ruled out there was a plan on  the table for plackard demonstrations and mass meetings.    Other options included American-style "blue flu", where  people book off sick en mass. National organiser Bereng Kholoane  said: "The salary discrepancies between the police and the NPKF  is a slap in our members' faces. "After they (NPKF) had gone on  a strike they got better salaries. (SAPU) union members' lives  are in danger on a daily basis, they get killed on duty and they  don't get half the salaries of the NPKF members."    Although memoranda had been submitted to the government and  the TEC on grievances, the only official response was a  statement by Law and Order Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze that  the morale in the police force was not low, Mr Brand said.    An issue that would be taken up with the TEC was information  that police officials that had been striking in self-governing  territories, notably in kwaNdebele, had been given promotion.  "This precedent is sending the wrong signal to the force as a  whole. It seems that strike actions gets you something," said Mr  Brand.    This was especially disturbing as these self-governing  police  forces would soon be integrated into one police force, he added.</p>

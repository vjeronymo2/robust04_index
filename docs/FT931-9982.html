			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: US insurers report heavy losses AETNA Life &amp; Casualty and Travelers, two of the largest composite insurers in the US, yesterday reported heavy fourth-quarter losses, following a variety of special charges both companies had announced last week. Travelers incurred the bigger loss for the final quarter of 1992 - Dollars 589m, compared with a profit of Dollars 69m a year earlier - in the wake of several charges, including: Dollars 485m to cover a Dollars 735m addition to property and mortgage loan reserves; Dollars 59m for costs linked to Hurricane Andrew; and Dollars 79m related to litigation and assesments for industry guarantee funds. The large quarterly loss meant that Travelers reported a deficit of Dollars 658m for all of 1992, compared with a profit of Dollars 318m in 1991. Apart from the charges outlined in the fourth quarter results, the insurer had taken other charges earlier in the year to cover the cost of meeting Hurricane Andrew claims and to pay for a corporate restructuring. Separately, Travelers last year booked a Dollars 170m one-off gain related to the adoption of two new accounting standards. At Aetna, the fourth-quarter loss totalled Dollars 192m after the company took a Dollars 180m charge to boost reserves for asbestos and environmental claims. In the same quarter last year, Aetna recorded a net profit of Dollars 93m. For all of 1992, the insurer reported net income of only Dollars 56m, down sharply from the Dollars 505m profit made in 1991. Aside from the charges, Aetna said its fourth-quarter and full-year results were affected by high catastrophe losses, poor workers compensation results, depressed commercial property values, and continued soft pricing conditions in its main domestic insurance markets. The one bright spot was the company's health business, although even there Aetna's 1992 earnings were well down on the previous year. Because the special charges and quarterly losses had been well flagged in advance, the stock markets displayed little reaction to the news from Travelers and Aetna.</p>

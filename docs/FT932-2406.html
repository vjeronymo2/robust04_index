			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York exchange makes time for night shift - The launch of an after-hours electronic trading system WHEN THE New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy market, launches its after-hours electronic trading system next Thursday it will bring something novel to the crowded field of computer markets. Instead of flashing bids and offers for securities, Nymex's Access screens will list a unique menu of commodity derivatives. Access (an acronym for American computerised commodity exchange system and services) will initially offer futures and options on Nymex crude oil, heating oil and New York Harbor unleaded gasoline and platinum futures. Operating from 5.00 pm to 8.00 am (New York time), Sunday to Thursday, the system will intensify competition between the New York products and those traded on London's International Petroleum Exchange. The energy markets in New York and London already compete head-to-head. The IPE's regular trading day is a marathon 11 hours, overlapping with Nymex's 8.20 am to 3.10 pm floor session. Mr Patrick Thompson, the Nymex president, dismisses suggestions that Access will draw business away from the IPE. He says both markets could see volume increase if arbitrage between their respective contracts expands. A crucial factor in the success of Access is whether there is round-the-clock demand for commodity derivatives. Computer-traded financial derivatives like Eurodollars and foreign exchange have continuous cash markets. Spot trading in commodities is usually specific to one time zone, with traders rarely 'passing the book' across continents overnight. Pricing futures and options without a 'live' spot market is treacherous, traders acknowledge. Most of Nymex's cash market trades in Texas, during US business hours. Ironically, the night computer session covers Asian business hours - a slow period for energy trading - but misses an important chunk of the busy US spot trading day. Nymex officials say they are working to narrow the gap between the 3.10 pm trading floor close and the 5.00 pm Access opening, at the behest of Houston, Texas, and US west coast oil traders. The Access launch comes just a year after a partnership between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters turned on Globex, an elaborate overnight electronic trading system with global ambitions for derivative products. Globex lists financial products from the two Chicago exchanges and the French futures exchange, Matif. Globex trading has been sluggish, boosted only recently by local interest in Matif products in France. For now, Access and Globex have no competing products, and many US brokerage houses will operate Globex and Access terminals side-by-side. Having Globex pioneer the process was useful for Nymex. 'We watched very carefully what happened to Globex. We watched every pot hole they stepped in, regulatory and technical, and tried to avoid it,' says Mr Thompson. Nymex officials say their strategy for Access is much more modest than Globex. 'We aren't traveling around the globe trying to sign up other exchanges,' says Mr Thompson. Access terminals will be installed only in the US, although the exchange has had sufficient interest from London to seek regulatory approval to put Access work stations there. Volume ambitions are also modest. A Dollars 20m system, Access was developed in partnership with AT &amp; T, the giant American telephone company, and the Chicago software firm, Task Management. Nymex has guaranteed AT &amp; T substantial revenue from Access, though officials decline to name the amount. Market observers estimate that it would have to trade about 8,000 contracts a night to meet the guarantee, though Access officials say they will be satisfied with a nightly turnover of 1,000 to 1,500 contracts in the first year. Partly because of the financial pressures, Nymex hopes to open Access as a sort of daytime bulletin board for low volume products and cash derivatives, like natural gas swaps, sometime next year. Long-term plans for Access are much less modest. Mr Thompson expects the system to have international penetration within three years, and nightly volume of over 15,000 contracts. If the Nymex's proposed merger with the New York Commodity Exchange goes ahead Comex's precious metals contracts would quickly be listed on Access. While Nymex officials are playing down the plans, direct challenges to Globex financial products are also in the works. Negotiations are under way with Finex (an arm of the New York Cotton Exchange) to list its dollar index future, and with Simex, the Singapore futures exchange, to list its energy and financial products, including its growing franchise in Eurodollar futures.</p>

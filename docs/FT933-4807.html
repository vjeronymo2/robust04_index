			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong dollar behind 20% growth to Pounds 26m at Bunzl THE STRONG US dollar helped Bunzl, the paper and packaging group, to report a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the half year to the end of June. Profits rose from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 26m on increased sales of Pounds 728.8m (Pounds 632.2m). The shares firmed 1p to 144p. After the completion of last year's rationalisation, the group is continuing to look at strategic acquisitions which may require a rights issue. Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said: 'We have told our shareholders that if we do a big acquisition we will talk to them first.' He added that he was confident that the group would continue to grow organically. Net debt rose to Pounds 113m representing gearing of 51 per cent. Mr Habgood said borrowings tended to peak at the half year and were inflated by the strong dollar. The group's debt is mostly dollar denominated. Net interest payable, however, declined from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 4.4m, mainly because of the fall in interest rates. Paper and plastic disposables, assisted by the the strong dollar, reported increased operating profits of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 13.7m). The continued growth of overseas cigarette markets helped the cigarette filters side increase profits to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.1m). Plastics products, benefiting from a buoyant US automotive sector, turned in Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.4m). Mr Pat Dyer, deputy chairman and chairman of the BOC Group is to replace Mr David Kendall as chairman in October. Earnings per share rose to 3.9p (3.2p). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.8p. COMMENT Bunzl continues to benefit from its rationalisation programme when it disposed of unwanted companies accumulated in the eighties and cut costs. By holding margins in the face of price deflation in the US it is also showing its metal with existing businesses. While the figures would be less sparkling without the benefit of the strong dollar, much of the profit improvement reflects a clearer strategy. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 17.5. With the prospect of a stronger recovery in the US, where 60 per cent of its revenues are generated, its premium to the market still looks justified.</p>

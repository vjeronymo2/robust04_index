			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Speech No. 94/44 by Mrs. Christiane Scrivener, </F> Commissioner for Taxation and Customs, delivered at the American  International Club of Geneva in Geneva on 29 April: "USA and  Europe: Why We Need Each Other"]    [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to  address the American International Club of Geneva on this so  important subject of United States and Europe. I consider that  the transatlantic alliance and relations are as vital today as  they were before the end of the Cold War. And our relationship  is also crucial for the future. New challenges are arising and  important political and economic changes are taking place both  in the European Union [EU] and in the United States and also in  the rest of the world. Europe and the United States have a  common world responsibility.    That is the reason why the agreement reached on the Uruguay  Round is of great importance. It is really a major achievement  and especially for European Union-United States relations.  After a period during which European Union-United States  relations were subject to some strain, the first visit of  President Clinton to Europe provided opportunity to revitalize  the European Union-United States dialogue.    It was a very good surprise that President Clinton so  clearly, supported European integration, expressing the view  that Europe should be a very strong and equal partner. He  underlined the importance of the European Union for the United  States and made it clear that "America's commitment towards  Europe's safety and stability remains as strong as ever."  [passage omitted]    Let us come now to the prospects of European Union-United  States relationship.    The European Union and the United States have the most  important interdependent relationship in the world. Both sides  have major, concrete, overlapping interests in the other. The  European Union and the United States are each other's largest  single trading partner. Both share fundamental political  principles and both have an interest in promoting these  principles in the world. Given the depth of EU-U.S. economic  and political interdependence and the order of magnitude of  global political, economic, trade and environmental problems  which neither side can any longer solve on its own, it is  imperative that both work together in order to develop common  strategies and actions. This close relationship between the  United States and the EU is fully reflected in the transatlantic  declaration of 23 November 1990, which provides the  institutional framework for the transatlantic dialogue. In it,  both sides agreed inter alia on regular and intensive  consultations, by making full use of and further strengthening  existing procedures.    With the end of the cold war, new economic and political  challenges have emerged. The European Union, together with the  United States, is bound to remain in the forefront of regional  crisis management, especially in the framework of the United  Nations. Both partners are contributing to stability and  constructive change in Central and East Europe and the former  Soviet Union and to the achievement of peace in ex-Yugoslavia.  Both partners continue to share a common interest in the  management of other political issues: China, the Middle East,  and the promotion of democracy and human rights throughout the  world. At the same time the EU and United States together with  Japan have the common responsibility and the economic strength  to stimulate world trade, to revitalize global economic growth,  including employment and to reduce exchange rate instability.    At the NATO summit the approval of the partnership for  peace approach established a framework for enhanced political  and operational military cooperation with the Central and East  European countries. With respect to ex-Yugoslavia, a converging  approach emerged also from the NATO summit. Formal  consultations with the United States as called for by the EU  have contributed to better policy coordination in this area.    Following seven years of tough negotiations on the Uruguay  Round, which quite often put extreme strain on the transatlantic  relationship, the successful conclusion of the round in December  1993 demonstrated that both the US and the EU still have the  political will to work together constructively.    On the basis of competitive and cooperative partnership, the  EU and the United States remain a pole of stability for the  international community. But if both want to remain each  other's key partner on the world scene, timely changes and  adaptations will be needed in the transatlantic dialogue in  order to contain potential sources of friction and to build up  an agenda based on joint interest and cooperation.    It is important to improve transatlantic channels of  information and communication in order to avoid misinformation  and the resulting friction over each other's share of the burden  of financial, economic and trade efforts necessary to assist the  reform process in the Central and East European countries and  Russia.    In order to achieve a better cooperation between the EU and  the United States it is essential that the EU gets its act  together and speaks with one voice on foreign and security  policy issues.    On the economic and trade side, it is now necessary to  implement the Uruguay Round and to keep the process under  political purview.    The EU and the United States will have to tackle the  so-called next generation of trade issues such as trade and  environment, trade and social issues, trade and competition and  work closely together on global issues such as population growth  and environmental degradation.    It is very important that an active bilateral dialogue be  developed on all issues of common interests.    As a European Commissioner in charge of taxation and  customs,  I have initiated a new dialogue in these fields between the  European Commission and the United States administration. That  has been fruitful in the case of the difficult problem of  unitary taxation. Other tax problems of common interest could be  discussed in the same way.    Another field which seems to me to be crucial for the coming  years is new technologies. In that field, European Union/United  States cooperation should be strengthened. It is not only a  matter for cooperation at governmental or public agencies level.  It is a matter for business cooperation between European and  American companies. In some areas, such as the new information  highways, if Europe and the United States want to keep or to get  a technological leadership, they must work more together.    A kind of common leadership often seems to be the only way  to  face competition from Japan and Asia.    As you can see, there are a lot of reasons why I think that  the United States and Europe need each other.    The challenges and common responsibilities which both the  European Union and the United States have to face clearly call  for more coordinated approaches, common action and closer  cooperation. It is a question of political will on both sides  but it is also a question of a better consciousness at all  levels in the business communities and public administrations on  both sides of the Atlantic ocean.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

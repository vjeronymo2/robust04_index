			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Brokers favour use of three electronic trade systems A POWERFUL group of institutional investors and stockbrokers yesterday named three electronic trade confirmation systems which they want to see established as standard products for use in the securities industry. The institutions which had launched the exercise had hoped originally to select just one, effectively driving out of the market a range of competing commercial systems. But the final decision reflected the impracticality of foisting a single system on to all users, and the need to keep an element of competition. Electronic confirmation of the details of trades, which would replace the current system based on telex and facsimile, is seen by the institutions as a way of speeding up the clearing and settlement of deals. Some users hope that the trade confirmation infrastructure could later be used to support electronic dealing, by-passing existing exchanges. The three systems chosen were Trax (developed by the International Securities Market Association), Sequal (the London Stock Exchange) and Oasys (a commercial system developed by Thomson). In addition, the Depositary Trust Corporation of the US will also be recommended once it's product is completed. Mr Chris Smith, manager of the transaction department in the UK of Fidelity, one of the leading fund managers behind the initiative, said the intention had been to pick only one supplier but it had proved politically impossible to do so. Instead, national markets were likely to develop their own systems, he said, with international suppliers providing systems which were able to link internationally active investment firms into them.</p>

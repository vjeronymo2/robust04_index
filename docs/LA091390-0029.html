			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A RESPONSIBLE LESSON IN SEX EDUCATION FOR TEENS AND PARENTS  </P> <P> The "ABC Afterschool Special" series puts its best foot forward with today's  outstanding season premiere, "A Question of Sex" (at 3 p.m. on Channels 7, 3,  10 and 42).  </P> <P> Starring Tracey Gold of "Growing Pains" and sensitively directed by "Top Gun"  actor Tom Skerritt, the hourlong drama revolves around Shauna, a teen-age girl  who decides to publicly protest the lack of sex education and counseling for  teens in her town.  </P> <P> She comes into conflict with the school board and her mother, a board member up  for re-election. Mom insists that sex education is the parents' responsibility,  even though she herself can't talk about it to her daughter.  </P> <P> Written by Courtney Flavin from a story by Flavin, Beth Thompson and Tracey  Thompson, the drama addresses parents' concerns, the importance of  communication and of giving teens the information to make responsible choices.  It avoids extremes and finds a common-sense compromise, doing so with honesty,  unusual artistic integrity for a "message show" and a complete lack of  exploitation.  </P> <P> If the latest Kinsey report is any guide -- suggesting that a majority of adult  Americans are woefully ignorant about sexual realities -- this straightforward  hour should be required watching by parents as well as teens.

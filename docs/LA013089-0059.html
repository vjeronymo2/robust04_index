			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOLAR CALL BOXES GET HUNG UP IN PATENT DISPUTE  </P> <P> Installation of emergency call boxes on Ventura County freeways, scheduled for  April, will be delayed because of a dispute over patent rights, a county  official said.  </P> <P> Al Knuth, deputy director of the county Public Works Department, said that  installation of the 390 solar-powered call boxes will be delayed at least until  July because of legal squabbles between two communications companies that had  bid on the project.  </P> <P> "It's a disappointment we sure didn't expect," he said in an interview Friday.  </P> <P> Knuth said the county has spent $3,000 to hire an attorney specializing in  patent law to help settle the disagreement. The attorney, Bernard Kleinke of  San Diego, is to report to county officials Feb. 22, he said.  </P> <P> In October, the county awarded Cubic Communications Corp. of San Diego a  contract for nearly $817,000 to install the boxes at quarter- and half-mile  intervals on six freeways. It rejected a competing bid of about $1 million from  GTE Cellular Communications Corp. of Burbank.  </P> <P> GTE alleges that allowing Cubic to install the system would be an infringement  of GTE's patent on the system, which doesn't expire until 2004, Knuth said.  </P> <P> E.A. Hardenburgh, GTE's general manager, said the company would consider  letting Ventura County use the system for a fee. Hardenburgh would not say how  much GTE would charge the county.  </P> <P> Keith Burnett, Cubic's chairman, said his firm would "defend any suit GTE wants  to throw at us." He said that licensing the call-box network "is like licensing  the wheel" because the technology is not that sophisticated.  </P> <P> A lawsuit, he said, "would not hold up, but it's sure got the politicians  nervous, so that's why they've delayed the installation."  </P> <P> Ventura County has three call boxes. Two are on the Simi Valley Freeway just  over the Los Angeles County line. The other is on the southbound side of the  Ventura Freeway, halfway up a steep incline near Camarillo.  </P></p>

The republic's Constitution says relations with the federal  centre must be built on the basis of agreements between federal  authorities and the local government. The republic is to have  its own president at the head of the executive power and the  popular Hural (parliament) as the main body of representative  authority. The first presidential and parliamentary elections  will be held in March 1994.</p>

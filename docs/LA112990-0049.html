			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EXHIBITS: ART/LIFE;  </P> <P> EVOLVING ISSUES;  </P> <P> TO CELEBRATE THE INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY, IT'S ON A WORLD  TOUR OF GALLERIES, INCLUDING ONE IN VENTURA.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Joe Cardella was a frustrated artist living in Santa Barbara,  trying to find expression in what he perceived to be a conservative, closed art  scene. He found it with a monthly limited-edition publication bearing the name  Art/Life.  </P> <P> The portfolio featured graphic art, prints, poetry, Xerox art and collages, all  bound into an attractive package available at a modest price. Cardella could  not have predicted the longevity or scope of his project. It was, it turned  out, an idea with legs.  </P> <P> At present, 200 copies of Art/Life are produced 11 times a year (every month  except January) and distributed internationally -- the biggest drop points  being New York City and Tokyo. Most of the contributing artists are  California-based, but work comes from Germany -- which has the second largest  contingent of Art/Lifers -- and other corners of the world.  </P> <P> "I realized the publication would have the potential to do something, but I  didn't know what form it would take," Cardella said last week during a break  from assembling the 10th anniversary issue of Art/Life.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced that one of the main reasons Art/Life continued and flourished  was because the need for it already existed. I merely filled the need. I didn't  create the need."  </P> <P> Now, Art/Life is in the midst of its "10th anniversary world tour," with  separate gallery shows in New York, Milan, Tokyo, Kassel, Germany, and, in our  neighborhood, at Ventura's Momentum Gallery (34 N. Palm St.) and Westmont  College (955 La Paz Road) in Montecito.  </P> <P> And Cardella is now living in Ventura, not in Santa Barbara, although moving  was a bit more complicated than a 30-mile drive down U.S. 101.  </P> <P> In 1985, after several years of getting Art/Life off the ground and around the  world, Cardella returned to Connecticut, his birthplace. He had graduated with  a degree in design from Syracuse University before heading west and thought  that it was time to go back.  </P> <P> "Mistakenly, I thought it would be helpful to Art/Life to be closer to New York  City, the art center and publishing center of the world," Cardella said. "But I  was there and was still doing everything through the mail, so it seemed  pointless. I preferred California. We had been out here long enough so that we  enjoyed this lifestyle and climate."  </P> <P> So after three years, Cardella returned to Southern California with Barbara  Smeltzer -- "my life partner as well as my Art/Life partner. She's helped me a  lot."  </P> <P> Needless to say, Art/Life has come a long way from the Xerox machine. It has  also come a long way from two-dimensional images on paper. Perusing past  Art/Life issues on display at Westmont, as well as pieces hung on the gallery  walls, it's apparent that the variety and ambition of the art has evolved over  the years. Within each bulging issue, you are liable to find such "found  objects" as chopsticks, paint brushes, rubber gloves, even patches of  Astroturf. The canvas ranges from paper to metal leaf to transparent plastic to  fabrics.  </P> <P> The publications force artists to think relatively small -- to work to the  scale of its 8 1/2-by 11-inch format. "It takes some people a while to get used  to," Cardella said of the format. "And other people just can't grasp the  concept. But once you work within that framework, there are really no  limitations. You can use scaled images of larger pieces and you can also do  conceptual pieces which are all-encompassing and that deal with global  concepts. It's just a matter of becoming facile with the medium."  </P> <P> For the most part, the aesthetic temperament of the Art/Life art is gentle,  often conveying soft-edged absurdity and soothing abstraction. Noticeably  lacking are strident political messages or abrasive imagery meant to provoke.  In other words, Art/Life is by no means a guerrilla art enterprise or an  underground art tract.  </P> <P> "It probably has something to do with the people we attract," Cardella said of  his monthly. "I generally don't encourage things that are real downers. The  purpose of what we're doing is not to depress people. It's to enlighten people.  I prefer things that are primarily well done and that also make positive  statements."  </P> <P> Art/Life is as vital as ever, and Cardella believes that "returning to  California was pivotal because people still have more freedom out here with  their ideas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> The Art/Life exhibit will be displayed at the Momentum Gallery, 34 N.

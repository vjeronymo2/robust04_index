			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established in this experimental population area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental population area, land-use restrictions could be used as needed, and at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at the discretion of land management and natural resource agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established, temporary restrictions on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions on private land would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service and Federal, State, or tribal agencies authorized by the Service, could promptly remove any wolf from the experimental population once the Service, or its authorized agencies, has determined it was presenting a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental, unavoidable, unintentional, and accidental take in the course of otherwise lawful activity, or in defense of human life, would be permitted by the Service and its authorized agencies, provided that such taking was not resulting from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf, and the taking was immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the appropriate authorities. Shooters have the responsibility to identify their target before shooting. The act of taking a wolf that is wrongly identified as another species, for purposes of this rule, will be considered as intentional, negligent, and not accidental. Such a take may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service, and other Federal, State, or tribal agencies after they have been designated by the Service, may control wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or moving wolves when five or fewer breeding pairs are established, or by other previously described measures. Killing wolves or placing them in captivity may only be considered when there are six or more breeding pairs established in the experimental population area. When depredation occurs on public land and prior to the establishment of six breeding pairs, depredating females and their pups would be captured and released at or near the site of capture, one time prior to October 1. If depredations continue, or if six packs are present, females and their pups would be removed. Wolves on private land under these same circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals or pets on private land, twice in a calendar year would be moved, and chronic problem wolves would be removed from the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service, other Federal agencies, and State or tribal wildlife personnel would be authorized and trained to take wolves under special circumstances. Wolves could be live-captured and translocated to resolve conflicts with State or tribal big-game management objectives, when they are located outside of the experimental areas, or to enhance wolf recovery. If the captured animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, it could be placed in a captive facility. Killing of any wolves would be a last resort and only authorized when live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service and authorized agencies of the Service would use the following conditions and criteria to determine the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

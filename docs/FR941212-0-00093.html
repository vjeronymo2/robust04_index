			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) If a demand by a claimant or an inquiry by a potential claimant is directed solely to the Army, where it appears that the responsible Army employee may have applicable insurance coverage, the employee should be queried as to whether he or she has liability insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If so, determine if his or her insurer has made or will make any payment to claimant. Under applicable State laws, the United States may also be an insured entitled to coverage under the employee's liability policy. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 16 ALR3d 1411; United States v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., 245 F. Supp. 58 (D. Ore. 1965.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Therefore, where there may be applicable insurance coverage, the policy language should be reviewed, together with the rules and regulations of the State insurance regulatory body, or determine whether_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The United States comes within the definition of ``insured''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The exclusion of the United States from policy coverage conforms with state laws and policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Appropriate consideration has been given for a policy where the United States has been excluded from coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the employee refuses to cooperate in providing this information, he or she should be advised to comply with the notice requirements of the insurance policy and to request the insurance carrier to contact the claims officer or attorney. The case should be followed to ascertain whether the employee's insurer has made or will make any payment to the claimant before deciding whether to settle the claim against the Government. Normally, the award, if any, to the claimant will be reduced by the amount of the payment of the employee's insurance carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the employee is the sole target of the claim and Army claims authorities arrange to have the claim made against the Government, the employee should be required to notify his or her insurance carrier according to the policy and inform Army claims authorities of the name of the insurance carrier and details of the coverage. Except when the driver's statute is applicable, the insurance carrier is expected to participate in the negotiation of the claims settlement and to pay its fair share of any award to the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Where the responsible Army employee is ``on loan'' to another employer other than the United States (for example, an ROTC instructor at a civilian institution or performing duties for a foreign government), it should be determined whether there is applicable statutory or insurance coverage concerning the acts of the responsible employee and appropriate contribution or indemnification should be sought. In the case of foreign governments, applicable treaties or agreements are controlling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A great many claims cognizable under the FTCA are now settled on a compromise basis. A major consideration in many such settlements is the identification of other sources of recovery. This is true in a variety of factual situations where there is a potential joint tortfeasor; for example, multi-vehicle accidents with multiple drivers and guest passengers, State or local government involvement, contractors performing non-routine tasks for the Government, medical treatment rendered to claimants by non-Government employees, or incidents caused by a member or employee of the military department of a State or Commonwealth with whom the DA does not have a cost-sharing agreement. The law of the jurisdiction regarding joint and several liability, indemnity, and contribution may permit shared financial responsibility, but even in jurisdictions that do not permit contribution, a compromise settlement can be reached with the other tortfeasor's insurance company paying a portion of the total amount of the claim against the Government. For these reasons, every effort should be made to identify the insurance of all potential tortfeasers involved and the status of any claims made, and to demand contribution or indemnity where substantial reason exists to believe that liability for the loss or damage should be shared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) When a claim is filed against the Government under a subpart that does not permit the payment of a subrogated interest (subparts E, J, K), it is important to ensure that full information is obtained from the claimant regarding insurance coverage since it is the legislative intent of the statutes upon which these subparts are based that insurance coverage be fully utilized before using appropriated funds to pay the claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.30  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. Settlement means denial or payment of a claim in full or in part. When an approval or settlement authority determines that a claim is meritorious in an amount within his or her monetary jurisdiction, the claim will be approved in that amount under the statute determined to be proper regardless of the statutory basis asserted by the claimant. Every effort will be made to settle claims at the lowest level possible commensurate with the actual value of the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Award of full amount claimed. If an approval or settlement authority approves a claim in full, the claim will be certified for payment to the appropriate disbursing officer. Enclosures listed in &sect;536.35 will be forwarded with the claim. The claimant will be notified of the action taken on the claim. A settlement agreement is required prior to payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Award of less than full amount. When an approval or settlement authority determines that a claim is meritorious in part, he or she will_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Notify the claimant in writing of his or her action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Request the execution of a settlement agreement (in triplicate) in final and complete settlement of the claim in the reduced amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If an approval authority, inform the claimant that if he or she does not desire to accept the award, he or she should indicate in the reply the reasons for rejection. If a settlement authority, and the action is taken under subparts C or F, inform the claimant of the right to appeal. (See &sect;536.63 and &sect;536.103.) DA Pam 27&hyph;162 provides sample formats for letters notifying claimants of the actions taken on their claims. (Fig 5&hyph;10 is to be used by field approving and settlement authorities; figs 5&hyph;8 through 5&hyph;11 are to be used by claims authorities in conjunction with &sect;536.37 of this part.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Nonacceptance of reduced award. When a claimant rejects a partial award, the approval authority may reconsider the matter and, if justified, make further efforts to settle the claim. When further efforts to settle appear unwarranted, the claim and related file will be forwarded to the settlement authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident with a memorandum of opinion. The claimant should be advised of such referral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Civil works claims. Engineer civil works claims settled under the provisions of the FTCA in an amount of $2,500 or less normally are paid out of funds controlled by the COE rather than claims appropriations. Unsettled claims in this category should, therefore, be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. An information copy will be sent to the COE, ATTN: Chief Counsel, unless the latter waives that requirement. Civil works claims received outside engineer channels should be forwarded without further action to the district or division engineer in whose area the incident occurred, or to the COE, ATTN: Chief Counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Settlement of property damage claims. All claims submitted for only property damage or for only personal injury should be evaluated for other potential claims. Under tort claims statutes, only one payment may be made to a claimant on all claims arising out of a single incident. Therefore, a property damage claim arising from an incident in which the claimant sustained injury should not be paid unless the claimant executes a release for any potential injury claim. Likewise, when a property damage claim is settled the claimant should be informed that subsequent claims for hidden damage or loss of use are precluded by the settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.31  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims forwarded without settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Claims beyond monetary jurisdiction. If the chief of a command claims service or the head of a claims office considers a claim meritorious in an amount exceeding their jurisdiction, they will forward the claim with a memorandum of opinion to the settlement authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident. The claimant should be informed of this referral. In most cases the claimant should not be informed of the amount of award recommended. However, for claims arising under the Foreign Claims Act notice of the amount recommended may be required in accordance with &sect;536.156.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Hector  Arenas reports:    [Arenas] The Guatemalan Government has asked the Spanish  Government for support to try to attain a definitive peace  agreement this year in talks it is holding in Mexico with the  guerrilla movement. Negotiations started in Spain, in El  Escorial [near Madrid], a few years ago. The request for  support was made by recently appointed Guatemalan Foreign  Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman during a short stay in Madrid,  in which she held a meeting with Foreign Minister Javier Solana.  The Guatemalan minister described the meeting as being very  positive.    [Begin de Vielman recording] We find it positive that they  are very favorable to the beginning of this new phase, and we  believe that Spain will be among those countries watching this  process closely, and that they will support us. [end recording]    [Arenas] Also, during this meeting Guatemala asked the  European countries to lift present restrictions on the import of  tropical fruit, especially bananas. Finally, the Guatemalan  minister said that reports last week on the alleged plotting of  a coup d'etat against President Leon Carpio were lies.</p>

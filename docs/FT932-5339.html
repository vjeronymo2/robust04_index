			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Shell staff refuse new contracts WORKERS AT Shell's Haven oil refinery in Essex are refusing to accept individual contracts of employment and union derecognition, it was announced yesterday. Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary for the oil industry, said that Shell was 'attempting to deny our 470 members their basic right to trade union representation and is using the threat of redundancy as a weapon to intimidate the workforce into signing individual contracts'. Yesterday Shell confirmed that it was going ahead with derecognition at the Haven refinery for wage bargaining purposes, though workers can still belong to unions. It also announced it would impose compulsory redundancies by the end of next year.</p>

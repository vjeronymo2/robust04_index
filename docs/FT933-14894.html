			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Why Commission deserves two cheers on EC car pricing Sir, It is hard to avoid the conclusion that John Griffiths ('Exchange rates main factor in European car price comparisons,' July 5) is looking through the wrong end of the telescope in assessing the reasons for differences in car prices between EC member states. Exchange rates in themselves are no more responsible for price differences than the Retail Price Index is a cause of inflation: they are merely a means of translating one country's prices into a form which can be compared with another's. Short-term fluctuations - especially dramatic ones such as those associated with the exit of sterling, the lira, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo from the Exchange Rate Mechanism last September - may upset long-established comparisons, but they do not invalidate them. The fact is that pre-tax car prices in the UK were well above those in most other EC countries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s; even the substantial fall in sterling against the D-Mark, Belgian franc, French franc and Dutch guilder within the last year has done no more than shift the general level of UK prices to roughly the EC average, with some models still costing 20 to 30 per cent more than in other countries. Whether even this state of affairs remains depends heavily on the car manufacturers' pricing policies in the UK, and on the manufacturers' ability to resist the temptation to return to their old view of this country as a high-price, high-profit market where consumer interests come a long way down the list of corporate priorities. What underlying factors should guide car pricing in different EC countries is an interesting issue for debate, as John Griffiths identifies. It may well be that in a completely unrestrained market subject to differing tax treatments in different areas, manufacturers would be justified in varying their pre-tax prices in a way that maximises their investment returns. But we don't have an unrestrained market - EC limits on price differences were introduced as part of the 'deal' on selective and exclusive distribution reached between the Commission and the manufacturers. Also, the Commission, rightly, wanted to demonstrate the benefits that could flow directly to consumers from a single, barrier-free market in the crucially important cars sector. For its efforts so far the Commission deserves at least two cheers from the consumer corner - and the new data that will be generated by these twice-yearly car price comparisons will start to give us a clear, authoritative picture of whether the EC single market for cars is a myth or, at last, a reality.

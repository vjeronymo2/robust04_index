			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] OHX small observation/reconnaissance helicopter for  the Ground Self-Defense Force, a replacement to the current OH6  model, is being developed as the first helicopter to be  developed here based on purely local technology. While the  fuselage is being developed under the cooperation of Kawasaki  Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy  Industries, Kawasaki's plays the biggest role as the prime  controller. It is in charge of developing about 70&percnt; of the  fuselage including the front fuselage and the rotor.    The total sale of Kawasaki's Aerospace Division in FY92 was  about &yen;230 billion. The total sale in FY93 is expected to  reduce to about &yen;190 billion, because, among other things,  the number of P3C antisubmarine patrol planes they produce as  the prime contractor has been reduced. Furthermore, it looks  like their business will be affected in the future by the budget  cut of the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program introduced at the  end of last year.    That being the case, their expectation for OHX is flying  high. If we assume that OHX will be deployed in a similar scale  as OH6, it means a project of about 180 helicopters, amounting  to a figure over &yen;100 billion. It is certain that it will be  a stable source of income for Kawasaki, while the defense  spending is declining across the board.    An informed source at the Defense Agency points out that,  "it  is the Defense Agency's intention to seek an effective use of  the limited budget in accordance with the sharing of  responsibilities such that fighters are to be built by  Mitsubishi, and helicopters by Kawasaki."    A main pillar of the commercial business to compensate for  the reduction of orders from the Defense Agency is the  production sharing plan of the new commercial jet, Boeing 777.  Unfortunately, due to the poor business conditions the airlines  are experiencing, the production is still at the pace of one a  month. It is expected to take at least two more years to reach  the production pace of three to four planes a month.    The helicopter business is an ace of the commercial market  as  well.    The attention-getter here is BK117, a commercial helicopter,  which was developed by Kawasaki in cooperation with Deutsche  Aerospace of Germany and Aerospatiale of France. Although the  incoming order level has dropped since the bubble bursting of  the economy, "there is yet a strong demand potential at various  central government branches and local governments," says  Nobuhiko Tatebe, Director and Assistant General Manager of  Aerospace Division.    One such potential is the use of helicopters for the  Emergency Medical Service (EMS). It is the transport service for  rescuing patients from remote islands and mountain areas.  Although they have not sold any helicopters for this application  due to the pending legal issues and the lack of infrastructures,  they will appeal to the public and authorities through  demonstrations using actual helicopters.    The company's effort on R&amp;D is also strong. They  developed  for the first time in Japan the fly-by-wire (FBW) technology for  the helicopter to replace the hydraulic system hitherto used. In  this system, in place of a regular stick, a small stick is used  and the delicate movement of the fuselage is detected by  sensors. The computer will understand the pilot's intention, and  sends signal to the control device of the rotor. The system is  currently tested on an actual helicopter.    Some of these cutting-edge technologies have already been  applied to practical uses. One example is the OPS navigation  system which determines the location of the helicopter based on  the data received from satellites. "It automatically displays  the altitude and the height of an obstructing object on the  ground to enhance flight safety," says Mr. Tatebe with a pride.    Some of the executives of the heavy industry here have  voiced  an opinion that, "there is no base for the aircraft industry to  grow in Japan." On the other hand, Ryozo Tsutsui, Executive  Director of Kawasaki (formerly Director General of the Technical  Research and Development Institute of the Defense Agency),  predicts that, "the currency of the 21st century is technology."  What he means is that the technology of a nation or a company  will be the key factor that determines the negotiation power of  said nation or company. It is safe to say that the helicopter is  the lifeline for Kawasaki for maintaining its basic aircraft  manufacturing technology.</p>

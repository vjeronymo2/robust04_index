			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Libreville, 1 March (AFP) -- The UN Economic  Commission for Africa (CEA) said Tuesday [1 March] that the CFA  franc, used in 14 African countries, might be devalued again if  the 50 percent devaluation on January 11 did not boost growth.  The African franc zone "will not be safe from a new  devaluation" over the next few years if it is the "most  realistic" option for promoting long-term macro-economic growth,  a study published by the CEA Tuesday said. [passage omitted]    In a study on the macro-economic effects of the CFA franc's  devaluation, published during the fifth meeting of African  finance ministers which opened in Libreville on Tuesday, the CEA  cautioned, however, that despite the "numerous studies on the  subject, one cannot say with certainty if devaluation is an  efficient measure or not."    The study predicted three possible scenarios for the  development of the 14 affected economies over the next six  years. The "most realistic of the three" calculated a 50  percent increase in domestic prices in the first year, a  permanent five percent increase in annual public spending, a  thirty percent increase in foreign capital flows in the first  year and a stabilisation at 18 percent in the following years.    The devaluation would provoke a short-term increase in  production with a growth in gross domestic product at 7.8  percent in the first year, thanks to a 39.7 percent boost to  exports, the CEA said, confirmed by a rise in exports from Cote  d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso since January French officials at the  meeting said.    However, after the first year, the outlook will deteriorate,  the CEA said, and in the long term there would be a "net slowing  of growth," due mainly to inflation slowing down exports,  increasing trade deficits and cutting funds available for  investment and production. "In fact, the long term model gives  production figures which are almost unchanged from those that  would have been seen if no devaluation had taken place," the CEA  said    The effect of the devaluation on the region's trade balance  was also doubtful, because of the rise in prices, the CEA said.  At the end of six years, "national output will become less and  less competitive and imports less and less expensive," the CEA  said, ending up in "a continuing degradation in the trade  balance".    In total, "the direct expansionist effect of the devaluation  on the whole of the economies of the franc zone will be wiped  out in the long term," the study said, predicting another  devaluation to follow.    CEA Executive Secretary, the Algerian Layashi Yaker opened  the African finance ministers' meeting warning that "poverty was  developing" on the continent which was facing a "spiralling rise  in unemployment". After the "lost" decade of the 1980s, Africa  had not started out any better in the 1990s, he said, with an  average growth in output of 1.5 percent since 1990, less than  half the rate of growth of the population. Debt problems have  continued to grow, Yaker said. "Why have ten years of  structural adjustment not succeeded in bringing Africa out of  the crisis?" Yaker asked, saying it was the "central" question  for the continent. [passage omitted]</p>

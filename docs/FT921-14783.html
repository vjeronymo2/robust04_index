			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Hopes fade for TV deal in west country SLENDER chances of a deal between Television South West and Westcountry Television before next week's judicial review in the High Court of the ITC's franchise decision seemed to fade last night. Over the past few weeks there have been informal contacts between the two commercial television companies, usually through third parties. In October the Independent Television Commission announced that Westcountry had won the franchise for the south-west with a bid of Pounds 7.82m. TSW was rejected on the ground that its Pounds 16.2m bid was too high to sustain its programme service throughout the 10-year franchise. TSW successfully appealed against a High Court refusal to grant a judicial review of the ITC decision and the hearing is due to go ahead on Monday. However, there has been a series of contacts between Mr Stephen Redfarn, chief executive of Westcountry and Mr Harry Turner, chief executive of TSW. First Mr Redfarn offered to talk and Mr Turner said 'No'. Then after Lord Donaldson granted TSW a judicial review, Mr Turner suggested talks and Mr Redfarn and his board declined. Although it was never spelt out, the implication of the contacts was that there might be terms under which TSW might withdraw its judicial review. One possibility would be that the TSW shareholders would get a minority stake in Westcountry. The unusual contacts continued last Friday when Mr Turner telephoned Mr Redfarn under the mistaken assumption that Westcountry was prepared to talk. Mr Redfarn believes the ITC's case is a strong one, although he would consider a formal proposal from TSW. TSW, the Plymouth-based ITV company, will rely on information from an ITC secret document questioning whether the company's bank would actually give it the Pounds 10m overdraft promised. Apparently that was never checked. In the document the ITC said that if advertising revenue grew at only 4 per cent a year in real terms, compared with the TSW forecast of 5.3 per cent, the company's fixed costs would total 105 per cent of revenue between 1993 and 1995. 'With no dividends until 1996, a lean cost structure and limited strength in the projected balance sheet, the risks to the programme service posed by the size of the are very great,' the secret ITC staff document says.</p>

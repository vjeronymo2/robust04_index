A docudrama, "Never Forget," starring Star  Trek's Leonard Nimoy, is being shot locally and is due on the TNT cable network  in January. . . . Mermelstein, an Auschwitz survivor who is often consulted on  the set, says it was "kind of strange" watching himself portrayed. Even  stranger: He's playing his own father. Mark I.

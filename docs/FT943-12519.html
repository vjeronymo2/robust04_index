			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Architecture: Image projector's image - Colin Amery assesses Channel Four's new building in London Television is everywhere and it is sometimes difficult to imagine it coming from any specific place. In these days of virtual reality, it comes as a surprise to realise that TV channels need concrete headquarters and solid bases for their activities. Opened earlier this month, the new Channel Four building in Westminster follows hot on the heels of the new ITN building in London, designed by Sir Norman Foster. Britons see ITN in all its transparent glory every night on 'News at Ten' - the image of efficiency and focused energy gives a certain boost of confidence to the broadcasting of the news itself. When TV-am began its short life in a converted canal-side warehouse in Camden Town, it chose as its architect the jocular Terry Farrell who could not resist a sunrise-shaped entrance and a row of breakfast egg cups along the parapet. Those jokey days are over and Channel Four took the appointment of its architect, Sir Richard Rogers, very seriously. Channel Four held a private competition and appointed a design committee to oversee the process and select the winner. The composition of any jury is usually what determines the result and when you have Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, Michael Manser, a former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Michael Grade and Sir Richard Attenborough on the jury you can expect a fellow member of the modernist establishment, of a certain age, will be appointed. At the time of the competition (1991) I recall the much more adventurous scheme, by Bennetts Associates, which reached the shortlist but did not win. The winning design by Sir Richard Rogers shows how middle age has tempered the extremism of his early years when the Pompidou Centre, which he designed with Renzo Piano, was the first building to expose all its pipes and ducts on the outside of the facade. This was seen as some kind of a breakthrough and announced the birth of the style known as high-tech. As is often the case with the promotion of architectural styles - a great deal depends on the personal charm of the architect. Richard Rogers has always been a fervent evangelist and has used his personal charm to sell his particular brand of mechanistic modernism. It is interesting to see how he is modifying his line, and in all his public utterances about community architecture he begins to sound close to some of the views of HRH The Prince of Wales. Channel Four's new headquarters occupies two and a half acres on Horseferry Road in Westminster, just behind the concrete horror of the Department of the Environment's headquarters in Marsham Street. The site had been ear marked 20 years ago for a 20 storey post office building and work had already started on the construction of a ten metre deep basement. This below-ground work was utilised by the architects to provide a home for 'no-daylight functions' such as the main studio and the preview cinema. As part of the planning deal, negotiated by Westminster City Council, half an acre of the site is a public park and children's playground. The plan of the building is a large 'L' shape, with the knuckle of the building, at the joint of the 'L', being occupied by the curved entrance area, boardroom, and restaurants. It is this curved element that is the most spectacular part of the building and is really the only part of the design that seems to bear Richard Rogers's signature. The curved curtain wall, supported on a spider's web of steel, is something that all architects have tried to do since Norman Foster's Willis Faber Dumas office building in Ipswich curved so sinuously on its site. It is the component manufacturer who must take much of the credit for the success of something as striking as Channel Four's curved glass wall. It was made by Eiffel in France (who made the famous glass pyramid in the Louvre). Permasteelisa, an Italian cladding manufacturer under the direction of Massimo Colomban, made the curtain walling on the office blocks which have a rugged toughness about them. Massimo Colomban is one of those brilliant Italian designer/businessmen who is currently founding a school to train architects in the 'perfecting of component engineering'. Channel Four has really gained a fragment of a Rogers building - the excitingly curved entrance area and the lift tower and stack of meeting zooms - the rest of two blocks is routine offices. Indeed, one of the blocks will be let. Channel Four has spent Pounds 62m on the site and the building. Construction costs are some Pounds 39m which, allowing for the special needs of a TVbuilding, is not far from the average for a good quality office block in central London. Channel Four has provided London with a modest but striking example of late modernism - a kind of calmed, high-tech building. The particularly good thing is that it has stayed in the centre of the city, not gone wandering off to Docklands and has provided some housing for sale and a park on the site. In image terms the new headquarters is much more workmanlike than Lord Reith's grand Broadcasting House. By concentrating all the architectural excitement at the entrance, Channel Four's new HQ is rather like TV itself - it promises a lot of sparkle but, once you pass the entrance the building, is pretty routine.</p>

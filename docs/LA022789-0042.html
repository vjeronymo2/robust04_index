			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAMB'S HITS THE BIG LEAGUES WITH 'AMADEUS'  </P> <P> The good news is that a decade after Peter Shaffer wrote "Amadeus," the play --  now in a luscious, shimmering production at Lamb's Players Theatre -- still  works.  </P> <P> On the surface, "Amadeus" poses the eternal question of why genius would be  bestowed on as rude, crude and seemingly unworthy person as the young Wolfgang  Amadeus (or "Beloved of God") Mozart, while mediocrity should be the lot of  Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri.  </P> <P> The key to the dilemma, of course, is that this is a tale of worthiness versus  unworthiness in Salieri's eyes alone. And what Salieri doesn't see is that the  fault lies in his conception of God as a merchant weighing out such good deeds  as chastity and charity and doling out fame and fortune accordingly.  </P> <P> The danger in producing a play about mediocrity versus genius is that it draws  attention to the quality of the show itself, begging the question of whether  the company here has pulled a Mozart or a Salieri.  </P> <P> Not to worry. There is an auspicious feeling of stretch to Lamb's season  opener, playing through March 25.  </P> <P> Lamb's has supplemented its capable ranks with worthy talent. It is directed by  associate artistic director Kerry Cederberg, and only David Cochran Heath  (Salieri) and Michael Buckley (Venticello, one of Salieri's servants) are  regulars. The rest of the cast -- headed by Aloysius Mullally as a Mozart who  exudes innocence and Robert F. Stark as Joseph II, the hopelessly unmusical  emperor to whom manners are everything -- bring original and colorful  interpretations to the parts.  </P> <P> One could ask for more, to be sure: More music to be piped in by Mozart and  Salieri. Also, the range of Salieri's task -- to move through time and space,  from smug contentment to existentialist despair, from apostle to Judas -- can  provide the role of an actor's career. If Heath is not the last word on  Salieri, he delivers a creditable performance with the promise of more over the  course of the run.  </P> <P> The production gleams with the attention to detail that nudges Lamb's, at last,  into the bigger leagues. Kudos for the engagement of a movement consultant and  dramaturge. The elegant costumes by Veronica Murphy Smith -- all lace, brocade  and tight corsets -- are excellently complemented by the wigs. Brett Kelly's  lighting plays its own musical variations on the smooth, polished surface of  Mike Buckley's simple set.  </P> <P> There may be flaws in the diamond, but this is still a gem of a show.  </P> <P> "AMADEUS"  </P> <P> By Peter Shaffer.

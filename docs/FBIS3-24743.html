The Armed Forces for the Liberation of  Angola [FALA] are teaching a lesson in northern Angola. Our  correspondent reported today that violent clashes are continuing  in Bengo Province. The battle is being fought near  Nambuangongo, where Eduardo dos Santos' troops are paying dearly  for the cowardly adventure of the Futungo de Belas man.    In the past 24 hours, the enemy suffered 73 confirmed dead,  leaving large quantities of Russian- and Brazilian-made war  materiel near the commune of (Usu). Two KrAZ trucks carrying  war materiel were captured yesterday on the (Caiengue)-(Usu)  road. Troops assigned to the forward logistics position were  completely neutralized. Also yesterday, an antitank missile was  fired at and burned a Ural vehicle carrying mercenaries of  unknown nationality.    Our correspondent cites the FALA operational commander for  the Bengo Military Region as saying that the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's military adventure is  doomed. He said the first clashes have proved FALA's combat  superiority.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Computerised sell programs push Dow lower Wall Street UNDER the weight of computerised sell programs and dividend-related technical influences, share prices struggled to gain momentum yesterday, finishing little changed at the end of an exceptionally quiet day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.78 at 2,941.64, having spent all but the last few minutes of trading in negative territory. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended slightly lower, down 0.72 at 380.08, while the Nasdaq composite of over the counter stocks closed 0.62 lower at 491.48. Turnover on the New York SE was very light at 129m shares; the quietest trading day since mid-January. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 818 to 699. The market lacked strength primarily for two reasons. There were several sell programs in early trading which knocked a few points off the leading index, and three big stocks went ex-dividend yesterday, which automatically led to a downward recalculation of the Dow. A cloud had already been cast over the market by the President's weekend heart scare. His rapid return to work helped sentiment recover, but concern about his long-term health, and doubts about the credibility of the vice-President, Mr Dan Quayle, as a potential successor to Mr Bush, left the market feeling nervous and prevented share prices from pulling away from the early losses. The three stocks that went ex-dividend yesterday were IBM, which was trading down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 103 3/8 , Union Carbide, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 18 1/4 , and Bethlehem Steel, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 14 1/2 . After months of fierce conflict, the news that NCR had finally succumbed to AT&amp;T's hostile Dollars 110-a-share all stock bid lifted the computer group's shares Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 103 3/4 , but left AT&amp;T Dollars  3/8 weaker at Dollars 37 on turnover of 1.7m shares. MCI Communications, one of the big national telephone companies, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 3/4 after the company said it would no longer handle the billing for so-called 'adult' 900-number telephone calls. American Cynamid rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63 3/8 , a new 52-week high, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch, the big broking house, increased his 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates for the company in the wake of an analysts meeting with the medical products manufacturer last Friday. Elsewhere in the health-products sector, United Healthcare, an over-the-counter stock, climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 in brisk trading after posting first quarter net profits of 54 cents a share, up from 28 cents a share a year earlier, and Healthcare Compare advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 after it reported that net income more than doubled to 19 cents a share in the first quarter of this year. Among secondary financial stocks, Midlantic Corp fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 after warning that non-performing loans would probably continue to increase in the months ahead because of the persisting difficult business conditions throughout the US. Canada OPENING lower and trading in a tight range throughout the session, Toronto share prices recouped early losses. The TSE ended off 3.62 points to close at 3487.67. Declining issues beat gainers 292 to 226 and trading volume of 15.016 fell from Friday's 20.741. Nine of fourteen subgroups lost ground. Mining, energy, consumer products, industrial products and financial services ended steady.</p>

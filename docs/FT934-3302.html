			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fife chairman accuses dissident shareholders The hostile struggle for control of Fife Indmar was stepped up yesterday when Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman of the Scottish engineering and distribution company, accused rebel shareholders of publishing misleading information. Mr Hepburn, who is fighting moves to unseat him, said a dissident circular sent to shareholders exaggerated the group's pre-tax losses and gearing, and criticised boardroom pay rises 'mischievously'. Rejecting the circular, he said claims that Charles Carpenter, a Fife subsidiary, had incurred accumulated losses of Pounds 1.2m in the two years to December 31 1992, were inflated by Pounds 905,000. Gearing in 1991, meanwhile, was 83 per cent and not 93 per cent as alleged, he added. He also told shareholders that criticism of directors' payments - which rose from Pounds 87,000 in 1988 to Pounds 255,000 last year - was unjustified because they were linked to group performance. The rebel allegations were made by Mr Charles McDonald, a current director, and Mr Guido Crolla, a Scottish businessman, who together control 10.4 per cent of the company. They aim to oust Mr Hepburn and fellow director Mr Michael Munro at an extraordinary meeting next week and become chairman and managing director respectively.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURALS AND BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> In Allan Parachini's "Panel Does a Double Take, Decides Kruger Work Is Art"  (May 2), regarding the mural proposed for the Temporary Contemporary Museum, he  describes Councilman Joel Wachs as "an activist on the City Council in favor of  ordinances to try to control the proliferation of advertising signs in Los  Angeles."  </P> <P> My personal experience with the councilman and his voting record show just the  opposite.  </P> <P> In response to my plea to control billboards, the major culprit of urban visual  pollution, he said he was against it and he voted consistently for the sign  industry: In 1986 he voted against a proposal to prohibit huge billboard  supports from overhanging buildings; in 1988 he voted against prohibiting more  billboards in Los Angeles (the proposal failed by only one vote); and in 1989  he urged the council to exempt illegal real estate signs in residential  neighborhoods from crackdowns.  </P> <P> I would be overjoyed if the councilman changed his stand on this issue.  </P> <P> TED WU, Chair, Sign Committee, Los Angeles Beautiful Inc.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DECISION SOON ON CARDINAL COACH  </P> <P> The Cardinals could be just two interviews and a day or two away from having a  new coach.  </P> <P> General Manager Larry Wilson said Monday he will interview San Francisco 49ers  offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren within the next couple of days.  </P> <P> Holmgren, the last of several possibilities on Wilson's list, couldn't be  interviewed until the Super Bowl was over. Now that the 49ers have won it, New  York Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg also will be talking with Holmgren  before Thursday.  </P> <P> For Wilson, the Holmgren meeting is probably the next to last interview. Once  that's done, he said, he'll meet with Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill "and the  rest of our people," and then a second interview with someone on his list  "could put it all together" by the end of the week.  </P></p>

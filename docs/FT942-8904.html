			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Value Trust advances Restructurings and other changes in companies within its portfolio helped Scottish Value Trust outperform its benchmark in the six months to end-March. Net asset value rose 23 per cent over the half year to 119.63p per share, easily exceeding the FT-SE-A Investment Trusts Index, up 8.2 per cent over the same period. Referring to the showing, Mr Bob Borthwick, chairman, highlighted the reconstruction of Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise Capital, which enabled the trust to realise a substantial profit on its holding of convertible loan stock and enhanced the underlying net asset value of its investment in the ordinary capital, and the restructuring and subsequent share price increase of Utility Cable, the former Baillie Gifford Technology, in which Scottish Value held a 26 per cent stake. Earnings were 1.18p; the interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.85p) and a total of 2p (1.8p) is anticipated for the full year.</p>

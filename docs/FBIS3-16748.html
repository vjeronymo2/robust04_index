			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The POSTFAKTUM agency reports that rumors are being  circulated in Moscow that on 20 March Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin urgently flew to Sochi to meet the president, that  telephones in the House of the Russian Federation Government on  Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya are receiving only incoming  calls and it is impossible to phone from the White House, and  that special purpose units were put on red alert and can enter  Moscow any minute. The source was connecting the emergence of  these rumors with the alleged aggravation of Boris Yeltsin's  health. However, in Viktor Chernomyrdin's reception office and  the Russian Federation Government press service, this  information was categorically refuted.    Answering a question by the POSTFAKTUM agency correspondent  as to whether special purpose units have been put on red alert,  a duty officer at the interior troops headquarters said that  nothing of the kind had happened and nothing of the kind is  expected.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tarmac sinks 49% to Pounds 190.7m - Sharp fall likely in current first half as property recession continues THE DEEP recession in UK and US housing and commercial property markets caused pre-tax profits at Tarmac to fall by 49 per cent, from Pounds 377m to Pounds 190.7m, last year. Sir Eric Pountain, chairman of Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, warned that profits would also fall sharply in the first half of this year. Sir Eric said January and February had been particularly bad months for UK housebuilding and construction material sales. These had been further depressed for part of that time by severe winter weather. He said it would be difficult, although not impossible, to reover the first half downturn during the final six months of the year: 'Much will depend upon the timing and the pace of recovery in the UK housing market. There has been a slight improvement in sales since interest rates started to fall in February.' said Sir Eric. The share price fell by 16p to 229p following the warning. Sir Eric said Tarmac's markets last year had been the toughest for more than a decade, reflecting the severity of the economic downturn in the UK and US. Group operating margins fell from 12.7 per cent to 7.2 per cent as sales volume and prices came under severe pressure in most divisions. Only the construction division achieved an increase in operating profits - ahead 30 per cent to Pounds 40m helped by an increase in UK road contracts. In contrast, housing profits collapsed 63 per cent from Pounds 183.5m to Pounds 67.3m. The group blamed expensive land bought in 1987 and 1988 for a sharp fall in margins. The number of houses sold slipped from just over 12,000 in 1989 to 11,209 last year. The average price of a Tarmac home had remained static at about Pounds 75,000. Sir Eric said this masked a price reduction in real terms as the group had built fewer one bedroom homes. Profits from UK quarries fell by 20 per cent to Pounds 80m. Tarmac said volume sales of aggregates and ready-mix concrete had been maintained at the expense of margins as prices had fallen. Black top sales, however, had increased reflecting the rise in road construction. Profits from sales of other building materials fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 17m. Sales of brick and aerated blocks were hit particularly hard by the decline in UK housebuilding. Industrial product profits fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 38m while commercial property profits declined by 40 per cent to Pounds 12.7m. There was no comfort in the US where profits halved from Pounds 43.7m to Pounds 20.8m. Before currency translations profits were down by 43 per cent to Dollars 40.1m. As in the UK, volume sales and prices were under pressure in many of Tarmac's US markets. Earnings per share fell from 32.3p to 16.7p leaving total dividends unchanged at 11.25p, covered 1.5 times. The final distribution is held at 8.25p. See Lex</p>

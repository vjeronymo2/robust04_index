			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The risks of euphoria Like an errant teenager, the British economy has often promised to change its ways, only to disappoint. Usually those in charge are themselves deceived, before deceiving almost everyone else. This has now become the main danger confronting the UK. As in much of the industrial world, things economic have been going increasingly well. Maybe, as economists at the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank have argued, this is the end of the inflationary era. But any policy-maker who acts on that assumption would be a fool. Fortunately, Alan Greenspan, the cautious and wily chairman of the Federal Reserve, does not fall into this category. By raising short-term interest rates a further three-quarters of a percentage point this week, he and his colleagues acted to slow the rate of expansion of the US economy to what they believed, on the best available evidence, to be its sustainable rate of economic growth. They may be wrong. But it was still the right thing to do. If a policy-maker turns out to be over-optimistic, the economy will overheat and inflation will rise to excessive levels. The costs of wringing inflation out of the system, once forward momentum has become strong, are high and in part irreversible, while the time required to do so is also long. In the UK, for example, the price paid for the 13.8 per cent expansion of the economy between 1986 and the second quarter of 1990 was almost four years of recession and slow recovery, before output finally returned to its previous peak level. Even in the third quarter of this year, GDP was only 3 per cent above its previous peak. If, however, policy had been more cautious in the late 1980s, the expansion might well have continued - or at least the subsequent downturn could have been shorter and shallower. If, for example, economic growth had averaged as little as 2 1/4 per cent a year since 1986, output this year would be 2 1/2 per cent greater than it now seems likely to be. These considerations must guide policy-makers, not least a chancellor of the exchequer framing a budget. He must not confuse the cycle with the trend. He has also to keep his head, while all around are losing theirs. Good news Certainly, almost all the news is good. Gross domestic product grew 4.2 per cent in the year to the third quarter, with 30 per cent of the expansion generated by the improvement in net exports. Notwithstanding rapid economic growth, the trade deficit on goods and services is estimated at less than 1 per cent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1994. Retail sales continue to expand at a measured pace. They were up 0.1 per cent between September and October and 3.1 over October 1993. The public sector borrowing requirement in April to October of this year is already Pounds 7.2bn less than it was last financial year. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell another 46,000 in the month to October 13, to 2.52m. It is 455,000 down from its peak in December 1992. With output per head rising 6 per cent in the three months ending September 1994, unit labour costs in manufacturing also fell by 1.4 per cent over that period. Average earnings The decline in unit labour costs partly reflects the slow rate of increase in earnings. The underlying annual increase in whole economy average earnings remained at 3 3/4 per cent in September, which is consistent with achievement of the government's inflation target of 1-2 1/2 per cent by the end of this parliament. That target has already been achieved, with retail prices, excluding mortgage interest payments, rising just 2 per cent over the year to October. This index is, in fact, no higher than in May. With broad money provisionally estimated to have expanded over the six months to October at an annualised rate of just 2.4 per cent, even monetarists will be unable to detect the smallest danger of inflation. It is always possible to find something to moan about: gross fixed capital formation declined by 1 per cent over the last quarter. In all, however, the picture is one of rapid growth with low inflation. It is possible that it will stay so. Credit growth is slow because the housing market has been flattened, partly by the decline in nominal prices during the last recession. Consequently, monetary growth has almost disappeared. The commitment to full employment is known by wage bargainers to have gone. Unions are much weaker than before, as the cavalier way they are being treated by Mr Blair's Labour Party demonstrates. Meanwhile, greater competition within the economy seems to transmit disinflationary forces into lower prices, not just into lower levels of output. Hoping that this expansion will be different - longer, stronger and, above all, less inflationary - than previous ones is reasonable. But that outcome is not certain and must not be assumed in policy. Let policy-makers position themselves to be pleasantly surprised. That way they also have the best chance of ensuring both they - and the British people - actually will be.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F> Leopoldo Fabiani; place and date not given: "Andreatta's Hope:  `Bosnia Can Be Saved'"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Excerpts] Rome -- The situation in Bosnia can now be  regarded "slightly less pessimistically," thanks mainly to the  rapprochement between the United States and Europe that enabled  NATO on 9 February to issue an ultimatum to the Serbs to lift  their siege on Sarajevo. Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta  seemed less happy about certain "toxins" that the international  situation could cause to circulate in the organism of Italian  politics. He thus described as "crazy" the ideas of those  making "territorial demands" vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia.  They include Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, who  has spoken about the "historical rights" of Italians in Istria.  Andreatta demanded peremptorily of those who have reached  electoral agreements with the National Alliance, first and  foremost of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, that they  "immediately sever any joint responsibilities." This, because  "in the event of a victory by the right, the world's governments  will perceive the most dangerous sign of a complete turnabout in  Italian foreign policy" and in the country's international  position. "I do not believe," Andreatta concluded, "that  Berlusconi likes the role of Italy's [Russian nationalistic  leader] Zhirinovskiy. He must see to this while there is still  time." [passage omitted]    [Fabiani] Minister, some people still believe that the  ultimatum issued to the Serbs will not be implemented, that  Europe will exploit any sign of amenability to refrain from  using force.    [Andreatta] To fail to honor the commitment made would  entail  a very high cost. It would jeopardize NATO's credibility far  beyond the Bosnian question. But everyone now is convinced of  the need to act. The likelihood of success has improved. Now  it is important to maintain this pace, to avoid falling back  into the swamp of unproductive diplomatic activity when  everything deteriorates, and again paying the cost to our nerves  of our action in recent months.    [Fabiani] Why are you now less [as published] optimistic or,  if you prefer, less pessimistic, about the chance of halting the  war in Bosnia?    [Andreatta] First, because of the rapprochement between the  United States and Europe. This was achieved when the French  said that their country's honor would not permit them to keep  their men in Bosnia as blue helmets without taking action. For  a moment France and the United States were close to a  confrontation. Then, faced with the threat of Paris'  withdrawing its troops, the American administration realized the  implications of a split with its allies. The diplomacy of the  Twelve also helped to persuade the Americans. This 24-handed  approach scored its first success since the Maastricht Treaty,  after several attempts. A part was also played by France's  traditional tactic of pushing its relations with Washington to  the limit. The public in the various countries, shocked by the  pictures shown in the media, also greatly influenced the  decision to take action.    [Fabiani] Will it be possible to overcome Russia's  objections?    [Andreatta] Despite Zhirinovskiy and despite the blackout in  communications with Washington that lasted a couple of days,  Russia has never sought a rupture, not even at the worst moment.  I felt this clearly when I met in Geneva with Deputy Minister  Vitaliy Churkin, and I explained to him the rationale behind the  decision that NATO was reaching at that very moment.    [Fabiani] But has anything changed between the warring  parties?    [Andreatta] Some positive signs, some more rational  attitudes, can be seen here too. The sanctions against Serbia  have not yet caused a final crisis for the government, but  economic normalization is now a serious objective for Milosevic.  And during the latest elections he has also rid himself of the  extremist nationalism represented by Seselj. The Croats felt  that Bonn's support had weakened. Tudjman now seems more  moderate. Then there are the Muslims. Within the space of a  few months a near-miracle has taken place -- the creation from  nothing of a Bosnian military force comprising 200,000 men. On  the one hand this sets back a long way the plan to totally  eliminate the Muslims, which some people were nurturing. But,  on the other hand, it could prompt the Bosnians to form too  optimistic an assessment of their own strength. But now the  Americans can recommend realistic objectives to them.    [Fabiani] What do you think of the Serbian threats of  retaliation against Italian territory?    [Andreatta] That is a problem for the Serbs. It is our  problem too, of course, but it is their problem first and  foremost. Relations between the two countries are fair. I do  not think that they could be jeopardized by some carelessness on  the part of Belgrade's secret services -- which are in fact  fairly efficient -- with respect to Serbian terrorist groups.    [Fabiani] Are you satisfied with the Italian public's  response to events in the former Yugoslavia?    [Andreatta] At present our country is threatened by the most  brazen form of videocracy. The media are no longer an  expression of public opinion but a training forum for  politicians. So there has been excessive reaction, though some  commentators well-informed about international matters have  tried to contain these reactions within more correct limits.    [Fabiani] What is your opinion of the political debate on  foreign policy matters?    [Andreatta] The territorial demands put forward by the  National Alliance raise some very serious problems concerning  the possibility of a country's continuing to be a trustworthy  partner in foreign policy. To claim "historic rights" in Istria  could prompt the same dismay in Europe as the German neo-Nazis  prompt when they talk about Sudetenland or German Silesia. I  expect Fini's allies to sever all responsibilities and to break  all electoral links too. Otherwise this creates a major  grouping that has some chance of forming a majority and  therefore of leading the country, and that embodies some crazy  ideas. We must create scope for the voters' sense of reason, so  that they will not vote for fairy stores, not vote for  "beautiful."    [Fabiani] But do Italian politicians think of citizens only  as voters?    [Andreatta] Generally, this is so. It is no coincidence that  some people want to prevent the citizens that they do not like  from expressing themselves, as in the case of postal votes for  Italians abroad.    [Fabiani] Minister, you seem to have formed an enthusiasm  for  what is a new job for you. Would you agree to stand for a  possible second term at the same ministry in the next government?    [Andreatta] I am optimistic by nature. So I can even  envisage a victory by the moderate center, however unlikely it  may seem. If that did happen, I would certainly accept.</p>

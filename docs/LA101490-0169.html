			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANGOVER LINGERS IN PARTY AFTERMATH  </P> <P> Once again South Peyton Place (a.k.a. South Pasadena) dominated the front page  of several newspapers over the past two weeks.  </P> <P> No, it's not the freeway fight.  </P> <P> There appear to have been a few skirmishes to see who's boss in a town that  involves several factions.  </P> <P> I'd like to comment on a headline in the Los Angeles Times, "No One's Satisfied  in Aftermath of Party," (Oct. 4) and the soap opera story that followed.  </P> <P> You don't have to be a bartender to know that mixing certain ingredients will  probably result in a huge hangover. One recipe for rancor on the rocks:  </P> <P> Main ingredients are young offspring of prominent and powerful families  gathered to support Bartles and Jaymes. (No, they're not political candidates!)  </P> <P> Blend in some music to serenade the neighborhood, possibly featuring "Little  John and the Bombastic Bass Belchers."  </P> <P> Add a short fuse to a longtime annoyed neighbor, who knows the police phone  number by heart.  </P> <P> Throw in a dash of one of those settlers for the stomach, "How do you spell  relief?" "P-O-L-I-C-E!"  </P> <P> Shake well, pour and gulp, then resist any temptation to conduct yourself in a  responsible manner. I hear this concoction is called "Pandora's Punch."  </P> <P> It will probably be a while before the doctor diagnoses the root cause of the  traumatic disorder and makes his findings known to the master of the house.  </P> <P> In the meantime, my Rx for the neighborhood: Take two aspirin and go to bed  until the hangover disappears. Oh yes, you could pray for rain. It keeps people  indoors and the windows shut.  </P> <P> ROBERT O. COOK  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

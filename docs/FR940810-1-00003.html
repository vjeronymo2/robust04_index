			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, airlines claim that code-sharing can help them operate more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiently, because they can spread costs by providing a joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft. Particularly in thin markets, this efficiency can increase consumers' price and service options or enable the use of equipment sized appropriately for the market. Thus, overall, the Department believes that code-sharing can offer significant economic benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code-sharing services have expanded significantly since USAir (then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allegheny Airlines) set up the first code-sharing arrangements in the 1960s. A 1986 DOT study of the regional airline industry found that code-sharing agreements were a prominent feature of the nationwide air service network. A Study of the Regional Airline Industry at 80 (May 1986). The study also found that 16 of the 20 largest regional airlines operating in the continental U.S. participated in a code-sharing agreement with a major airline. Id. at 27. The Regional Airline Association's 1993 Annual Report reported that by 1992, the largest 29 regional carriers were code-sharing, 36 of the largest 50 regional airlines had code-sharing agreements, and 96% of regional airline passengers flew on code-sharing carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, international code-shares, which have existed at least since the early 1980s, have expanded recently. Early international code-shares  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tended to involve individual routes; the more recent trend has been towards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> code-sharing agreements that involve total route systems, such as the one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between Northwest and KLM. Today, most major U.S. airlines have code-sharing agreements with foreign airlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits of Wet Leases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some airlines perform some or all of their scheduled passenger air transportation services by contracting for the equipment and crew of another carrier (wet lease). Operating by wet lease can permit such carriers to offer services that might otherwise be unavailable. The flexibility to contract with other airlines for equipment and crew to fill operational needs benefits the public by avoiding disruptions and creating service alternatives that could not otherwise be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOT Regulatory Policy and Statutory Bases <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 41712 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code (formerly &sect;411 of the Federal Aviation Act) authorizes the Department to decide if a U.S. or foreign air carrier or ticket agent (including travel agents) has engaged in unfair or deceptive practices and to ban such practices. Under that section, the Department has adopted various regulations and policies to prevent unfair or deceptive practices, such as the rules governing computer reservations systems (14 CFR Part 255) and the policy on fare advertising (14 CFR &sect;399.84).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although code-sharing and wet-leasing can afford public benefits, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can also confuse and mislead the public unless prospective travelers are aware of the arrangements before they select a flight. Current DOT policy has dealt only with code-sharing, and has been to consider the practice to be unfair and deceptive and in violation of 49 U.S.C. &sect;41712 unless consumers are given reasonable and timely notice of the existence of the code-sharing arrangement. 14 C.F.R. 399.88 (Docket No. 42199, 50 FR 38508, September 23, 1985). The policy statement expressly applies only to U.S. air carriers, however. It states that the obligation to give ``reasonable notice'' requires air carriers, at a minimum to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Identify, with an asterisk or other means, each flight in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the airline code is different from the code of the airline actually providing the service, in written or electronic schedule information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Provide information in any direct oral communication with a consumer concerning a code-sharing flight sufficient to alert the consumer that the flight will occur on an airline different from the airline whose code is shown on the ticket and identify the airline(s) actually providing the service; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) provide frequent, periodic notice in advertising media of the existence of a code-sharing relationship and the identities of the airline(s) actually providing the service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the current policy recognizes that, to be timely, notice must be given during all discussions about a code-shared flight. Consumers must be given clear notice before they make reservations or buy transportation both that the service they are considering is on a code-shared flight and of the actual operator's identity, so that they can consider these facts in making travel purchase decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When adopted, the policy statement on code-sharing disclosure was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied directly to ticket agents, since it was believed that ticket agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would communicate important information to travelers to retain them as clients. 49 FR 43709; October 31, 1984. Furthermore, section 41712 of title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 of the U.S. Code prohibits unfair and deceptive practices by ticket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents, and Department rules also prohibit ticket agents from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misrepresenting the kind or quality of service being sold. 14 CFR 399.80(c). In practice, the Department has not expressly required ticket agents to disclose code-sharing arrangements, although it would consider enforcement action against ticket agents who misrepresent code-sharing services as single-carrier services in response to specific inquiries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, since there were few code-sharing arrangements between U.S. and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign air carriers at the time of its adoption, the policy did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly cover foreign air carriers. 14 CFR 399.88. To some extent, the Department has since moved to address this matter. Specifically, when the Department approves a code-sharing arrangement involving a foreign air carrier, it now explicitly requires the foreign air carrier to adhere to the requirements of 14 CFR 399.88 as a condition of its approval. See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;35 (May 24, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINUED RESEARCH ON ARMENIAN GENOCIDE URGED BY DEUKMEJIAN  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, frustrated at modern Turkey's refusal to admit  responsibility for the massacre of Armenians in 1915, exhorted scholars  Thursday to persevere in documenting research so no one can deny that the  "genocide was anything but a stark reality."  </P> <P> The son of immigrant parents and the nation's most prominent officeholder of  Armenian ancestry, Deukmejian is passionate about the Armenian genocide issue  and recognition of it by the United States.  </P> <P> He lashed out at "present-day Turkish officials and certain revisionist  historians" who he said have labeled as "forgeries" and "wartime propaganda"  documentation of the mass slayings by Western observers.  </P> <P> "In essence, they deny that there ever was such a thing as an Armenian  genocide," Deukmejian said in a speech to a symposium on the Armenian massacres  at Cal State Sacramento.  </P> <P> The conference attracted university professors from throughout the United  States, Canada, Austria and Greece.  </P> <P> "That is why competent, professional research is so important," he told the  standing-room-only crowd. "The world community is entitled to thoroughly  researched and overwhelmingly documented facts that no one can dispute that the  Armenian genocide was anything but a stark reality."  </P> <P> Under former President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. State Department repeatedly  lobbied successfully against legislation that would declare a national day of  remembrance for the approximately 1.5 million Armenians slain at the hands of  the Ottoman Turks or deported to the deserts starting in April, 1915.  </P> <P> The measure was strongly opposed by Turkey, a key NATO ally, which warned that  approval could damage U.S.-Turkish relations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reagan Policy  </P> <P> During the last presidential campaign, then-Vice President George Bush  indicated that he was not bound by the Reagan policy and told the American  Armenian Assembly that as President, "I would join Congress in commemorating  the victims of that period."  </P> <P> Deukmejian was asked after his speech what steps the Bush Administration had  taken so far to recognize the genocide. He replied, "No official acts have been  taken that I'm aware of."  </P> <P> He said he believed that the Bush Administration is still in the process of  developing a foreign policy, but "we will make sure our view is heard" on the  genocide issue when the time is right.  </P> <P> In his speech, Deukmejian noted that in addition to American, British and  French reports of a 1915 Turkish policy of genocide against Armenians, German  diplomats made similar observations. At the time, Germany was an ally of  Turkey.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said one piece of research disclosed that Baron von Wangenheim,  German ambassador to Turkey in 1915, wrote that it was obvious "that the  banishment of the Armenians is due not solely to military considerations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Internal Enemies'  </P> <P> "Talaat Bey, the minister of the interior, has quite frankly said . . . the  Turkish government intended to make use of the World War and deal thoroughly  with its internal enemies, the (Armenian) Christians in Turkey, and that it  meant not to be disturbed in this by diplomatic intervention from abroad," the  ambassador wrote.  </P> <P> His successor, Count Wolff Metternich, reported in a 1916 cable to his  superiors that it was Turkey's objective to "resolve its Armenian question by  the destruction of the Armenian race." He said the Turkish government "has  refused to be deterred."  </P> <P> "We owe it to all those who perished on the burning desert many years ago to  ensure that the world always remembers what happened," Deukmejian told the  conference. "Only by doing so will the world have a chance to prevent a  repetition of a similar tragedy."  </P> <P> Richard G. Hovannisian, a renowned scholar on Armenian and Near Eastern history  at UCLA, said the purpose of the conference, in part, was to draw together new  research into the Armenian genocide and make it available to school students,  so that the so-called "forgotten genocide" would not be forgotten.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Letter: Still a place in the market for credit card Sir, Your suggestion that credit cards are likely to be replaced by debit cards (FT Survey of credit and charge cards, July 15) is not borne out by the facts. The UK credit card market is clearly a mature market and unlikely to repeat the high rates of growth seen in the 1980s. Nevertheless, the use of credit cards continues to grow. While the introduction of annual fees by most issuers has reduced the number of cards in issue, there is no evidence that it has reduced the number of card-holders. The value of payments made by credit card was Pounds 12.67bn in the first five months of 1992, 7 per cent higher than in the same period in 1991. In comparison, the debit card market is a growth market. The value of debit card payments almost doubled between 1990 and 1991. However, it still has a long way to go before it catches up with the credit card market. The amount spent on credit cards was three times the amount spent on debit cards last year. Most consumers see debit cards as a replacement for cheques and cash and complementary to credit cards, this being reflected in different patterns of spending. The average credit card spend is Pounds 45 compared with Pounds 27 on a debit card. Elizabeth Phillips, director, Credit Card Research Group, 2 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AA</p>

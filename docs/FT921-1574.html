			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Postal votemay swing marginals LABOUR claimed victory in the race for the postal vote as registration closed yesterday. More than 20,000 students have registered to vote Labour by post in marginal constituencies where they study, according to the National Organisation of Labour students. The Conservatives said they had no figures for the total number of Tory postal voters since campaigns to register them are organised locally. Evidence from town halls is mixed and not all votes have yet been counted. In Cambridge, where Conservative MP Mr Robert Rhodes James is retiring with a majority of 560, the number of postal voters has doubled to 5,000, about 7 per cent of the electorate. Disabled people, travelling workers, holidaymakers and students at home during vacations can all apply for postal votes. The total number of postal electors in 1987 was 907,725, about 2 per cent of the total vote.</p>

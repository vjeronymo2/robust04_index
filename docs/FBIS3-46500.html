The vcci president said in 1993 the VCCI  admitted 262 more members, including 56 associated ones who are  foreign businesses having opened branches or representative  offices in Vietnam, and joint ventures between Vietnam and  foreign countries. It was the first time VCCI welcomed foreign  businesses to join VCCI.    VCCI established relationships and signed cooperation  agreements with commerce chambers and trade promotion  organizations in 11 countries. It also set up seven commissions  or councils specializing in bilateral cooperations with foreign  countries, and promoted existing ties with some international  and non-governmental organizations. Moreover, Doan Duy Thanh  added, the VCCI arranged, the visits of nearly 10,000 business  delegations from 52 countries to Vietnam and those of 20  delegations consisting of about 1,000 Vietnamese businessmen  abroad to study foreign outlets and inquire into the  possibilities for trade and investment. Six major exhibition  fairs were held within the country in addition to two others  abroad under the auspices of the VCCI. VCCI has provided legal  and bussiness consultancy for businessmen to help them work out  business deals and investment projects as well as settle  disputes in external and internal relations. Sixteen  professional-training courses were opened for more than 1,200  businessmen from various VCCI members. More than 40,000 sets of  certificates on origin of export commodities were granted to  Vietnam's businesses, helped 1,600 labels to be registered,  provided industrial protection to 27 industrial designs and 57  inventions. On VCCI's plans for 1994, Mr. Thanh said the  chamber should pay more attention to membership expansion,  especially to the small and medium-sized busimessmen in all  ecomomic sectors. A centre would be set up by VCCI to assist  small and medium-sized businesses in finance, management and  marketting. Eight international exhibition fairs are expected  to be held in Vietnam next year complete with four or five  others in Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea, to introduce  Vietnam's export goods and foreign investment-calling projects.</p>

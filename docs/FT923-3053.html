			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Germany offered to cut rates a week earlier GERMANY offered to cut its interest rates in return for a realignment of European currencies more than a week before the deal was finally done, according to senior officials in Bonn and Frankfurt. However, agreement was delayed by the refusal of other members of the European exchange rate mechanism to go ahead with the realignment, they said yesterday. Both Britain and France wanted the Bundesbank to cut its interest rates unilaterally. 'It was the Germans who initiated the whole process,' according to one well-placed official. 'We tried even before Bath (where the European Community Finance Ministers had their informal meeting on September 6), indicating that we were ready to do something on the interest rate front, providing our partners would come to grips with their domestic economic decisions. 'But in Bath the time still was not ripe.' According to the officials, the Bundesbank was not prepared to act on interest rates unless there was prior agreement on a realignment. 'An interest rate cut in isolation would have indicated that the Bundesbank was giving in, and have no effect on the markets,' according to the official, who declined to be identified. 'Talks had been going on for some time, and at several levels,' according to another senior official. 'In the end, the market forced the pace.' The delay in reaching agreement may well have been because the Bundesbank wanted a much broader realignment of currencies than simply one affecting the lira, other sources said. They believe that such a realignment would have involved a devaluation of sterling - but the British government refused to give way. Officials in the Bundesbank did believe that a sterling devaluation was required by the market, although other officials said they recognised the strength of British arguments against any adjustment. In the end, the flood of speculative money from Italy into Germany last week forced the Bundesbank to act without such a realignment. On the German side, the deal was put together by a triangle of key officials: Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the deputy president of the Bundesbank; Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary for finance; and Mr Johannes Ludewig, economic adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A key factor in the process was heavy political pressure from the French government to cut interest rates in advance of next Sunday's referendum on Maastricht, thus persuading French voters that Germany was prepared to act in the 'European' interest. German officials expressed surprise that the currency markets believed a realignment would come only after the French referendum. 'There was no way we could wait until September 21,' according to one. 'If the French got any more pessimistic in the opinion polls, it would have caused havoc in the market.'</p>

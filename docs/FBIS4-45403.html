			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Phillip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Briton Gave Me </F> Drugs, Gregory Tells Thai Court"]    [Text] Sandra Gregory told a Bangkok court yesterday she  tried to smuggle heroin out of Thailand to pay for her air fare  home to Britain and to settle medical bills.    The 29-year-old teacher said Robert Lock, 28, a fellow  Briton, brought the drugs to her guest house on the day of the  flight.    "He told me it was heroin and he told me to conceal it  inside  myself," she said.    Gregory, who told the judge she had dengue fever, admits  possessing 87g of heroin at Bangkok's Don Muang international  airport on Feb 5, 1993.    Lock, from Cambridge, had paid her &pound;1,000 to take the  drugs to Japan for him, said Gregory, from Sowerby Bridge, West  Yorks.    "When we got to the airport I was approached at the  check-in.  The policeman pointed to Robert and asked if I came with him, I  said yes.    "They took us to an office and started searching us. They  took X-rays and let us go.    "I still had the heroin inside me when I went to the bank to  change some money," she said. "But I was followed by a woman  police officer with a radio.    "They arrested us again and said I had a problem with my  X-ray. I admitted everything and produced the drugs.    "When Robert was brought into the interview room, I told him  I had admitted it. He turned to me and said, `You admit it  yourself. I'm not going to. You've done your job badly.'"    Lock, who insists there is no evidence against him, is  expected to enter the witness box on June 24.    In the past his lawyer has sought to highlight alleged  inconsistencies in Gregory's evidence.    He was not carrying any heroin when he was arrested as he  checked in for a flight to Tokyo, and denied a charge of  trafficking.    The court has been told that Thai customs had received a tip  from the British Embassy to watch out for Lock, although the  official who allegedly made the telephone call has not responded  to a prosecution summons.    Speaking later from her holding cell, Gregory said she had  found a companion in Patricia Hussain, 29, a Briton, who was  arrested last month on drugs charges.    Hussain, from Manchester, is accused of possessing 7kg of  heroin, and is also being held in the Women's Correctional  Institution in the Thai capital.    "We are like chalk and cheese, but we are getting on great,"  said Gregory.    Lock, breaking a 15-month silence, expressed gratitude to  people in Britain who had sent letters of support.    He also thanked the organisation Prisoners Abroad for  sending  him &pound;25 a month for food. "The food they give us is  inedible," he said. "It has cockroaches in it sometimes. I have  to buy everything I eat."    He receives the equivalent of &pound;15 a year for working  in  the prison timberyard. Gregory works at the bakery.</p>

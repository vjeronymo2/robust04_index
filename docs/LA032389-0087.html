			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATE ARMEN SARAFIAN REMEMBERED WIDELY;  </P> <P> EDUCATOR'S TOUCH MADE SOME LASTING IMPRINTS  </P> <P> The day after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968,  some students gathered in front of the Pasadena City College cafeteria and  threatened to storm it.  </P> <P> That was the tenor of the times when Armen Sarafian, a distinguished San  Gabriel Valley educator who died recently after a heart attack, was president  of the college. In 1976, he had told an interviewer from The Times: "They were  at a mob tension level."  </P> <P> Sarafian, who always maintained a deeply personal touch with students  throughout his 42-year career, confronted the would-be demonstrators.  </P> <P> "One told me they were so full of grief that they had to relieve it by helping  themselves to the food," he said. "Another yelled, and I can still hear it,  'I'm willing to die or go to jail but I have to do this!' That showed me how  symbolic this was."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helped Students  </P> <P> But Sarafian was unrelenting. Taking food without paying for it? That would be  a misuse of public funds, he told the students. But he understood their  anguish, he quickly added.  </P> <P> "I feel so terribly full of grief, let's go in together and share the grief,  and I'll pay for it," he told them.  </P> <P> The students filed into the cafeteria, took food and drinks and, after a  cashier toted up the bill, Sarafian dished out about $200.  </P> <P> The incident is often cited as an example of the uncanny ability of Sarafian, a  former president of the University of La Verne and a former member of the State  Board of Education, to turn problematic situations into positive ones.  "Conflict resolution," Garbis Der Yeghiayan, president of the American Armenian  International College in La Verne, calls it.  </P> <P> "When there were problems, he felt them before they even arose," said Der  Yeghiayan.  </P> <P> Although the King assassination touched off bloody disturbances all across the  country, the Pasadena incident became the impetus for the creation of a fund to  assist economically deprived minority students. The first money to go into the  Martin Luther King scholarship fund came from black students who subsequently  apologized to Sarafian and insisted on reimbursing him for their lunches.  </P> <P> Teacher, administrator, college president, member of the State Board of  Education, education innovator, Armen Sarafian died March 11 at 69 after  suffering a massive cardiac arrest while attending the Big West Conference  basketball tournament at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> Sarafian, a longtime Pasadena resident, was there to root for his friend,  University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Coach Jerry Tarkanian, whose team beat New  Mexico State for the conference championship.  </P> <P> Tarkanian, who coached at Pasadena City College between 1966 and 1968, was one  of many who said they had felt Sarafian's personal magnetism. "He was like a  second father," said a stunned Tarkanian after Sarafian's death. "He talked to  me before the game. And he said he'd see me afterward. He knew my mother and  father. We've been close for 50 years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ex-La Verne President  </P> <P> Besides his 11-year tenure as college president, Sarafian put in nine years as  president of the University of La Verne, where he founded the American Armenian  International College in 1976. At both Pasadena and La Verne, he was credited  with turning ailing institutions into healthy educational centers.  </P> <P> Born in Van Nuys of Armenian immigrant parents, Sarafian earned his bachelor's  degree magna cum laude at La Verne College, where his father, Turkish-born  Kevork Sarafian, was head of the foreign languages department.  </P> <P> Sarafian earned his master's at Claremont Graduate School and his Ph.D at USC.  </P> <P> By the end of his presidency at Pasadena, where Sarafian had begun teaching in  1947, the school's enrollment had doubled. While there, Sarafian was the  driving force for the Southern California Consortium for Community College  Television, an alliance of 18 colleges that first brought instructional  television to the region.  </P> <P> "What other people saw as dreaming blue skies, he put into action," said David  Ledbetter, Pasadena's assistant superintendent for instructional services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father's Dream  </P> <P> Under Sarafian's guidance, La Verne evolved from a small liberal arts college  near financial collapse to a university that had achieved both financial  solvency and academic respect. It had been the dream of Sarafian's father to  build an Armenian college in La Verne, said Der Yeghiayan. "Armen turned it  into a reality," he said. "That made a big difference in his decision to come  to La Verne and accept the presidency."  </P> <P> In recent years, despite his complaint in 1984 that he was "tired of  presidenting," Sarafian had served as interim president of Colorado Mountain  College and interim chancellor of Peralta Community College District in  Oakland.  </P> <P> He also became deeply involved in fund raising for Armenian studies. A trip to  Armenia in 1984 was a revelation to him, said Der Yeghiayan. "He had not spoken  Armenian in 60 years, but he was carrying on conversations in Armenian," said  Der Yeghiayan. "He was so proud to be visiting the motherland for the first  time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unobtrusive Style  </P> <P> Sarafian's style as an educator was unobtrusive. "He was one of those people  who did things in a silent, efficient way," said U.S. District Judge Dickran  Tevrizian, a fellow member of the Pasadena Armenian-American community. "You  never read in the newspaper that Armen Sarafian had done such-and-such. It was  always Pasadena City College. He did things not by the use of his name but by  the use of the institution."  </P> <P> But the college president never got so engrossed in institutional details that  he forgot about people, friends and colleagues say.  </P> <P> "He wasn't a William Jennings Bryan orator," said Bill Goldmann, Pasadena's  dean of education services. "But he communicated his interest and concern."  </P> <P> Goldmann was a social science teacher at the college (then Pasadena Junior  College) when he became the object of Sarafian's unsolicited generosity.  </P> <P> "He arranged a scholarship for me to study economics at the Claremont Graduate  School," he said. "Knowing about a person's needs or desires and then doing  something about them -- they're really light years apart."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Encouraged Escalante  </P> <P> Bolivian-born Jaime Escalante, the inspirational math teacher at Garfield High  School who became the subject of the movie "Stand and Deliver," recalled  Sarafian's encouragement when, as a Pasadena City College student, he was  struggling with English.  </P> <P> "There was a class called 'American Institutions,' which was a required  course," Escalante said. "The teacher said I didn't have enough English to  perform, and he suggested that I drop the class."  </P> <P> Sarafian, hearing of Escalante's difficulties, called him into his office. "He  told me not to give up so easily," Escalante said. "They were beautiful words  of encouragement."  </P> <P> Despite having enough honorary degrees to fill a book and having been appointed  to state-level panels, there were some honors that Sarafian resisted. When it  was suggested in 1976 that Pasadena City College name its new paramedic  sciences building after him, he strongly opposed the idea.  </P> <P> "It is far better to name buildings for what they contain and offer, rather  than to worry about names," he said. "I certainly don't want to saddle people  with an unpronounceable name and one they can't spell."  </P></p>

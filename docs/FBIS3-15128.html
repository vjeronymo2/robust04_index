In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Livshits said that the main  task facing the team is to analyse the effects of the economic  policy, which was ignored by former First Deputy Prime Minister  Yegor Gaydar. Experts will try to anticipate events by  analysing possible negative consequences of proposed decisions  and measures.    Like Gaydar, Livshits is a determined monetarist. His thesis  on the theoretical principles of "Reaganomics" won him a degree  of doctor of economics. In 1990 he wrote "introduction to a  market economy", the first textbook of the kind in Russia.  Before his transfer to the presidential analytical centre two  years ago, Livshits headed the department of economic theory at  the Moscow Machine Tool Engineering Institute.    Observers believe that Livshits will become the president's  eye to monitor the pace of reform in Russia.    Livshits plans to work in close cooperation with Sergey  Glazyev who heads the State duma committee for economic policy.  He said the deputies welcomed Yeltsin's state-of-the-nation  address. This provides a good basis for joint work of two  branches of power in the economic sphere, Livshits said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS believes it is possible to conduct directed fishing on species other than bluefin, with only a limited amount of bluefin bycatch. However, if evidence indicates this is not true, NMFS may consider more stringent measures, such as area or season closures or gear restrictions, in future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Adjust the Longline Incidental Catch Boundary Line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to move the 36 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;N. latitude line that separates the northern and southern longline fisheries to 34 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;N. latitude. Several comments were received requesting such a change. A traditional longline fishing area off Cape Hatteras straddles the current line at 36 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;N. latitude. The current boundary, which is a very dynamic oceanographic regime, creates a problem because of the uncertainty of drifts in the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies and currents that occur in the area. Fishermen may take bluefin in an open area and drift to a closed area, whereupon they are not able to land these fish because of the prohibition on capture, retention, possession, and offloading of bluefin when an area is closed to fishing. NMFS believes adjustment of the boundary line to 34 <!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong --> &cir;N. latitude is appropriate because this a less dynamic oceanographic environment close to shore with the Florida Current located further offshore. This modification should reduce waste of fish and enforcement problems in this area without increasing bluefin mortality. The total bluefin quotas for the northern and southern management areas for incidental longline catch would remain unchanged by this adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments Regarding the Use of Curved Length Measurements of Bluefin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to amend the regulations to include definitions of straight fork length, and curved fork length and to clarify that straight length is the sole criterion for determination of bluefin tuna size class. Additionally, NMFS proposes to amend the regulatory text regarding dealer reporting to clarify the existing requirements to report weights and lengths of bluefin tuna purchased from fishermen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the size classes for bluefin are based on straight lengths (lengths taken along a straight line between lines perpendicular to the body). If proper equipment is used, straight length provides a more accurate measurement for bluefin than curved length (lengths taken along the curvature of the body) because of short-term variations in the girth of the fish as a result of recent feeding rates. Frequently, however, calipers or similar instruments are not available for measuring the straight length of bluefin. Measurements are often reported as curved length taken with a tape measure held along the body of the fish. Illegal fish may be retained when commercial fishermen and recreational anglers use curved length instead of straight length for determination of size classes and enforcement actions have resulted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is not proposing to define size classes in terms of curved length at this time. However, after analysis of length data is completed, NMFS could amend the size-class definitions to make curved length an acceptable criterion for determination of bluefin tuna size class. NMFS requests comments on the use of curved length in conjunction with, or in place of, straight length for determining size classes of bluefin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments Regarding Additional Means To Provide Notice of Fishery Closures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current regulations, closures are announced via notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , with the closures generally effective some time after filing the notice. Fishermen who do not have access to these notices may consult NMFS weekly catch reports, consult notices issued over the highly migratory species fax network, listen for updates on NOAA weather radio, or call 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347 or 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260 for current information. NMFS received comments during the 1993 fishing season that sufficient notice was not provided for all closures. While existing regulations do not require advance notice of closure, NMFS recognizes the importance of making every effort to notify the affected public as far in advance as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although NMFS endeavors to provide advance notice, quota monitoring is difficult when allowable catch levels are small relative to the level of fishing effort. Based on current and historical catch rates, NMFS attempts to project when quotas are likely to be reached for all fishing categories. While the overriding concern is to maintain catch within each category's quota, it is also important that NMFS afford the maximum economic benefits to be gained from full use of allocated quotas. Unfortunately, reliance on projected catch figures may result in premature closures or short notification periods. Given the increasingly restrictive bluefin quotas in years 1995 and beyond, NMFS anticipates that quota monitoring and notification of closures will become even more difficult. NMFS requests comments on alternative means to provide notice of closures so as to minimize disruption to fishing activities and allow participants to plan accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

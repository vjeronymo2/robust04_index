			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Gilts: Prices stalled by concerns over next auction GILT prices moved sideways in volatile trading as the market found little stimulus to higher prices. A dominant concern was that the next gilt auction, scheduled for May 26, will force up yields. With a rush of figures this week about the UK economy, many investors were chary of doing much buying and selling of gilts. The Danish referendum tomorrow on Maastricht and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday - which some believe will decide on another cut in interest rates - added to the sense of nervousness. This month's auction is likely to be of a further Pounds 3bn or so of stock, in the 10-15 year maturity range, with further details being announced tomorrow. At the same time, the Bank will publish its latest quarterly report on inflation, which is expected to comment in detail on monetary developments of recent months and the fact that pressures on prices may be starting to re-appear on fragile signs of recovery. In recent weeks, the Bank's regional agents - a network of people around Britain who report once a month to Bank officials in London about economic trends - have indicated that more companies are keen to pass on to customers rising costs arising from wages and materials. This trend is seen in the Bank as worrying and underlining the need for caution in handling any possible adjustments in interest rates in the coming months. There has been some satisfaction at the Bank at the relatively good reception among small, retail investors for gilts in recent weeks. Even so, a great deal of optimism is needed to believe that the Pounds 50bn or so of gilts which the Bank will probably need to sell during the current financial year will find ready buyers. The chances are that prices will come down, particularly at the long end of the market where it is thought yields might rise in anticipation. The auction next week could be as high as Pounds 3.5bn, according to some theories, in which case a new bout of anxiety may be triggered among investors thinking that the Pounds 50bn guestimate for official gilt sales is on the low side. With auctions arriving at the rate of one a month, some in the gilt market have been trying to make the case that the Bank should have decided on a policy of having one auction every two months, in which case there would have been longer periods in which the market could have traded free from auction jitters. That option has been considered by the Bank but ruled out on the grounds that the large volume of stock - up to Pounds 7bn or Pounds 8bn a time - would have been far too much stock for the gilt market to absorb with comfort. Attention this week will focus on the latest UK unemployment data, which is due to be released on Thursday. The consensus forecast for a rise of 15,000 last month reflects the widespread scepticism that unemployment has turned the corner so early in a recession, with many dismissing the seasonally adjusted falls in February and March as freak results. The consensus is that the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index last month will turn out to be 1.5 per cent or, excluding mortgage interest payments, up 3.1 per cent on the year. These details are due to be announced on Friday. The economic data this week follow the generally encouraging inflation figures from last week, which showed that prices of raw materials and fuel purchased by UK manufacturing industry rose by 7.2 per cent in the 12 months to April, compared with a rise of 8.4 per cent in the year to March. The output prices index - the prices of manufactured products as they leave the factory gates - rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to April, compared with 3.7 per cent in the year to March. This trend continues to give the impression that rising prices are not a pressing problem. Although the figures added some life to the gilt market, prices fell back later in the week, partly because worse than expected inflation data from the US unsettled bond markets on Wall Street.</p>

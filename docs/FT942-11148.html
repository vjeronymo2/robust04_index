			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE regains 3,100 as dollar tensions relax - Market report The absence of further devel-opments in the US dollar left the London stock market to stage a technical recovery yesterday which took the FT-SE 100 Index back above the 3,100 mark as UK voters went to the polls in the local elections. The day was enlivened by good trading figures, an increased dividend from British Petroleum and a Pounds 65m deal in Reuters as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority lightened its stake in the global financial communications group. The equity rally was helped by a recovery in British government bonds and in sterling, but analysts took a restrained view of the 35.5-point gain in the FT-SE 100 to a close of 3,106, just a shade below the day's best level. The market fell by 14 Footsie points in early trading but this appeared to be a reflection of the Reuters deal. The US investment bank handling the business was believed to have sold the June stock index future first as insurance against the possible effects of the transaction in Reuters stock. Once this deal was done, the US house bought back the futures contracts and the underlying market turned higher. The sharp rise in BP shares caught some securities traders wrong-footed and the trading screens briefly showed a backwardation - when some marketmaker bid and offer quotations are briefly out of line - as at least two US houses battled to change portfolio stances on the stock. Higher dividend payouts from both BP and Bank of Scotland reinforced optimism on corporate earnings and gave the market a significant boost. Later, as it became clear that the central banks had no immediate plans for further moves to support the US dollar, tensions relaxed and shares moved up smartly. London was helped at the close by initial firmness on Wall Street, although analysts warned that the US payroll data, due today, could present the Federal Reserve with a further opportunity to tighten credit. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 12.9 to 3,770.6. Seaq volume of 688.5m shares was some 20 per cent up from Wednesday's figure which, in turn, reflected retail business worth Pounds 1.22bn, at the lower end of recent daily averages. The blue chip sectors were boosted by the oil majors, which are heavily weighted in all leading market indices. Elsewhere, the share price gains were more scattered, with many of the best performances coming from stocks which had suffered the most over the past two weeks. The pharmaceutical sector, where the multinational leaders are undergoing a spree of acquisition moves sparked by moves into the US by some European groups, reported a calmer session yesterday. Firmness in UK bonds, which have clearly shown this week that they can still upset the equity sector, provided an underpinning for the recovery trend. But doubts were expressed as to whether the US dollar has yet stabilised and analysts admitted that stock markets remained highly vulnerable to the next move to tighten credit policy at the Federal Reserve. Such a move is widely expected at some time in the near future and the timing could now depend on the dollar. Meanwhile, the UK equity market will watch sterling today to see the effects of the outcome of the local elections.</p>

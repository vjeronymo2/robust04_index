This amendment revises certain inspections required by the existing AD, and requires additional inspections and structural modifications. This amendment is prompted by reports of recent incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's determination that long term continued operational safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe rather than repetitive inspections. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective April 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;51&hyph;035, Revision 1, dated December 16, 1991, as revised by L&hyph;1011 Service Bulletin Change Notification 093&hyph;51&hyph;035, R1&hyph;CN1, dated October 27, 1992, as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incorporation by reference of Lockheed Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 093&hyph;51&hyph;035, dated June 28, 1990, as listed in the regulations, was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 22, 1991 (56 FR 6556, February 19, 1991). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Lockheed Western Export Company (LWEC), Dept. 693, Zone 0755, 86 South Cobb Drive, Marietta, Georgia 30063.

The action proposed to require certain structural modifications and inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggests that any new requirements or changes to AD's that address ``collector'' service bulletins (CSB) should be issued as new AD's, rather than supersedures of ``old'' AD's. The commenter suggests further that a ``collector'' AD should be issued annually to address any changes or additions to CSB's. The commenter believes that this proposed procedure would ease administrative and financial burdens to operators, particularly in the case of AD's that address CSB's, such as the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur. The FAA's normal policy is to supersede an ``old'' AD by removing it from the system and adding a new AD in a case where substantive requirements must be added to the ``old'' AD. The FAA has determined that the changes made to the original issue of the CSB addressed in this AD are substantive, since changes have been made to certain accomplishment procedures and some new requirements have been added. The FAA finds that issuance of a supersedure is appropriate in this case to include those new or revised requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests that the FAA conduct a thorough review of AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 91&hyph;05&hyph;05 and this proposed rule to eliminate any references to service bulletins that are addressed in other existing AD's. The commenter contends that there is no justification for requiring operators to perform duplicate inspections and that such requirements are confusing to operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to eliminate references to service bulletins addressed in this AD that are also addressed in other existing AD's. The FAA recognizes that certain service bulletins addressed in this AD have also been the subject of other existing AD's. However, the FAA has included references to such service bulletins in this AD only to require that operators accomplish those actions that will terminate the repetitive inspections required by other existing AD's. The FAA has also been informed by Lockheed of the necessity to revise Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;51&hyph;035 (referred to in this AD as the Collector Service Bulletin (CSB)) to fully address the required terminating actions for all affected airplanes. Subsequently, the FAA may consider further rulemaking to require that action be taken in accordance with that revised CSB; any duplicate requirements would then be eliminated by rescinding any existing AD's that address those duplicate requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggest that the contents of the second ``NOTE'' in paragraph (d) of the proposal should appear in the final rule as two separate paragraphs, one to exclude the first three service bulletins cited and a second to exclude the fourth service bulletin. One of the commenters asks if a ``NOTE'' has legal status in an AD. Another commenter states that the actions described in the first three service bulletins should have been excluded from this AD, since such an exclusion appeared in AD 91&hyph;05&hyph;05.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Volex at Pounds 3.7m as it repositions VOLEX, the specialist wiring and connection systems company, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 3.68m for the year to March 31, a period of 'strategic repositioning of the group's products and its markets'. In July it sold the loss-making Volex Accessories division to Hanson for an initial Pounds 8.8m. In January it gained access to both the data cable assemblies business and the US market with the acquisition of Cable Products for an initial Pounds 8.1m and maximum Pounds 14.6m. Mr Howard Poulson, chief executive, said he was pleased with Cable's results so far. The group also decided to change the emphasis of Volex Wiring Systems, the wiring harness company, over the next two years away from the high volume car production market and towards the higher margin markets of the commercial, agricultural and specialist vehicle industries. The company started production on a contract for John Deere, and Mr Poulson hoped this would be a 'foothold' with the US tractors group. Buoyed by a rise in exports to 40 per cent of sales, Pencon emerged as the group's best performer. It also received a fillip from the government's decision to introduce safety legislation to make compulsory in the UK the fitting of plugs, and moulded plugs where appropriate, to electrical appliances. Over the year Volex turned borrowings of Pounds 5m into cash of Pounds 5.5m and Mr Poulson said he was looking to expand the Cable Products side with an acquisition on the west coast of the US, and to expand Pencon. Group exports have grown from 15 per cent two years ago to 30 per cent now. Turnover fell 16 per cent to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 97.3m) and operating profits were down by a little less than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.77m. However this was boosted by investment income of Pounds 443,000 and lower interest charges of Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 477,000). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.53m related to provisions for the withdrawal from the car sector. Earnings dropped to 14.9p (17.9p) and the final dividend is maintained at 10.5p for an unchanged total of 17p.</p>

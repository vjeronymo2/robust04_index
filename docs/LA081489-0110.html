			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPURS WORRIED DRAFT CHOICE WILL BE DRAFTED  </P> <P> The Yugoslav army's drafting of Los Angeles Lakers Vlade Divac has the San  Antonio Spurs a bit concerned about what will happen to their own player from  that nation, Zarko Paspalj.  </P> <P> Both Divac and Paspalj starred on the Yugoslav national team. The Lakers signed  Divac, who has been ordered to report to active military duty by Sept. 19. The  Spurs signed Paspalj to a two-year contract on July 27.  </P> <P> "Sure we're concerned," Spurs President Gary Woods said. "We've always known  that Yugoslavia could draft the players into the army.  </P> <P> "The players get a deferment from military service if they are playing in their  own country, but we've been aware that they could be put into the service if  they left the country," he said.  </P> <P> Yugoslavs are obligated to serve one year in the army and are eligible to be  drafted until age 28. Paspalj is 23.  </P> <P> Paspalj has been working with the Yugoslav consulate in Chicago to complete the  necessary paper work to obtain a deferment from military obligation. He says he  is not worried.  </P> <P> "I think this is not a problem," Paspalj said. "I must do my military service,  but I can do it in three or four years.  </P> <P> "I don't think this is a problem for any of us (Yugoslav players in the United  States). I think it is mostly a reporter's story.  </P> <P> "I talked to Vlade (Saturday) night, and he said it is not true. He says he  will serve in the army but not for a few years. He will play for the Lakers."  </P></p>

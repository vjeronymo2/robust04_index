			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / US worries about food aid resources US RELIEF experts are worried that food aid resources, much of which have gone to help the former Soviet Union, will be stretched too thin by the emerging threat of starvation in drought-hit southern Africa, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We're getting nervous about our other programmes around the world, if they have to take food from other programmes to feed Africa,' Mr Frank Catania of the Save the Children Federation said. The US Agriculture Department has enough food to 'meet currently known US response needs,' but if the southern Africa drought persists or another calamity develops, some aid programmes might have to be trimmed,it says.</p>

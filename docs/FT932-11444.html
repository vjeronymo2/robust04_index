			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Matif to list on Globex THE Matif, the French futures exchange, will list its French government bond futures and options contracts on Globex, the after-hours trading system, on May 13, writes Tracy Corrigan. The launch of the so-called 'notionnel' contract, the world's second-largest interest rate contract, was postponed in March due to intermittent disconnections of Globex screens in Paris, but this problem has now been largely solved by Reuters, the service provider, according to the Matif. Euroclear and Cedel, the two European clearing houses, have set a new target date of September 17 for the implementation of the electronic bridge - the mechanism by which settlement is exchanged between the two systems. They will miss a June deadline due to further delays in testing. The new bridge is expected to save the market between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m a year.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Roche seeks to assure investors on Syntex bid Roche, the leading Swiss pharmaceutical group, claimed yesterday that Syntex, the US drugs group for which it launched an agreed Dollars 5.3bn bid last week, would be an 'optimal addition' to the group. It said the cost of financing the takeover would not dilute its earnings. The price of Roche's non-voting securities has fallen about 7 per cent since the bid was announced, reflecting investors' worries about the offer price - 59 per cent above the pre-bid market capitalisation - and potential dilution. Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, said yesterday that he assumed dilution would be avoided. 'We expect to see another increase in group income (in 1994). In making this forecast, I have taken our offer to the Syntex shareholders into account.' Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said Roche would decide on exactly how to finance the deal only when and if the tender was successfully completed. He said the group had shown its ability to use innovative devices, such as bull spreads and knock-out warrants, to finance previous large acquisitions on favourable terms. Roche officials also pointed out that the group had SFr14.6bn (Dollars 10.4bn) in liquid funds at the end of last year, enabling it to raise money on the finest terms. Syntex is expected to achieve net earnings of about Dollars 380m in the year to July 1994. Mr Gerber said Syntex's well-established clinical research unit would enable Roche to develop products more quickly, and that its 'interesting products' in the research pipeline would add to Roche's own core areas. He said Roche would not follow recent moves by rivals Merck and SmithKline Beecham to acquire drug distributors. He was leery of diversifications, and said Roche was fully-occupied with research and development and confident of its strengths.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies Vice President Alfonso  Ferrufino said yesterday that the use of violence as a method to  fight the illegal drug trade has failed and now the United  States must leave Bolivia alone to design its own antinarcotics  strategy.    In the midst of growing tension in coca producing areas,  legislators have again questioned official antinarcotics  policies which emphasize repression as the main tool to fight  trafficking. This is being blamed for the tension in Chapare.    "The results speak for themselves. The volumes of drugs  introduced into the United States have increased and consumption  has expanded during the years these policies have been in  effect. This reality has forced Bill Clinton's administration  to conclude that the drug problem in their country is a problem  of education and health," Ferrufino said.    The legislator recognized that surplus coca plantations are  linked to poverty and unemployment. The peasants have seen in  that crop their only possibility for survival at a time of  growing unemployment.    "If the United Nations understood and accepted the U.S.  installation of radars to control the entry of drugs in its  territory, why would the United States not accept that Bolivia  wants to seek its own solution to the problem instead of  continuing to implement a failure," Ferrufino said.

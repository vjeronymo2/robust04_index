			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Danes turn towards Maastricht A LARGE and increasing majority in Denmark supports the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The treaty is due to be submitted to a second referendum in Denmark later this year. The poll showed that 56 per cent would vote yes, 30 per cent no, and 14 per cent were undecided. It was conducted on January 11 and 12, before the publication of the Tamil report, on Thursday, and the consequent resignation of Prime Minister Poul Schluter. This compares with a December poll in which 51 per cent were in favour, 37 per cent against and 12 per cent undecided. In last June's referendum on the treaty 50.7 per cent voted in favour of the treaty and 49.3 per cent against. The date of the second referendum has not yet been set, but it is expected it will be held in May.</p>

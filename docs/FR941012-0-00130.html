			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, who said that ``cat skidding crews'' in the northwest work in close proximity of tree fellers, suggested that this provision should allow skidding directly away from a timber feller as long as the feller is not actively trying to fell a tree (Ex. 5&hyph;43). OSHA notes that the final rule does not prohibit what the commenter suggests. The final rule only says that yarding machines shall not be within a two-tree length distance while manual felling is in progress. The final rule does not prohibit the yarding operator from clearing logs when the feller is not engaged in cutting trees. While the feller is moving onto the next tree and assessing its condition, this provision allows yarder operators to remove the trees that have been felled, provided that the other requirements or this paragraph have been met (e.g., the feller acknowledging that it is safe for the yarder to enter the work area).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of the final standard requires that no employee approach a felling operation closer than two tree lengths of the tree being felled until the feller acknowledges it is safe to do so. This provision includes an exception to the two-tree length requirement when the employer demonstrates that a team of employees is necessary to manually fell a particular tree. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained provisions specifying that employees remain two tree lengths from the feller. The proposed rule did not contain the felling team exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters urged OSHA to permit exceptions to the two tree-length requirement (Tr. W1 152, 183&hyph;86, W2 163, OR 126). These commenters discussed, for example, the need for shovelers to work in conjunction with fellers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes the two tree-length distance requirement is necessary for several reasons. First, a feller may not be aware of approaching employees due to noise or the feller's concentration on the work. It is therefore possible that employees may inadvertently enter an area where a tree is falling. This could result in injury to the approaching employee, and even to the feller if he attempts to take corrective action. According to the WIR survey, six percent of employees injured reported that co-worker activity had contributed to the accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study indicated that eight percent of employees who were killed were hit by a tree being felled by another employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129). According to the OSHA FCI report, nine logging employees were killed when they were struck by a tree that was being cut by another logger (Ex. 4&hyph;61). Second, an approaching employee could be injured if he is unaware of or misjudges the falling direction of a tree. The feller is the best judge of the direction that a tree is likely to fall and, therefore, should be the one to signal when a work area is safe. Third, approaching employees could be injured if a tree were to inadvertently fall in the wrong direction. The best way for employees to prevent such injury is to remain clear of the work area while the felling operation is being conducted. Once the felling of the tree is completed, the feller can signal that it is safe for other employees to approach. Therefore, OSHA believes the safer approach for both the feller and other employees is to wait until the feller has acknowledged it is safe to enter the felling area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has included an exception to this rule for particular situations when more than one employee is needed to manually fell a particular tree. However, OSHA notes that this exception covers only manual fellers and those whom the employer demonstrates are needed to assist in manually felling a tree (e.g., shovelers). It does not include mechanical felling operations and it does permit machines to enter the manual felling area. In those situations, paragraphs (h)(1)(iii) and (h)(1)(v) apply. If a machine is necessary to push or pull over a tree, the manual feller must move at least two tree lengths away and must not enter the area until the machine operator acknowledges that it is safe. OSHA notes that this is not a blanket exception for all team felling activities. The general rule is that no person is to approach a feller until the feller has indicated it is safe to do so. The exception is meant to be applied on a case-by-case basis. That is, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a particular tree or a particular felling situation requires a team. Only then is more than one person allowed within the immediate work area. In addition, the employer bears the burden of showing that a team is necessary to manually fell the tree in that particular situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

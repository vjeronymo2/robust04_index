			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described previously, the computational method would require appropriate justification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reembrittlement trends are estimated, and monitored by continued surveillance in accordance with Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) provides that the reembrittlement rate must be monitored using a surveillance program which conforms to Appendix H of this part. Some older plants conform to Appendix H by applying issues of ASTM Standard E 185 that do not require the use of the vessel ``limiting materials'' in the surveillance program. Within this context, the term ``limiting materials'' refers to the materials predicted to have the highest RT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> NDT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or the lowest Charpy upper shelf energy during the operational lifetime of the plant. It is the intent of this rule that, as required by later issues of ASTM Standard E 185, the vessel ``limiting materials'' should be used to monitor reembrittlement if the materials are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50 specifies fracture toughness requirements for ferritic materials of pressure-retaining components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary of light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors. These requirements provide adequate margins of safety during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic tests. The proposed amendments to Appendix G are principally of a clarifying or a restructuring nature. These amendments include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Sections IV and V of Appendix G which would be combined and rewritten to clarify the Charpy upper-shelf energy requirements, and the pressure-temperature and minimum permissible temperature requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An explicit statement that would be added to Section IV requiring that pressure and leak tests of the reactor pressure vessel required by Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel (B&amp;PV) Code (ASME Code) must be completed before the core is critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed thermal annealing rule, 10 CFR 50.66, that would be referenced in lieu of the details on thermal annealing previously given in Section V.D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The reference to the ASME Code that would be changed from Appendix G of Section III to Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The ``design to permit annealing'' requirement (Section IV.B), which would be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The restructuring of Sections IV and V is intended to promote clarity of the requirements in these sections. The procedures required for cases in which the Charpy upper-shelf energy of a RPV beltline material falls below 50 ft-lb also would be clarified by consolidating the requirements previously addressed in parts of Sections IV and V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions in Section V.C concerning requirements for ``volumetric inspection'' and ``additional evidence of fracture toughness'' would be removed. The volumetric examination requirement would be removed because it was unnecessary, given the inspection and performance demonstration programs currently required under 10 CFR 50.55a. The ``additional evidence of fracture toughness'' requirement in Section V.C.2 would be incorporated in the ``equivalent margins'' analysis in Section IV.A.1, as a provisional method for developing fracture toughness data needed for that analysis. At the present time there is an adequate generic fracture toughness data base available to perform these analyses, with appropriate bounding considerations. The modification would permit a licensee to develop plant-specific data. Generally, plant-specific data would result in a reduction in the margin applied to the fracture toughness data, to reflect the reduction in uncertainties due to the availability of plant-specific data. However, this must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pressure-temperature and minimum permissible temperature requirements in Section IV would be restructured, with the principal feature being the addition of a table which summarizes the pressure-temperature limit requirements and minimum temperature requirements as a function of the plant operating condition, the vessel pressure, whether fuel is in the vessel, and whether the core is critical. In addition, Section IV would be reworded to clarify the minimum permissible temperature requirement by indicating the criteria for use in determining the location in the component or material which must satisfy the minimum temperature requirement. This minimum temperature is defined in Section IV as the metal temperature of the controlling material in the region which has the least favorable combination of stress and temperature for the appropriate plant condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that all pressure and leak tests of the RPV required by Section XI of the ASME Code must be completed before the core is critical is intended to prohibit the use of nuclear heat, i.e., core criticality, before the completion of these tests. The use of nuclear heat before the completion of such tests is considered unsafe for several reasons, including the hindrance of finding leaks with the vessel at such a high temperature and the potential for exacerbating the consequences of a vessel rupture (in the extremely unlikely event that it should occur) by having the core critical. The explicit prohibition of nuclear heat in these cases was recommended to the Executive Director for Operations by the Committee to Review Generic Requirements in a memorandum dated June 7, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements on thermal annealing contained in the current Appendix G (Section V.D) would be replaced by a reference to the proposed Thermal Annealing rule, 10 CFR 50.66.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changing the reference to Appendix G of the ASME Code from Section III to Section XI means that the requirements for operating plants will no longer come from the construction code (Section III of the ASME Code) but instead will come from Section XI, the in-service inspection code. Appendix G to Section XI and Appendix G to Section III are identical, so this amendment would not result in a change in technical requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV.B of Appendix G requires that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Reactor vessels for which the predicted value of upper-shelf energy at end of life is below 50 ft-lb or for which the predicted value of adjusted reference temperature at end of life exceeds 200  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (93  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) must be designed to permit a thermal annealing treatment *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would delete that requirement. This deletion conforms with Commission direction from 1985 and public comments to delete this section. An additional consideration to delete this requirement is that there should be no requirement to ensure the feasibility of a (future) voluntary activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

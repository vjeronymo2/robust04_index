He said: "It is said there are 1,591 items listed, but there  is a hitch to it. Deregulation will be implemented on only 231  of these items by the end of fiscal year 1994, and only in 42  cases will regulations be completely abolished."    Hashimoto made the remarks during a lecture he gave at a  seminar for senior officials of the LDP's Miyazaki Prefectural  Chapter.    He also criticized the government's attitude.    He said: "As such a large figure has been announced, Japan  will face difficulties when the rest of the world becomes aware  of the fact."</p>

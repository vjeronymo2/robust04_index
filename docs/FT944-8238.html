			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life's surrender bonus - Scheme to reduce penalties for early redemption of policies The move by Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, to offer higher surrender values to customers who cash in long-term life assurance or pension policies prematurely has aroused far more interest than expected among independent financial advisers. But the policy of giving a better deal to customers whose plans lapse within a few years - at the expense of a small reduction in maturity value - has sparked controversy within the life sector. Some companies believe that improving early surrender values can be unfair to investors who stay with a policy for its duration. They also fear it could undermine the very idea of the policy as a form of long-term saving. Mr John Hylands, Standard's head of marketing, said the programme of presentations to independent financial advisers - through whom the company makes most of its sales - had been extended to the end of this week. The company had originally expected about 2,000 independent advisers to attend, but now expects as many as 4,000 will have been to the roadshows by the presentations' finish. Other life companies, including those which also sell primarily through independent advisers, are particularly irritated that Standard is improving its surrender values without cutting the commissions it pays to those selling its products. Competition among those life companies is expected to intensify as a result of regulatory changes. Under Standard's new system, which comes into effect in January, the company will finance the initial cost of paying commission - so the adviser will still get paid - and then deduct the total out of premiums paid over the whole life of the policy rather than just taking it all from the early premiums. To finance this change, Standard will move about Pounds 50m in the first year from its free assets, which totalled Pounds 5.7bn at the end of last year, into policy reserves. Mr Hylands said that total would rise over the following few years and would stabilise at the transfer of 'a few hundred million pounds of capital'. Throughout the life assurance industry, companies have been adjusting their policies and the way they pay sales agents and advisers in preparation for the new regulatory regime, which begins in January. Standard also has an additional factor to cope with next year in the loss of its former relationship with Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, under which Halifax sold only Standard Life financial services' products. The Halifax is setting up its own life assurance subsidiary in January.</p>

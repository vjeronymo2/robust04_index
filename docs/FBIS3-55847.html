There is no cause for  immediate alarm because, since becoming the "moral" victor in  the elections, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been firing off in all  directions, more for the sake of provocation than in earnest.  But he cannot be ignored, because some day this man could  become Russian president. Whatever fate awaits him, his moment  of truth came yesterday, when he triumphantly entered the  skyscraper that (for the present) houses the new parliament. It  was an entry worthy of a rock star, rather than a politician,  because only Madonna and Michael Jackson are granted such a  reception. [passage omitted]    Vladimir Volfovich, I asked him, amid the throng, is what  you  told one Austrian newspaper true? Do you want Italy to cede the  South Tyrol to Austria?    [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely. You wanted to break us up into  pieces. Well, now you can taste some of your own medicine.    [Franceschini] Who do you mean by "you"?    [Zhirinovskiy] You Italians, you Europeans, you Westerners.  You caused the Soviet Union to collapse, and it would serve you  right to suffer the same fate and to see what it feels like.  Thus, perhaps you will understand what Russia is experiencing  now, without the 14 republics that have historically belonged to  it. So, South Tyrol must go to Austria, Trieste can go to  Yugoslavia, Sicily can go it alone, and so forth.    [Franceschini] But the Soviet Union was a vast and  totalitarian empire. Italy is a small democratic country. Why  do you want to break it up into pieces?    [Zhirinovskiy] You are small, but you must become even  smaller. You must end up with an Italy as small as Andorra or  Liechtenstein: Then you will understand!    [Franceschini] But in your opinion Russia should regain not  only the former Soviet republics but also the former communist  countries of Eastern Europe.    [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. I say this to the countries of  Eastern Europe: Stay neutral, free, and independent. You do  not need NATO at all. Why do you want to lick American and  British generals' boots? You will never have anything to fear  from Russia. Russia will never reach as far as Prague or  Budapest.    [Franceschini] What about as far as Kiev? Are you in favor  of taking away Ukraine's nuclear weapons?    [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely, yes. It must have all its  missiles taken away, and Russia must have them back. No new  nuclear powers must emerge in the world; there are already  enough.    [Franceschini] So you agree on this with Yeltsin and  Clinton.  They are working well in the negotiations with Ukraine...    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, they are good fellows, but let them  first get out of the way. It would be better.    [Franceschini] Will you be seeing Clinton during the Moscow  summit?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am willing to meet with him, but he is  afraid. I really do not know of what.    [Franceschini] Well, you have earned yourself a terrible  reputation...    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, people say all kinds of things about me:  The latest is that I am supposedly a KGB agent, and to think  that I was never a CPSU member, have never been in prison or a  mental hospital, I do not get drunk, I speak four languages, I  have two degrees, I served my country faithfully in the Army, I  have not run away to seek my fortune abroad, and I have never  stolen a single ruble from anyone. Where can your Clinton find  another Russian politician with a record like mine?    [Franceschini] But every second day you declare war on some  foreign country or other...    [Zhirinovskiy] I am opposed to war; I am in favor of peace  and of civilized coexistence between all the countries of the  world. I do not threaten anyone, either in the South or in the  West: We want relations of good cooperation with both Finland  and Turkey, with both Afghanistan and Poland, but there are  risks of war in the world, and they could increase if someone  makes some wrong moves of the kind discussed by NATO in Brussels.    [Franceschini] Namely?    [Zhirinovskiy] Namely, the idea of waging war on Bosnia.  Mitterrand's proposal to bomb the Bosnian cities is pure  fascism, or evidence of senility. Mitterrand is evidently a  crazy old man; he has not long left to live, and intends to  bring the world to war. He is the warmonger, not I. Mitterrand,  Major, Kohl, Clinton, the Japanese, the whole of G-7: They are  to blame for the war in the Balkans. They hold a summit in  Brussels, but the time will come for other summits at which  people will be called to account for all these crimes.    [Franceschini] Some people expect your first proposal in  Parliament to be an attack on Boris Yeltsin.    [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. It will be a proposal for a  general amnesty for all political crimes from 1985 to the  present. That is, from the day Gorbachev came to power until  the violent events of last October. The lengthy crisis and the  changes of these difficult years have led to thousands of unjust  sentences. Russia must bury its past at a stroke. It must look  ahead. To the future. With me. Then it will succeed in rising  up again.</p>

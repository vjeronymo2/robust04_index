			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parking, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>   [Excerpts] Irish premier Albert Reynolds tonight stepped up  the pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to respond to the Downing  Street Declaration. Mr Reynolds said he had provided "copious  clarification" of the document he signed along with John Major  in London on December 15. He told a European Parliament  candidates selection meeting of his Fianna Fail party in Dublin  that he had given clarification of the declaration in numerous  statements as well as in a lengthy response last week to a  letter from Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.    "Since such clarification was requested from us we are  entitled to expect that it would be carefully studied and taken  into account," he said.    "Two months after the joint peace declaration it is time for  political realism and for a clear decision soon ..." he added.  [passage omitted]    Mr Reynolds warned against thinking that clarification from  London for the Republicans was all that was needed and said the  role of the Irish Government was central to the peace process.  He said it was clear the armed conflict could resolve nothing  and equally clear that bilateral dialogue or negotiation between  Sinn Fein and Britain, without regard to Dublin or the other  Northern Ireland political parties, would also fail to solve the  impasse.    "I have provided comprehensive textual clarification," he  added. "I have presented a closely argued analysis of how  self-determination is applied in international law in  partitioned countries worldwide. I would expect people to study  it and respond to it and not to treat the issue simplistically,"  he urged.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Wallace McCain ousted as head of frozen food group Mr Wallace McCain, 64, has been ousted as co-chief executive of McCain Foods. His replacement, possibly an outsider, will be appointed soon, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. However, a bitter, decade-long struggle between Mr Wallace McCain and his brother, Mr Harrison McCain, 66, over family succession at McCain Foods is far from over. Mr Harrison McCain said he would continue as sole chairman and chief executive until a successor was appointed in the next week or so. The two brothers have over the past 38 years built McCain Foods into a frozen foods multinational with annual sales of USDollars 2.5bn. Each controls 33.57 per cent of the company. The McCain Foods family-controlled board, after a six-hour meeting in Toronto, dismissed Mr Wallace McCain and appointed him non-executive vice-chairman. Later, he accused his brother of 'playing family politics and keeping the board under his thumb'. He said he would pursue the lawsuit against his brother and the company. He maintains that McCain Foods should be restructured, headed by an outsider, and later taken public. Mr Harrison McCain said the board's action 'provides a resolution of the dispute among shareholders and opens the way for an orderly succession of chief executive'. Only Mr Wallace McCain's two sons, Scott and Michael, voted against his dismissal at the board meeting. Neither of the brothers were at the meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Smajl Terzic from Tesanj] </F>   [Text] The last 24 hours in the operational zone of the  7th South Operative Group have been the worst since the start of  the [Serb] enemy offensive. The aggressor has continuously  pounded civilian targets in Tesanj, Maglaj, Sije, Mravici,  Matuzici, Jelah, Kalosevic, and Miljanovci. The shells have  killed over 20 civilians, and wounded about 100 innocent people.    The entire 30-kilometer-long defense line has been pounded  with hundreds of shells, but the worst situation was in the  operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade in the region  of Plana, Lijesnica, and (Nekoli), and in the operational zones  of the 203d Glorious Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosnia, the 110th  Glorious Brigade HVO Usora, and on the southern sector of the  the 200th Chivalrous Brigade in the region of Kraljevo Brdo,  Bandera, and Borik.    Let us add at the end of this report that today it is eight  months that this region has been besieged, this region where  people are dying of hunger and deprivation. We appeal to all  who can and want to help these suffering people to send in food  and medicine.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> WAGNER: "Das Rheingold." Marjana Lipovsek, Jadwiga Rappe, James Morris, Theo  Adam, Heinz Zednik, Andreas Schmidt; Symphonie-Orchester des Bayerischen  Rundfunks conducted by Bernard Haitink.  </P> <P> EMI-Angel 49853-2 (two compact discs). The order may be jumbled, but the  priorities are right: with his most recently published installment of the  "Ring," Haitink capitalizes on the promise of the previously released "Die  Walkure." What the conducting lacks in sheer, Soltiesque dazzle, it more than  makes up in its adherence to line and respect for architecture, a symphonist's  probing view of the score, animated by the Bavarians' accomplished playing and  EMI's resourceful engineers. Morris' grainy bass epitomizes the callow young  Wotan. Adam, a distinguished Wotan of yesteryear, brings uncommon intelligence  and a tight top to Alberich. Noted, too, with pleasure: Lipovsek's steady  Fricka, Rappe's opulent Erda, Zednik's wily Loge and Schmidt's Donner, a rich,  baritonal, golden-age performance. ALLAN ULRICH  </P></p>

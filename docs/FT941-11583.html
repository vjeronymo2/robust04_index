			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull posts FFr3.42bn losses Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer company, yesterday highlighted the severity of its financial problems by announcing a net loss before restructuring costs of FFr3.42bn (Dollars 583m) last year against a comparable loss of FFr2.45bn in 1992. The announcement follows last week's demand from the European Commission for the French government, which is the controlling shareholder in Bull, to suspend plans for a FFr2.5bn capital injection into the ailing company. Both the government and Bull have argued that the capital injection is part of their plan to prepare Bull for eventual privatisation. However, the EC has claimed that the capital increase was not accompanied by a fully-fledged restructuring plan. The government has 30 days to present restructuring proposals to the commission. Meanwhile Bull, which reported a net loss after restructuring costs of FFr4.72bn for 1992, suffered a fall in sales of 6.4 per cent to FFr28.25bn in 1993. It also saw its operating losses escalate to FFr1.89bn from FFr642m.</p>

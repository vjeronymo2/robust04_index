			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURNING MARXISM AGAINST THE RUSSIANS;  </P> <P> LET HISTORY JUDGE THE ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES OF STALINISM A REVISED AND  EXPANDED EDITION BY ROY A. MEDVEDEV; TRANSLATED BY GEORGE SHRIVER (COLUMBIA  UNIVERSITY PRESS: $57.50; 800 PP.; 0-231-06350-4)  </P> <P> It was a cold and wet evening in what passed for spring in Moscow in 1976 when  I first met Roy Medvedev. My wife and I had made our way to his apartment on  the far edge of the city, by Metro, bus, and finally on foot, feeling like  underground conspirators and hoping we were not followed. Medvedev then was one  of the Soviet Union's three best-known dissidents, along with Andrei Sakharov  and the then recently exiled Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Today, living testimony to  the Gorbachev revolution, Medvedev is not only published openly in Soviet  newspapers and journals but has been elected along with Sakharov as a deputy to  the new Congress of the People and to the Supreme Soviet, where he has become  an eloquent voice for democracy. In December he is scheduled to come to this  country and to address the convention of the American Historical Assn. in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Medvedev became world famous when his magnum opus on Stalinism, the original  edition of "Let History Judge," was smuggled out and published in English  translation in 1972. In the next few years the work appeared in the other major  Western languages and even in Japanese and Chinese. In response, the Brezhnev  government deprived Medvedev of both his job and his Communist Party  membership, and the KGB subjected him to constant surveillance and harassment.  </P> <P> That was an era when the aging Communist bureaucracy was bent on rehabilitating  the memory of Stalin, clouded ever since Nikita Khrushchev's well-known "Secret  Speech" of 1956. They were doing everything they could to perpetuate Stalin's  totalitarian system of rule, even if their scale of arrests and killings was  more modest. Critical inquiries and exposes of the historical truth such as  Medvedev devoted himself to were intolerable to the party hierarchy.  </P> <P> The wonder is that Medvedev was never actually arrested and jailed or deported  like Solzhenitsyn, or like his own twin brother, Zhores Medvedev. Zhores, an  eminent biologist as well as political critic in his own right, was deprived of  his Soviet citizenship in 1973 while he was on a research visit to England,  where he still lives and supervises the foreign publication of Roy's work.  </P> <P> Speaking with Medvedev that night 13 years ago, I asked him how he managed to  produce such a monumental work as "Let History Judge," along with the flood of  writings that followed, considering the difficult conditions of his life and  work. "I don't do it all myself," he explained. "People are bringing me  materials all the time. I have a whole institute."  </P> <P> As Medvedev observes in the preface to the new edition of "Let History Judge,"  "A person who works openly on the subject of Stalin and Stalinism in the Soviet  Union inevitably becomes a center of attraction for many who wish to express  their opinions or impart testimony on this question, which is still a very sore  subject in Soviet society." Nonetheless, it was with extraordinary courage and  rare insight that Medvedev took on the unique task of marshaling and telling  the historical truth about Stalinism, from inside the system.  </P> <P> As a book written from the inside, where "dangerous" source materials were shut  away in the "special preserves" of the libraries, and the major Western works  were available only when they could be smuggled in, "Let History Judge" was an  extraordinary accomplishment, both of description and of explanation. Although,  as Western reviewers noted at the time, Medvedev was reluctant to dispute the  merits of Lenin and the 1917 revolution, he produced a compelling and original  account, "a history of a disease," showing how the revolution went wrong in  Stalin's hands, and how the tyrant found support for his "usurpation of power"  and his annihilation of the Communist Old Guard among the same sort of  "petty-bourgeois" elements of society who supported fascism in Western Europe  between the wars. To be sure, Medvedev retained the overall Marxist schema and  language about history and society -- he still does -- but as he pointed out to  me, "The Marxist frame of reference is the only one Russians know, thanks to  their indoctrination, so the only way to reach them with new ideas is within  the Marxist framework."  </P> <P> Today, under Gorbachev's perestroika -- "restructuring" -- and glasnost --  "openness" -- Medvedev enjoys vastly more positive conditions for his work.  Oceans of new information, both Soviet source material and the accumulation of  Western studies, have become available to him. At the same time, the Gorbachev  era has put Stalinism in a new perspective, giving it an end (so it seems) as  well as a beginning, which makes it possible to look at that era in a more  historical way.  </P> <P> These circumstances have not required Medvedev to alter his basic beliefs. As  he emphasizes in the preface to the new edition, "The author of this book has  modified his views in many respects to make them more precise, but he has  maintained his adherence to socialist ideals," to the discomfiture of critics  on both the far left and the far right. This ideal, he notes toward the end,  "does not guarantee full equality of material possibilities or an equal  position in society to everyone, because people differ individually. Socialism  must, however, ensure substantial progress toward equality in the most  important sense -- equality of rights and obligations, just treatment of all,  and equal opportunity for all to discover and develop their talents and  abilities. It must reduce the flagrant material inequality that exists under  capitalism, eliminating both excessive wealth and humiliating poverty."  Medvedev still regards Stalinism as nothing but "barracks pseudosocialism,"  distinguished by its overgrown bureaucracy, its deception of the masses, and  the hypocritical and corrupt pursuit of elite privilege.  </P> <P> The nature of Stalin's rule, including his mammoth crimes in the  collectivization of the peasants, the artificial famine of 1932-33, and the  purges of 1936-38, is now well known and beyond dispute, to Soviet historians  as well as Westerners. There are only more gory details that keep coming out  about this story, which Medvedev recounts in full. What remains more debatable  is explaining how Stalin could establish the kind of system that permitted him  to commit these monstrosities, "even worse than Hitler," as another eminent  Soviet scholar recently remarked to me.  </P> <P> This question was raised as long ago as 1956 when the Italian Communist leader  Palmiro Togliatti, asserting his own independence, took issue with Khrushchev  for putting all the blame on Stalin's demented personality. "The true problems  are evaded," Togliatti charged in a famous interview shortly after the "Secret  Speech" was made public by the United States government, "which are why and how  Soviet society could reach and did reach certain forms alien to the democratic  way and to the legality which it had set for itself, even to the point of  degeneration."  </P> <P> There are some in the Soviet Union who now argue, like many Western writers,  that Communist ideology has been the key to the Soviet tyranny all along. One  such critic is Alexander Tsipko of the Institute of the Economics of the World  Socialist System in Moscow, a hotbed of progressive and critical thinking, who  openly puts the blame on Marx's Communist utopia combined with the abstract  messianism of the pre-revolutionary Russian intellectuals. Tsipko rejects the  notion of betrayal or counterrevolution under Stalin, echoed by writers from  Leon Trotsky to Medvedev himself, on the ground that this theory detracts from  the responsibility that should rest on the revolutionary thinkers who preceded  him.  </P> <P> While that argument is persuasive at first glance, it does not stand up against  the actual story of Stalin's rise to power between 1917 and 1929. Here, in a  major expansion of his book based on Western studies, Medvedev shows how Stalin  was opposed at one time or another by practically every other leading Russian  Marxist, not to mention innumerable Social Democrats and Communist schismatics  outside the Soviet Union. It is too much to credit Stalin, as his sycophants  did, with being the highest oracle of Marxist truth; Medvedev conveys the far  more realistic picture of a cynical, opportunistic, and above all egomaniac  power grabber who learned early on how to manipulate Marxist-Leninist doctrine  to entrap or bamboozle the true believers. By the time of the purges, he now  concludes, "Stalin wielded such power as no Russian tzar or any other dictator  of the past thousand years has possessed."  </P> <P> This, however, does not bring us any closer to understanding how it was  possible for such a warped and vicious man to take over the Brave New World.  Medvedev demolishes the view that Stalin was merely the implementation of  Lenin, but like most newly liberated Soviet historians, he still tiptoes around  the question of Lenin's responsibility for the one-party system and the  centralized party bureaucracy that set up the country for Stalin's takeover.  "De-Leninization," it seems fair to say, remains the last hurdle for  perestroika in Soviet history.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Despatches: Quick march down the capitalist road THE COLONEL could hardly have found himself displayed in more handsome surroundings, or have provided quite such an affront to historical memory gilded by years of absence. There he was in all his finger-lickin' awfulness, stuck to the colonial facade of the old Dong Feng hotel on Shanghai's Bund, the city's waterfront corniche. There was, however, worse to come. Inside the Dong Feng, formerly the Shanghai Club and once the preserve of gin-sodden expatriates and their ladies-in-waiting, there was more excess. The long wooden bar - the longest bar in all Asia in its day - had been taken away and replaced by a Colonel Sanders fast food establishment with its synthetic plastic red and white livery. The stale vapours of Kentucky fried chicken wafted across what had been a marbled entrance hall of some majesty in the faded days of empire. Returning to Shanghai after 10 years, I felt a strange sense of dislocation: regretful of a fading, less complicated past, yet exhilarated by a new vitality. For the city is awakening like an oriental Rip Van Winkle after years of heavy-handed control from Beijing, fearful of Shanghai's unruly reputation as a crucible of new, and possibly dangerous, ideas. The Chinese Communist party was founded in Shanghai. To Mao and his comrades in 1921, it was a city of excess, of riches beyond imagining, but also a human sink - the perfect place to start a revolution. These days, there is barely a whiff of political contrariness; rather, the scent is one of money, of getting on and getting rich. At the Shenyin Securities company, where long queues of stock market punters form each day in a drab, suburban street, I met a small, balding man named Tsao who was waiting for his daughter to emerge from a scrum of people besieging the counters inside. The 76-year-old Tsao, it emerged, was a Shanghai 'millionaire' before the revolution took it all. He appeared affronted when I confessed that I had not heard of his now-defunct business, the 'famous' Wasong electric fan company. The communists had expropriated the company and his shares in other enterprises had been made worthless, yet Tsao was punting again with meagre savings. Why, after being scalded once? I asked, to which he replied with a toothless grin: 'Because I can't help myself.' Across the city on the banks of smelly Suzhou creek, in a converted hotel ballroom, the Shanghai stock exchange, the city's new temple of capitalism, was registering Tsao's modest (Dollars 53) investment. Other, bigger punters are in the field, like 'Million Yang,' a former Shanghai worker who is famous the length and breadth of China for his stock-picking acumen. In time, Million Yang may become the stuff of legend in the tradition of Shanghai's dubious personalities of the past, like Big-Eared Du and Pockmarked Huang; or of other colourful figures who occupied a nether world of secret societies such as the Green Hand. A writer on Shanghai observed many years ago that its vocation had never been government or art or religion; it had been money-making. Shanghai's leaders, communist in name only these days, have, like religious converts, embraced the city's zest for commerce with rare enthusiasm. Mayor Huang Ju is lyrical about his plans to make Shanghai the 'dragon head' of the Yangtze river valley, the 'gateway to the world outside.' Dressed in conservative suit and tie and wearing platformed, tasselled shoes, Mayor Huang is the very model of the modern Chinese official, dancing nimbly around questions about Mao and Marx, communism and capitalism, then and now. China's turbulent past, its class struggle, its Soviet-style central planning, its mass political campaigns, are 'part of history.' What is important, he says, is to look forward - and he is probably right, since to dwell on the past would be to remind oneself of wasted years and behavior best forgotten. Shanghai no longer moves at the measured pace that I recall. People surge through narrow streets and traffic is caught in endless jams. Moving west along Nanjing Road, the city's main shopping street, you find yourself borne on a human tide; and if you wish to leave the torrent, you are obliged to negotiate your way carefully, like crossing a river. Ten years ago, it was possible to stroll and browse, poking into stodgy, Soviet-style emporiums like the No 1 Department Store where sleepy sales assistants barely acknowledged your presence. Now, Nanjing road has come alive with shops like Benetton, Stefanel and the Sincere Department Store. Its Shanghainese owners, refugees from communism, have returned to claim their birthright, if not the exact location on which the old Sincere store stood before the revolution. In these new, gleaming retail temples, people engage in a kind of consumerism gone mad. Shopping in Benetton one day, I removed my pullover to try on a new one, only to find that my shapeless relic had been borne away by the crowd: it was no easy task to retrieve it. Travelling further west across Tibet Road, which forms the great traffic divide between the eastern part of the city and the western (traffic on either side gridlocks in a honking, blaring cacophony), you come to a structure not unlike the grandstand at a racecourse. Indeed, this was a race-stand before the revolution put paid to such frivolity. The building is now the municipal library, and the race-course itself has been divided into a drab 'people's park' and 'people's square.' If, by chance, you visit the park on a Sunday and allow yourself to be drawn towards small groups, talking and debating in a dusty corner, you will hear a multitude of tongues in excited babble. English predominates, and strange conversations materialise. 'My name is David Copperfield,' said one old man, by way of introduction. 'Mine is Charles Dickens,' I said, to which he replied: 'I know him well,' before shuffling off into the crowd. In Shanghai now, anything seems possible, although slavish attachment to western fads and fashion jars and you dream of the days when Shanghai, like the rest of China, seemed other-worldly. There is not much that is other-worldly about the JJ Disco, though - a throbbing palace of western-style rock which is packed to its strobe-lit rafters each night with 1,200 patrons who jiggle and jive on elevated dance floors under a huge yellow butterfly caught in smoky rays of light. It was not so long ago that a jazz band was considered risque by the city's party bosses but, these days, a fairly lurid nightlife has made a comeback, reviving memories of a seedy past. Not far from JJ's, in what was known as Frenchtown before the revolution changed everything, stands the handsome old Jinjiang Club, preserved, as if in aspic, by the communists and where I and my friends would repair, 10 years ago and more, for a late-evening game of snooker. Now, sadly, the musty snooker room has gone and so, too, has the old-fashioned restaurant where we would dine on escargots and filet mignon and be entertained by a chamber orchestra. The Jinjiang has become the Garden Hotel Okura, a perfectly renovated and reconstructed Japanese-style hotel with an orderliness that says less about the past than it does about the future. The plumbing, I am sure, is flawless but, somehow, it is not the same. Happily, the old Peace Hotel on the waterfront has been preserved more or less intact, and it is there that I stay for old time's sake. Not the least of its appeal is a marvellous Art Deco reception area where idle moments can be spent in the gloom - lighting remains faithful to the 1930s - watching the parade of tourists, Japanese businessman, and the odd journalist who has forsaken the newly-built glass-and-chrome up-market hotels like the Hilton and the Portman. Known before the revolution as the Cathay, the Peace Hotel forms a fusty link with the past and we are assured by its manager, Mr Wang, that its character will be preserved. Completed in 1930 and owned by the Sassoon family, wealthy Jewish merchants from Baghdad, the Peace still lives, appropriately enough, in the jazz age. There are no plans, insists Mr Wang, for karaoke bars or discos. History takes a visitor, returning after many years, to No 76 Mingye Road, in the old French quarter. It was there, at a meeting on July 21 1921, that the Communist party of China was born, the venue being the home of one of the delegates. Mao himself is said to have attended, and the place has been preserved as a shrine to the birth of communism in China complete with replica teacups (12) and ashtrays (two) from the first meeting. But the museum now seems oddly deserted, even ghostlike, as if the mass movement launched by that first meeting is irrelevant to today's events. Outside, life flows on in full flood but, inside, the atmosphere is one of an almost defensive silence, as if daring the visitor to ridicule the revolution's legacy. History also propels the visitor away from the commercialism of Nanking Road, and the bustle of the Bund, north along Sichuan Road to Hongkou Park, where you can see the memorial to Lu Xun, China's greatest modern writer, whose biting satirical works poured scorn on bourgeois Chinese society of the time, in the process helping to re-define Chinese literature. With luck, new Lu Xuns will emerge to remind the Chinese of their follies, and to balance the money worship of the present.</p>

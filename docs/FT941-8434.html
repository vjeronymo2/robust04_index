			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Yielding ground Two things seem to be worrying equities. One is the domestic concern that, after botching the presentation of the latest rate cut, the authorities have lost the policy initiative just when recovery prospects are overshadowed by April's tax increases. The other is the international concern that the liquidity flow that has boosted world financial markets will dry up now the Federal Reserve has begun to tighten. With the New York bond market jumpy about how quickly the Fed will tighten again, there is not much incentive to put more cash into any leading bond market. That already makes it harder to disguise the extent to which the governments of industrial countries are under pressure to raise money. When bond markets start to worry about supply, the natural consequence is that real yields rise, even though inflationary pressures still appear dormant. The UK may be more advanced on the recovery road than the rest of Europe but equities can do without a general trend towards higher real yields. Compounding the problem is sterling's weakness, which may make further base rate cuts harder even if domestic economic developments suggest they are desirable. There is still a chance that, having moved sharply down this week, the gilts market has created leeway to absorb next week's auction comfortably. If it does not, equities will be in for a rougher ride. Despite yesterday's sharp fall, the FT-SE 100 index was barely changed on the week and selling pressure has been modest. Obviously the market also has an eye on the results season getting under way in earnest next week. But it will now have to be really good to reassure.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKE YOUR CHOICE OF COUNTER TOPPINGS;  </P> <P> KITCHENS: MATERIALS CAN RANGE FROM GRANITE TO TILE TO WOOD, BUT EACH HAS  DRAWBACKS AND THE PRICE RANGE CAN BE EXTREME.  </P> <P> No other surface in a house takes the kind of punishment kitchen countertops  get. Not only do they have to withstand the torture of heat and cold, spills  and scratches, chopping and pounding, but when the work is done, we expect them  to look as if they've never even been used.  </P> <P> Even in their idle moments, kitchen counters earn their keep. More than any  other component, they set the tone for the whole room, whether it's the earthy,  informal look of tile or the super-clean appearance of a continuous smooth  surface.  </P> <P> Tile has long been a popular choice in Orange County, as it is all over the  southwestern United States, says Steve Salazar, owner of Kitchens Del Mar in  Corona del Mar. But it's now being challenged by the toughest surface of all:  granite.  </P> <P> "Granite is indestructible," Salazar says. "It's impervious to stains, to heat  -- you could start a fire on it. You can chop on it, slide things across it. It  doesn't matter. About the only way you could do a granite countertop any damage  would be if something sharp and very heavy hit it on the edge. Then it might  break."  </P> <P> Because the stone must be polished to a high gloss to be properly sealed,  granite still shines after a simple cleanup when the work is done.  </P> <P> Granite is also expensive, ranging from $75 to $150 a square foot, installed,  depending on the stone itself, the time and effort necessary to fabricate it,  and the individual conditions in a kitchen, such as the number and angle of  corners and cutouts for sinks and stove tops, Salazar says.  </P> <P> The granite used for kitchens here may come from as far away as South America  or the Mediterranean, he says, or it may be from domestic quarries. The most  exotic-looking slabs, with intricately colored veins, are usually South  American.  </P> <P> Some homeowners get closely involved in the process, not only choosing the  individual slabs of granite they want for their kitchens, but even deciding  where and how they want the stone to be sawed so that particular veins of color  are highlighted, Salazar says.  </P> <P> Granite's strength is also its weakness. It's an unforgiving surface, which  means there's no room for mistakes or even fudging inaccurate measurements.  "Whatever you do with granite, you can only do it once," Salazar says. For that  reason, it is not recommended for do-it-yourselfers.  </P> <P> Even with a professional installer, Salazar warns, it's possible to spend as  much as $10,000 and end up disappointed. "Before you hire someone to install  granite countertops, demand to see an installation he's done in somebody's  kitchen. Not a photo. You need to actually see it. You want someone who deals  with an established granite fabricator and who has experience with the  material."  </P> <P> The choices in color and pattern of granite surfaces is limited only by nature  itself, but it is limited. Not so with solid-surface synthetics such as Corian  or Fountainhead, which has a stonelike appearance. Less expensive than granite  at about $35 to $60 per square foot, installed, synthetics come in a wide  selection of both solid colors and patterns. Whatever the choice, synthetics  are exactly the same all the way through. That comes in handy if they get  stained, burned or scratched, all of which can happen. If it does, the damage  can usually be sanded off, leaving the countertop looking new again.  </P> <P> For homeowners who want a single smooth surface throughout the kitchen,  solid-surface synthetics can be attached to sinks made of the same material. Or  for a decorative touch, two or more colors or patterns can be combined without  breaking the continuous surface.  </P> <P> Tile is where do-it-yourselfers get a chance to excel, although many homeowners  still prefer to select the material and design and let someone else do the  dirty work.  </P> <P> "There's an infinite variety of things you can do with tile," Salazar says.  "You can combine colors, textures, sizes. You can add hand-painted or  custom-made tile. You can get different looks with different colors of grout,  and with different widths of grout."  </P> <P> Tile can be as inexpensive as $5 a square foot, installed, or it can cost as  much as $50 with custom-made tiles, Salazar says.  </P> <P> Tile is most popular for the Southwest or French look, although it can be used  with many other styles as well.  </P> <P> But tile does have its drawbacks. "It's not a flat, even surface, and that can  be a problem," Salazar says. "Also, the grout is very, very porous, which means  it's susceptible to stains."  </P> <P> Then there's the old standby from the '60s, the laminated countertop.  </P> <P> Laminates, such as Formica, are inexpensive -- $5 to $10 a square foot,  installed -- and they come in "thousands" of colors and patterns, Salazar says.  "It's a very functional, scratch-resistant surface," he says. "But it's not  very flexible. It can be bent, but only in one direction."  </P> <P> Laminated tops can be dressed up with wood or tile trim to make them less drab.  </P> <P> Wood countertops, once all the rage, are no longer nearly as popular, Salazar  says. "It's a rich, natural look, but it burns, stains, scratches. It takes a  lot of maintenance. And if you chop onions on a wood countertop, it's going to  smell like onions for a long time after that."  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Rethink urged in counties review Two politics professors have called for a pause in the English local government review due to be finished by the end of this year, because the process is now 'fundamentally flawed'. They say an all-party conference should discuss how to change track. In England, the Local Government Commission is recommending that the current two-tier structure of counties and districts be changed into all-purpose authorities. But Professor George Jones, of the London School of Economics, and Professor John Stewart of Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies, argue in the Local Government Chronicle that the way ahead should be unitary status for large towns and cities, with slight revisions to the two-tier system of responsibilities elsewhere. Several districts are trying to arrange mergers so that they will be big enough for unitary status. Formal announcements have already been made on merger proposals for Devon, Cambridgeshire and Surrey, while several other areas must make submissions by the end of this month. Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the commission, has recommended that new unitary authorities should have populations of between 150,000 and 250,000.</p>

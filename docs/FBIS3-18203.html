			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Feb 28 (AFP) -- Leading Western powers united  Monday [28 February] to defend the downing by two U.S. F-16  fighter jets of four Bosnian Serb aircraft in central Bosnia  earlier in the day.    The four were part of a group of six Super Galeb aircraft  which took off from the northwestern Serb-held airport of Banja  Luka early Monday morning, a French military source said.    In Bonn, German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that  the downing of the aircraft was the "bitter but necessary  consequence" of Serbian aggression. "The (Serbian) pilots had  not reacted to two warnings given after they clearly infringed  the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia," Vogel said.    In Washington, President Bill Clinton said that the American  forces had made every attempt to avoid a confrontation with the  Serbs. "There were two warnings," Clinton told reporters.  "Every attempt was made to the best of my information to avoid  this encounter."    In Brussels, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that  the use of force showed that "the international community has  decided to make sure it is respected."    British Prime Minister John Major, in Washington on an  official visit, said that the four downed aircraft had shown  clearly hostile intentions. "The planes had no reason to be  there, had been warned and should have expected to be shot  down," Major said.    At the French Foreign Ministry, spokeswoman Catherine  Colonna  said the Serbian flights over Bosnia "constituted an  unquestionable violation of United Nations resolutions." It was  "the first violation of this type" and the "most serious  violation seen to date," she said, adding: "The international  community must show its resolve to see that the UN Security  Council's resolutions are respected."    In Rome, Italian Defence Minister Fabio Fabbri said that the  incident was "painful" but "allowed the United Nations to keep  its authority and prestige." Fabbri said that the U.S. pilots  had "operated according to the defined procedures in order to  see the UN Rsolution 816 on the no-fly exclusion zone was  respected. "If the international community and the United  Nations want to make their intention of guaranteeing world order  credible and influential, they cannot avoid the use of force for  peaceful and humanitarian ends," he said.    In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, current  president of the European Council of Ministers, said that,  "disagreeable and difficult as the serious incident was...it  could not annul" the peace process underway in Bosnia.    General Jean Cot, commander of the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR], said in a statement in Zagreb that the shooting down  of the four planes was carried out "exactly according to  procedures. All stages of this operation were executed by NATO  exactly according to the procedures agreed for the no-fly zone,"  he said.    In Tirana, where he was on an official visit, Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman said he was "entirely in accord with"  the NATO operation by which the international community showed  "it intends to continue its actions to put an end to the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    In Ankara, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said that  the  action was entirely "legitimate."    In Milan, Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kresevliajakovic said that  "NATO's strength will accelerate the end of the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    In Moscow, extreme nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  demanded the "dissolution" of NATO and the United Nations.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Copymore declines by 48% A FURTHER decline at Copymore in the second half saw profits for 1992 reduced by 48 per cent from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 536,000 before tax. This followed the first half slip from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 506,000. In view of the profit drop, the USM-quoted office automation and equipment distributor has not paid a final dividend. This leaves the year's total at 1p, against 2.7p. Sales rose to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 28.4m). Earnings were lower at 3.3p (5.9p). The company said that there were 'recessionary conditions in our core photocopier and laser printer markets.' As a result of a Pounds 482,000 downward revaluation of freehold property and writing off almost Pounds 700,000 in acquisition goodwill, the year-end debt-equity ratio increased to 184 per cent</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Funerals raise tension again: Impatience with political talks in South Africa SOUTH Africa yesterday braced for another round of potential violence at political funerals, after the death at the weekend by natural causes of Mr Oliver Tambo, elder statesman of the African National Congress and patron of the liberation struggle. He had been in failing health since a stroke in 1989 and was no longer active in ANC policy-making, but remained a potent symbol of resistance to apartheid. ANC officials said they believed his funeral would be as large as that for Mr Chris Hani, whose violent death two weeks ago provoked a serious political crisis in South Africa. Mr Tambo, though his health kept him away from the negotiations, is credited with helping to engineer a shift in ANC policy in 1989 - the movement opted to negotiate rather than fight for an end to apartheid. Within the next week, South Africa will bury two political leaders - Mr Tambo, who is to be interred next Sunday at his old home town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg, and Mr Andries Treurnicht of the right-wing Conservative party, who is to be buried tomorrow at a big ceremony in Pretoria. On Wednesday, a mass funeral will be held, at Sebokeng township near Johannesburg, for the 19 victims of a massacre on the eve of Mr Hani's funeral last week. A funeral will also take place for a TV reporter of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, murdered in Sharpeville township at the weekend. The funerals are likely to create new tension, as multi-party negotiations resume today for a new constitution. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, stressed the impatience of young ANC members at the slowness of negotiations over a political settlement in South Africa. 'Time is not on our side. A date for elections must be set now,' he said. ANC and government negotiators have committed themselves to push for agreement in the multi-party negotiations within six weeks, this to include an election date, the installation of a multi-party transitional executive council to advise the government before multi-racial elections, an interim constitution until elections, and principles for a future constitution. This last would include multi-party power sharing until the end of the century. However, while the basis for agreement exists between the two main parties to the talks, others in the 26-party forum vehemently oppose certain aspects. Seven people were killed yesterday when ANC supporters shot two Inkatha Freedom party members at a funeral vigil for a regional Inkatha leader and then mourners killed five of the attackers. Mr Charles Nqakula, a former journalist, has been appointed general secretary of the South African Communist party to succeed Chris Hani.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Walter Taboada Milla, head of the </F> National Counternarcotics Division, by David Montoya; place and  date not given]    [Text]The political violence has more than one link  with the drug traffic. In this edition, we begin publishing a  bimonthly supplement on this topic. David Montoya, of the  Special Report team, was able to interview the chief of the  DINANDRO [National Counternarcotics Division], General Walter  Taboada Milla. The National Police's DINANDRO has been operating  since 1 January 1992, the date of the merger of the two  divisions of the PIP [Peruvian Investigative Police] and Civil  Guard that had been responsible for that task. The merger into a  single division made it possible to reinforce the police work on  what is known as interdiction. Now, there is more national  information on the problem, available more rapidly. The  DINANDRO's mission combines intelligence and interdiction  activities, and simultaneous coordination with the Armed Forces  throughout the country.    [Montoya] Starting with the topic of the "Vaticano" case, is  it true that some artists had to be arrested to create a  smokescreen in the country? Did they really have to be arrested  based on "orders from above," without evidence?    [Taboada] It was called an order from above, referring to  their superiors in the chain of command. So, there was no agency  apart from the police that ordered the detention of those  persons.    [Montoya] But there was no apparent evidence for detaining  them, was there?    [Taboada] Then why didn't they complain; why didn't they  file  a suit for habeas corpus? We detained them to investigate the  specific case involving the financial aspect, because there was  a series of contradictions. (Later, one of those detained sued  the interior minister.)    [Montoya] And in the case of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera,  did  you succeed in proving the drug trafficking charges?    [Taboada] Within 12 days, we collected sufficient evidence  to  sentence him for a great many years. By his own admission, he  was a drug trafficker from 1979 until 1991.    [Montoya] But "Vaticano" apparently is going to be sentenced  to life imprisonment for his connection with subversion, rather  than for drug trafficking.    [Taboada] That is a complementary charge.    [Montoya] Many people wonder how the Campanilla Army Base  could have failed to discover "Vaticano's" illicit activities,  and how he managed to create his empire almost before their  eyes. What is your opinion of this?    [Taboada] We have been totally dedicated to seeking evidence  against this individual, and we couldn't go any further in two  weeks. The trial judge has paved the way for continuing the  investigation and for going as far as necessary.    But "Vaticano" didn't start out in Campanilla; he began much  sooner, selling by the kilo at first. Later, by 1989 in Uchiza,  he was already owner of the "firm," which he called "Loco  Limonier." Then he moved to Campanilla. He's a clever man,  despite the fact that he has only primary schooling. There, with  the entire population's support and the local authorities'  approval, he managed to renovate the marginal highway, spending  $300,000, and even installing electrical utilities. As this drug  trafficker has mentioned, there were no Army personnel there at  that time; they arrived later.    [Montoya] How much was "Vaticano" moving as regular  shipments?    [Taboada] "Vaticano" claimed that it was more profitable for  him to lease the landing strip than to engage in collecting and  shipping drugs. He was leasing his landing strip for $15,000 per  flight, and it is his claim that there were about 20 to 25  flights per month.    [Montoya] Drug dealing is a financial activity that can  corrupt people. Have there been any cases of this kind in the  directorate that you head?    [Taboada] As human beings, we sometimes make mistakes, and  it  is due to such a mistake that I am there (in the DINANDRO). You  may recall the case of the son of the drug trafficker, "Mosco  Loca," who was released. Those responsible were a colonel, a  commander, and a captain. For that reason, there was a series of  transfers of officials who had been working together for over  two years. During my administration no cases have appeared, and  I have been there for six months.    [Montoya] We are witnessing a drop in the price of PBC, and  there is much talk about the international drug traffic's  potential opportunity with poppies. How has the DINANDRO been  monitoring this product, the base for heroin?    [Taboada] There has been considerable talk of poppies. A  television channel showed poppies in the San Martin zone  bordering Moyobamba and Rodriguez de Mendoza Provinces. We  reached the site that had been identified as a growing zone and,  according to the video that we have, it is a poppy variety that  is useless for extracting gum or latex (components for heroin).  To give an idea, the capsule, or bud, must be pear-shaped, and  the one that they showed was small, resembling a peanut with a  shell, on which incisions could not be made to extract the gum.    We have checked other areas, in northern Moyobamba, north of  Rioja, where the same type exists; and we reached Jaen, with the  same results.    [Montoya] What is the drug traffic's future?    [Taboada] We are progressing well. We have been outfitting a  coordinating office to monitor the components of basic paste.  The Ministry of Industry, the DINANDRO, the Public Prosecutor's  Office, and the Sunat [National Tax Administration  Superintendency] have been integrated into this office. We are  also connected to terminals that have sufficient range for  monitoring producers, importers, exporters, warehouses,  carriers, sellers, and resellers. In other words, the monitoring  reaches 80 percent and, when this outfitting is completed, we'll  achieve 100 percent.    [Montoya] Is the drug traffic currently a priority for the  National Police of Peru?    [Taboada] In fact, since last year, since September if I'm  not mistaken, we have begun attaching greater importance to the  interdiction of the drug traffic. You must have heard through  the news media that the DINCOTE's [National Counterterrorism  Directorate] personnel are going to be reduced. What will be  reinforced is the DINANDRO's activity, in order to achieve  greater success.    [Montoya] Minister Briones has stated that, in 1994, he  expects the DINANDRO to become an office with success similar to  that of the DINCOTE. Do you all feel identified with this kind  of expectation on the part of your superior chiefs?    [Taboada] It is not merely an expectation or desire that is  involved, but also logistical support. They are backing us so as  to convert us, this year, into the police unit that will accrue  outstanding success.    [Montoya] Does this apply to your personnel's income and  bonuses, as well?    [Taboada] A system is being introduced whereby we give  bonuses to the personnel, but according to the number of  seizures, and not daily or monthly.  <H5>  PBC Prices Falling: Drug Traffic Reorganizing in Peru? </H5>   In the case of Peru, the price of washed PBC, the principal  illegal export product, has virtually plummeted thus far in the  1990's. At first glance, this would appear to affect the  influence of cash flow from this activity on the Peruvian  economy. Nevertheless, at the same time, the drop in basic paste  prices could be one of the leading economic factors in the  expansion of coca crops on nearly all of the Peruvian jungle  border. However, it is also an incentive for growing other  crops, such as poppies, which are still incipient in Peru.    One possibility is that a period of reorganizing this  illegal  activity is beginning, wherein coca derivatives will continue to  be the main product, but with an outcome not yet possible to  predict. It is likely that this downward price trend will  continue. However, it is also important that an impetus be given  to the alternative development projects, as a centerpiece of the  antidrug plans.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs surprise may put Fed action on hold THE Treasury bond market's hopes of another easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve seem to have been put on temporary hold as a result of better-than-expected jobs figures for April. However, judging by the market's ability to shrug off ultimately the news that some 126,000 non-farm jobs were created in April, it would appear that traders still think a quarter-point cut in the Fed funds target is likely, possibly in the early part of June. Trading was extremely volatile on Friday, as the market absorbed the news of a tiny drop in the unemployment rate, from 7.3 to 7.2 per cent, looked more closely at the figures, remembered the weakness of money supply, and then rallied. The market had been in a reasonable mood last week as some Dollars 36bn of quarterly refunding went well. The weakening of money supply figures, including a Dollars 9.7bn drop in M-2 for the week ended April 27, also encouraged investors, who believed a rate cut by the Fed was around the corner. It was in this environment that the initial reaction to the new jobs figures was a brief mark down, especially as a Federal Reserve staffer was quoted as telling Market News that a further Fed easing was now unlikely 'since the economy is expanding'. Yet Ms Maria Ramirez, the capital markets analyst, pointed out that 75 per cent of the 126,000 increase in jobs were temporary service sector positions that, in any case, tend to be over-estimated. Only 8,000 of the new jobs were in manufacturing, hardly an indication of a boom, or even of a rosy recovery. The bottom line, as the bond watchers at Salomon Brothers noted, is that the jobs data, while stronger than expected, will not challenge the 7 3/4 per cent to 8 1/8 per cent trading range in which bonds have lingered for the past three months. The pace of expansion should remain moderate, keeping the bond market deadlocked in this trading range, Salomon said. The yield curve also remains extremely steep, with about 300 basis points separating two-year notes and the benchmark 30-year bonds. The 30-year paper was yielding 7.89 per cent on Friday, which represented a rally of nearly one point on the day. Looking ahead, some economists are arguing - and presumably many in the bond market agree - that the Fed will want to do more to stimulate bank lending and perhaps money supply growth as well. The so-called credit crunch is meant to be tapering off, and there have been encouraging signs that regional bank lending is growing much more than the sluggish 1 per cent average annual rise in loans for all banks. Inflation should not be a worry for the Fed, according to most analysts. The forecasts for next week suggest a rise in the April producer price index (PPI), of 0.2 to 0.3 per cent, and in the consumer price index (CPI), of 0.1 to 0.3 per cent. By the same token, expectations for April retail sales - a decline of between 0.1 and 0.5 per cent - also point to an economic environment that could well be conducive to a rate cut by the Fed. The jobs data may have, therefore, been more a flicker of hope - especially for those politicians wishing to portray America in solid recovery - than a decisive trend-setter. It's still a near-sighted market. Latest US interest rates now appear on the Currencies, Money and Capital Markets page</p>

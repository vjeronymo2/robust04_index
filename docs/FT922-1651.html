			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Ireland stalled after GPA aborts take-off - Dublin's underperformance has caused brokers to cut their growth forecasts Dealers on the Irish stock market have been holding their breath for the past week, awaiting two of the biggest events of the year that could have made a significant impact on the market. As it happened, the effects of one cancelled out the effects of the other. GPA's crash on take-off on Thursday has deprived the Irish market of what would have been its biggest quoted stock, boosting its current market capitalisation of IPounds 7.9bn (Dollars 13.45bn) by some IPounds 2bn. The good news yesterday, however, was the approval of the Maastricht treaty in what was expected to be a cliff-hanger referendum. The fall on the Danish market following the 'No' vote there at the beginning of the month had created expectations of similar falls in Dublin and a slump in confidence if the vote went against the treaty. Share prices firmed yesterday as reports came in from around the country of what appeared to be a two-to-one vote in favour. The failure of the GPA flotation had caused deep disappointment among brokers, institutions and corporate financiers who feel the market is too often viewed from abroad as a financial backwater, harbouring a few graceful swans but accompanied by a lot of unexciting ducklings. As one broker said: 'It is a problem of scale. No foreign institution is going to hold a significant chunk of Irish stock, and although there is interest in the bigger stocks, most feel they cannot justify a commitment of resources to specifically follow the Irish market.' Nonetheless, trading has been showing greater signs of life this year, following a decline in business towards the end of last year. According to Mr Tom Healey, the exchange's general manager: 'the first quarter of this year has shown the highest level of business of any quarter since the beginning of 1990. This has been achieved without once-off 'boosts' such as the Greencore and Irish Life privatisations last year and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.' Average daily turnover has averaged IPounds 16.3m so far this year, 17.3 per cent up on the 1991 average. Market values, having rallied in the first part of the year, have since slid back. The ISEQ index stood at 1,361.8, up 6.4 on the day but down 1.4 per cent from the end of 1991, and almost 10 per cent down on last year's peak of 1,510. 'The new finance bill this year has made bank deposits a lot more attractive than equity investments and there hasn't been the money flowing into the institutions,' says an equity analyst at Solomon's stockbrokers in Dublin. The bill has given a tax advantage to putting money into bank deposits, rather than into equity-linked savings and has created a furore in Dublin's financial community. Under pressure, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, has said that, in general, he will consider extending similar tax benefits 'to certain types of investments'. Yesterday's slight advance in the ISEQ on the news of the referendum vote was not as great as some had expected. 'It's a small market and will take some time for it to digest the impact of the GPA flop,' according to Solomon's. Irish Life, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, which together had hoped to dispose of some Dollars 18m of GPA shares in the aborted combined offer, all suffered falls on Thursday, and, although they recovered yesterday, the gains were not as great as most had expected, given the referendum news. The underperformance of the Irish market has resulted in brokers revising downwards their bullish 15-20 per cent growth forecasts of earlier this year. Mr Kevin Barry, head of research at NCB stockbrokers, says: 'I would be surprised to see it up by more than 10 per cent now, given there is only six months of the year left.' Brokers remain hopeful though, that foreign buyers will move in looking for bargains. 'There is no fundamental problem of corporate earnings. The underperformance of the Irish market does make the stocks look increasingly cheap,' says Mr Barry. Gilts turnover continues to be by far the biggest business of the exchange, amounting to IPounds 20.2bn for the first five months of the year, or an average of IPounds 195m per business day. Earlier this month the stock exchange introduced a new gilt turnover service, which is now publishing the daily turnover. Mr Healey said that there had been resistance to publishing the figures, similar to that encountered when the equities turnover service was introduced. 'The small size of the market here, and the dominance of a few big brokers and institutions, made some people nervous that it might be possible to easily identify the source of any big movements of funds. 'Those fears disappeared though when we introduced the equities turnover service, and most people are pleased with the market's greater transparency.'</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters slides Reuters Holdings fell sharply in afternoon trading as US investors took a dim view of the news and electronic information group's half-year results. The Pounds 245m profit was in line with analysts' forecasts but there was some concern over the operating margin. The company said investment in new acquisitions and new business investment programmes accounted for the slight margin decline and added that sales growth had slowed in May and June. It appeared that Mr Peter Job, the traditionally downbeat chief executive, disappointed US analysts and after the company conference the shares traded in the form of American Depositary Receipts fell sharply. They were down more than 5 per cent by the close of London trading and prompted the UK shares to fall 21 to 459p with very heavy turnover of 14m shares. Pharmaceuticals stocks were affected by comment in one US newspaper questioning their ability to maintain high dividend payments. The article cited Marrion Merrell Dow and Glaxo, which fell 13 to 559p. Wellcome dropped 6 to 634p, although there was some support from a study which showed that its anti-AIDS treatment AZT or Retrovr could cut transmission of HIV from mothers to babies significantly. SmithKline Beecham held steady with a gain of 1 1/2 to 419 1/2 p in anticipation that the US Food and Drug administration would give approval for over-the-counter selling of Tagamet, the company's anti-ulcer treatment. Oil major BP, the leading Alaskan oil producer, held slipped a half penny to 411 1/2p despite reports that the Clinton administration was making significant progress in drafting legislation to lift a 21-year-old ban on exports of Alaskan North Slope crude oil. Shell Transport was affected by reports that production at a Nigerian gas lifting plant had been cut by a third following an explosion. The company, which produces half of Nigeria's oil, denied an explosion had taken place but the shares ended the day 6 lower at 726p. Burmah Castrol slid 23 to 865p after agency broker James Capel moved its recommendation to hold from buy because of higher oil prices and the shares' recent strong performance. Capel has increased its forecast for the average 1994 oil price to Dollars 16.50 a barrel from Dollars 15. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT fell 8 to 435p as good news on the tobacco side was countered by disappointing figures from the Eagle Star insurance arm. Motor dealer Lex Service tumbled 30 to 447p after reporting interim figures below market expectations. Engineering group IMI hardened a penny to 328p after NatWest Securities upgraded 1995 profit expectations. Leaving its current year forecast at Pounds 84m, it raised the following year's estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 107.5m. Airports operator BAA, a strong performer in recent sessions, ran into profit-taking leaving the shares trailing 14 to 980p. British Airways eased 3 to 426p after it said it may challenge yesterday's decision by the EC to allow its rival Air France to receive FFr20bn in state aid. Food and drink manufacturer Cadbury Schweppes climbed 9 to 435p as marketmakers covered positions in what was described as a classic bear squeeze. A surge in auction sales helped Sotheby's rise 13 to 828p. Reports of takeover activity in the hotels sector ruffled some feathers but failed to make much impact on share prices. Forte, which is said to be attempting to persuade shareholders in the Savoy Group to support its ambitions for a combined luxury hotel group, moved ahead in early trading before sliding back to close a halfpenny ahead at 231 1/2p. Savoy 'A' shares finished 2 adrift at 968p. 600 Group rose 5 to 64p after an upbeat AGM message from the chairman. The company said sales and orders were ahead of last year's comparable figure and the company's new products were being well received in the market. Other statistics, Page 35</p>

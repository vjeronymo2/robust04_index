			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Trong </F> Xuyen, member of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central  Committee and deputy defense minister, by correspondent Pham  Minh Chau; place, date not given]    [Summary] [Pham Minh Chau] "Dear Comrade Deputy Minister:  As chairman of the Committee for Fighting Corruption and  Smuggling under the Ministry of National Defense, how do you see  the evil of corruption and smuggling in the Army?"    [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption and smuggling are painful  evils imposed on our people. The party and state have  introduced many resolutions, directives, and measures to stop  these evil practices, but the results have been very limited.  Our Army is a part of society. Therefore, the evils of  corruption and smuggling have also appeared in the Army.  Because of its tight control and different operational  characteristics, however, corruption and smuggling are less  severe, with very few serious cases in the Army.    "The most common form of corruption and smuggling in the  Army  is when private traders lure greedy military personnel and units  to be a front for their illegal businesses. Some units also use  military vehicles to transport smuggled goods or use military  facilities to store smuggled goods. Some units allow their  troops to smuggle goods while carrying out their economic  duties. Yet the number of these cases and the quantity of goods  involved is not great."    At present, the Ministry is investigating military units  that  have bought smuggled cars to sell for profit.    "Regarding corruption, its main manifestation is the  exploitation of management positions and authority over  controlling materials and budgets to accept bribes. They also  take advantage of payment loopholes to create a difference  between the actual cost and the amount of money recorded on  paper or on an invoice in order to appropriate state property,  budget money, and unit funds. This type of corruption is  normally practiced in infrastructure construction projects  because of the great amount of money and materials, management  difficulties, and loopholes in payment procedures."    [Pham Minh Chau] "Dear Comrade Deputy Minister, can you  brief  us on the results of the fight against corruption and smuggling  in the Army following the issuance of directives by the party  Central Committee Secretariat and the prime minister?"    [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] It is possible to say that our Ministry  has strictly observed the party Political Bureau directive, the  National Assembly resolution, and the government directives on  fighting corruption and smuggling. The Military Inspection  Section has worked with military leaders to conduct financial,  logistical, material management, and transport management  inspections in units suspected of corruption. It also  coordinates with market management teams to clarify some cases.  By checking 613 military vehicles in the 5th, 7th, and 9th  Military Regions and in two armed corps, we discovered 20  vehicles transporting illegal goods. We also discovered more  than 30 civilian vehicles using military registration plates to  carry smuggled goods. In the fourth quarter of 1993 and the  first quarter of 1994, military inspection and control organs  discovered and filed charges in many corruption cases. In the  first quarter of 1994, we imposed penalties on 14 cadres and  party members for corruption and 27 other military personnel for  smuggling. The results achieved in the fight against corruption  and smuggling have brought about positive changes, but compared  to the requirement they are still far from our expectations.    [Pham Minh Chau] "Based on those cases of corruption and  smuggling you have uncovered, can you cite the main causes of  these evils in the Army?"    [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] There are many causes; they have been  mentioned in several state and section meetings, conferences,  and seminars. We have talked enough about the causes of  corruption and smuggling. The causes of these evils in the Army  are the same as elsewhere. In the Army, the most direct and  important cause is the lack of responsibility and proper  management by leaders and unit commanders over their  subordinates. We must differentiate two separate sets of  circumstances, though. The first is intentionally creating  conditions and providing the necessary papers for personal  benefit. The second, which is more common, is a lack of  vigilance and knowledge of the law and state and army  regulations by Army leaders. Their subordinates take advantage  of this to practice corruption and smuggling. In any event, the  leaders still have to be responsible for wrongdoings in their  units.    [Pham Minh Chau] "So in the future, what measures should be  taken to prevent and fight corruption and smuggling  sufficiently?"    [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption poses a danger to our  renovation undertaking. Fighting corruption and smuggling is an  important undertaking of the entire party, people, and Army and  all of society. The Central Military Party Committee and the  Ministry are resolutely fighting these evils in the Army because  this is one of the urgent requirements to build a revolutionary  army.    Regarding practical measures to prevent and fight corruption  and smuggling, each unit needs to establish its most appropriate  and effective way of fighting. Whatever measures are taken,  though, they must concentrate on three fundamental measures:  combining education and management with inspection, maintaining  tight control, and strictly punishing violations according to  state laws and military discipline.    Fighting corruption and smuggling is a very complicated task  because humans have hidden diseases. We believe that with unity  between management and command and between the higher and lower  levels, together with public participation, the fight will  achieve actual results on the way toward eliminating these evils  step by step to restore military discipline and order, thus  earning the trust and love of the party, state, and people.    [Pham Minh Chau] Thank you, Comrade Deputy Minister.</p>

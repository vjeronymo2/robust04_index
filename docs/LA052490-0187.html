			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> RECYCLING CENTER ON POLLUTED SITE URGED  </P> <P> As part of an effort to develop 40 acres of city-owned land partly contaminated  with high levels of methane, Mayor Thomas J. Mays on Wednesday unveiled a  proposal for a mobile recycling center on the site.  </P> <P> Mays is championing an offer made this week by a Chino-based firm to establish  a facility -- at no cost to the city -- to reuse wood and concrete waste from  redevelopment projects, tree trimming and other work.  </P> <P> Pomona Valley Environmental Inc. would use part of its income from reselling  the materials to pay the estimated $4-million cost of setting up the center and  all future operating costs.  </P> <P> The city would also receive a percentage of the firm's revenues, which Mays  said would probably average about $400,000 per year.  </P> <P> The recycling center would incorporate the wood shredder and concrete crusher  the firm is now using in clearing the abandoned Ocean View Mushroom Farm next  to the methane-plagued site. The proposed facility, which city staff officials  are studying, would use five acres of a 17.6-acre parcel, a former Orange  County dump site extending along Talbert Avenue from Golden West Avenue to  Gothard Avenue, which a city-hired consultant reported last month is highly  contaminated with methane gas.  </P> <P> That discovery jeopardized city plans to build a golf course there and relocate  nearby mobile home residents to the site, since state law prohibits the  construction of new residences within 600 feet of a methane-contaminated site.  </P> <P> Mitigating the problem would cost nearly $7 million, according to the report.  But for a recycling facility, the methane dilemma could be solved for about  $1.2 million, the study said. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Banks seek changes to rules covering BT sale THE government is to consider a request from some of the biggest high street banks to amend the regulatory rules covering share dealings in the sale of part of its stake in British Telecom. The radical proposal to cut the 'regulatory red tape' is in response to the government's call for innovative ideas as to how to distribute the stake The banks want retail institutions offering shares in the sale to the public to be exempt from some of the tougher clauses contained in the Financial Services Act. In the first of a series of meetings with Treasury officials and SG Warburg, the government's lead adviser in the sale, the banks will today argue that the red tape is putting off shops and building societies from selling the shares. The Treasury has called for ideas from financial institutions to be sent or given to it by May 19. Under the present regulatory rules any company selling shares has to be regulated by either the Securities and Investment Board (SIB) or one of the other self-regulatory organisations. The banks want the government to offer a list of retail houses which want to sell BT shares a simpler regulatory framework or cheaper associated membership of one of the SROs. They want the Government to distinguish between the big stockbrokers and smaller retail institutions which might be persuaded to sell the BT shares. Some of the banks believe that high street shops, such as Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury, could be persuaded to sell the shares if the regulatory framework was simplified. Mr Tony Vine-Lott, managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers, the bank's retail share dealing service, said: 'The Government should provide a new simpler regulatory framework with SIB or another SRO from an approved list of organisations willing to sell the BT shares.' Mr Steve Crockford, director of Midland Bank's stockbroking service, said: 'The Government must recognise that there should be a difference in the regulatory rules between small retail organisations which want to sell BT shares and the all-bells-all-whistling stockbroking service offered by the big institutions.' Most of the banks are members of the Securities and Futures Authority, formerly The Securities Association. The first 10 employees selling shares have to be registered for an individual annual fee of Pounds 500, the next 90 at Pounds 260. If the building societies chose to be regulated by SIB the cost is between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 100,000, depending on the number of investment staff. The Cheltenham and Gloucester building society pulled out of SIB in September 1989 after its fees went up tenfold to more than Pounds 100,000. Although SIB has since reformed its compliance costs many of the banks believe its fees are still prohibitive. A spokesman for the Cheltemham and Gloucester said it would reconsider joining an SRO if the costs were reduced. In another proposal to sell the BT shares to as many investors as possible, National Westminster will call for tax advantages to buy and hold shares and greater education in the merits of share ownership. Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of National Westminster Stockbrokers, called for a more 'equitable relationship' between investors buying and selling shares. Other proposals include enabling potential BT shareholders to register for shares before the share price is announced on the basis that they will be guaranteed a certain amount of shares. Some of the banks also believe they could offer more 'user friendly' share services if the investor could have his account debited directly on buying the shares in his branch, thereby relieving him of the trouble of writing out a cheque. Dewe Rogerson, the financial advertising and public relations group, has been chosen by BT and the Treasury to market the sale of part of the Government's BT stake. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DELAWARE TOPS MANUFACTURING LIST  </P> <P> Delaware is the most attractive state for manufacturing, according to a survey  of state officials and business groups issued today by the accounting firm  Grant Thornton.  </P> <P> Delaware replaced New Hampshire, which fell from No. 1 in the 1988 survey to  No. 3 in this year's edition behind Virginia.  </P> <P> Peter Praetz, manager of the survey, said Delaware was favored because of its  skilled work force, wage levels and government policies toward manufacturing.  </P> <P> Praetz acknowledged that states such as New Hampshire, Vermont and Mississippi  -- usually ranked high in the survey -- have not become manufacturing giants.  </P> <P> And states ranked low on the list, including No. 22-ranked California, have had  significant growth in manufacturing in the last year, he said.  </P></p>

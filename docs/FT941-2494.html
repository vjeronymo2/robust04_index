			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Modest local poll win for Balladur Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right coalition government yesterday won a modest victory in the first round of France's local council elections. But the socialist opposition also claimed success by improving on its dire performance in last March's parliamentary poll. The centre-right won 44.7 per cent of the votes in the first round which encompassed 2,018 of France's 4,033 local council seats and which was the first significant test of confidence in the Balladur government since it came to power last March. The socialists and their allies emerged with 28.77 per cent of the poll and the communists with 11.45 per cent. Mr Balladur last night described the result as 'favourable' to his government. Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, hailed it as the start of a 'very clear revival' for the left. 'The good times are over for the right, the bad times are over for the left,' he said. The local elections have come at a critical time for the prime minister whose popularity has slipped recently on concern about high unemployment and a wave of violent strikes and demonstrations across France. The elections will be concluded next Sunday with a second round of voting. The extreme-right wing National Front yesterday secured 9.78 per cent of the votes, consolidating its position after last year's parliamentary poll. The ecologists, weakened by internal squabbles, emerged with 2.62 per cent of the votes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry on  Monday denied as "not factual" the recent claim by a British  military expert that the discarded submarines bought by North  Korea may be used for military purposes.    An article written by a British international naval forces  expert and that appeared in the recently published "Jane's  Warships, '94- '95," alleged that North Korea has purchased 40  submarines from Russia and that there is the danger of the  submarines being used for military purposes in North Korea.    "We have asked Russia about the claim through our consulate  general in Vladivostok and Russian authorities said there is no  such danger at all," a ministry official said.    Russia, he said, explained they had sold 12 discarded  submarines, instead of 40 as claimed by Jane's, to North Korea,  and only one of them has actually been delivered to Pyongyang.    Even this one submarine has no way but to be used as scrap  because the Russian military had removed from the submarine all  those parts that could be used militarily, the official said.</p>

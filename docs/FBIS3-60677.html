			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Dec. 23 (YONHAP)--Seoul officials said  Thursday they remained optimistic of a breakthrough in the North  Korean nuclear impasse after another Pyongyang-Washington  contact in New York the same day.    One official, declining to be identified, said that a North  Korea-U.S. high-level contact for a third round of nuclear talks  may be agreed on next month.    Confirming the New York contact early Thursday morning, the  officials said that the United States demanded North Korea  accept inspections acceptable to the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) and necessary to continue IAEA safeguards.    It also demanded resumption of inter-Korean dialogue on the  nuclear issue and meaningful negotiations, they said.    The U.S. side made it clear that the demands were  preconditions, they said.    ``You could say there are forward movements,'' said one  official.    The very fact that the contacts are occurring quickly  signifies that the differences between North Korea and the  United States are ``not very big,'' he said.    The two sides met on Monday with North Korea's response to  the two demands by South Korea and the United States. The  response was rated as positive by both Seoul and Washington,  though not enough.    Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the  United Nations and the representative at the New York contact,  said he suggested ``simultaneous steps'' in meeting demands of  both sides.    Pyongyang reportedly suggested accepting overall IAEA  inspections on all of its declared sites instead of limiting  them to handpicked facilities in exchange for suspension of the  South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise Team Spirit and the  scheduling of the third round of high-level talks.</p>

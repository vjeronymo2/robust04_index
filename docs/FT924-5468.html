			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Trust Bank of New Zealand ahead 28% TRUST Bank, New Zealand's only remaining locally-owned trading bank, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 27.1m (USDollars 14.2m) for the six months to September 30, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The directors said they expected profits to be up 20 per cent for the full year. Last year, the bank earned NZDollars 42.4m. The country's other leading banks have been sold overseas - a process that accelerated after deregulation of the country's banking system in 1984. Mr Graeme Pentecost, managing director, said the result showed the bank was recovering from losses on its commercial book, which marred the last full-year result. He said the improved performance reflected continuing growth and a rising share of the local market. The bank has been promoting the fact that it is locally owned. Trust Bank increased its housing book by Dollars NZ310m to NZDollars 3.5bn in the period. Assets climbed NZDollars 400m to NZDollars 7bn. The bad debts reserve remained at NZDollars 27.3m. Mr Pentecost said the bank's risk-adjusted capital adequacy ratio had strengthened from 9.9 to 10per cent, ahead of the New Zealand Reserve Bank's requirement of 8 per cent.</p>

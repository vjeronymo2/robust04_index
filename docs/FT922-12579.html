			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / G7 partners may urge Japan to boost economy JAPAN MAY be urged by its trading partners among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to consider further fiscal stimulus to boost its economy when G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meet in Washington later this month. European monetary officials said that Japan was the only big industrial country in a position to boost its economy and so help world growth. The US, which is likely to be the G7 nation keenest on promoting expansionary policies abroad, recognises that the European members of the group have little scope for action. If it chose fiscal expansion, Japan could reduce the risk of downward pressure on the yen that would arise from a further relaxation of monetary policy, officials added. They said there were indications that Japan might give its economy a fiscal boost by bringing spending from the second half of the year forward to the first half. It emerged yesterday that the recent weakness of the Tokyo stock market has caused considerable concern among officials from other industrialised countries. But in a series of recent gatherings that included last weekend's meeting of Working Party Three of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and this week's regular central bankers' meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Japan assured its trading partners that the stock market problems were containable.</p>

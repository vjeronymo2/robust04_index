			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S THE BEEF (AGAIN);  </P> <P> HAMBURGER JOINT'S OWNERS USE FOOD TRUCK TO DISH UP TREATS AFTER FIRE SHUTS  STAND  </P> <P> Like a greasy phoenix rising from the ashes, Meaty Meat Burgers has reopened  for business.  </P> <P> The hamburger stand lost its home last month, when a late-night fire consumed  the tin-and-wood roof and walls of the former bus shelter at the corner of Pico  Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.  </P> <P> "Don't Panic, We Will Be Back in two or three Weeks," said a sign painted on  the wall of the eatery, which is as well known for its jaunty name and bilious  green paint job as it is for its highly spiced hamburgers.  </P> <P> But after taking a week off, the owners rented a caterer's truck and went back  to dishing out their simple fare -- single or double burgers with bacon, egg,  chile or cheese, on three sizes of bun with "mayo," mustard, onion, pickle,  tomato and lettuce.  </P> <P> "We want to keep our customers coming back and happy while we build," said  Sharon Rector, daughter of owner Delphinia Langford, who opened Meaty Meat  Burgers 11 years ago.  </P> <P> Five family members and two long-time employees have been working there ever  since, serving a clientele who come on foot, by bus and in vehicles ranging  from rusty jalopies to gleaming Mercedes-Benzes.  </P> <P> "The only thing special is it's cooked with love," Rector said. "It's just a  good home hamburger, that's all."  </P> <P> The cramped outdoor seating area with its 12 red-topped stools -- now closed  off because of the fire -- was an informal place where strangers found it easy  to chat, customer Kimberly Garland said.  </P> <P> "This is a good place to come after an all-night party," she said. "There's  something about a Meaty Meat Burger. It sort of absorbs the alcohol."  </P> <P> Jay Malter, who said he has been a customer about once a week for five years,  said he found the thick patty to be "just like what hamburgers used to be when  we were kids, before McDonald's and plastic came out."  </P> <P> An architect is drawing up plans for the new Meaty Meat, Rector said, but the  family wants it to keep its homey look. "We feel it's a landmark," she said.  </P> <P> The early-morning fire, the origin of which is still undetermined, left the  outdoor dining area untouched and only charred the iron grill and cooktop where  as many as 400 patties a day would sizzle.  </P> <P> But the bright green paint scheme, which includes a wall painting of a  cheeseburger against a mountain landscape, may have to go. "We just don't know  about that," she said.  </P> <P> In May, Meaty Meat's hamburger was rated "best in Los Angeles" by a Times  reviewer, who praised it as a "people's burger -- fatty, peppery meat . . . all  the works and not much money . . . "  </P> <P> Not everyone sees it that way, of course. The reviewer "must have been  hallucinating," a reader wrote, calling it "a lousy $4 meal."  </P></p>

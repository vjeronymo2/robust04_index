			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (1): Recovery will be a long slog - Derbyshire is affected by many of the pressures bearing down on UK society - all of which crystallise into the single, crucial question of how to find jobs. The answer is as elusive in Derbyshire as elsewhere in the UK THE UK comes together in Derbyshire. This is not just because the county, in the heart of England, is a linchpin between the Midlands, the north-west and Yorkshire. It is not just because, within a relatively narrow area, Derbyshire embraces the main characteristics illustrating the contrasting geographical facets of picture-postcard rural England and drab urban landscape. It is also because Derbyshire is a microcosm of the pressures bearing down on UK society. Here there are the classic problems of economic restructuring, the shift away from old traditional industries to new high-technology light manufacturing. Here there are the difficulties both of reshaping a sluggish rural economy and of urban regeneration. Here there have been the tensions between central and local government. Here, of pressing immediate importance, are the ravages of recession compounded by the threat to the remaining coalmines of the county. All of the pressures crystallise into the single crucial question of how to find jobs, both for those who have lost them and for those entering the labour market in the near and medium terms. The question can be no more clearly answered in Derbyshire than anywhere else in the UK. The immediate response among public authorities is to start talking of inward investment with the customary obeisance to the skilled and adaptable workforce. But there is no measure of this skill and adaptability relative to any other area in Britain. And it is not clear what will be the source of this inward investment. The chances of investment on the scale of Toyota, the Japanese car manufacturer - shortly to start production at a Pounds 700m plant in Burnaston, to the south of the county - seems unlikely to be repeated in the immediate future. There has been no rush of Japanese companies to follow it. The taste of Japanese companies for overseas investment, in any case, has been soured by domestic economic problems. It is true that the strengthening of the UK vehicles and components sector, within which the Japanese involvement and the growing internationalisation of domestic producers are significant factors, could spin off more vigorously into Derbyshire. But, for the moment, the region of attraction for continental European companies has not been the East Midlands, of which Derbyshire is a part, but the West Midlands. To the extent that Derbyshire has actively sought inward investment, it has concentrated on manufacturing. This seems likely to continue. For the service sector, the blandishment of lower property costs than the south of England has lost appeal as a surplus of office space has built up in the Home Counties. Indeed, the Prison Service, which had planned to relocate to Derby, found that it could not afford to move. Beyond that, industry rather than services gives the county its economic backbone. While there is a case for building up a stronger independent services sector to provide diversification as a protection against the economic cycles, Derbyshire in the national context has probably lost that game to Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. Of course, it is not surprising that inward investment should be seen as an antidote to the difficulties building up in the county economy. The decision of Toyota to go to the county was not only the investment coup of the 1980s. It was also, arguably, the single most significant corporate decision to have affected Derbyshire for a generation. Repetition by other companies, albeit on a smaller scale, would provide dynamism in an economy which, like so many others in the recession, has been winding down. After all, the presence of Toyota gave the economy, especially in the south, a stimulus that held off the full impact of the recession longer than in most UK areas. As recent business surveys have shown, it prompted more confidence about the future among business leaders than has been evident elsewhere in the East Midlands. Further, inward investment, were it to take place, would help to offset the effects of the threatened closure of three collieries, with the loss of nearly 3,000 mining jobs, in the declining coalfield of north-east Derbyshire. Hence the plea for the government to give Assisted Area status to Chesterfield and allow national and European Community subsidies to assist investment. But, given the UK recession, the decline of industrial production in Japan, the hesitant recovery of the US economy and the subdued outlook in continental Europe, it is unlikely that Derbyshire in the near future will experience fresh inward investment on a scale that provides sustained economic impetus. The county, like so many others, is forced back to the conclusion that the best hope for growth lies in the expansion of existing companies, the succouring of smaller companies which will be the Rolls-Royces, Brels and Courtaulds of tomorrow. It remains to be seen whether the Autumn Statement earlier this month is the harbinger of economic recovery and a commercial climate which will turn that hope to reality. If not, then probably the best which can be expected is static economic performance accompanied by a build-up of social problems. Unemployment has been rising steadily across the county although it remains below the national average in some rural areas. In Derby, the rate has climbed from 7 per cent to 12.8 per cent in two years, but that average hides the fact that in one inner city suburb the rate reached 30 per cent. For the past five years, the unemployment rate in the Chesterfield area has been running at about 23 per cent above the national average. More people chasing fewer jobs has led, since the beginning of 1991, to a rapid build-up in the numbers of the long-term unemployed - those who have been out of work for more than a year, according to county council analysis earlier this year. The worst-affected areas, in terms of totals, are Chesterfield and north-east Derbyshire. But parts of Derby are exhibiting that painful British urban phenomenon: a growing concentration of people living outside the ebb and flow of the economy. Even when the economy is expanding they do not obtain jobs. This particular difficulty is being addressed by City Challenge, the government urban regeneration scheme which, after competitive bidding, funnels into a specific area Pounds 37.5m over five years. More generally, the immediate prospects for the unemployed are not encouraging. Both the North Derbyshire and the Derby &amp; Derbyshire Chambers of Commerce, in their latest business surveys undertaken before the Autumn Statement, reported a downturn in orders. Derby &amp; Derbyshire noted that 40 per cent of the manufacturing companies in its area employing less than 19 people had experienced during the third quarter a decrease in home orders. In the second quarter, 40 per cent of them had found their order books growing. North Derbyshire observed a deteriorating financial situation for companies in its area: in September, 38 per cent reported a worsening cashflow, compared with 31 per cent in June and 20 per cent in March. The number of manufacturing companies operating at full capacity fell to 15 per cent from 28 per cent over the third quarter. Even if the Autumn Statement checks the recession, the impact of recovery will be slow to seep through. In any case the recovery will need to be sustained and far-reaching to provide an economic panacea for the north-east: the continuing struggle to shift dependence away from industries based on coal and steel will enter a new and acute phase in the event of coalmine closures. The county faces a long slog.</p>

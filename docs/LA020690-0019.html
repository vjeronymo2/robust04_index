			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LEAST 75% OF THE WAY TO TALKS;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: EVEN COMMUNISM IS DE-DEMONIZED. BARNACLES OF APARTHEID REMAIN,  BUT REPRESSION IS THE LOSER.  </P> <P> A journalist friend in Cape Town arrived home after heavy celebrating last  Friday evening to find a message from the South African Communist Party on his  telex machine.  </P> <P> This would have been unheard of the day before, when hobnobbing with the  Communist Party could have resulted in a prison term. That is the measure of  change introduced by President Frederik W. de Klerk the same day.  </P> <P> Uncharacteristic response from black opposition leaders, such as "incredible"  and "deeply impressed," greeted news that African National Congress stalwart  Nelson Mandela is to be freed, banned organizations legalized, some press  restrictions lifted, political prisoners released, the death penalty suspended  and exiles welcome to return home.  </P> <P> The masses marched for joy in the cities, watched by low-profile police.  </P> <P> The "de-demonizing" of the Communist ogre -- for years the main focus of  government hostility toward black nationalism -- was perhaps the most  unexpected and symbolic event. It placed South Africa in fairly enlightened  Western company.  </P> <P> Shorn of its underground mystique, the Communist Party must now show its  strength -- or its weakness -- in an environment of freed black nationalism.  Its leaders concede in the aftermath of the shocks in the East Bloc that  strategic reconsideration lies ahead. There is no doubt that the new freedoms  and ideological confusions in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have  contributed directly to the de-demonization process in South Africa.  </P> <P> The old South African propaganda target -- repressive Stalinist communism --  hardly exists.  </P> <P> De Klerk's quantum leap -- which this writer judges to be at least 75% of the  way necessary to create conditions for realistic talks with the ANC --  underscores a modern-day truth: The world of the microchip and fax machine,  notably the capacity to speed freedom ideas from one corner of the earth to the  other, ensures that things will never be the same. Repression is the loser.  </P> <P> South Africa is poised for the first time since the 1950s to negotiate rather  than fight over the question of democratic rights for all. The crass bans on  the Communist Party in 1950 and on the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress in  1960 have been rectified at last. We are back to the 1950s, but in a much  changed world.  </P> <P> Stubborn, crusty barnacles of apartheid remain to be pried from the body  politic. Whites must get used to the idea of taking their place in society  according to their skills and numbers, like everyone else. The bad news is that  this enormous adjustment process could be lengthy and dangerous -- and could  yet founder.  </P> <P> De Klerk's reforms are a shiny but relatively small pool of freedom in an  environment of entrenched repression and racial discrimination. That  environment is a continuing state of emergency (with, for instance, police  power to detain without trial for up to six months), laws that restrict  individuals and organizations and crucial apartheid measures in government  schooling, living areas and land allocation, a racial population register and  separate constitutional rights.  </P> <P> The government is wedded to these, in some degree or other, and it will take  tough bargaining and pressure to change this.  </P> <P> De Klerk's generalized references, for instance, to "universal franchise" and  "equality before an independent judiciary," require fleshing out. He still  clings to the concept of group rights -- or "national entities" -- which could  mean a white veto over major decisions. A single one-person one-vote  constitution has so far not been acceptable to him or even to many in the  cautiously liberal Democratic Party opposition -- not to mention the  right-wing.  </P> <P> Yet black leaders of any standing will refuse a deal that they see as a ruse by  whites to appear to "share power" while in reality dividing and ruling the  black majority. They want majority rule.  </P> <P> That is the nitty-gritty of the months -- and probably years -- of negotiation  that lie ahead. De Klerk will no doubt seek to spin out the talks as long as  possible.  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, though, the beginning of the end of white rule has been sounded by  De Klerk himself. He has firm control of the process and will want to retain  it. Right-wing whites might well kick up a fuss. But judges who are relatively  independent in South Africa will be called on to deal with any excesses.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the country is promised a respite from the bloodletting and economic  and social damage of past years. If the potentially powerful economy starts to  reflect the hopes rather than the fears of all the people, that locomotive will  move to underpin the talks. Consequently, whites might fear a bit less and  militant blacks be a bit less angry. A tolerably free non-racial democracy at  the foot of Africa could emerge to match Eastern Europe's experiences in  freedom.  </P></p>

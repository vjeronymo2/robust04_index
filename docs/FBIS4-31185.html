			<p>BFN     [Text] The Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] has faxed  us a communique referring to the assertion made in Constanta [on  3 June] by Corneliu Vadim Tudor [senator and chairman of the  Greater Romania Party, PRM], during a news conference organized  in that city by the PRM. According to the communique, the SRI  press bureau has been authorized to publish the following:    The examination of the operational situation and the  information available in the reference domain does not confirm  the existence of any intention or real possibility of  assassinating the Romanian president or restoring the monarchy  in the near future.    The circulation of such news without the sufficient previous  checking of its likelihood needlessly creates confusion and  unrest or, on the contrary, it makes public opinion doubt the  seriousness of such assertions. The SRI communique concludes by  saying that, quote, however, if Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is  in possession of realistic information with respect to the  aforementioned issue, we invite him to publish it, unquote.</p>

Examine his  speeches, statements and interviews and you will find several  annoyed references to this or that "distraction" from his main  policy goals.    Loathing distraction is the meritorious hallmark of someone  with a mission. But it may also be the sign of someone who is  too single-minded, too determined to control the agenda -- and  inadequately prepared for the unexpected. It is the unexpected  that Clinton has to watch for in 1994.    Clinton, the man with a mission was very much in evidence in  his first State of the Union speech on Tuesday. He displayed  the rather frenzied energy and drive of a Cecil John Rhodes.  One could imagine him being dragged out of the White House in a  few years' time muttering, "so much to do, so little done." He  could invoke many solid achievements in his one year in office  so far, including cutting the gigantic American deficit by $500  billion and helping set the economy back on the road to  recovery, passing the North American Free Trade Agreement,  securing a GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]  agreement, getting Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan to agree to  scrap their nuclear weapons, pushing through legislation to  control guns, allowing students to work off loans, offering  leave to workers who have to tend sick family -- the list goes  on.    Working with a meagre 43 percent of the vote, he got over 86  percent of his legislation through Congress, a strike rate  beaten since World War 2 only by Johnson and Eisenhower. After  a year of incredible ups and downs when his public approval  rating fell to 37 percent at one point, he is again riding high  at around 60 percent -- his highest rate since taking office --  and 17 percentage points above his vote in the elections. Polls  show that the economy -- the big issue of his election campaign  -- is now receding as a concern of Americans, largely because it  is improving.    The economy has been replaced as a public concern by crime,  welfare reform and health care, in that order. In his state of  the union speech Clinton threw himself into those issues with  enthusiasm. Confounding many cautious voices in his own party,  he announced he would tackle two difficult, major reform tasks  at the same time -- health care and welfare -- as well as  several crime measures.    Health care reform will by itself be an enormous  undertaking,  involving a revamp of the health industry. The Republican Party  is opposed to this, so a major legislative battle will ensue.  Add to that welfare reform -- a controversial plan to terminate  welfare payments to anyone who has been on it for two years --  and several other initiatives, and you have the making of  another bumpy year.    And yet achieving his ambitious agenda may not be Clinton's  biggest worry. In 1993 he showed himself remarkably resilient  when focused and committed. The problem may instead be those  "distractions." Chief among them could be "Whitewatergate," the  web of vague accusations about improper dealings between  Arkansas Governor Clinton and a failed savings and loan company.    After resisting pressure for a special counsel to examine  the  allegations, Clinton gave in, saying that if he had not, the  affair might have distracted from his policy goals. This had  the desired effect. The press subsided. But the investigation  could still be a ticking time bomb.    Other potential distractions are in foreign affairs and  defence. Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti all intruded last year,  threatening to distract Clinton from his domestic agenda. These  volcanoes are not quite dormant yet and others still more  explosive -- such as Russia -- may be lurking. There is an  aspect of being president which Clinton seems to shun. That is  simply being on watch, ready to deal with whatever comes up --  even if it's not on the agenda.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AST TO INTRODUCE 2 SMALL COMPUTERS;  </P> <P> COMPETITION: PLANS TO MARKET NOTEBOOK-SIZED LAPTOPS THAT CAN BE UPGRADED HERALD  TOUGHER RIVALRY IN CROWDED FIELD.  </P> <P> Personal computer maker AST Research Inc. said Friday it plans to introduce two  notebook-sized computers that can be upgraded to suit a user's growing  performance requirements.  </P> <P> While AST is a late entrant to the crowded $2.1-billion laptop computer market,  computer analysts said the machines have advanced features and will cost less  than half the price of its nearest competitor.  </P> <P> "When you've got an outstanding product with the right features and the right  price, it's always the right time (to introduce it)," said James W. Ashbrook,  AST senior vice president of worldwide marketing.  </P> <P> Analysts said the introduction will create more competition in an already  crowded field. InfoCorp, a market research firm in Santa Clara, reports there  are more than 20 companies that are either developing or selling notebook  computers. The firm estimates sales of notebook machines, generally eight  pounds or lighter, increased 231% in 1990 to 890,000 units, compared to 260,000  a year earlier.  </P> <P> "There's going to be a blood bath in the portable computer market, and AST has  just made the first stab wound," said JoeAnn Stahel, president of  Storeboard/Computer Intelligence Inc., a market research firm in Dallas. "They  are serious."  </P> <P> AST's less expensive model, the Premium Exec 286/12 with a 20-megabyte hard  drive, is based on the Intel 80286 microprocessor and will sell for prices  beginning at $2,495. The higher-end model, the Premium Exec 386SX/20 with a  20-megabyte hard drive, is based on the Intel 80386SX microprocessor with  prices beginning at $2,995. Both models weigh about 6.5 pounds and are small  enough to fit in a briefcase.  </P> <P> The 386SX model competes with the Compaq LTE 386 s/20, a 7.5-pound notebook  computer introduced three weeks ago by Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. The  model has 30-megabyte hard drive and sells for prices starting at $6,500.  Compaq officials said Friday their machine is more powerful than AST's and  appropriately priced, but Ashbrook disagreed.  </P> <P> The AST model also competes with a notebook computer introduced last week by  Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas. The 5.7-pound TravelMate 3000 computer is  priced about $5,500.  </P> <P> "On the surface, it (the AST model) looks like a very aggressively priced  notebook," said Bruce Stephen, analyst at International Data Corp., a market  research firm in Framingham, Mass. "AST is a known name and it has good  distribution. It might do well."  </P> <P> AST is aiming the product at business people on the run, such as traveling  sales people, reporters, auditors, real estate and insurance field personnel.  </P> <P> The computers feature paper-white VGA graphics and can be expanded for  facsimile or modem options. They can operate on battery power for three hours,  and the batteries can be replaced in a "suspend mode" without disrupting work  on the screen.  </P> <P> Unlike other laptops on the market, the Premium Exec 286/12 model can be  upgraded to the more powerful 386SX microprocessor for $499. AST will introduce  the two machines formally at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas on  Nov. 12 and begin shipping them in December.  </P></p>

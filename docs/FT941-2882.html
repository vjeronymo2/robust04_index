			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Museums block Norton'sstrategy for a kick-start Attempts to kick-start the Norton motorcycle company by raising much-needed cash from the sale of 10 vintage motorcycles appeared close to breakdown yesterday. Lawyers acting for three British museums where the motorcycles have been on display - some of them for more than 50 years - have halted moves to return them to Norton Motors (1993), a Canadian-backed company which bought the famous manufacturer last year. The move is a blow for Norton, which had asked Sotheby's sell the fleet next month as part of its strategy to realise capital to restart production. Yesterday, however, curators at London's Science Museum, the National Motor Museum and the Museum of British Road Transport said they would not part with the vehicles, including an 1898 Ariel tricycle and 1905 Matchless, unless the company could prove its ownership. Mr David MacDonald, Norton's former chief executive, has written to the curators warning them that the company has no rights to the motorcycles. Norton has merged and changed hands several times since the motorcycles were loaned to the museums, and it could prove impossible to unravel which company now owns them. The Science Museum said yesterday: 'We're waiting for Norton to prove ownership. The matter is with our solicitors.' Norton, which has also called in its lawyers, said it remained confident it could sell the bikes.</p>

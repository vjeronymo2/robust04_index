			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COCAINE WORTH $1 BILLION SEIZED ON SHIP FROM PANAMA  </P> <P> With the permission of the Panamanian government in exile, federal agents  stopped a ship from Panama City and confiscated 3,359 pounds of cocaine, one of  the largest seizures in U.S. history, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Adm. Paul A. Yost, Coast Guard commandant, flew here from Washington for a news  conference on the seizure, which he called special because the street value of  the confiscated cocaine could have reached nearly $1 billion.  </P> <P> The 162-foot cement carrier Barlovento was heading for Puerto Plata, Dominican  Republic, from Tampico, Mexico, when it was intercepted Wednesday by two Coast  Guard cutters about 180 miles southwest of Key West.  </P> <P> An initial search did not uncover any cocaine, but the suspicious behavior of  crew members prompted the Coast Guard to seek permission from the Panamanian  government in exile in Washington to escort the ship to Key West for a more  thorough search, the Customs Service said in a statement.  </P> <P> Panama is ruled by the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who faces indictment  in the United States for drug smuggling, but the United States recognizes  exiled Panamanian President Eric A. Delvalle.  </P></p>

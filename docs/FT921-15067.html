			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Super-Bere lights pension touchpaper: Pierre Beregovoy's reform plan could ignite an emotive issue despite backing from French markets WHENEVER French stockbrokers gather to grumble about the lacklustre state of the Paris markets, one topic is virtually guaranteed to cheer them up - private pension schemes. The prospect of an expansion in private pensions, which are rare in a country where almost all pensions are administered by the state, has long been regarded as the best way to provide an influx of investment for the French stock market, thereby solving its long-term liquidity problem. It is against this background that a brief reference to plans for pension reform in a conference speech given last Thursday by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, was enough to send the CAC 40 index soaring. All Mr Beregovoy, or 'Super-Bere' as the French press calls him when particularly impressed by his rigid economic policy, said was that he hopes in early April to produce proposals to reform the fonds salariaux, the corporate pension schemes used by a small number of senior French executives, and to introduce a tax-efficient personal equity plan. This news was interpreted by the Paris financial markets as confirmation that the long-awaited reform of France's pension system was under way. The prospect of pension reform may be cheering news for the financial markets, but for the bureaucrats in Mr Beregovoy's ministry it presents one of the most complex challenges they could encounter. At present almost all French pensioners, with the exception of the minority belonging to the fonds salariaux, receive their pensions from the state. The system is administered by the Caisse de Retraite, a state body paying out pensions from the money it receives from the employed. This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large pool of young workers and proportionally fewer pensioners for them to support. But in recent years, as the population has aged and the number of young people moving into the labour market has fallen, the system has come under pressure. This problem seems set to intensify as the population ages further. Most demographic forecasts suggest that by the year 2020 there will be more people of pensionable age in France than there will be working to support them, threatening to throw the system into chaos. The obvious solution is for France to follow the precedent set by other countries, notably the UK and the Netherlands, by encouraging the use of private pensions. But such a course is fraught with potential problems. First, there is a short-term political hurdle in the hostility of the powerful trade union lobby to the concept. There is also the logistical difficulty that, until the first tranche of private pensions comes to fruition, those people in work will not only have to continue contributing to the state system - to provide pensions for their elderly compatriots still dependent on the state - but will also have to pay for their own private pensions. Such a package would be difficult for France's embattled Socialist government to sell to the electorate. Mr Beregovoy and his advisers also have to devise a means of encouraging people to invest in private pensions - which will almost certainly involve offering tax concessions - without running the risk of forfeiting too much government revenue at a time when budgets are already under strain. Pension reform would almost certainly create a potentially lucrative new market for the banks, insurance companies and other finance houses that have been waiting eagerly to launch pension and savings products. More important, the development of private pension funds should, eventually, provide a sorely needed source of investment for the equity and bond markets. The French equity market in particular has long suffered from a lack of liquidity; the absence of the large private pension funds that bolster the London market is seen as one of the chief causes of the problem. The emergence of such funds could also have far-reaching consequences for the whole French corporate scene, which tends to be dominated by established industrial interests and the big banks. The new breed of private institutions should be able to take up the cudgels on behalf of other shareholders who, as the recent rows over the takeover bids for Source Perrier mineral water and Au Printemps retail groups attest, frequently feel that their interests are neglected. As a result the French markets ought to be able to look forward to a future in which they not only become more liquid but also more orderly, if Super-Bere and his bureaucrats succeed in solving the thorny pension problem.</p>

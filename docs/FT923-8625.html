			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: German banks It is tempting to see the 3.2 per cent fall in Deutsche Bank's first-half operating profits as the harbinger of disappointments to come in German banking generally. The figure contrasts, for example, with a 17.5 per cent increase in Commerzbank's interim profit and even higher growth rates at the Bavarian banks. Yet while Deutsche's results do bear the hallmarks of a slowing economy, there also appear to be special factors at work. The bank is paying the price for expanding into eastern Germany where its new customers are becoming more sophisticated about wanting higher-yield accounts. This partly explains the squeeze on interest margins. Come the end of the year, the difference with the other banks may be less striking. Most German banks are suffering some pressure on their funding costs from the inverted yield curve. First-half operating results are no guide to the impact of economic slowdown on loan loss provisions. German bank accounting in this regard is notoriously opaque, but, if the bad debts really do start mounting, Deutsche could end up with two advantages. First it almost certainly has a large surplus of developing country debt provisions. Second it has at least already begun to scale back its domestic lending, placing more funds in the interbank market, even at the expense of compressing its interest income.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Technology: Leap forward for fancy footwear - A pair of machine-washable leather shoes Splashing through puddles in leather shoes is the delight of many a child but the nightmare of many a parent. The leather usually dries hard and cracked and the colour frequently fades. But after years of research, tanners and footwear designers have discovered a way of preventing shiny shoes from becoming shabby. Newly emerging on shop shelves are leather or suede shoes which can be popped into the washing machine with a cup-full of detergent with the weekly wash. The shoes should re-appear clean and supple, and in perfect shape. The biggest breakthrough in making machine-washable leather shoes has been in the tanning process, says Steve Rose, head of upper materials testing at Satra, the UK shoe industry's research association. When the leather comes off the cow, the natural fats in the skin are removed to prevent them going rancid, and a cocktail of oils and greases - some natural, such as fish oil, some synthetic - are added. The hides are then tanned using chrome salts, which keep the fats in the leather. The problem with detergents is that they are alkaline, and would normally cause the salts to detach and the fats to be washed away. The latest tanning processes, the exact details of which are closely guarded, use chemically reactive fats: they combine with the leather so that they cannot be sluiced out. The technique is carried out by only a handful of tanneries around the world, notably in the US and Korea. The process means that rather than being water repellant, as might be expected, the shoes use leather which wets very easily. 'When they come out of the machine they are glutinous and swollen,' explains Rose. Salz Leathers, of Santa Cruz, California, originally developed its washable leathers for cycling gloves, explains sales manager Mike Mullins. 'We wanted something that was very porous and would dry very quickly. Then we found that we could wash it and that there was a much bigger market out there for it.' Designing machine-washable shoes presents further problems. On most conventional shoes, the soles are stuck on with adhesive bonds which tend to disintegrate in warm soapy solutions. For machine-washable footwear the soles are made of PVC or polyurethane and injection-moulded on to the uppers  -so the sole becomes its own adhesive. This largely determines the shoe style: trainers or casual. Metal fasteners also need to be avoided and the shoe-lining should be sewn in rather than stuck using traditional glues. Most mashine-washable leather or suede shoes are also white or light coloured, as there are still some problems in making the colour fast if darker dyes are used. Once manufactured, samples of the shoes undergo rigorous testing. Mike Fletcher, head of the Clarks test laboratory in Street, Somerset, says his company, which also sells shoes under the 'K Shoes' brand name, gives the shoes six thorough washes to test for durability. The obvious appeal of the shoes seems to be translating into sales. Shoe retailers, such as UK high street store Russell &amp; Bromley, which sells the American Keds range of machine-washable ladies' casuals, reports brisk sales. Once purchased, Satra recommends that machine-washable leather shoes be treated like delicate fabrics. They should be washed at 40`C and be stuffed with tissue paper to help retain shape. And, Satra warns, they should not be tumble-dried - or ironed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Frydl and Kveta Subertova: "Mutual Trade </F> Between Czech Republic and United States Is Increasing, but  Czech Republic Shows Considerable Deficit"]    [Text] Bill Clinton will arrive in Prague today. It is only  the second time in the history of the Czechoslovak state and the  first time during the existence of the independent Czech state  that a president of the United States has payed us a visit.  Although this visit has above all a political content, according  to Friday's statement by a senior White House official, it will  play an important part in the negotiations in the capital of the  Czech Republic [CR] and in improving the access of Eastern  European countries to Western markets. Although the President is  not bringing any concrete proposals, and understands that this  is a problem for which there are no easy answers, he wants to  contribute to its solution.    The basic document which regulates economic relations  between  CR and the United States is the 1990 Agreement on Trade  Relations, which gives CR a favored nation status. In 1991 the  U.S. Government also accorded CSFR the preferential customs  system which applies to developing countries, and which was  extended for CR until 30 September 1994. Mutual relations are  also regulated by, among other things, the Agreement on Support  and Protection of Investments of 1991 and the Agreement for  Preventing Double Taxation (ratified on 23 December 1993).    Trade between CR and the United States shows a considerable  dynamic, our newspaper was told in this connection by the  director of the Department for OECD countries of the CR Ministry  of Industry and Trade, Petr Postulka. In 1992 trade turnover  grew by 176 percent, and reached a volume of $684 million. At  the same time, however, the trade deficit on the Czech side  climbed to $375 million. This happened because the imports ($529  million) included the purchase of aircraft for the Czechoslovak  Airlines. Overall, United States is in the 10th place among the  CR trade partners. In the first 11 months of 1993, the share of  the United States in our foreign trade reached 2.4 percent.  Exports to the United States amount to 1.8 percent of CR exports  and U.S. exports to CR amount to 2.9 percent of CR imports. The  deficit in the mutual balance of trade from January to November  1993 reached $137 million of the total trade turnover of $522  million. If we disregard the one-time impact of the purchase of  the aircraft in 1992, it appears that the CR deficit still  continues to increase, said Petr Postulka.    In the structure of Czech exports to the United States the  largest share is that of textiles (about 18 percent), glass (13  percent), and rolled steel (9.5 percent). According to Postulka,  it would be helpful to the Czech economy if machine tools played  a bigger part on the U.S. market, since consumer goods will have  to face an increasingly stronger competition, especially from  the developing countries. More than a quarter of the imports to  CR consists of computer technology, followed by electrical  conductors (7 percent), and telecommunication equipment (6  percent). CR therefore imports high technology goods which serve  to modernize the Czech economy and strengthen its  competitiveness.    The regulations for protecting the Czech market are liberal,  but the access of Czech goods to the U.S. market is in some  cases encumbered by high tariffs (for example, footware, glass).  On the other hand, for the time being Czech exporters can use  the system of general customs preferences for some commodities.  U.S. quotas are basically sufficient for them, and there is even  the question whether, for example, the newly established quota  for 800 tons of cheese will be fully used up this year, said  director Postulka. Apart from cheese, United States sets quotas  only for the import of woolen piece goods and ready-made  clothing. The agreement on voluntary restriction of the export  of steel from CSFR has not been renewed after its expiration on  31 March 1992.</p>

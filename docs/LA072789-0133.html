			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRAIN SCAN ON KRAFT SHOWS ABNORMALITY, PROFESSOR TESTIFIES  </P> <P> A brain scan of serial killer Randy Steven Kraft shows that he suffers from an  abnormality that could affect "emotional, impulsive, and sexual behavior," a UC  Irvine psychiatry professor testified Wednesday.  </P> <P> Testimony by Dr. Monte S. Buchsbaum, director of UCI's Brain Imaging Center,  marked the first time jurors have heard the defense waver at all from its  position that Kraft is innocent of all 16 murders of which he was convicted on  May 12.  </P> <P> "Randy still maintains he is innocent," said Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald  outside the courtroom in Santa Ana. "But if the jurors believe he is guilty,  we're only saying maybe there is a reason. Maybe it was something beyond his  control."  </P> <P> Buchsbaum, testifying about the PET, or positron emission tomography, scan at  Kraft's death penalty hearing, acknowledged on cross-examination that some  leading authorities claim such brain tests are too experimental for use in  criminal cases.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum also acknowledged that a more standard brain-scan test on Kraft four  years ago, an EEG or electroencephalogram, showed no abnormalities. But he  testified that the PET scan can measure deeper into the brain than an EEG and  can better reach areas that control sexual behavior.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum said the problem could stem from a head injury Kraft suffered when he  was 1 year old.  </P> <P> Kraft, now 44, is accused by prosecutors in court papers of 45 murders of young  men in Southern California, Oregon, and Michigan.  </P> <P> Bodies of the victims, most of them between 18 and 25 years old, were usually  dumped along freeway ramps or in remote areas. Most had been sexually  mutilated, or showed some signs of sexual abuse.  </P> <P> Kraft acknowledges that he is gay. But in questioning witnesses himself, Kraft  has tried to elicit a portrait of himself as a conservative gay man, not given  to extreme sexual aberrations.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum told jurors that in most areas, Kraft's brain was quite normal, which  would explain his high intelligence and his ability to communicate well with  co-workers. The brain area affected controls "a narrow spectrum," he said.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum's testimony did not include any details about what extremes might  result from Kraft's alleged brain abnormality. But he did say that test results  showed a significant difference from the norm, based on PET scans of 24  volunteers.  </P> <P> While other brain-scan tests measure electrical impulses, or the structure of  the brain, a PET scan measures how the brain is functioning.  </P> <P> Although there are about two dozen PET scan centers across the country,  including three in California, Buchsbaum admitted under questioning by Deputy  Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown that it is a new procedure for criminal trials. In  fact, Buchsbaum said he believes he is the only PET scan expert involved in  criminal cases today. And he has only testified in three other cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Depression Could Have Been Factor in Test  </P> <P> Brown questioned whether "depression" might have caused Kraft's test results.  After all, Brown said, the test occurred on May 31, just two weeks after  Kraft's conviction. He also reminded the professor that Kraft has been in the  Orange County Jail for more than six years. Depression could not be ruled out,  Buchsbaum answered. In fact, he had written several years ago that depression  could interfere with test results. But Buchsbaum quickly added that he doubted  depression was a factor, based on recent experimental tests on that issue.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum also testified that "it would be consistent" with the test results  for Kraft to display some signs of the organic damage. For example, bursts of  anger would not be surprising, Buchsbaum acknowledged.  </P> <P> Yet Kraft's long list of character witnesses have all insisted that Kraft  rarely displayed any temper, was always quiet and reserved. After Buchsbaum's  testimony, prosecutor Brown asked a Kraft character witness whether he had ever  seen Kraft angry, a question that until Wednesday had been more typical of the  defense.  </P> <P> Even Kraft smiled at this switch in the lawyers' positions.  </P> <P> Kraft lawyer McDonald was pleased with Buchsbaum's testimony. And McDonald said  he doesn't consider it inconsistent with his earlier arguments that Kraft is  innocent.  </P> <P> "If the jury's position is (that) Randy is guilty, we can at least show them it  wasn't because he is an evil person; it's something organic he can't do  anything about."  </P> <P> Another witness Wednesday was Rabbi Leonard Beerman of West Los Angeles, now  retired, who said he believed after talking to Kraft that he is a considerate,  caring individual who should be spared the death penalty.  </P> <P> "Did you ask Mr. Kraft whether he had killed any of these young boys?" Brown  asked the rabbi.  </P> <P> "No, but Randy did tell me he was innocent," Beerman answered.  </P> <P> "Did you believe him?"  </P> <P> "Yes, yes I did," Beerman answered the prosecutor.  </P> <P> Beerman also said he opposes the death penalty, not only for Kraft but for  people such as Adolf Hitler and Adolf Eichmann, who "murdered my own people."  </P></p>

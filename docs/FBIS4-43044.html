			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F> unidentified ARD correspondent; Scharping is speaking from Bonn  -- live]    [Text] [ARD correspondent] The European election is not a  signal for federal elections. That is what the next interviewee  will say. SPD [Social Democratic Party] Chairman Rudolf  Scharping live from Bonn:    [Correspondent] You have presented yourself quite clearly as  the leading figure of the SPD. My question is, what is your  share of the blame for the election result?    [Scharping] I say once again, we have not been able, in  general, to convince workers that the European election is  important since it is an election to the European Parliament.  But we will succeed in that in the federal elections--I am  firmly convinced of this. I am not downcast by the result;  although on the other hand, it is clear that it is a setback.  We lost the first round.    [Correspondent] Half of the people said this had a strong  national German accent, this European election. Can you, under  these circumstances, with this result, stick with the strategy  that you have pursued so far. Or should you not change  something in order to win on 16 October?    [Scharping] We will stick to the clear direction that  unemployment in Germany has to be fought, that social justice  has to be reestablished within the framework of a stable  financial situation. I am quite sure that the turnout will show  more than clearly that there is still a huge potential that we  can win over. So we will stick to our clear direction. It would  be silly to change the overall strategy of the party because of  an election to the European Parliament.    [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, Joschka Fischer from the  Greens criticized the SPD earlier for demonstrating too little  profile and too little opposition. He was perhaps also thinking  about the possibility of forming a joint government in the  autumn. How do you view this?    [Scharping] I believe we have to make the SPD the strongest  party; otherwise, nothing will change in Germany. We have to  explain this in eastern Germany where, in my opinion, the PDS  [Party of Democratic Socialist] is alarmingly strong, despite  the considerable gains by the SPD in the local elections. We  have a good opportunity in Saxony-Anhalt, but we have to  convince the people in the East that every vote for the PDS cast  in protest is perhaps understandable, but is indirectly useful  for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] under the current  conditions.    [Correspondent] But you have been accused of copying Kohl.  If that is the case, people would rather vote for the original.  That is the accusation.    [Scharping] Yes, but that is not true from any viewpoint. I  do not think I have to explain that now. This will become more  than clear over the next few weeks. The second thing that the  SPD has to do is to mobilize its support among the employees and  to bring actual issues to the foreground. We have quite  evidently not succeeded in this in the way I wished us to, given  several careless debates in the SPD. Third, we have to make it  clear that reform- orientated policies will only be possible in  Germany if the SPD becomes significantly stronger on 16 October  than it is at present.    [Correspondent] Mr. Scharping, wasn't it perhaps after all a  mistake not to try to push forward the ecological restructuring  of our society? Instead, you cannot deny this, take a rather  more conventional economic course?    [Scharping] If you could explain to me what is conventional  about pursuing a clear labor market policy when 420,000 more  people are unemployed this year than they were last year, when  more will be done for families with children, then the problem  is perhaps that not enough support has yet been mobilized for an  economic and social reform policy. Incidentally, the SPD has a  clear view on the environment and has formulated a clear reform  program in this area, too. Of course, we will have to work  harder in a more united and resolute way.    [Correspondent] Don't you think it is necessary to make a  statement on your coalition intentions in favor of the Greens  after all?    [Scharping] I am not thinking of making a coalition  statement  with regard to smaller parties. I do not think it is a good  idea to create conditions where the tail wags the dog and where  one concedes exclusive rights to the smaller party. That has to  be made clear to every voter in Germany, and so I will repeat  it: Reform politics in Germany will only be possible when the  SPD is stronger.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rawalpindi (PPI) -- North Korea supports Pakistan's  peaceful nuclear programme, said the North Korean Ambassador to  Pakistan Mr Choe Su-il.    He was informally talking to the PPI after a function held  in  connection with annual prize distribution ceremony of Little  Angels School, which co-incided with the 17th foundation day of  the institution.    He said the perceptions of Pakistan and Korea on the nuclear  issue were identical as Pakistan had an expressed desire for a  nuclear free South Asia, while Korea wanted nuclear free Korean  peninsula.    Asked would it be justified to pressurize Pakistan on  unilaterally signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT)  he said "it is upto the Government of Pakistan to make a  decision in this regard".    The Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK)  earlier in his address said Pakistan and Korea enjoyed excellent  traditional relations adding that the ties of friendship had  further been cemented by the visit of Pakistan's delegation  headed by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Korea. "We highly  value the friendship with Pakistan and will do our best too  further promote the ties", Choe Su-il maintained.    Underlining the importance of education he said it played  key  role for the nations to achieve the target of progress and  prosperity.    The Principal of the school Mrs Salma Siddiqui presented a  momento from all the `angels' and staff of the school to the  chief guest.    The DPRK Ambassador presented a traditional Korean painting  to Mrs Siddiqui and donated some books for the school library.

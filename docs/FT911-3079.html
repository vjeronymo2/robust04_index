			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lovell Pounds 30m rights to reduce debt YJ LOVELL (Holdings), the housing and construction company, yesterday announced a Pounds 30m rights issue and warned that it would have to make substantial extra provisions against developments in this year's accounts. The dual announcement sent the shares into a sharp decline to close 33p down at 145p. The 2-for-5 rights issue of 23.77m shares is pitched at 130p. Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said: 'We should have had a rights issue before the recession but we didn't. This is to make sure we don't come out of the recession over-geared.' The company estimated it would have to make extra provisions of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m, before tax relief, for its urban renewal division. This comes after a Pounds 16.5m provision made when it decided to close the business in July last year. Mr Hichens said since publication of results for the year to end-September the market served by the urban renewal division had deteriorated further. There was also a need to set more money aside for the commercial development and residential operations. In total, the company said it expected to make provisions of at least Pounds 22.5m in the current year accounts. Mr Hichens said that, without the rights issue and taking into account the extra provisions, gearing would have risen to at least 108 per cent. With the issue proceeds, it would fall to just below 50 per cent. At the end of last month, indebtedness totalled Pounds 74.7m while the company had Pounds 3m cash. On current trading, he said half-year results would 'fully reflect' the impact of poor trading conditions. But, helped by the recent disposal of an interest in an industrial estate, which produced Pounds 15.6m, Lovell would show a modest pre-tax profit. It intended to pay maintained interim and final dividends of 2.2p and 6.75p respectively. For the year to end-September, Lovell reported a 32 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 19.9m after taking most of the provision for the urban renewal business as an extra-ordinary item. It dipped into reserves to pay the dividend. The rights issue document gives details of the remuneration agreed with Mr Robert Sellier, the former group managing director at Wimpey who this month takes over as Lovell's chief executive. Under a three-year service agreement, he is to receive an annual salary initially set at Pounds 200,000 and, at the discretion of the board, an annual bonus of up to 50 per cent of base salary linked to profit targets. He may apply for options over 400,000 shares.</p>

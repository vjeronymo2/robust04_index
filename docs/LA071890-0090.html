			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Heady Sales: Coors Brewing Co. of Colorado has been so successful in four  markets outside the United States that it plans to expand into two more but  won't say which.  </P> <P> Coors (in a tie with Heineken) holds 20% of the Japanese import market, 5% of  the market in Canada, 25% in Bermuda and 19% in the Virgin Islands, where the  company introduced its product only eight months ago. The popularity of lighter  beers in England and the evolving free-trade agreement between the United  States and Mexico would seem to put those two countries high on Coors' list for  sales.

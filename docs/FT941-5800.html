			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Names change problems remain - Ladbroke's 1993 performance The traditionally secretive Ladbroke Group held its first ever press conference yesterday. The projector that was used to show slides of the company's 1993 performance was clearly so unaccustomed to the task that it froze. A promise of greater openness from the new management, headed by Mr John Jackson, chairman, and Mr Peter George, chief executive, had helped push the shares of the hotel, betting and DIY group up 29 per cent since the new year. Yesterday, the glow that has surrounded Ladbroke since the departure at the beginning of the year of Mr Cyril Stein, its founder, began to fade. The announcement of full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.1m after exceptional items, compared with a restated Pounds 5.2m in 1992, led to a further initial rise in the shares. But they then fell to close down 10p at 199p as the realisation set in that while the names at the top might be different, several of Ladbroke's problems remain. Recovery in the Hilton International hotel subsidiary was proving slow and the Texas Homecare retail chain is beset with problems. Rumours that Ladbroke had found a buyer for Texas proved unfounded. Mr Jackson said Ladbroke remained committed to Texas for the long term. The impact of the National Lottery on Ladbroke's Vernons football pools business is still uncertain. Mr Jackson and Mr George are thoroughly familiar with the group's difficulties and opportunities. Mr Jackson has been a non-executive director since 1980 and Mr George has been with the group for 30 years. What has changed is that both now have the opportunity to run the group in a way that Mr Stein, suspicious of scrutiny from outsiders, would never permit. Mr Jackson yesterday said the board would answer any questions put to them. He was true to his word. Mr George's public confidence has grown since his appointment was announced last September. Then, Mr George, whose lanky frame gives him the appearance of a gawky schoolboy, seemed overawed at the responsibility he had inherited. Yesterday, he gave every indication of having mastered his brief. He now has to restore the group's businesses to health. The only sector to show a substantial improvement was betting and gaming, where operating profits before exceptionals rose from Pounds 68m to Pounds 86.1m. The UK betting shops benefited from summer evening opening. The group has also begun testing terminals which allow bets to be placed without having to go up to the counter, as well as a computer system which allows customers to see simulated races. Prospects for the pools business are clouded by the National Lottery. Ladbroke is an investor in Games for Good Causes, one of the bidders to be lottery operator. Mr George has placed a bet at William Hill, one of his rivals, that his consortium will win. He thinks the odds of 16-1 understate Ladbroke's chances, but accepts that its consortium is not the favourite. Mr George argues the lottery will not have an immediate effect on the habits of traditional pools customers. Standing orders accounted for 39 per cent of stakes last year. Mr George believes these customers are more likely to remain loyal. 'The pools are such a habit. People have been doing it for so long and 95 per cent do the same numbers every week. There's a tremendous fear that the day you stop is the day your numbers come up.' He sees younger people who have not begun filling in pools coupons as a more serious problem. They might prefer to buy lottery tickets instead. Hilton International's operating profits slipped from Pounds 119.5m to Pounds 117.7m. Hotels in London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, the Americas and the Caribbean performed well. Continental Europe, however, is struggling through recession, hotels in Japan were hit by the fall in corporate spending, Australia shows few signs of improvement and business in Egypt has been damaged by fundamentalist terrorism. Nevertheless, Mr George argues that Hilton is the sort of brand that will benefit from worldwide recovery. It is in the four to five star category, cheaper than the luxury hotel market, and suitable for cost-cutting business travellers. Texas profits were Pounds 7.8m, compared with Pounds 43.6m. Mr John Coleman, appointed Texas chief executive last September, has to deal with the previous management's practice of assuming they would receive rebates from suppliers for buying quantities of goods they were unable to sell. The lines stocked by Texas are being cut by a quarter and the number of suppliers is being reduced. But competition is fierce and Mr George admits that service standards require substantial improvement. Despite the group's protestations that it has a long-term commitment to Texas, it is difficult to believe that Ladbroke would not have sold if anyone had been prepared to pay for it.</p>

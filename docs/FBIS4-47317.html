Independent parameters studied individually are: length,  diameter, and shape of gas lines, and the transmission rate of  the injector nozzle when other design and operating parameters  remain unchanged. The transmission rate of the nozzle is the  ratio of the total area of the gas lines in the nozzle to the  cross sectional area of the cylindrical part of the chamber. The  nozzles tested here have ratios of 0.134 and 0.255. Different  gas line lengths lead to a significant change in the flow rate  at which vibrations occur. The minimum flow rate at the lower  edge of the vibration region for both nozzles was virtually the  same, given identical line lengths. There are two distinct  stability minima in the studied ranges of line length, 48-62 and  156-169 mm. The next minimum is at 250 mm. Maxima are clearly  visible at 6-12, 100-120, and 210 mm. The stability of  combustion is calculated as a function the Mach number and the  ratio of the length of gas lines l to the wavelength of sound in  the lines, _l_. At the best stability value, minima and maxima  are separated by about 0.5l/_l_. At the worst stability value,  they are separated by 0.25l/_l_. This is a key finding of his  paper and indicates the acoustic nature of the effect of gas  line length. Converging lines have advantages over cylindrical  ones. Resonance properties of the nozzle lines are key in  determining optimal length. The interaction of longitudinal gas  vibrations in the gas lines and transverse (tangential) gas  vibrations in the combustion chamber is studied. Figures 8;  references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

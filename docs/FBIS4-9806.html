			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has said that  recent kidnappings and the assassination of Javier Barahona, the  deputy mayor of Wiwili, are desperate actions by criminal gangs  trying to undermine peace. Mendieta added that the government  is working to combat this situation.    [Begin Mendieta recording] We are prepared to fully  guarantee  that the disarmament process of the 3-80 Northern Front will  conclude satisfactorily on 8 April, as scheduled, and that the  second phase of disarmament will begin tomorrow without any  delay. [end recording]    Mendieta said he would meet with high-ranking EPS [Sandinist  People's Army] officers to counter the criminal gangs.    [Begin recording of Colonel Oswaldo Lacayo, member of the  EPS  General Staff] We will conduct operations in full coordination  with the group being disarmed in the areas surrounding the 3-80  Northern Front disarmament area to prevent any problems. [end  recording]    According to the EPS, gangs such as those under the command  of Charro, Nortiel, and Omar are trying to hinder the  disarmament process, but the International Commission of Support  and Verification-OAS [CIAV-OAS] believes the peace process is  well under way.    [Begin recording of Sergio Carabana, CIAV-OAS  representative]  These incidents are isolated. I believe the government will  take steps in this regard, and we will help conduct a thorough  investigation to find the culprits. [end recording]    The CIAV-OAS will propose that Barahona's case be discussed  by the tripartite commission.</p>

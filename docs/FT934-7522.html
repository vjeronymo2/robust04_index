			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Tague travels onwards with Storehouse group Retail group Storehouse accompanied its interim results yesterday with the news that it had finally appointed Stephen Tague, currently trading director of Allders department stores, as store operations director of BHS. Tague, 38, is the first permanent appointee to the post since Ann Iverson moved across to become chief executive of Storehouse's Mothercare chain in June last year, although Steve Bedford, group development director, has been standing in for the past year. Tague began his retailing career with Debenhams as a graduate trainee. He held a number of store management positions before becoming sales controller of menswear, boyswear, luggage, sports and men's shoes. He then moved on to join Allders International in 1986, first as retail operations director of UK airports. He then spent four years as group buying and merchandising director before becoming trading director of the department stores. Tague is going to take up his appointment in January, from whence he will have responsibility for BHS's 123 stores, at a time when Keith Edelman, chief executive of Storehouse since August, is keen to expand the chain. Keith Edelman said yesterday he was aware of the need to strengthen the top management of the group and restore stability after a number of departures and changes. Interviews are currently taking place for a new group finance director after the resignation of Graham Rider last month. Storehouse expects that an appointment will be made in the new year. Storehouse is also looking for a new property director - another function that has been fulfilled recently by Steve Bedford - to speed up its store opening programme.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC FADES IN LOSS TO MARYLAND  </P> <P> George Raveling's booming voice echoed down the hallway outside the locker  room. For 20 minutes Raveling lectured USC's basketball team.  </P> <P> He had every right to be upset after watching the Trojans collapse in the final  12 1/2 minutes of a 72-59 loss to Maryland Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Leading, 42-40, after guard Harold Miner, who scored 22 points, hit a  three-point jump shot with 12:25 remaining, the Trojans fell apart and Maryland  outscored them, 17-6, in the next six minutes.  </P> <P> Although it was sauna-like in Cole Field House, USC was ice cold, missing 10 of  its final 18 shots.  </P> <P> "I don't think the heat was a factor," Raveling said. "What disappoints me is  the manner in which we lost. We didn't exhibit the kind of basketball that  we're capable of playing."  </P> <P> Raveling was so flustered after emerging from the locker room that he grabbed  the wrong sports jacket on his way to the press room.  </P> <P> "That's symbolic of the evening, nothing fit," Raveling said. "The only  positive I see in this game is that it happened in our second game of the  season. We have to use this game as a bucket of cold water to wake us up and  make us realize some things we're going to have to do to be a better basketball  team.  </P> <P> "We certainly were not a team tonight. The rules say you have to put five  players out there, so SC had five players out there, but they didn't have a  team out there tonight."  </P> <P> Shadowed by forward Vince Broadnax and reserve guard Kevin McLinton, who were  assigned to him in Maryland's box-and-one defense, Miner missed 10 of 20 shots.  He began forcing shots, missing six of seven three-point attempts.  </P> <P> "I definitely didn't play well at all," Miner said. "But you have to take the  good with the bad. You can't play perfect every game. I just have to build on  this and move forward."  </P> <P> Miner wasn't the only Trojan who played poorly.  </P> <P> USC forward Ronnie Coleman, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds, missed 10 of 15  shots, including a dunk. The Trojans shot only 38.6%.  </P> <P> Point guard Robert Pack missed six of 10 shots and had a team-high five  turnovers. Guard Phil Glenn missed five of six shots and forward Calvin Banks  missed three of four shots.  </P> <P> "Nobody for SC played well," Raveling said. "It was just one of those horrible  nights that you wish never happened to you."  </P> <P> After opening the season with a 41-point victory over Chicago State last  weekend, Raveling thought the Maryland game would provide him with a better  barometer for the Trojans (1-1).  </P> <P> Although USC shot 39.4% in the first half, the Trojans trailed by only 29-28 at  halftime because Maryland couldn't convert its free throws, missing seven of  nine.  </P> <P> But the Terrapins took control of the game in the second half.  </P> <P> Guard Walt Williams scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half to lead the  Terrapins (1-1). He had 10 points in Maryland's decisive run, hitting two  three-point shots.  </P> <P> Forward Garfield Smith had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and center Cedric Lewis  was a force inside with eight points, 14 rebounds and six blocked shots.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> USC center Yamen Sanders, sidelined with a sprained ankle, didn't make the  trip. Keith Greeley started in place of Sanders, but he was replaced by  freshman Mark Boyd at the start of the second half. Boyd had eight points and  four rebounds for the Trojans. . . . Maryland guard Matt Roe, a transfer from  Syracuse, had 16 points.  </P></p>

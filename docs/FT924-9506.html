			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Clinton reassures allies and cautions enemies MR Bill Clinton, the Democratic governor of Arkansas and US president-elect, set out yesterday to provide reassurance to allies while warning enemies not to try to take advantage of President George Bush's lame-duck administration. 'The greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's resolve during this period of transition,' Mr Clinton said, implicitly targeting Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, who yesterday celebrated the defeat of President Bush. 'The greatest gesture of goodwill any nation can make toward me is to continue their full co-operation during this period with our one president, George Bush.' He said that 'America has only one president at a time, and that American foreign policy remains solely in his hands'. Mr Clinton, taking his first steps on the road to inauguration on January 20, also sought to reassure financial markets that he would not embark on a government spending spree and that his economic policies would not interfere with the free market. 'We understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue growth,' he said. President Bush, only the fourth elected incumbent to be voted out of the White House after one term and the first Republican to suffer the fate since Herbert Hoover in 1932, flew back to Washington after a gracious concession in Houston. En route, Mr Bush signalled that he did not plan to bow out entirely in his last months in office, by vetoing a Dollars 27bn (Pounds 16.5bn) tax bill sent to him by the last Congress. In the end, Mr Clinton's margin of victory in the election was less overwhelming than had appeared likely at one time. Though his margin where it mattered in the electoral college was decisive - winning 32 states plus the District of Columbia, worth 370 votes, against 18 states and 168 electors for Mr Bush - he will take over the presidency in January with the third-lowest score in the popular vote this century. Near-final figures gave him 43 per cent, against 38 per cent for the president and 19 per cent for Mr Ross Perot. Exit polls showed Mr Perot's support, the highest achieved by an independent since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912, was drawn almost equally from the two party candidates. His best placing was to come second in the Utah contest. Mr Perot gave no real clue last night as to his future, but he did offer Mr Clinton an unspecified helping hand. The combined Clinton-Perot vote, about 62 per cent, was a resounding rebuff for the person and policies of President Bush, who had taken over 53 per cent of the popular vote four years ago. One explanation lay in a turn-out estimated at about 104m, the highest ever, equivalent to about 55 per cent of registered voters. Though many state races were very close, Mr Clinton assembled a geographically well-spread series of victories. He swept the far west and the north-east, took almost all the big industrial states, broke the Republican lock on the mountain states and was very competitive in the south. Mr Bush held on to his adopted home of Texas and to Florida. There was a subdued reaction to the result on Wall Street, which had been expecting a Democratic victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 29.44 at 3,223.04, but most of the decline was blamed on futures-related programme trading and other stock indices were little changed or slightly higher.

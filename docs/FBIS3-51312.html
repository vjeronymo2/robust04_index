A survey conducted yesterday  by Datafolha among party leaders and Senate and Chamber of  Deputies party bloc members reveals that 35 percent of PMDB  followers questioned want the party to support Britto in the  presidential race. Former Governor Orestes Quercia came a  distant second with barely 10 percent of the votes.    The survey conducted during a PMDB leadership meeting in  Brasilia confirms the supposition that Quercia dominates the  party apparatus. During an interview with FOLHA last weekend,  Quercia indicated his candidacy and ruled out Britto's chances:    "It is too soon for him," Quercia said.    The survey shows that his party does not think so.    Nearly 100 PMDB leaders attended the meeting yesterday.  Datafolha questioned 72 of them. The numbers reveal more bad  news for Quercia: Senator Pedro Simon (RS) [Rio Grande So Sul]  appears in third place with 6 percent support, only 4 points  below the former Sao Paulo governor. Simon is Quercia's  arch-enemy and will work better with Britto. When we add the  percentages obtained by Britto and Simon, we can see that the  two candidates are preferred by 41 percent of PMDB leaders.    Sharing third place with Simon is Goias Governor Iris  Rezende, also with 6 percent. Rezende is an old friend of  Quercia but is undecided on who he will support. Next in the  list (with 3 percent) is Parana Governor Roberto Requiao,  another enemy of Quercia. Next, with a mere 1 percent are  former President Jose Sarney, Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury  Filho, and Deputy Odacir Klein -- the Congressional  Investigating Committee vice president.</p>

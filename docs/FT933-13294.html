			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / French rescuer hit by loss on Adam ROYAL Bank of Scotland is buying Adam &amp; Co, the troubled Edinburgh private bank, a year after Adam's capital was temporarily wiped out by a Pounds 21m loss from unauthorised foreign exchange dealing. Royal Bank is paying Pounds 10.5m for the private bank which was formed in 1983. Some Pounds 9.5m of the amount will go to Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a French shareholder who rescued Adam &amp; Co last year by injecting Pounds 21m. Mrs Primat, who is 75, chose to take the loss rather than wait for her convertible preference shares to be repaid over 20 years. The shares had a zero coupon for 10 years and then a 5 per cent annual payment. Mr James Laurenson, Adam's deputy chairman and managing director who will become a non-executive director, believed Mrs Primat had 'decided that there was an inherent loss, and that she should crystallise it now'. The net asset value of Adam &amp; Co, which has 4,000 private banking clients, is Pounds 13.5m. Mr Laurenson said it had opted to sell at a discount to book value because it would be burdened by the repayment of Mrs Primat's preference shares. Mr Laurenson said Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank which was retained to advise on the future of Adam &amp; Co after the currency loss, had recommended the sale because the bank would otherwise be held back. 'We could have carried on but we decided that we would be constrained by a lack of financial resources. We did not think we would be able to innovate and provide the sort of service that our customers have become used to,' he said. Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said the bank believed Adam &amp; Co would complement Royal Bank's other private banking operations. The bank owns Child &amp; Co, the 300-year-old London private bank. 'We feel that Adam has a good customer base, and fits very well with our whole ensemble,' he said. Royal Bank believed the sale price was appropriate. Mr Mathewson stressed Adam would 'keep its own identity'. Two Royal Bank executives, including Mr Tony Schofield, managing director of branch banking, will become non-executive directors of Adam. Observer, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVIST TO LEAD HOUSING DEPT.;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: THE MAYOR NAMES GARY SQUIER, A LONGTIME ADVOCATE OF MORE LOW-INCOME  HOUSING, TO RUN THE NEW AGENCY. OBSERVERS SAY BRADLEY IS SHAKING UP THE  BUREAUCRACY IN RESPONSE TO A DEEPENING CRISIS.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday named Gary Squier, a longtime advocate for the  poor and for reform of the city's affordable-housing programs, to run the  city's new 244-person Housing Preservation and Production Department.  </P> <P> Squier, 39, who began his career in the mid-1970s as a VISTA volunteer on Skid  Row, has been a private housing consultant and developer as well as acting  director of the city Housing Authority. He was previously city housing  coordinator under Bradley.  </P> <P> Bradley, at a press conference in front of an uninhabitable brick building that  once housed 100 families, gave a plug to the city housing bond measure,  Proposition K, and a state housing bond measure, Proposition 145, before  calling Squier "an ideal choice."  </P> <P> Squier has been praised by many developers, bankers, advocates for the poor and  neighborhood revitalization groups as an expert strategist who can bring  together disparate sectors of the city to attack the housing crisis.  </P> <P> At the same time, his appointment is of interest for the activist political  message Bradley is sending, said several City Hall observers.  </P> <P> "That's fantastic!" cried UCLA Associate Prof. Alan Heskin when told of the  appointment.  </P> <P> "A political appointment was a great early fear of many people, and there's no  question that instead what we are getting is a tremendously qualified,  exceptional person," said Heskin, who is head of the urban planning program at  UCLA and a member of the interviewing team that scored Squier highest among six  finalists.  </P> <P> Squier said his department will control a $50-million annual budget to build  and rehabilitate low-income housing. The housing department also will review  the housing efforts of all other city departments, including the Community  Redevelopment Agency. That agency's budget has become the target of  intensifying criticism from City Council members who complain that it is so  complex they cannot tell what they are paying for.  </P> <P> "We'll be acting in an advise-and-consent role to that agency," Squier said.  "Both of us are looking at better ways to get things done."  </P> <P> Squier will join a fellow activist, Charles Elsesser, a former Legal Aid  Foundation attorney who was named this month as chairman of the city's newly  formed Housing Commission, a citizens panel that oversees the housing  department.  </P> <P> Elsesser, who is also an aide to state Sen. President Pro Tem David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles), battled the city in the late 1980s as a Legal Aid lawyer,  arguing that longtime city policies had diminished low-cost housing in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Squier and Elsesser met 15 years ago while working on behalf of the poor on  Skid Row, and their appointments represent what many say is an increasingly  determined effort by Bradley to shake up the city's housing bureaucracy and  respond to a deepening housing crisis.  </P> <P> Bradley's push to create low-cost housing began in 1988 with the formation of  the Blue Ribbon Committee on Affordable Housing. The group recommended, among  other things, raising large sums to build affordable housing by charging a fee  to big commercial developers.  </P> <P> A slow response by the City Council to those recommendations prompted some Blue  Ribbon Committee members to criticize Bradley several months ago for not  lobbying council members hard enough. Today, however, 15 of the group's 16  original recommendations are being implemented, including the developer fee.  </P> <P> Two other key recommendations -- the creation of a housing department and a  Housing Commission -- were implemented this fall and are considered by many to  be the most extensive bureaucratic reforms in City Hall in a decade. Before  that, housing efforts were overseen by 11 different divisions within city  government.  </P> <P> Squier said passage next week by voters of Proposition K would boost his  department's budget by 40%. However, he said, "Even with that, we have to get  other local sources of funds because no one source can make up for federal  housing cuts of the past decade."  </P> <P> Aside from funding, he said, the issue in the 1990s will be to change city  policies that work at cross purposes to discourage housing construction.  </P> <P> Squier cited the failure by planners to create high-density housing zones along  the new Blue Line, saying that such a transportation corridor, if planned in  today's climate, "would be an obvious choice for low and middle-income  (apartment units)."  </P> <P> According to City Housing Coordinator Michael Bodaken -- another 1990 mayoral  appointment from the activist ranks -- Bradley selected Squier after the city  Personnel Department chose 12 candidates from 36 applicants nationwide.  </P> <P> During a four-month search, a four-member committee, including Heskin, narrowed  the finalists to six and forwarded those names to Bradley, Bodaken said.  </P> <P> "The mayor was looking for administrative experience, vision and  problem-solving," said Bodaken, a former Legal Aid attorney. "Nobody -- not the  department or the mayor or the council -- wanted a political appointment."  </P> <P> Heskin said scores given to the candidates by the four-member committee "are  public record, and Gary Squier got 95 out of 100. The next candidate, a really  terrific choice from New York, got 91, but Gary had a clear edge for his  knowledge not only of housing but of City Hall."  </P></p>

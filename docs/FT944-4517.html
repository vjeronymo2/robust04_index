			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Bank deputy in call for stability Exchange rate stability requires micro-economic reforms to improve productivity, as well as macro-economic measures to control inflation, the deputy governor of the Bank of England said yesterday. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, giving the third Bank of England/London School of Economics lecture, said that 'to achieve international monetary harmony, every country should start at home'. Reviewing the history of exchange rate management Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'It has become virtually impossible for any central bank or government to withstand the pressures of a sceptical market.' Mr Pennant-Rea said that exchange rate targets were targets 'not just for the authorities but for currency dealers as well, and like all targets, they invite pot shots'. But he said the low inflation rates of 1993 and most of 1994 had been 'due to policy decisions made while sterling was in the exchange rate mechanism. Only now is Britain in a position to prove that it can keep inflation down solely by virtue of its domestic resolve to do so - and it is far too early to judge how we will fare in the test'.</p>

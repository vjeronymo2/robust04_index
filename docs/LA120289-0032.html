			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY FROM DELTA FACES NEW THREAT  </P> <P> Year after year we see our water and power bills go up. According to The Times,  we on the City Council should take "the broader view" (editorial, Nov. 9) and  approve increases, even when they are not necessary.  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago the council requested the chief administrative officer (CAO)  to review the requests of the Department of Water and Power so that we, like  the Public Utilities Commission, could have a second opinion. He has done just  that. His review noted that the DWP has a $47-million cash surplus last year,  and that the current trend, if it continues, could generate a $50-million  surplus at year-end even without a rate increase. In view of this, a rate  increase is simply not justified.  </P> <P> The Times reported that the increase to the average residential customer's bill  would be about 5.9%. This is misleading. If DWP's 8.4% rate request is  approved, customers could see their bills increase more than 17% simply because  of the high cost of purchasing water and the automatic pass-through provisions  that apply. Allowing DWP to keep up with the "cost of living" is one thing --  permitting bills to rise more than three times that amount is excessive.  </P> <P> As New York rating agencies know, the Los Angeles City Council will not let the  DWP's bond ratings slump. As Moody's says, "Timely rate increase is the key to  good credit." I simply would add, "if justified." The City Council has not been  hesitant to approve rate increases if the funds are essential. It approved a  12% rate increase last year.  </P> <P> ERNANI BERNARDI  </P> <P> Councilman, 7th District  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (8): Keeping it to a minimum / Considering the impact of 'green consumerism' EARLIER THIS year, the Women's Environmental Network caused a furore by targeting a J Sainsbury supermarket and ripping off all the 'excess' packaging from its products and dumping it at the check-outs - an echo of previous environmental campaigns in Germany. Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth demonstrated last December outside Woolworth and Ryman stores to protest against their selling Silly String and Snow Spray in environmentally harmful CFC-filled spraycans. Such protests are the most visible and vocal sign of how environmental concerns directly affect retailers, although they are viewed as more of a fuss than a threat to business. But arguably they represent only the tip of a far more serious iceberg. Partly as a result of such campaigns, millions of consumers throughout the industrialised world have woken up to the environmental consequences of their consumption and are determined to do something about it. Much of this impulse towards 'green consumerism' - driven by the younger generations in particular - is weak, inconsistent and at times contradictory, but it is potent, nonetheless. As John Elkington, director of the SustainAbility consultancy and co-author of the Green Consumer Guide, told a CIES conference on Environment and the Food Business earlier this year: 'A considerable proportion of tomorrow's consumers will see their purchasing patterns as a useful lever to effect environmental change, in effect to 'vote' yes for environmental quality. . . Retailers need to recognise this trend - and to support it.' Already, some companies - including B&amp;Q and Sainsbury's - have taken the issue seriously and have acted to seize the initiative. They are realising that, not only does such action help ease environmental pressures and win customer goodwill, but that it also invariably leads to good business practice. Sainsbury's buyers are currently examining every product on their shelves, to ensure they only use the minimum packaging fit for their purpose. The company is discovering that, in addition to the environmental benefits, its approach has produced substantial cost advantages. For example, the simple expedient of reducing the size of its free tear-off produce bags - in which customers cram their vegetables - has resulted in an annual material saving of more than 600 tonnes of plastic, or 25 per cent of the total. Its decision to remove the polystyrene bases from under its pizzas has saved a further 100 tonnes of plastic a year at a cost benefit of more than Pounds 150,000. As one Dutch speaker noted, at a recent packaging conference, by taking such initiatives retailers are able to act as the gearbox between the consumer and the packaging manufacturer, transmitting the shoppers' desires into buying orders, moving up or down depending on the speed of developments. Retailers, therefore, exert a strong direct influence on their packaging suppliers. But the packaging industry often complains that retailers attempt to push the additional costs and inconvenience down the supply chain, and will not shoulder responsibilities themselves. They are quite prepared to reduce the amount of packaging, they say, but are not so keen to recover and recycle. In particular, they point to retailers' reluctance to complicate their distribution networks by using them to return used packaging products to their suppliers. They also highlight the inconsistencies of retailers' environmental stances which have led to widely divergent policies across Europe. How can one retailer, such as Marks and Spencer, of the UK, encourage the use of PVC packaging because it believes it is energy-efficient; while another, such as Albert Heijn, the Dutch supermarket group, can simultaneously insist on reducing the amount of PVC because it is not easily recycled? In turn, however, retailers complain about the unresponsiveness of the packaging industry in the face of their environmental concerns. 'Sometimes it is like drawing teeth,' says one leading retailer of his attempts to encourage a dialogue with packaging suppliers. As in so many other areas of the debate, it is clearly essential for both sides to develop closer partnerships to respond to consumers' demands - however inchoate they may be. For, although consumers would generally like retailers to do more for the environment, they do not always know precisely what. Most consumers, of course, want the best of all worlds. They do not want packaging that will compromise on convenience, or quality or products that will be any less effective. And they would probably only accept a slight diminution in the appeal of luxuriously packaged branded products. Consumers are still likely to choose Scotch whiskies in posh boxes for presents, and the distillers are always likely to use them to market their products - unless legislation were to force them not to. Consumers remain rightly sceptical of many of the sweeping environmental claims made by retailers and consumer products manufacturers. But, equally, there is perhaps now a danger of a backlash against some of the more absurd and intrusive elements of environmental legislation. Even in eco-friendly California, the beginnings of just such a trend are emerging regarding the insistence on bio-degradable nappies, for example. Consumers are also sharply divided about whether they want to pay much of a premium for their consciences. In a Mintel survey last year, 35 per cent of UK consumers said they were not willing to pay any extra for environmentally friendly products, although 24 per cent said they would pay more than 5 per cent extra, and 31 per cent said they were prepared to spend an extra 10 per cent or more. As one frustrated delegate told the CIES environmental conference: 'The only issue more complicated than the environment is the human psychology that affects consumer perceptions of the environmental issue, and how it motivates their purchasing habits.' But, difficult though it may be to interpret, it is now impossible to ignore. The packaging and retailing industries must, at the very least, give consumers the option of buying less environmentally harmful products and living up to their responsibilities for minimising waste in all areas of their businesses.</p>

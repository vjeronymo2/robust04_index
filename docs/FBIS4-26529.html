			<p>BFN     [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun  invited persons in charge of a number of loss-making state-run  enterprises to a meeting convened in Luoyang on 13 June to  discuss and map out ways and means of turning enterprise losses  into profits.    Secretary Li Changchun delivered a speech in which he  emphatically called for firmly grasping each and every excellent  opportunity at the moment, further emancipating our minds,  deepening the on-going enterprise reform, and boldly trying out  a variety of new reform measures. He stated: We should  strictly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee by further developing the  productive forces; promoting lateral associations between  enterprises; forming more enterprise groups; correctly handling  relations between reform and development, on the one hand, and  stability on the other; carrying out production in light of  market demand; producing more readily marketable products;  shifting enterprise operational mechanisms; focusing on heavy  industrial growth, while continually pushing ahead with light  and textile industrial growth; and amalgamating more loss-making  enterprises with profit-making enterprises, with a view to  turning enterprise losses into profits. To this end, he said,  all comrades concerned should further enhance a sense of  enterprise reform and should strive to accelerate the on-going  enterprise reform.    Secretary Li Changchun noted: The large and medium-sized  state- run enterprises also should implement a joint-stock  cooperative system on a trial basis, further expand opening up  to the outside world, and firmly grasp two key work aspects at  the same time.</p>

The dependence of the heat transfer pattern on  the bundle height was evaluated by testing three bundles of 37  tubular rods, all rods having a 10 mm diameter and a 1 mm wall  thickness. The three bundles were formed by identical regular  hexagonal (4-5-6-7-6-5-4) arrays of tubes with a 14 mm center-to  center distance between neighboring ones, but their heights  differed: 700 mm, 1270 mm, 2500 mm. Each bundle was wrapped in a  3 mm thick jacket of a matching hexagonal shape with an 89 mm  inside width between parallel sides of the hexagonal  cross-section. The bundles were assembled by spacing the tubes  by means of a template at each end and, if necessary, one in the  middle. Each bundle was heated by passage of electric current  through the tubes and were cooled with water flowing through a  large circular channel surrounding the jacket. The temperature  was measured with thermocouples in capillary steel sheaths, at  equidistant locations along the height: six locations along each  of the two shorter bundles and ten locations along the third  one. The tubes around each bundle to which nine or ten  thermocouples were to be attached had been selected so as to  ensure symmetry and reproducibility of readings. Tests were  performed under conditions of mild vacuum: 0.1 MPa and 0.2 MPa.  For calculating the maximum temperature in a bundle, the data  have been processed in terms of both Nusselt and Rayleigh-2  numbers. The results, combined with available data on fuel rods  in a 1000 MW high-power graphite-moderated channel reactor  (RBMK-1000) with boiling-water coolant and an identical but 2845  mm high bundle of fuel rods, provide an adequate basis for  design optimization aimed to ensure cooling of such bundles by  natural convection.

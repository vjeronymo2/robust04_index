			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Namibia gets tough to defend its fishing grounds NAMIBIA, which has long had its rich fishing grounds plundered by other countries, is taking tough action to preserve what it hopes will become a major source of foreign exchange. South Africa, the country's former ruler, was itself exploiting the fish stocks and, as the rest of the world did not recognise South Africa's jurisdiction over Namibia, the Namibian coast became open range for fleets increasingly restricted by measures to conserve falling stocks elsewhere. Last April the newly-independent Namibia declared a 200-mile Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) and announced that fishing would be by licence only until research could be done into fish stocks. Stocks are believed to have plummetted, according to one survey. In 1977 60% of hake - the target of Spanish ships - caught off Namibia was past breeding age. In 1989 82% was less than a year old. The average annual hake catch is now half the 1972 peak of 800,000. The country has announced a total allowable hake catch of 60,000 tonnes in 1991, but only 15% of this is open to foreign fleets. This is less than 5% of what the EC fisheries directorate felt would be a reasonable compromise. Namibia has previously been powerless to prevent poaching because it lacks a credible fisheries protection fleet. But last November five Spanish ships were caught fishing illegally inside the EEZ in a daring helicopter operation Two weeks ago the Namibian Supreme Court sentenced the captains of the five Spanish vessels to pay fines totalling R155m (Pounds 33m) or serve prison terms of between 3 1/2 years and six years. Their ships were seized, with their equipment and catches. The day after the arrests Mr Manuel Marin, the European Community commissioner for fisheries, scuppered fishing quota talks between the EC and Namibia, citing Namibia's 'apparent conflict with a member state' and the low quotas offered to the Community. Mr David Morris, MEP for Mid and West Wales and a member of the fisheries committee of the European parliament, has written an open letter to the parliament protesting against what he regards as the use of the commission's powers to protect the interests of the large Spanish fishing companies. Mr Morris says: 'Namibia is not in conflict with the European Community. It is not even in conflict with the Spanish government.' The decision to halt negotiations 'has created the impression that the European Community as a body endorses the criminal activities of Spanish fishing crew.' Spain is the country with most to lose by Namibia's assertion of its fishing rights. Spanish ships net half the hake caught off the Namibian coast. Around ports like Vigo in Galacia, 50,000 people are said to be directly or indirectly dependent on the fishing industry. Spanish companies have been among the worst offenders in the widespread violation of Namibia's fishing moratorium. The Spanish government 'deplores and regrets' the poaching and has warned its fishermen that they face 'strict legal measures' if they violate Namibian waters. It has apprehended seven ships whose catches came from the area. Eventually Spain will have to accept a drastic reduction in its fishing off the Namibian coast if stocks are to recover and Namibia is to be allowed to build up its own fishing capability. The Spanish government's problem is that this will have severe domestic repercussions. Commissioner Marin has said there is 40% overcapacity in the EC fishing fleet; the north Atlantic has been seriously overfished; in the south Atlantic European fleets are finding that African governments such as Namibia and Sierre Leone - which last month arrested a French trawler - are becoming increasingly assertive. As Spain makes up such a large proportion of European tonnage, Spain will have to bear the brunt of the cuts if this overcapacity is to be reduced. In the past Namibian fishermen accounted for only 18% of the fish caught within the EEZ and little of the Pounds 100m-worth of catches by foreign fleets contributed to the country's economy. The government is keen to build up its own fishing fleet and processing industry after stocks have been given time to recover. This will be based around the deep water port of Walvis Bay, which, though currently part of South Africa, is widely expected to revert to Namibia soon. The Namibian government believes fishing could overtake mining as the economy's most important sector in five years time. In 1988 it constituted 2.5% of GDP and 4.4% of exports.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Tax rise on foreign companies 'would hurt US' CONGRESSIONAL proposals to increase taxes on US subsidiaries of foreign companies would hurt the American economy and undermine US tax treaties, according to testimony yesterday before the House Ways and Means Committee, writes Nancy Dunne. Mr Evan Galbraith, chairman of the Board of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and former US ambassador to France, vigorously attacked a bill he said would discourage investment and cost US jobs. 'To impose capital gains tax on direct investment, impute taxable income where none exists, tax insurance coverage, circumvent our treaty obligations and discourage American penetration of overseas markets is intellectually and economically indefensible,' he said. 'This bill is simply another manifestation of protectionism.' To counter past charges that foreign-owned subsidiaries are avoiding US taxes, the Organisation for International Investment released a new study, conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick, an independent accounting company, which concludes that there is little difference between foreign and US firms. Between 1983 and 1988 foreign-controlled companies paid an effective tax rate of about 2.1 per cent on average compared with an average rate of 2.2 per cent for major US subsidiaries, the study said. The difference is attributed to high start-up costs decade and a sharp depreciation of the dollar which raised the costs of doing business in the US. In 1988, the latest year figures are available, US subsidiaries paid Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3bn) in federal income tax, up 58.6 per cent from 1983. Non-US companies, already upset about hostile Congressional sentiment to foreign business, are alarmed about proposals by Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, to raise taxes on them.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Coal fund trustees reject proposals TRUSTEES OF the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme yesterday rejected one of the government's two proposals for administration of its pension funds after privatisation and said the other would need significant modifications before it could be accepted. The scheme's trustees said their legal advisers believe that the government's so-called Option B, which sets up a free-standing fund, 'is not capable of satisfying the government's commitment to safeguard pensions'. The scheme is the smaller of the two coal industry pension funds to be affected by privatisation. In its proposal for a free-standing scheme, the government said that members would benefit from all of the surplus generated by better-than-expected investment returns, but offered no protection against a shortfall. In the worst case, this proposal could lead to a reduction in members' benefits, the scheme's solicitors said. However, the trustees say the government's alternative proposal will also need further safeguards to ensure that pension promises are met. That proposal calls for the government to act as guarantor of the scheme's solvency, allows the government and pensioners to share in distribution of surpluses, and sets up a 'closed scheme'. Current contributors could participate in a new industry-wide scheme to which new employers would also contribute. Specifically, the trustees want the government to ensure that the practice of increasing pensions in line with inflation is maintained. The trustees are also calling for new legislation to codify members' rights to index-linked pensions.</p>

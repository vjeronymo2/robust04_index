			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Interest rate falls seen BELIEF that interest rates would fall in the UK was maintained yesterday, in spite of a moderate drop in unemployment, while lower Spanish rates gave hope that a trend of easier money might be emerging in Europe, writes Peter John. Short sterling futures were higher in the morning on the belief that there might be an increase in the number of unemployed during September. A rise would have underlined the weakness in the economy and reinforced the need for lower rates. When the seasonally adjusted figure came in with a drop of 13,600 in the jobless total, the sterling futures contract for December fell initially. From a high of 94.51 it hit a low of 94.44. However, the sell-off was short-lived as economists took a harder look at the figures and decided they were less encouraging than first thought. Also, the decision by the Bank of Spain to cut its key lending rate by half a percentage point to 9.5 per cent gave some hope that, in spite of the hard-line approach by the central banks of Belgium and France in recent days, European rates may be about to fall further. Lower rates in continental Europe would give a greater margin for easier lending conditions in the UK. In the event, short sterling was steady at 94.47 at the end of dealing and drifted down a couple of basis points during unofficial trading. Meanwhile short-term money rates were around  1/16 per cent lower although marketmakers said the easier money was merely responding to Wednesday's rally in the futures market. Certainly, short rates were under no pressure from interbank dealing yesterday. An early forecast shortage of Pounds 1.5bn was almost all taken out at the start of Bank of England operations. The Bank bought Pounds 1.25bn of bills at 5 29/32 per cent for resale on November 3 and 4. It also bought a further Pounds 125m of bills. At midday, the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank of England bought an additional Pounds 230m of bills taking assistance to just over Pounds 1.6bn. German call money was quoted at 6.7 per cent down from 6.8 on Wednesday, following the generous allocation of funds in this week's repo tender. The fall in the overnight rate prompted some dealers to look for a 5-basis point cut in next weeks repurchase agreement rate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] Chinese people have been flocking abroad to pursue  advanced studies since the late 1970s when the country opened up  to the outside world. Many of them have retuned after the  graduation. As CRI's [China Radio International] (Zhao Jianpu)  discovered, China has just set up an information system to help  make it the best use of these talented young people. Here is  (Tian Hong) with the details:    China has just set up a worldwide computer network to  collect  and give information for both the country's talent hunters and  returned students. (Gong Changshun) from the China Service  Center for Scholarly Exchange says the information system will  be a great help for the country in retrieving these talents.    [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong  Changshun says the system has come just in time as more and more  students are finishing their courses and returning home. The  official says since 1978 when China began its open-door policy,  the country has sent many people abroad for advanced studies.  Also a large number of others have gone abroad  privately-funded. Statistics show that so far the number of  returned students have reached 70,000. More than 140,000 are  still studying abroad. Gong Changshun says both the returned  and those who are still abroad are concerned as to how they can  best serve their country. But many of them have not found  suitable positions, due to a lack of information.    [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong  Changshun says the computer network covers most parts of China  and every Chinese embassy and consulate abroad. Due to the  network, information about the supply and demand of these  talented young people can be obtained immediately. In this way,  people can not only find more choices for their skills, but also  can effectively be introduced into joint-venture projects to aid  the country's economy. The official says that most talent  hunters and students who have returned or are still abroad are  welcome to join the scheme. The hotline number of the network  is 205-1306, that is 205-1306.

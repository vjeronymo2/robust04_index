			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- Douglas Hogg, the  minister of state at the Foreign Office, said in Belgrade today  that a plan for a comprehensive peace solution in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should be based on a proposal for the  territorial division advocated by the European Union. I have  not come to Belgrade with any specific plan, but I brought two  important messages, Hogg said after his meetings with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic. Hogg specified that the first message was  that it was of vital importance to cease hostilities as soon as  possible. The second message is that it is necessary to realize  that a comprehensive peace solution in Bosnia is based on a  division of the country, giving 51 percent of the territory to  the Muslim-Croat federation. Hogg stressed that the sanctions  will not be relaxed until the war stops and the peace plan  begins to be implemented in Bosnia. He confirmed that he had  discussed with Milosevic and Jovanovic the problem of the UN  protected areas in Croatia, but he did not specify what they  talked about.    As regards the fresh crisis surrounding Brcko and the latest  attempts to create an exclusion zone there as well, Hogg said  that this subject had not been discussed because these talks did  not involve any details. He stressed that he agreed with the  increase in the number of UN observers in that area, which the  Serb side had agreed to as well.    Yugoslav Minister Jovanovic explained that the stance on the  division of Bosnia that Hogg had mentioned was in fact an old EU  proposal, which Britain believes should be a framework for  demarcation in the resumed negotiations. This is not a problem  that should be obstructing the negotiating process and the  ending of the war at this moment, he underlined. We agreed that  the work of the contact group is very important and that it is  necessary to sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities  as soon as possible, which should be followed by political  negotiations, Jovanovic said.    What the Yugoslav side insists on, according to him, is that  the sanctions, as an acute problem, are the basic obstacle to  the implementation of any political solution either in Bosnia or  in Krajina, or, for that matter, the entire territory of  Yugoslavia. We pointed out that the sanctions are a form of  hostility against the entire Serbian nation, not only against us  in Yugoslavia, and that before the cessation of hostilities, due  attention ought to be paid to ending all other forms of  hostility. The sanctions are one of them, as well as the media  war and the biased approach of the international community to  the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav crisis in  general. It would be impossible to cease military hostilities  while keeping economic, propaganda and other forms in force.    Jovanovic told the reporters that Hogg's visit was part of  the British Government's initiative aimed at "assessing the  situation" for the work of the contact group which is preparing  a new peace conference. Hogg conveyed to us the assurances that  the British Government and probably other Western governments  were not prepared to fight the war for the Muslims against  anybody. We do not have any reason to doubt this, even though  the development of the situation will be the best proof for  this, Jovanovic said.    The assessment of the situation should be carried out before  the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed. The interested parties, i.e.  representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] mediation, will hold further talks to  discuss whether the agreement will be of limited duration or a  permanent one, Jovanovic pointed out.    According to Jovanovic, Kosovo was also discussed in the  context of an overall political solution in the former  Yugoslavia, and after visiting Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade,  Hogg will visit Pristina and it is very likely that he will go  to Zagreb again.</p>

The decisions of the Registration Commission of the Russian  MVES to exclude enterprises from the register may be reviewed by  the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy  and the Support of New Economic Structures and challenged in the  manner established by law.    If the Russian GKAP discovers violations of the established  rules and procedures of decisionmaking, it will be entitled to  request the Russian MVES for the reconsideration of the  enterprise's application for registration (or reregistration) by  the Registration Commission of the Russian MVES.    11.

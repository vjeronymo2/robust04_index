			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] faction is  demanding that the Duma act promptly to prevent the  privatization program for 1994-1996 from taking effect in  disregard of the constitution and the Duma. The demand, which  comes in a statement by the faction leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, was circulated in the parliament's lower house  today.    He says that on June 14 the Privatization Commission of the  State Property Committee approved the privatization concept and  program devised under the guidance of the commission's Chairman  Anatoliy Chubays and drafted a decree on how to implement this  program.    He reports that his faction has prepared an alternative  concept for the president, government, and Security Council and  insists on giving it as much publicity as the government's  package.    The LDP faction maintains that the Duma should  differentially  distribute incomes from privatization and denationalization and  proposes that the State Property Committee be abolished and a  committee to oversee property relations be set up and a state  committee be formed to control Russia's property abroad. The  Liberal Democrats also want all privatization profits, including  those remitted abroad, to be progressively taxed. To cut the  budget deficit, they consider it necessary to slash aid to  former Soviet republics.</p>

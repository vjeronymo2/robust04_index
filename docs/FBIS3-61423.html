Tseligorov, Rostov on Don; </F> UDC 62-503.4]    [Abstract] The criteria of multidimensional nonlinear  pulsed automatic systems are obtained on the basis of  w transforms which require a positive determination  of the Hermitian conjugate matrix. These criteria are modified  so that analysis of the absolute stability of the system is  reduced to computer verification of the strict continuation of  the real polynomial.

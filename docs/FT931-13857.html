			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Germany The Bundesbank cannot be best pleased with the way the budget debate is developing in Germany. The agreement that is taking shape looks likely to involve a much larger 1993 deficit than had hitherto been expected, while some of the more significant tax increases may not take effect till 1995. The disappointment may slow the pace of interest rate cuts later this year, though it is unlikely to reverse the gradual easing signalled two weeks ago. It would have been rash to have expected any significant move as early as today's council meeting. Pressure on the French franc has abated so there is no currency market reason to cut rates. The central bank will almost certainly want to keep up the pressure on public sector workers to accept a reasonable pay settlement. For the sake of its credibility it may also want to wait till the January money supply figure becomes available. This is likely to show a sharp deceleration since it will be the first monthly figure to be calculated off the high base established during the final quarter of 1992. The Bundesbank may have to acknowledge that little more can be achieved on the budget, especially since it is clearly growing more worried about the state of the economy. But the old pattern whereby slowdown leads to steep falls in rates may not be repeated if the budget deficit starts pushing up yields in the bond market.</p>

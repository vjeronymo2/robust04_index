			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Beware investment nomads - Serious Money Telecommunications giant BT started the UK privatisation crusade ten years ago today. And as our popular shares table shows, investors in BT and most of the other privatisations have done very nicely out of the share sales. But privatisation has generally had a greater effect on the companies involved than on the attitude of private individuals to the stock market. People who happily bought shares in some or all of the big privatisations, have not gone on to buy other shares through the secondary market. The proportion of UK shares held by individuals is still falling. This is partly because many people still find the stockmarket daunting and expensive, partly because no one tries to sell 'second hand' shares to the public in the same way that they sell privatisation issues and unit trusts. Most major investment houses and many major companies prefer having large investment funds as shareholders. Small shareholders are seen as 'expensive', particularly when they insist on holding shares in their own name rather than through nominees. Such dismissive attitudes are understandable - but a touch short-sighted. Professional investors tend to be far more fickle than personal investors. Investment managers looking for new markets or new types of investment can be as lethal as tourists pillaging an unspoilt holiday spot. (The recent collapse in the silver price provides a good example of what can happen to a small market when the tourists lose interest.) But investment tourism is here to stay. Figures published this week showed that foreign ownership of UK shares had risen to 16 per cent in 1993, compared with less than four per cent at the start of the 1980s. Over the same period share ownership by private individuals has fallen steadily from over 28 to under 18 per cent - despite the privatisation programme. The most important investment tourists are US fund managers. For a long time they had remained relatively parochial, but US pension fund managers have belatedly woken up to the charms of geographical diversification. For private investors the question is not whether the trend is a good thing but how to adapt to the changing investment environment. US investors have clear preferences: what they like are large companies in which they can buy - and sell - substantial holdings easily. That tends to mean the largest companies: those in the FT-SE 100 index and the top of the 250 index. Usually such companies can absorb substantial foreign buying without their shares prices responding excessively. This is good both for the buyers and for other investors in the companies. But if American interest is particularly strong it can send the share price of even a large company soaring, which is fine until American interest wanes. In the first few months of 1987, for instance, strong American buying was the main factor behind a doubling in the share price of drugs group Glaxo. When the October crash came, and investors round the world put foreign holdings at the top of their 'sell' list, the Americans sold Glaxo as hard as they had earlier bought it. And the Glaxo share price lost virtually all its earlier gains overnight. The year 1987 was an unusual one. And it is rare for shares in a large company to be affected so severely by the changing attitude of international investors. But if American buying were to move further down the size scale, such roller coaster share price movements could become more prevalent. Some UK fund managers are now being given authority to take their American clients into medium-sized and even smaller companies. Private individuals have two possible ways of dealing with these outside influences on UK share prices. They can either try to 'make the trend their friend', hoping to make short term profits from the tourists; or they can take a really long term view, and view short term gyrations with Olympian detachment. The former approach is tempting - but can be expensive.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Welfare costs 'exaggerated' CLAIMS THAT the cost of the welfare state is rising to levels the UK cannot afford are countered in a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. The report appears a day after Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said further increases in welfare spending could take government spending to unsustainable levels. The foundation says that while Britain's welfare spending has risen sharply over the past three years, it has been stable as a share of national income over the medium term. That share - about a quarter of GDP - is below the level in most other European countries, according to the foundation. The report, based on research by the Welfare State Programme at the London School of Economics, says that claims about upward pressure on welfare costs have been exaggerated. Even with an ageing population and higher pension costs, the share of GDP taken by the welfare state will grow slowly, the report says. If benefit levels were again linked to earnings, the cost of the welfare state would rise by 5 per cent of GDP over the next 50 years. This is no more than the increase in welfare spending in the last three years, according to Mr John Hills, the report's author. 'There is still a wide range of policy options open to ministers,' he said. Scaling down the welfare state would hit more than just the poorest in society, the report says. Many relatively well-off people depend on the health service and social security system during times when their income is lowest. Mr Hills said: 'If the aim of policy remains one of holding down welfare spending as a percentage of GDP, hard choices may have to be made about entitlement to benefits.'

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> OREGON NO PROBLEM FOR ARKANSAS  </P> <P> Arlyn Bowers didn't score a point for ninth-ranked Arkansas, but according to  Coach Nolan Richardson, he was the main reason the Razorbacks beat Oregon,  102-75, Sunday at Little Rock, Ark.  </P> <P> Bowers played 10 minutes and missed all three of his shots.  </P> <P> "Arlyn Bowers picked up our defensive intensity," Richardson said after a  couple of scoring spurts by Lee Mayberry helped the Razorbacks get by the  Ducks. "They took our intensity away by spreading the floor and trying to lull  us to sleep, but Arlyn took care of that."  </P> <P> Mayberry scored 10 in the opening minutes and another eight during a  second-half run. Mayberry's initial scoring outburst -- including two  three-point baskets -- gave the Razorbacks a 27-10 lead with 14:20 left in the  first half. Oregon trailed by 12 at the half and closed to 60-53 with 13  minutes left in the game.  </P> <P> Oliver Miller started a 37-9 Razorback run with a short jump shot and then  blocked a shot that led to a Mayberry basket. Mayberry made a three-point shot  and then fed Lenzie Howell for a basket and a 69-53 lead with 11:20 left.  Mayberry's three-point basket made it 76-60, and it was 97-62 when the run  ended with four minutes remaining.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: Don't shoot the messenger Brian Basham's involvement on the murkier side of British Airways' row with Virgin is not the first time that the best known 'street fighter' in City public relations has been in a spot of bother. Nor is it likely to be the last. Although he has come off worst this time, he isn't going to retire from the trade. He enjoys it too much. The workaholic son of a south London butcher, he is one of the more enduring features of the topsy-turvy world of City PR. His nose for a good City story  -first spotted by the Daily Mail's former city editor Sir Patrick Sergeant  -has proved valuable over the years to countless journalists who often used him as a discreet source. He served his apprenticeship under John Addey, the ex-barrister who invented modern financial PR. That was nearly 20 years ago and since then Basham has invariably had a view, and often a role, in many of the City's juicier stories. In his heyday in the 1980s he was the 'best bid man around', says one rival. Indeed, some nervous companies hired him to stop him working for a predator. A changing City climate has meant that demand for his special influence-peddling skills is not what it was. But whatever the concerns about his business methods, and there is an element of sour grapes in some of the criticisms, he is a street-wise survivor. If he has a fault, it's failing to follow the motto of one of his proteges, Brunswick's Alan Parker: 'Never get between the client and the footlights'. Basham's problem is that he frequently does.</p>

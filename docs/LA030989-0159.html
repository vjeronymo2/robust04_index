			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOP-SEEDED BREA-OLINDA KEEPS ROLLING ALONG  </P> <P> So much for Our Lady of Peace. Now, it's on to more difficult tasks for the  Brea-Olinda High School girls' basketball team.  </P> <P> After beating Our Lady of Peace High of San Diego, 81-36, Tuesday in the first  round of the Division III Southern California Regionals, Brea plays host to  Reedley of the Central Section in a semifinal game at 7:30 tonight.  </P> <P> The winner advances to the regional final Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> Lemoore (19-8) plays Palm Desert (24-3) in tonight's other Division III  semifinal.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Brea (28-2) has had just one difficult game in postseason play thus  far, and that was a seven-point victory over Lakewood St. Joseph in the  Southern Section 3-A semifinals. The Wildcats, who won the 3-A title by 29  points over Atascadero last Friday, have won 19 consecutive games.  </P> <P> The Wildcats are unbeaten against California teams. Their only two losses came  in the Christ the King tournament in New York City in December.  </P> <P> The question tonight is: Can Reedley (13-13) stay with Brea, much less beat the  Wildcats?  </P> <P> Reedley put on a fine defensive showing in the second half in beating Ramona of  San Diego, 54-26, in the first round.  </P> <P> The Pirates held Ramona to eight points in the second half, three in the third  quarter. Ramona made just one field goal in the second half.  </P> <P> Tracy Ainger, a freshman forward, had 18 points to lead Reedley.  </P> <P> Aimee McDaniel, who had 22 points against Our Lady of Peace, leads Brea with a  15.3 scoring average. Tammy Blackburn (12.6 points a game) and Jinelle Williams  (11.1) also average in double figures for Brea.  </P> <P> In Division II games:  </P> <P> Valencia (21-9) at Vista (27-3): Valencia wore down Mt. Whitney of Visalia in  its first-round game. The Tigers used their speed and height advantages to win,  65-50. Kristen McDonald, a 6-foot senior center, had 24 points to lead  Valencia.  </P> <P> It won't be quite so easy tonight. Top-seeded Vista, which breezed past Canyon,  80-38, in the first round, has the size to match up with Valencia.  </P> <P> Chris Enger, Vista's 6-4 senior center, averages 26 points a game. Tuesday, she  had 43, outscoring Canyon by herself. Vista led, 35-22, at halftime against  Canyon, but showed its explosiveness by outscoring the Comanches, 29-9, in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> The winner meets the Muir-Katella winner for the Regional championship Saturday  at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Muir (24-4) at Katella (27-3): This is rematch of the Southern Section 4-A  title game a week ago.  </P> <P> In that one, Katella staged a dramatic, fourth-quarter rally and won in  overtime, 54-48. Joni Easterly, a 5-11 guard, led the Knights with 34 points.  </P> <P> Easterly, who averages 22 points a game, topped last Thursday's performance  with a 36-point game in Katella's 56-39 victory over San Marcos Tuesday.  </P> <P> Muir edged Bakersfield North, 62-56, in its first-round game.  </P> <P> If the Mustangs are to avoid a repeat of last week's game, they need to handle  the ball better and get it inside to 6-3 center Lisa Salsman. Salsman had just  12 against North Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling boost for Wellcome PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome bucked the market's desultory trend yesterday after the company reassured analysts about prospects in a series of one-to-one presentations. The shift in the value of sterling and the dollar after Black Wednesday on September 16 will help profits. A number of specialists left the meetings to upgrade their forecasts. Among them was Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon who raised his profit forecast from the 'low 600s' to Pounds 670m for 1993, believed to be around the top end of the range. The stock jumped 20 in early trade but the shine was taken off its performance later by the sharp slide in the market and the sale of a large line of stock. Dealers said NatWest Securities was selling a block of 2m shares at 915p and, although the selling was easily absorbed, Wellcome's gains were trimmed to a net rise of 2 at 914p. Turnover was heavy at 5.1m shares. Cellular worries Shares in the cellular telephone operators came off sharply amid speculation that their call rates might be heavily undercut by a new agreement between BT and Personal Communications Network (PCN) operators - the new rivals to cellular. Market sources suggested that the new PCN interconnect rates would be only marginally above present BT landcall rates - around 10p per minute - compared with the rates paid by the cellular groups Vodafone and Cellnet, of around 33p per minute. If true, the agreement could impact on the cellular groups' earnings. They have both recently launched a new package of rates designed to attract new customers in advance of the PCN launch, expected this summer. Yesterday, BT, co-owner of Cellnet, retreated 6 1/2 to 377 1/2 p, Vodafone 12 to 407p, while Cable &amp; Wireless, the majority owner of PCN operator Mercury, fell 3 to 708p. Meanwhile, BT was the subject of revived talk that it would spend the proceeds of its sale of McCaw to buy into MCI, one of the US's leading long-distance telecoms groups. BT made Pounds 1.8bn from the McCaw deal which would buy it a 10-15 per cent stake in MCI. Glaxo retreats A sharp slide in Glaxo took the market by surprise yesterday. In spite of stories ranging from impending rights issues to worries about drugs, the bottom line appeared to be a continuing shift away from the stock in the US. The growing US concern was highlighted by the selling of 650,000 American Depositary Receipts, equivalent to 1.3m shares at Dollars 21.50 or around 700p. Dealers said the stock was now testing chart levels on both sides of the Atlantic. There was further concern following a television programme on Monday night which was critical of Glaxo's Myodil drug and some suggestions, generally discounted, that Glaxo might be considering a rights issue. The company has signalled its interest in making an acquisition in the OTC market (over the counter drugs) but analysts say the company has a cash pile of around Pounds 1.5bn and would be able to avoid a cash call. Finally, Smith New Court cut its 1993 forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 1660m and its 1994 numbers by Pounds 70m to Pounds 1900m. However, Smiths argue that they are merely bringing their numbers in line with the market consensus. Taiwan cheers BAe Turnover in British Aerospace rose sharply to 8.4m, making it the day's most actively traded stock as the market greeted with relief confirmation of the long awaited deal with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture regional jets. Analysts said the deal meant the company would not have to close the Woodford assembly plant, brought cash to BAe, enhanced the residual value of the 146 aircraft, and gave it access to a fast growing market. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite, one of the leading enthusiasts of the stock, said the deal was 'a major achievement for the new management'. He raised his end of year prediction of the share price from 250p to 300p. The team at Smith New Court, though appreciative of the deal, said: 'The share price is likely to pause until developments on Al-Yamamah 2 become clearer.' The shares closed 9 up at 194p. Ladbroke boosted News that the government is to extend betting shop opening hours during the summer to 10pm helped shares in Ladbroke rally after weak trading for most of the day. Analysts said the development could add up to Pounds 5m to the group's pre-tax profits and should give a strong boost to the shares. After declining in early trading, they recovered to close steady at 189p yesterday. Other betting groups also benefitted. Bass, off 15 at one stage, rallied to close 9 adrift at 579p. Brent Walker jumped 1 1/2 to 8 3/4 p. Recent takeover talk surrounding Higgs and Hill came to a head with the sale by Berkeley Group of its 0.7 per cent stake in its fellow construction group. Berkeley began building its stake earlier this month and Higgs claims that its request for the company's intentions to be qualified were not satisfied, with Berkeley saying it intended to add to its holding, according to Higgs. Berkeley was served with a 212 notice and then sold its stake, the shares being immediately picked up by institutions yesterday after advancing strongly during early trading. They closed 6 ahead at 49p with turnover of 2.3m. Berkeley added 4 to 318p. Berkeley says it brought the stake recently as a trading investment and that its sale yesterday was not prompted by the 212 notice. There was some talk in the market that Berkeley may have been interested in buying Higgs' housebuilding business and using its stakebuilding as a lever. Higgs strongly denied it had held any disposal talks with Berkeley. However, more cynical analysts speculated that Berkeley had a reputation for lucrative trading investments, hence institutions willingness to buy the stock once it came into the market. Restructuring at Xerox helped Rank Organisation, the shares leaping 7 to 701p. Thorn EMI was worried by a downgrade from Credit Lyonnais Laing and also talk of a litigation trial due to begin next month in the US. The shares lost 15 to 843p. A weak brewers sector was cheered by news that the government was not ordering an investigation into the industry. Scottish and Newcastle added 3 to 444p and Grand Metropolitan 6 to 426p. SmithKline Beecham attracted heavy buying which resulted in turnover of 4.3m in the 'A's (up a penny at 478p) and 5.3m in the Units (2 1/2 better at 417p). Shell Transport slid 8 1/2 to 517 1/2 p as the Dutch arm predicted poor 1992 results from its refining and chemicals activities. Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi saw healthy turnover after one house took on a block of 1.5m shares at 168p and sold them at 168 1/2 p. Agency broker James Capel was a likely candidate as it is worried about the group's performance in the US and preparing to cut forecasts for the year. Recently-merged television station Yorkshire-Tyne Tees lifted 8 to 144p on raised full-year profits of Pounds 16.1m. However, James Capel is a seller arguing that the full impact of the company's Pounds 52m franchise bid has yet to hit the bottom line. Analyst Mr Guy Lamming said; 'They will have to run very quickly just to stand still.' Broadcasting group Carlton Communications added 5 at 815p mainly due to a stock shortage in thin trading conditions. Good demand for Rolls-Royce led to a squeeze. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 116 1/2 p, on turnover of 4.6m. Bid speculation returned to APV and the shares hardened 5 to 124p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (111).

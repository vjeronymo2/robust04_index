			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We begin with an item related to yesterday's  special edition of "Sava-Ravina" ["Close Examination," Sunday  radio program], which all of us probably listened to. Our guest  was Professor Albert Zafy, the president of the Republic, who  discussed the current state of national affairs for more than  two hours.    One of the topics he touched on during the program was the  disruptive acts being perpetrated by some people in the country,  acts which President Albert Zafy described as acts of  destabilization.    The head of state said yesterday that these acts of  destabilization as well as those perpetrating them had many  facets. He especially stressed that foreigners, local people,  and foreigners in collusion with local people were among those  involved in perpetrating these acts.    We have this evening received news concerning foreigners in  collusion with local people. It is now known that, once again,  there is an important foreign ambassador, still working and  living in our country, who is attempting to disrupt the country.  In other words, he is indulging in what is called  destabilization.    According to news which reached us, the foreign diplomat is  known to have toured various provinces during the series of  elections held in the country in 1993, supporting at that time  and still supporting, people who were not officially elected  during these elections.    Investigations are now being held and evidence shows that  the  foreign diplomat is really indulging in acts aimed at preventing  the head of state from carrying out his duty. This is what is  called conspiracy.    There are even some top officials of the former regime who,  according to what we have learned, are spreading rumors and even  boasting that they would inevitably return to power. [passage  omitted]    Not long ago, during a ceremony held on the occasion of the  launching of Radio France International, RFI, many of our  country's leaders including President Albert Zafy himself talked  to RFI journalists. The president also mentioned this  destabilization on that occasion which this foreign diplomat was  trying to bring about in Madagascar. President Albert Zafy,  however, at that time, pointed out that it was not the foreign  country which was the subject of his concern but the behavior of  its ambassador in Madagascar.    If we broaden our analysis, we may deduce that what happened  in Togo, Rwanda, and Burundi, for example, may be considered as  destabilization acts similar to those we are now experiencing in  Madagascar. Those acts caused the death of the Rwandan and  Burundian presidents.    We will all be monitoring the developments of this affair.  What is worth noting is that there are acts of destabilization  being perpetrated in our country by some local people or  foreigners or foreigners in collusion with local people. We all  have to be vigilant.</p>

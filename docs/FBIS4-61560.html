			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk 8 May TASS -- "Russia does not reject  partnership with NATO. But it should be partnership on an equal  basis," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an  exclusive interview with TASS on Sunday.    "This has been and will be our concept in foreign policy,"  he  stressed.    The foreign minister, who was elected to the Russian  Parliament's Lower House from the Murmansk constituency, arrived  earlier in the day in this city in northern Russia on a trip  related to his deputy's duties.    Elaborating on Russia's role in the pan-European process,  Kozyrev said: "We are not a weak country. We do not have any  inferiority complexes. Therefore we are ready for cooperation  with NATO as an equal partner."    According to the Russian diplomat, the agreement on Russia's  joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, was not signed  in April as scheduled because of "the need to finalize the  document offered to us."    "I believe we will go ahead with signing not only this  framework document, even not this framework document at all, but  a broader and more comprehensive programme of cooperation  between Russia and NATO," the foreign minister emphasised.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM PROGRAM CHANGES TO KEEP UP WITH WORLD  </P> <P> With a new $8.8-million building overlooking the Pacific and a complement of  almost 40 full-time and visiting professors, the University of California's  grand experiment to prepare students for the economic and cultural challenges  from Pacific Rim nations has moved into a critical stage.  </P> <P> As the question of America's competitiveness in the world becomes a central  national theme, the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific  Studies at UC San Diego sees itself playing a central role in shaping the U.S.  response.  </P> <P> The school, with a highly regarded group of academics, an unusually strong and  diverse group of students, and a curriculum unlike any other at American  universities, has already established its credibility for preparing students to  address deficiencies in the policy-making skills of public and private  institutions concerning Asia and Latin America.  </P> <P> But its senior professors say the breakneck pace of change in worldwide  economic and political events, on top of the growing pains inevitable at any  new professional school -- let alone one with such a new and ambitious agenda  -- are forcing continuing refinements and revisions.  </P> <P> As it prepares to welcome its fourth class of graduate students in September,  the school is altering the curriculum to respond to changing business needs,  working to improve student job placements and seeking to recruit bright young  professors to deepen the school's intellectual depth.  </P> <P> "We're operating within a (world) situation of great flux," said Peter  Gourevich, UCSD professor of political science and dean of the school. "We're  still asking ourselves what does it take to prepare people for a rapidly  changing American role in this new international environment?"  </P> <P> Professor Chalmers Johnson, a longtime expert on Japan and China recruited from  UC Berkeley, punctuated that assessment with reference to the  multi-disciplinary needs of students for political, economic, historical and  linguistic preparation.  </P> <P> From an initial number of 30 students in September, 1987, the school has grown  to 150 today, with a total of 400 expected by mid-decade. Most study a two-year  syllabus leading to a master's degree in Pacific international affairs, with a  handful pursuing doctoral degrees in the subject.  </P> <P> About two-thirds specialize in Asia, with one-third concentrating on Latin  America in their second year after a rigorous year of interdisciplinary core  studies. More students plan careers in the corporate sector, as opposed to  public policy/government positions, than originally anticipated by school  planners.  </P> <P> "The language requirement has been tough," said Megan DeJarlais, one of seven  students spending the summer between her first and second year taking intensive  Japanese to sharpen skills before taking the school's dreaded language  proficiency exam.  </P> <P> Placement of the students after graduation is critical to the school's eventual  acceptance as a major academic institution, and the picture has been mixed with  the first two graduating classes.  </P> <P> "We are putting more energy into career preparation, from the first week of  orientation, to stress that they need to think about their goals, what job they  want, how to put together a resume, how to interview," Gourevich said.  </P> <P> So far, students have been placed in the private sector more easily than in  government or foundation positions.  </P></p>

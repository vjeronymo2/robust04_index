			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic] </F>   [Text] The Third Fatherland Congress of the Serbian  Radical Party [SRS] is currently being held in the Trade Unions  Hall in Belgrade. The agenda includes the adoption of a new  statute and the party's program, the report on the work of the  party in the past period, and the election of the president and  the Central Fatherland Administration. Party president Vojislav  Seselj submitted a report on the work of the party. Dragoljub  Stankic reports:    [Stankic] The 672 delegates and 358 guests of the SRS from  the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, the republic  of Srpska, and the republic of Serbian Krajina tumultuously  greeted the arrival of Vojislav Seselj, president of the Serbian  Radicals. He submitted a report on the work of the party at the  very beginning of the congress.    Seselj spoke about the period starting with 1989, the  revival  of the Serbian national conscience, and the founding of the  party in 1990, which was at that time called, as Seselj said,  the Serbian Liberation Movement. The party then changed its  name into the Serbian Renewal Movement, the Serbian Chetnik  Movement, and finally the Serbian Radical Party in 1991.    The civil war broke out. Many volunteers from the party went  to defend the Serbian lands. About 70 percent of the Serbian  ethnic regions have been defended in the republic of Serbian  Krajina, and almost all Serbian villages in the republic of  Srpska, Seselj stressed. Today, it is only possible to  establish peace where the lines of the front are, Seselj said.  His message to Radovan Karadzic was to declare the independence  of the republic of Srpska and join the Republic of Serbia in a  single state. This was greeted with applause.    In the 1992 elections, the party was successful, but decided  to support the minority government of the Socialists. A year  later, the party embarked on overthrowing the government. As  Seselj said, the party decided to do this not because of the  wish for power, but because of the poor results, mistakes in the  economy, and the flourishing crime.    Seselj said he was satisfied with the election results in  the  republic of Serbian Krajina. He announced that the Radicals  would form a coalition government with the Serbian Democratic  Party of Krajina.    At the end of his speech Seselj said that his message to the  Socialists of Serbia and Montenegro was that he will not allow  the return of ideological premises, which he thought were  superseded. His message for the Serbian Democratic Party in the  republic of Srpska was that he will not abandon the joint front  for the defense of the Serbian land.    His speech was followed by a discussion on the report.  Nikola Poplasen, Rade Leskovac, Jovan Glamocanin, and many  others have already spoken. The delegates are currently in a  recess. When they return, they will, as expected, elect the  president of the party by a secret ballot. There are seven  candidates. The 50 members of the Central Fatherland  Administration, a new political organ of the Serbian Radicals of  all Serbian lands, will be elected by show of hand.</p>

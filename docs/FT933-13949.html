			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / A tempting glimpse of freedom at GUS: Neil Buckley finds the UK shopping group taking a rare step into the limelight Few companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 4.7bn have kept such a low profile as Great Universal Stores. Analysts who travelled from as far afield as Scotland to a rare GUS presentation last year were incensed at the company's lack of candour. Yesterday GUS was the talk of the City, not for its 45th yearly increase in pre-tax profits - a 7 per cent rise to Pounds 475m - but for its decision to enfranchise its non-voting shares, ending the Wolfson family's effective control of the company after 60 years. But GUS did more than extend voting rights. It enlarged its board by appointing four new non-executive directors and an executive director, issued a detailed 16-page press release described by one analyst as 'hardly Wolfsonesque', and increased the number of shares by a scrip issue to make them more marketable. Observers were left speculating that a cultural revolution was under way within one of the UK's more conservative and secretive companies. Some hope it might use its large cash reserves to become once again the dynamic and acquisitive company it was in the 1950s and 1960s. GUS grew from a retail and wholesale business selling household goods founded by three brothers at the turn of the century. After the first world war, it became a pioneer of mail order in the UK, publishing a catalogue which agents used to sell goods door-to-door. Mr Isaac Wolfson, son of a Russian Jewish immigrant family from Glasgow, gained control of the company in 1932 and it was he who used the profits from the mail order business to expand GUS into one of the UK's largest retailing groups. Wolfson began issuing non-voting A shares in 1952, and used these in combination with cash to fund a series of acquisitions, including the women's clothing group Morrison's, Jones and Higgins house furnishers, and Burberrys, the upmarket clothing retailer. By the early 1960s, GUS's interests encompassed footwear, hotels, electrical goods, builder's merchants, food retailing and a travel agency. In contrast to today, its shares were seen as volatile and speculative, and concern was sometimes expressed about the size of the borrowings. By the 1970s, GUS was the UK's biggest high street retailer, with more than 2,200 shops. But the mail order business was always the core and in the 1980s GUS sold off many high street interests, leaving it with only Burberrys and Scotch House, the woollen clothing retailer. However, it retained many of the freeholds and long leaseholds of the businesses it sold, the foundation of a sizeable property business. Today's business breaks down into four divisions with catalogue and home shopping at the core. The company has a reputation as a solid, defensive stock, which it seems in little danger of losing. But is it now about to become rather more than that? GUS is sitting on Pounds 1.3bn cash, which it is often accused of failing to put to good use. As one analyst put it: 'We have seen the glasnost, which was most welcome. But the question is, will we now get the perestroika?' Mr Richard Pugh, GUS deputy chairman, said the company had been on the look-out for a major acquisition for some years, but had not found one that met its criteria of having a good, continuing management, in a business GUS understands, at the right price. Analysts suggest the ideal acquisition would be an overseas mail order company, allowing GUS to utilise its expertise and benefit from economies of scale. One possible target might be La Redoute, whose parent company Pinault-Printemps has financial difficulties. But that might run into monopoly problems, as the French company already owns UK mail order operator Empire. An intriguing possibility is that GUS could bid for Next, the UK clothing retailer which is now staging a recovery. Next's chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale used to be a director of GUS, is a cousin of GUS chairman Lord Wolfson of Marylebone, and was one of the four non-executive directors appointed by GUS yesterday. Mr David Jones, Next chief executive, used to work for GUS and is said to be keen to run the business. GUS sold large parts of its high street empire in the 1980s to Next and to Combined English Stores, which was later taken over by Next. David Wolfson's return to the board also points to a possible solution to the succession problem at GUS, where there is no obvious heir. Some analysts, however, remained sceptical about whether yesterday's enfranchisement of the voting shares meant GUS would throw off its conservative image. Said one: 'I think the most excitement we will get from it may be what we have had today.' The results for the year to March 31 showed catalogue and home shopping increasing pre-tax profits to Pounds 207.7m from Pounds 195.5m. Burberrys and Scotch House advanced from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 37m, with Scotch House announcing plans to open a franchised boutique in Mexico City and Burberrys a similar one in Shanghai. Finance, banking and business information services rose from Pounds 137.4m to Pounds 140.2m; property lifted its contribution from Pounds 50.2m to Pounds 52.1m. About Pounds 117m of the Pounds 475m pre-tax profit came from interest income. Earnings per share rose from 118.8p to 128.2p. The 10 per cent total dividend increase to 44p, after a final of 30.25p, exceeded expectations.

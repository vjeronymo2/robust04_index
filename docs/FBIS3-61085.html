This statute specifies a set of measures controlling  exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems  (ballistic missiles, space-launch vehicles and research  rockets), remotely piloted vehicles (cruise missiles,  radio-controlled target drones and radio-controlled  reconnaissance aircraft) capable of delivering a payload a  distance of 300 km and more, and equipment, materials, and  technology that could be used in their manufacture and also  special equipment intended for the preparation and launch of the  said missiles and remotely piloted vehicles (hereinafter called  goods and services used for missile manufacture).    2. Exports (transfers, exchanges) from the Russian  Federation  of goods and services used in the manufacture of missiles shall  be controlled in order to counteract the proliferation of  missile equipment and technology that could facilitate the  manufacture or acquisition of missile systems capable of  delivering weapons of mass destruction and also the manufacture  or acquisition of the production capacity for such systems and  encompasses all types of foreign economic activity (other than  imports), including production and S&amp;T relations, coastal and  border trade, commodity-exchange transactions, and the  demonstration of exhibits at international exhibitions and fairs.    3. It is not the purpose of the statute to put obstacles in  the way of national space programs or international cooperation  in such programs, except in the instances where their  realization could facilitate the manufacture of systems for the  delivery of weapons of mass destruction.    4. The procedure for control of exports from the Russian  Federation of goods and services used in the manufacture of  missiles specifies:    the preparation and issue of findings concerning the  possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) of goods and  services applied in the manufacture of missiles enumerated in  the List of Equipment, Materials, and Technology Used in the  Manufacture of Missile Weapons Whose Exports Are Controlled and  Realized by License (hereinafter called the List) approved by  Directive No. 20-rp of the president of the Russian Federation  on 11 January 1993 (in the 19 November 1993 version of Directive  No. 744-rp of the president of the Russian Federation);    the licensing and customs formalization of the exports  (transfers, exchanges) of goods and services applied in missile  manufacture.    5. The List shall consist of two categories (parts).    Category I shall include the complete rocket systems capable  of delivering a payload weighing no less than 500 kg a distance  of 300 km and more and the equipment and technology that are  most significant in the manufacture of missile weapons, exports  of which are, as a rule, banned.    Category II shall include complete rocket systems that are  capable of delivering a payload a distance of 300 km and more,  but which are not part of the systems specified in Category I,  and the material, equipment, and technology used in the  manufacture of missile weapons that are exported by license.    6. Exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems  and goods and services included in categories I and II of the  List and also of all missiles or remotely piloted vehicles shall  be prohibited if there is reason to believe that they are  intended for use as a system for the delivery of weapons of mass  destruction.    In the consideration of the applications specified in Clause  8 of this statute for the issue of findings on the possibility  of exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems and  remotely piloted vehicles pertaining to Category II, and also  the equipment, materials, and technology used in the said  systems, account shall be taken of the possibility of a swap of  distance for payload weight, as a result of which they would  pertain to Category I.    In the specific instances where equipment pertaining to  Category I could in accordance with note 2 of the List be  specified for export (transfer, exchange) in the procedure  established for materials, equipment, and technology pertaining  to Category II, the exporter must comply with the conditions  specified in Clause 7 of this statute.

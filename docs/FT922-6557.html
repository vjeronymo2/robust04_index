			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as Fed dashes rate cut hopes Wall Street US SHARE prices lost ground yesterday as hopes for an interest rate cut diminished on reports that the Federal Reserve had decided against easing monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 15.13 off at 3,378.71. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.79 to 412.60, the Nasdaq composite shed 1.19 to 579.10 and the Amex composite eased 0.52 to 391.63. Turnover on the New York SE totalled 184.8m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by about two-to-one. The catalyst for the early losses was a newspaper report that the Fed's policy-making open market committee had agreed at its regular monthly meeting earlier this week not to cut interest rates immediately. Share prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by hopes that the Fed would lower rates to give the sluggish recovery a final push-start, but the report suggests that any easing of policy will have to wait until after publication of the May employment report on June 5. Market sentiment was also damaged by the weekly jobless claims data, which showed a 10,000 decline in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance during the first full week of May. The figures, while indicating an improvement in labour market conditions, also reduced the chances of an interest rate cut. US Shoe dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 12 5/8 in turnover of 1.46m shares after reporting first-quarter profits below those of a year ago and warning that second-quarter earnings would also be down on the equivalent period of 1991. Among financials, Morgan Stanley fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 in active trading after the investment bank reported net income of Dollars 139m for the three months ended March 31. The company, which has just changed to a January 31 year from a calendar year, said global sales and trading activity remained strong, but below the record levels achieved a year ago. In the same sector, Salomon declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 , giving up some of the gain earned on Wednesday when the US Attorney announced that the securities house would not face criminal charges in connection with the bond trading scandal which erupted in August last year. Salomon was, however, ordered to pay Dollars 290m fines and compensation to settle civil charges related to the scandal. On the Nasdaq market, Amgen rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 59 in turnover of 1.7m shares after chief executive Mr Gordon Binder said he was comfortable with analysts' estimates that the group's sales this year will reach Dollars 1bn. Canada THE Toronto market followed Wall Street lower in moderately active trading. The composite index ended 23.2 down at 3,358.0 and falls outpaced rises by 354 to 221 after volume of 28.7m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-groups lost ground, with declines of at least 1 per cent shown by financial services, consumer products and mining. Hudson's Bay, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 30 1/8 , said it narrowed its first-quarter loss to CDollars 4.5m from the CDollars 23.1m recorded a year earlier.</p>

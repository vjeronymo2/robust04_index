			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / At war with the Mafia in an island of fear: A car bomb in Florence only 10 days ago killed five people and reminded Italy of the honourable society's muscle. But the big battle remains in Sicily where the state is cracking down on organised crime THOSE murdered by the Mafia in Sicily are accorded magnificent funerals. As if to compensate for society's inability to protect them, the coffins are decked with enormous wreaths of flowers and there are great outpourings of grief. Dignitaries of church and state attend in all their finery to eulogise the dead. Yet, once buried, the names of the victims disappear from the public's conscience. Giovanni Falcone is an exception. The brutal murder of this anti-Mafia magistrate just over a year ago has made him a latter-day martyr and a symbol of all that is uncorrupted in Italy's body politic. His killing, followed two months later by that of colleague Paolo Borsellino - both blown up by bombs - has proved a turning point, both in public attitudes towards organised crime and the willingness of the government to fight it. By its actions, the Mafia overstepped itself. The challenge to the authority of the state became too great to ignore, and the traditional short-lived responses to such outrages - debates in parliament, a flurry of police activity, the round-up of a few token mafiosi - were no longer tolerable. 'The state has taken the war to the Mafia,' says Giorgio Musio, the prefect (police chief) of Palermo. 'Especially among the young, there is a new mood. People want to stand up to the Mafia and break with the tradition of omerta (the vow of silence traditional among mafiosi). Among Mafia members themselves, these violent tactics have provoked divisions, causing some to turn against the honoured society.' Musio represents the new stamp of authority in Palermo. He was drafted there last August from the tranquility of Florence to boost morale among police shaken by the killings, and to co-ordinate more effectively the three different services: police, carabinieri, and guardia di finanze. But he will not have forgotten that the last prefect to do this, General Carlo Alberto Della Chiesa, was gunned down with his wife in 1982. The stiffened resolve of the state is only one aspect of change. The wave of corruption scandals sweeping Italy have weakened the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties which long provided political protection to the Mafia in southern Italy in return for votes. Now, the Palermo judiciary - described by Falcone as 'a den of vipers' because of its Mafia infiltration and political intrigue - is being cleaned out. Giancarlo Caselli took over as Palermo's attorney-general in January and, within three months, produced a dossier on the alleged connections between the Mafia and Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician who has served seven times as prime minister. Last month, MPs agreed Andreotti - who denies the claims - should lose his parliamentary immunity and face investigations that could lead to prosecution. At the popular level, the Mafia is confronted with the indomitable presence of Falcone's two sisters and the widow and two sisters of Borsellino. They have been relentless in their calls for justice. Their dignified anger in bereavement has converted them into the nation's conscience and, already, they have begun to receive anonymous death threats - a sure sign that the Mafia is worried. In many ways, they have acquired the same moral force as that of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who became Argentina's conscience for the 'disappeared' during the years of military rule. And the Pope seemed to formalise this status last month when, on his third visit to Sicily, he received them in private audience. He also caught the changed mood of the island. Celebrating mass in the grandiose valley of Greek temples at Agrigento, he spoke of the Mafia by name for the first time and condemned it  -a crucial step because the Church, a powerful influence in the island, has been accused for years of being too passive in the fight against the criminals. Falcone recognised that Cosa Nostra, the umbrella group of the Sicilian Mafia, was the most dangerous organisation of its type and far more powerful than its associates, the Naples-based Camorra, the 'ndrangheta in Calabria and the Sacra Corono Unita in Puglia. As such, the battle against organised crime in Italy had to be fought primarily by defeating and isolating the Sicilian godfathers. His patient detective work led to the first maxi-trials of Mafia bosses during the mid-'80s. He proved that Cosa Nostra operated with a formal structure as a state within a state. Through use of a few key former members willing to turn state's evidence - the so-called pentiti - he showed that it was organised through a series of regional committees controlled by a commission of the leading clans, which took all major decisions. This made him a marked man - and he knew it. Although the most heavily-protected public servant in Italy, with 60 round-the-clock bodyguards, the Mafia managed to discover his travel plans - almost certainly via a mole in the interior ministry. As his convoy of three armour-plated cars drove from the airport towards the centre of Palermo, it was torn apart by a huge explosive device planted in a storm drain, A similar technique was used to kill Borsellino as he visited his ageing mother in one of Palermo's countless high-rise flat blocks. Today, the motorway has been re-surfaced and only a strip of red paint on a roadside fender marks where the convoy was blown up. In Palermo, the make-shift memorial to Borsellino is less anonymous. A small shrine of flowers and a billboard covered with simple messages of condolence marks the site of his murder. Behind these simple tributes lies a whole series of measures which seem to show that, after decades of impunity, the Mafia is on the defensive. The most visible evidence is the capture of the alleged two top figures in the Cosa Nostra hierarchy: 'Toto' Riina, with his squat build and steely eyes, is said to be the 'boss of bosses,' heading the clans from a base at Corleone, near Palermo. Arrested on January 15 in Palermo, he had been on the run for 23 years. Then, last month, police grabbed Santapaola, allegedly the Cosa Nostra number two and head of the newer clans in Catania, Sicily's second largest city. Wanted for 10 years, he is thought to have had a role in the killings of Della Chiesa, Falcone and Borsellino. Riina could have been betrayed. Experts on the Mafia, like criminologist Pino Arlacchi, claim he broke with its tradition of ruling through consensus and, instead, imposed his will violently with an army of 500 gunmen. Bolstered by the profits from the drugs trade during the '80s, Riina believed the old 'co-habitation' with the politicians was no longer necessary. And he had no compunction in getting rid of opponents like Falcone. The theory goes that, as a result, Riina brought too much pressure on the organisation and part of Cosa Nostra felt he had become a liability. This scenario is backed by the testimony of his former chauffer, Baldassare Di Maggio, arrested in December and now a pentiti. As one member of the anti-Mafia team in Palermo noted: 'The fact that Riina's chauffeur has turned against him is very important. Di Maggio was not party to the inner secrets of Cosa Nostra but he was the man most trusted by Riina, collecting him from where he lived and taking him to all the meetings.' The role of the pentiti is crucial to action against the Mafia. The first of these 'super-grasses' came forward in 1984 - Tommaso Buscetta, a former Palermo boss who fled to Brazil. He was followed in 1989 by Francesco Marino Mannoia, the chief 'chemist' (working with heroin) of one of the clans that lost out to Riina in the bitter battle to gain control of Cosa Nostra. Both sought protection in the US and their evidence has been accepted in court; Buscetta, in particular, has displayed an elephantine memory. Following new laws passed last year, establishing a witness protection programme on the lines of the US, Italy's interior ministry now says nearly 400 pentiti are co-operating - compared with fewer than 20 a year ago. This is a staggering increase in such a short time, and a substantial burden on the state. The government provides each with a basic L1.5m a month, or L2m if married, plus the guarantee of a safe haven. In one instance, around 40 members of one family were moved to avoid reprisals. The evidence of the pentiti has been used already to incriminate a top intelligence officer supposedly working against the Mafia, expose corrupt justice officials and policemen, and reveal alleged links with politicians - including Andreotti, who Di Maggio claims to have seen embracing Riina at a Cosa Nostra meeting. Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, maintains the pentiti have every interest in telling the truth. If found to be lying, they risk not only losing state financial support but imprisonment. And although nearly all these men have blood on their hands, they also know the lives of their fion while Mannoia's mother, aunt and sister have been murdered. Musio is cautious about the progress of the anti-Mafia battle. 'It would be wrong to give the impression the Mafia is being beaten,' he says. 'The organisation is still strong and Riina still has lieutenants in key positions among the families; but progress has begun to be made. The message is rather that the Mafia, with time and determination, can be beaten.' Even so, the Mafia retains the ability to kill and cause terror. Late last month, it was thought to be behind a car bomb in Florence that killed five people and damaged the famous Uffizi gallery. That was preceded, a few days earlier, by another car bomb in Rome aimed at a television talk show journalist - the first such incident in the capital. One of the main problems in beating the Mafia is the difficulty of getting at its illicit earnings - much of them derived from drug dealing - reckoned to be worth L26,000bn annually throughout Italy alone; indeed, one of the events marking the anniversary of Falcone's death has been a major conference on this issue. In the past 12 months, L3,000bn worth of alleged Mafia assets have been confiscated, although there are legal problems associated with the seizures. Then there is the personal security of those in the front line of investigation. Mafia intimidation has made the job of an honest official lonely, frightening and exhausting mentally - the strained faces of the magistrates in the palace of justice at Palermo tell that story. The staffing situation there is dramatic, with nearly 500 posts vacant. At the beginning of the year, 143,000 criminal proceedings were still in a preliminary phase and 13,000 others were waiting to go for trial. At Caltanisetta in the centre of Sicily, where investigations into the Falcone and Borsellino killings are centred, the government last summer had to seek special volunteer magistrates to help out. Despite all this, on one important criterion laid down by the anti-Mafia commission, Cosa Nostra is losing. 'Impunity sanctions Cosa Nostra's status of a state within a state,' it says; 'and if this is not corrected by the state, it is a sign that the former is either stronger than the state or that it is recognised and legitimised by the powers that be.' Arguably, this is no longer the case.</p>

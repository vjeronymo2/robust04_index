			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost-effective change Sir, Re your editorial ('England's local shambles', August 25), I feel some issues need addressing to prevent your readers from being misled. As I understand it, the Local Government Commission's brief was to devise structures which were based on identifiable communities, cost-effectiveness and what people want. Having kept a watchful eye over the debate and developments affecting reorganisation in Cleveland, I feel there is no doubt the commission has scored highly on all three counts. Indeed, the commission's decision to abolish the two-tier system and replace it with four districts will improve accountability, bring services closer to the people and enable the real needs of our local communities to be better met. On cost, the commission has indicated that the move to single tier councils in Cleveland will produce savings of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 11m a year, assuming services are maintained at their existing levels. Based on this calculation, reorganisation will pay for itself within three years. Peter Olsen, Clark Whitehill, chartered accountants, 40 Victoria Road, Hartlepool, Cleveland TS26 8DD</p>

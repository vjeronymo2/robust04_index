			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Talk Radio plans February launch Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder for the third national commercial radio station, was yesterday awarded a licence by the Radio Authority and plans to launch in February. Sir David Nicholas, the former chief executive of Independent Television News who is chairman of Talk Radio UK, promised it would be 'a national sounding-board to ventilate issues where people could get things off their mind in a way that has not been done in this country'. The company bid Pounds 3.82m a year - the highest of six bids for the eight-year licence and more than Pounds 1m ahead of its nearest rival Newstalk UK. The new national station has raised Pounds 9m for the venture - Pounds 6.5m in equity and Pounds 2.5m in leasing finance. Media Ventures International, a UK-controlled fund largely backed by US money, will have 31 per cent of the venture. Two American broadcasters - CanWest Global Communications and Emmis Broadcasting - will each have 24.5 per cent while Hambros Bank has 15 per cent and Radio Investings 5 per cent. Mr John Aumonier, managing director of the new station, said 97 per cent of output would be speech-based but it would not consist of 'Fred from Battersea' phone-ins. He promised drama, news, comedy, quizzes and discussions. Research showed the likely audience would be middle market, aged between 25 and 55. As much as 500 hours a year of programmes would be bought in from independent producers by the second year. The Radio Authority yesterday rejected a call from investors in LBC to re-advertise two London licences after Reuters Holdings took control of LNR, the company that was awarded LBC's licences.</p>

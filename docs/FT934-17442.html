			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Envoys not hopeful on jailed Britons TWO British diplomats left Baghdad yesterday, saying they saw little prospect of an early release for three Britons jailed in Iraq for illegal entry, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Later in the day, Iraq organised an unprecendented news conference by two of the Britons, but it was not immediately clear whether it pointed to any change in their status. 'It is clearly a political issue.  Iraq is doing an injustice by detaining them,' Mr Mark Le Goy, a consular official, told Reuter as he left for Jordan. Mr Paul Ride and Mr Simon Dunn, two of the prisoners, later told the new conference at a Baghdad hotel they were victims of circumstance. 'I am a victim of the situation whereby there is an area which is disputed.  I was allowed to proceed as a civilian into a military disputed area, without being advised that I was approaching it or Iraq,' Mr Ride said. The two men said Kuwaiti border guards had not stopped or warned them, but Mr Ride added: 'There is no point in apportioning blame.'  Mr Ride, Mr Dunn and Mr Michael Wainwright are in Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad.  Mr Ride is serving seven years and Mr Dunn eight for entering Iraq illegally from Kuwait. Mr Wainwright, serving 10 years for cycling in via Kurdish rebel-held areas in the north, did not attend the new conference.  'He is a little bit tired,' Mr Khalid Jarjees, the Britons' lawyer, said. Iraq last week released three Swedes jailed on similar charges, after Sweden's king had made a personal appeal to President Saddam Hussein. Iraq has demanded that Britain unfreeze Iraqi assets in British banks, in return for the three men's freedom.  Britain has ruled out any deal. AP adds from Nicosia:  Convicted PLO gunman Ian Daidson, a Briton imprisoned eight years ago for killing three Israelis here, was freed yesterday and put on a flight to London, officials reported. Mr Davison 35, from South Shields in north-east England, was pardoned by Cypriot President Gladcos Clerides on Wednesday, to mark the anniversary of the island's independence from Britain.</p>

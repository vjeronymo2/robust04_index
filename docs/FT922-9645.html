			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Angry SPD threatens to boycott budget crisis talks GERMANY'S Social Democratic opposition yesterday threatened to boycott cross-party talks on the country's budget crisis in protest at the government's plans for drastic cuts in unemployment benefits and job creation schemes. The hostile response to the first government proposals for long-term budget austerity was fuelled by an equally angry reaction at the Federal Labour Office, which declared that any large-scale savings would only increase the numbers of fully unemployed - above all in east Germany. The plan put forward by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, would curb growth in government spending to a bare 2.5 per cent per year until 1996, and would abolish any central subsidy for the Labour Office, currently standing at some DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn). Spending by the states and local authorities would be kept to a 3 per cent annual growth rate. Mr Waigel's aim is to cut his central government budget deficit, a factor behind the country's current high interest rates, from DM45bn this year to DM25bn by 1995. The plan yesterday split the German political and economic establishments on predictable lines, winning solid support from the Chamber of Trade and Industry and the ruling coalition partners, and outright hostility from the Social Democrats (SPD) and the trade union federation (DGB). Both Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, and Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the Bonn parliamentary group leader, called into question their planned talks with the government on May 27. Mr Klose said the talks would be pointless on the basis of the 'sloppy and socially unjust' proposal put forward by the finance minister. The most disturbing response for Mr Waigel, however, was the reaction of the Federal Labour Office's conservative president, Mr Heinrich Franke, who suggested that substantial savings in training and job creation schemes would simply boost outright unemployment in the east, without any significant budget saving.</p>

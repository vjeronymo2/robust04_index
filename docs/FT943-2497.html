			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Observer: Tally-ho] General Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of the British forces during the Gulf war, appears just as talented at getting investors to part with their money as he was at marshalling the troops. He is apparently flourishing as a director of Robert Fleming, where he has responsibility for the Middle East, a post he took up two years ago. He has been raking in buy orders for the current Dollars 750m offering of vouchers in Pakistan's telecoms company, which Fleming is handling on behalf of the Pakistani government. Indeed, some non-resident Pakistani individuals in the Middle East have placed orders running to Dollars 20m apiece. No doubt this reflects more a faith in their mother country's phone system than undying gratitude for Sir Peter's part in hounding out Saddam Hussein - thereby safeguarding their wealth.</p>

The ruling Wednesday by the U.S.  1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston overturned a U.S. District Court ruling  in New Hampshire that said the boy, identified only as Timothy W., could not  benefit from the services. "I feel it is a reaffirmation of what I thought was  clear all along -- that all handicapped students are entitled to an education,"  said attorney Ronald Lospennato, who represented the boy and the Disabilities  Rights Center.  </P></p>

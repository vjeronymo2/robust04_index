			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ascot restructures for second time in 18 months Ascot Holdings, the property, pubs and hotels group, yesterday unveiled a second financial restructuring in 18 months as its half-year results showed negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 25.7m. The group, formerly known as Control Securities, is to restructure around Pounds 164m of group debt. This will involve the issue of new shares to raise Pounds 27.3m, together with the conversion of preference shares, an offer to bondholders and settlement of claims by Bass, BCCI and Salomon Brothers. The effect of the proposals will be to create shareholders' funds of between Pounds 51.8m and Pounds 61.6m. This represents a pro forma net asset value of between 188p and 223p per new ordinary share. More than 27m shares are being placed at 150p, with a 49-for-1000 clawback. The new shares represent 66.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Existing shareholders will hold a further 13.4 per cent with the remainder being taken up by shares issued to Bass, BCCI and preference shareholders. The existing shares are being consolidated on a 100-for-1 basis. The shares yesterday closed down  1/2 p at 1 1/2 p. Ascot has also agreed new banking facilities totalling Pounds 71m and a mezzanine finance agreement worth Pounds 15m. The board warned shareholders and bondholders that the company faced 'a very uncertain future' should the proposals be rejected. The half-year results to the end of September show the group moving from losses of Pounds 555,000 into profits of Pounds 2.1m. However, operating profits fell 22 per cent to Pounds 7.78m (Pounds 9.97m). Turnover fell 34 per cent to Pounds 32.2m (Pounds 48.9m). Earnings per share were 0.2p against losses last time of 0.6p. Ascot's problems first came to light three years ago, when the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BCCI led to charges against Mr Nazmu Virani, who subsequently resigned as chairman and chief executive of Control Securities.</p>

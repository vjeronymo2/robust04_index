			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEATSHOPS IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Your exposure of the degrading exploitation of garment workers in Orange County  performs an urgent public service and the work of your staff writer Sonni Efron  is an achievement in the best traditions of journalism (Part A, Nov. 26-28).  This should, hopefully, stimulate a new movement for reform.  </P> <P> But your editorial ("Clean Up the Sweatshops," Nov. 29) falls short of offering  any drastic new remedies commensurate with the gravity of the conditions in the  industry. Your call for publicly exposing manufacturers is a slender reed,  indeed, to depend upon.  </P> <P> As a member of the Advisory Committee on Garment Manufacturing (appointed by  the labor commissioner pursuant to a provision of the 1981 Garment  Manufacturing Act) and as its elected chairman from 1982 through 1985, I had  the opportunity for close observation of the workings of the garment trade.  Several meetings of the committee jointly offered important legislation.  </P> <P> It is a low-capitalization, labor-intensive industry. A few machines, a place  to work, a few employees requiring only the scantiest training or home workers  willing to rent machines, a manufacturer willing to give you work -- and you're  in business as a contractor (or further down the line as a subcontractor).  Contractors come and go, they change locations or names or nominal ownerships.  </P> <P> In a business that is a highly competitive to begin with, this situation lends  itself to the most cutthroat forms of competition -- with the prime  manufacturer squeezing the terms to ever lower levels. Labor law violations and  debasement of workers prevail.  </P> <P> You are right in calling for a beefing up of enforcement personnel, maintaining  the bar against homework at the state and federal levels, and implementing the  hot cargo laws. But these are not enough.  </P> <P> A further ingredient is essential: New state legislation is needed, making the  prime manufacturer jointly liable with his contractors for the latter's  violation of the labor code. This would fix responsibility squarely where it  belongs.  </P> <P> The prime movers (retailers, manufacturers, jobbers as the case may be) cannot  escape the obligation to scrutinize the operations of those whom they contract  with to do their work. And they cannot plead ignorance of the situation in the  industry.  </P> <P> Several members of the advisory committee who represented contractors concurred  in the effort to get joint liability legislation introduced in the state  Legislature. They recognized that such a measure would not only protect  workers, but also shield contractors, who wish to observe the law, against  cutthroat competition.  </P> <P> A joint liability law -- and unionization of the workers -- would go a long way  toward bringing stability to the industry and decent working conditions to the  workers.  </P> <P> MAX MONT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

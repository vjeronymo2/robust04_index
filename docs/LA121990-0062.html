			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD OKS $75,000 FOR EFFICIENCY STUDY;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: CONSULTANTS WILL BE HIRED TO ANALYZE A $330,000 AUDIT THAT  RECOMMENDED TRIMMING 103 POSITIONS.  </P> <P> As part of a multifaceted plan aimed at cutting costs, the Oxnard City Council  agreed Tuesday to spend about $75,000 on consultants to find ways to improve  efficiency at City Hall.  </P> <P> The council also unanimously approved a proposal by City Manager Vernon Hazen  to spend about $56,000 for a word processing center that Hazen said will save  the city money in the long run.  </P> <P> In February, the financially beleaguered city spent $330,000 on a management  audit that was also designed to identify ways to make City Hall operate more  efficiently.  </P> <P> City officials defended the additional spending, saying the efforts ultimately  will save the city money.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, in order to save money you have to spend money," Councilman Michael  Plisky said.  </P> <P> Hazen said the audit completed in June by Cresap Management Consultants of  Washington, D.C., provided good ideas on how to improve efficiency. But he said  the additional studies by consultants are necessary if specific money-saving  plans are to be implemented.  </P> <P> The Cresap audit "pointed me in the right direction, but now I need more  information," Hazen said.  </P> <P> The audit said that the city can eliminate 103 city positions, including 30 in  the Police Department, seven in the Fire Department and 43 in the Public Works  Department, and still improve city services. The recommended reductions are  designed to save the city $3.5 million annually.  </P> <P> However, most city department heads criticized the audit, saying most of the  recommended staff cuts would drastically reduce city services.  </P> <P> The council also decided Tuesday to build no new parks until the council can  find a way of financing their maintenance. But officials said the city will  complete parks already under construction.  </P> <P> At Hazen's request, the council agreed to form several committees to study ways  to improve the city's financial condition. One committee is to review ways to  increase revenue through additional utility, towing and franchise fees. The  committees are to include council members, city employees and residents.  </P> <P> The council agreed to pay a consultant about $35,000 to review the cost-cutting  recommendations that Cresap made for the Police Department.  </P> <P> Hazen told the council that Cresap did not provide enough justification to cut  30 positions from the department. He said he believes an outside consultant  should study whether such staff cuts would greatly reduce police services.  </P> <P> "In developing a long-term financial strategy, it is important to have an  accurate staffing plan for the Police Department," Hazen said in a council  report. "This is why I think it is imperative that we have further study."  </P> <P> Cresap also recommended that Oxnard review its operation of the city's  community center and auditorium.  </P> <P> At Hazen's request, the council agreed to consider forming a nonprofit  corporation and a board of directors to operate the two facilities, which would  take the burden off the city. Hazen suggested that the corporation also operate  the Carnegie Art Museum.  </P> <P> Hazen said it will cost about $25,000 to have a consultant study the  feasibility of the proposal.  </P> <P> The council also agreed to spend $15,000 to have a consultant review the city  process used to issue development permits.  </P> <P> "The main purpose of an outside consultant is to provide some element of  outside fresh viewpoints but also to assess the need for additional training in  subjects such as how to work more effectively with customers," Hazen said in  his report.  </P></p>

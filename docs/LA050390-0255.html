			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAIDERS TO BOOST PASSING GAME WITH HOLLAND FROM CHARGERS  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers have reached an agreement to trade wide receiver Jamie  Holland to the Raiders for a seventh-round draft pick, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The Raiders were to announce the trade after receiving contract papers from Los  Angeles and Holland's agent, Steve Feldman.  </P> <P> "He's happy to be in L.A., and I think he'll do extremely well," Feldman said  Wednesday. "We worked out a one-year deal this weekend and the documents were  signed (Wednesday)."  </P> <P> General Manager Bobby Beathard said Wednesday that the Chargers and Raiders  have "agreed on the terms of the trade," but said the deal was contingent upon  the Raiders making contact with Holland. He declined to discuss the terms of  the trade.  </P> <P> However, The San Diego Union, citing anonymous sources, reported today that  Holland will go to the Raiders for a seventh-round choice.  </P> <P> Because Holland is a free agent, he technically must sign with the Chargers  before moving to Los Angeles. Feldman said the Chargers will receive signed  paper work today.  </P> <P> "I sensed in the off-season that Jamie might not fit in their plans and the  chance to go to L.A. is a great opportunity," said Feldman. "They're looking to  return to kickoff-return form from 1988, and want to use him a lot in their  three-and four-wide-receiver set."  </P> <P> Holland, 26, came to the Chargers from Ohio State. In three years in San Diego,  he caught 71 passes for 1,010 yards and one touchdown, but failed to establish  himself as a consistent performer.  </P> <P> Last season, Holland started opposite Anthony Miller when the Chargers went to  a two-receiver set, but in 16 games he caught only 26 passes for 336 yards.  </P> <P> Holland returned 79 kickoffs for the Chargers for an average of 21.9 yards. His  94-yard return for a touchdown to close out the 1988 season against Kansas City  stands as the third-longest in club history.  </P></p>

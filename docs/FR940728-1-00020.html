All legal authorities, provisions, definitions, and requirements contained in &sect;801.1 through &sect;801.9 are applicable to this survey. Additional rules and regulations for the BE&hyph;80 survey are given in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. More detailed instructions are given on the report form itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Who must report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mandatory reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Reports are required from each U.S. person who is a financial services provider or intermediary, or whose consolidated U.S. enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial services provider or intermediary, and who had transactions (either sales or purchases) directly with unaffiliated foreign persons in all financial services combined in excess of $1,000,000 during its fiscal year covered by the survey. The $1,000,000 threshold should be applied to financial services transactions with unaffiliated foreign persons by all parts of the consolidated U.S. enterprise combined that are financial services providers or intermediaries. Because the $1,000,000 threshold applies separately to sales and purchases, the mandatory reporting requirement may apply only to sales, only to purchases, or to both sales and purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The determination of whether a U.S. financial services provider or intermediary is subject to this mandatory reporting requirement may be judgmental, that is, based on the judgment of knowledgeable persons in a company who can identify reportable transactions on a recall basis, with a reasonable degree of certainty, without conducting a detailed manual records search. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Reporters who file pursuant to this mandatory reporting requirement must provide data on total sales and/or purchases of each of the covered types of financial services transactions and must disaggregate the totals by country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Voluntary reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If, during the fiscal year covered, sales or purchases of financial services by a firm that is a financial services provider or intermediary, or by a firm's subsidiaries or parts combined that are financial services providers or intermediaries, are $1,000,000 or less, the U.S. person is requested to provide an estimate of the total for each type of service. Provision of this information is voluntary. Because the $1,000,000 threshold applies separately to sales and purchases, this voluntary reporting option may apply only to sales, only to purchases, or to both sales and purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BE&hyph;80 definition of financial services provider. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of financial services provider used for this survey is analogous in coverage to the finance and insurance part of Division H of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC major groups 60 through 64, and major group 67). More specifically, companies and/or subsidiaries and other separable parts of companies in the following industries are defined as financial services providers: Depository institutions (including commercial banks and thrifts); nondepository credit institutions; security and commodity futures brokers, dealers, exchanges, traders, underwriters, and services providers (including investment bankers and providers of securities custody services); credit card companies; insurance carriers, agents, brokers and services providers; investment advisors and managers; mutual funds; pension funds; trusts; holding companies; investors; oil royalty traders; etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Covered types of services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The BE&hyph;80 survey covers the following types of financial services transactions (purchases and/or sales) between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons: Brokerage, except foreign exchange brokerage services; private placement services; underwriting services; financial management services; credit-related services, except credit card services; credit card services; financial advisory and custody services; securities lending services; foreign exchange brokerage services; and other financial services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What to file. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The BE&hyph;80 survey consists of Forms BE&hyph;80(A) and BE&hyph;80(B). Before completing a Form BE&hyph;80(B), a consolidated U.S. enterprise (including the top parent and all of its subsidiaries and parts combined) must complete Form BE&hyph;80(A) to determine its reporting status. If the enterprise is subject to the mandatory reporting requirement, or if it is exempt from the mandatory reporting requirement but chooses to report data voluntarily, either a separate Form BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed for each separately organized financial services subsidiary or part of the consolidated U.S. enterprise, or a single BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed, representing the sum of covered transactions by all financial services subsidiaries or parts of the enterprise combined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reporters that receive the BE&hyph;80 survey from BEA, but that are not reporting data in either the mandatory or voluntary section of any Form BE&hyph;80(B), must return the Exemption Claim, attached to Form BE&hyph;80(A), to BEA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18094 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;24&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

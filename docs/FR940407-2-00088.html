The proposed action was based on Respondent's material falsification of his application for a DEA Certificate of Registration submitted on July 20, 1992. In addition, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent issued anorectic controlled substances as appetite suppressants, in violation of applicable state law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(a) and 1301.54(d), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator finds that Respondent submitted an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration on July 20, 1992. Respondent indicated on such application that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration for cause, when in fact, he had voluntarily surrendered his prior DEA Certificate of Registration, AM1950371, for cause, on May 20, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between December 1991 and May 1992, Respondent also issued numerous prescriptions for anorectic controlled substances for purposes of weight reduction. Under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a physician is prohibited from prescribing anorectic controlled substances for these purposes. Although Respondent eventually admitted that the prescriptions were issued for the purpose of appetite suppression, the prescriptions themselves indicated that they were issued for other medical reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator may deny an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``(i)n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

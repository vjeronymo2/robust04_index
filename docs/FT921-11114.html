			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Abe indicted over Y80m bribe claims MR Fumio Abe, a former government minister accused of taking bribes, has become the first serving member of the Japanese Diet since the 1970s to be indicted. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's office on Saturday charged Mr Abe with accepting Y80m (Pounds 357,000) in bribes from Kyowa, a steel frame manufacturing and property investment company, in return for leaking planning information and lobbying officials on Kyowa's behalf. Mr Goro Moriguchi, a vice-president of Kyowa, was also charged. The indictments will put renewed pressure on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Mr Miyazawa, who counted Mr Abe among his close associates, apologised for the incident and pledged political reform. The prime minister was in New York attending the United Nations Security Council summit. Newspaper commentaries published over the weekend mostly assessed Mr Miyazawa's performance in the US favourably, including his veiled demand for a permanent Security Council seat for Japan. But the impact was undercut by the extensive publicity accorded to Mr Abe's indictment. The last serving Diet members to be indicted were Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister, and two others who were charged in 1976 for their roles in the Lockheed scandal. They were accused of taking money from the US group in return for approving orders for planes.</p>

During his visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim has been trying to design a more dynamic position for  Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country  has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings  have been scheduled for April when British Foreign Minister  Douglas Hurd visits Brasilia, and the Brazilian foreign minister  will visit France at the invitation of his counterpart, Alain  Juppe. Amorim will address the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee then.    These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years.  As just an example of the poor period being experienced by  Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to  Brazil has been postponed four consecutive times during the past  few years.    The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to  Germany foreshadow a new period. In Bonn on 25 February, the  Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important  meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O  ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: "If Brazil hopes to play a  leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these  talks." The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President  Fernando Collor of destroying our country's foreign policy and  not replacing it.    The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our  country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its  bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward  France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, Brazil's three  principal European partners, which represents a priority in  Itamaraty's strategy. The effort to further approach these EC  countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and  investments. Amorim emphasized: "To this end, however, it is  necessary to hold political talks."    In the case of Germany, the Brazilian foreign minister  explained: "The tripartite agreement's ratification was  essential because diplomacy and development must work together."    Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the  German interest in Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System].  The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic  control system in the Amazon region. The French and Americans  also have expressed interest in this project. The Brazilian  Government's decision on the submitted proposals must be made by  late April.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said on Sunday that he received new  encouragement in Belarus that Yugoslavia is not alone despite  its isolation and the international sanctions, and that the  circle of countries which are showing solidarity with its  justified objectives and resistance to outside pressure,  sanctions and isolation, is spreading.    "The talks we had in Minsk covered all the aspects of the  Yugoslav crisis, primarily the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"  Jovanovic told Radio Belgrade upon his return from the first  official visit to Belarus since it became independent.    "Both sides underscored identical interests that the crisis  in the space of former Yugoslavia end as soon as possible, that  Yugoslavia recover its legitimate rights in international  relations," Jovanovic set out.    Speaking About the talks in Moscow, which he visited  earlier,  Jovanovic said that he had agreed with Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev that developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina were  marked by positive changes, but that there were still serious  situations which made it imperative for both countries to be  very active and to collaborate even more closely.    It was underscored that Russia had played an important  positive role in the resolving of recent crisis situations, but  that it can have an even more active role in removing the  obstacles to peace, of which the biggest is the continued  maintenance of the sanctions against Yugoslavia, Jovanovic said.</p>

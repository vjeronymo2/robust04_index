			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- The Office of Bank  Supervision is investigating a report on the alleged outflow of  foreign exchange at Citibank's Seoul branch.    An official at the office said, "we are investigating the  Seoul branch of Citibank after it was reported that the bank  secretly sent out an enormous amount of money to a foreign  country in a transaction with a religious group."    "NAEIL SINMUN," a weekly newsmagazine, reported in a recent  issue that the Seoul branch of Citibank accepted a deposit of  more than 10 billion won (about 12.36 million U.S. dollars) at  low annual interest rates of 1-6 percent and had Citibank's Hong  Kong branch illegally pay a person affiliated with the religious  group 1.3 billion won.    According to the report, Citibank drew up an interest swap  contract with a company in Hong Kong to provide an annual 8.84  percent forward exchange rate in June 1991 and to receive spot  exchange rates slightly higher than the London inter-bank  offered rate (libor).    The bank claimed to have suffered a loss in the contract,  which said it should pay higher interest than the actual rate,  while in reality giving a sum equal to the loss through  Citibank's Hong Kong branch to someone designated by the  religious group, the report said.    NAEIL SINMUN reported that Citibank's Seoul branch paid a  relatively high interest rate, while international interest  rates were dropping, because it intended to send foreign  exchange to a foreign country under the pretense of a legal  final transaction.    Citibank said the Hong Kong company with which it made the  swap contract is a British bank, but failed to explain clearly  why the firm is not registered in the colony.    Citibank said, however, that the religious group's deposit  and the swap contract are unrelated and that banks often suffer  losses in swap transactions.    The bank claimed that NAEIL SINMUN wrote a distorted report,  saying, "We are studying legal action against the weekly."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sergio Caramana, </F> representative of the International Commission of Support and  Verification-OAS, by station announcer in Managua on 21  February; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] We have Dr. Sergio Caramana on the line  from the CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and  Verification-OAS] office. Doctor, we understand the meeting  scheduled for Monday has been postponed. What can you tell us  about this?    [Caramana] Greetings to listeners of Radio Corporacion. Yes,  what happened was we have been working to smooth out some small  problems and obstacles to holding this meeting since last  Thursday. That is why this meeting could not be held today. But  I want to inform you and the audience of Radio Corporacion that  the determination of the members of the Northern Front, the  Army, and government remains unchanged. They are determined to  peacefully resolve this issue through negotiations. The meeting  is scheduled for the middle of this week in the Quilali area.    [Announcer] Doctor, will you present specific points at this  meeting?    [Caramana] Basically the government and its institutions  will  present a series of broad proposals and programs to resolve or  address the causes that result in the uprising of different  groups and sectors of Nicaraguan society. I believe there is a  clear awareness to go to the root of the problem this time so as  to provide an in-depth and complete solution. We hope all  sectors involved are seriously committed to this line of thought.    This is not a matter of having a particular group surrender  its weapons as a daily thing in Nicaragua, but basically  tackling the in-depth problems. Among the basic demands is the  issue of security, which is very important and fundamental to  all this, and the issue of credits, production, social, health,  education, and emergency fund projects, which are needed in  these forgotten areas.    [Announcer] Doctor, we understand the meeting was postponed  due to the very military presence that will be used to settle  this situation.    [Caramana] Listen, that is not the reason why the meeting  was  postponed. In reality, we are coordinating the work and planning  of this meeting, which is very important, with government  authorities, military authorities, and members of the 3-80  Northern Front. I want to clearly state that all the parties are  demonstrating goodwill to get to that meeting and agree to the  requests made by the 3-80 Northern Front.    [Announcer] Doctor, El Chacal's [Jose Angel Talavera] group  seems to be ready to disarm itself. What is the situation of  other groups, such as those led by Nortiel and El Charrito?    [Caramana] Well, we have not received requests from those  groups for a possible demobilization. Consequently, I cannot  tell you what those two groups' intentions are. It has been  said, however, that some of the rearmed groups you just  mentioned may be included in this negotiation.    I believe the possibility of peacefully resolving, not  violently or militarily, the conflict in the northern region  will be an important sign for all sectors in the mountains,  especially the areas where the post-war population is residing.  I think we must seriously work to resolve this problem in an  honorable manner for all the parties involved, a solution with  real social justice.    [Announcer] Can you say whether there have been clashes in  the north the last few days?    [Caramana] No, thank God the truce has been respected. The  cease-fire has been respected. Thank God there has been no  incident or loss of human life to regret. I believe the truce  and cease-fire are, in reality, the first step of the  negotiations. They have an extraordinary value in the sense that  no more Nicaraguans are dying. No Nicaraguans from the Army,  rearmed groups, or civilian population -- many times people  suffer from cross-fire confrontations in these situations -- are  dying.    [Announcer] Doctor, what can you tell us about the Cobra-93  clandestine group?    [Caramana] Well, all I know about this group I get from the  news reports and some reports from indirect sources. These  groups and some other recompa groups are moving about the  country. I think it is appropriate to call the authorities'  attention to closely monitor these groups so they do not become  an obstacle to the peace process under way in Segovia. I hope no  incident occurs in this regard.    [Announcer] Doctor, would you like to say anything else to  the listeners of "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast?    [Caramana] I would like to add that we are facing a big  challenge. I am optimistic about it. But my optimism is moderate  in the sense that the resolution of this process does not depend  on CIAV-OAS, it depends on the Nicaraguan players of the  conflict, namely the government, Army, and members of the 3-80  Northern Front.    I believe we have the basic raw material to begin these  talks, which is the goodwill of these sectors to settle the  conflict peacefully. We reject a violent solution of this  dispute. In this regard, we are motivated to cooperate in a  vigorous and complete manner in this process.    [Announcer] I thank you very much, Dr. Sergio Caramana.</p>

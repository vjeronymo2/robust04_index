			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has already  brought a large number of loggers back home from Siberia and the  withdrawal operation is continuing, it was reported Tuesday.    A senior South Korean Government official said that the  number of North Korean loggers in Siberia, which has been as  high as 20,000, is currently estimated at only 7,000 to 8,000.    "The withdrawal operation became active from the beginning  of  this year and it is continuing as the Seoul government has  decided to allow fleeing North Korean loggers to settle in South  Korea," the official said, requesting anonymity.    The withdrawal could also be attributed to either a decline  in seasonal demand or to a delay in the renewal of the North  Korean-Russian logging agreement, he said.    The official said he could not say whether Pyongyang's  action  had anything to do with the Seoul government's decision to  resettle all willing loggers in the South and Moscow's agreement  to support the South Korean move.</p>

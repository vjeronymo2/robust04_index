			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Perfume ruling cannot go unchallenged Sir, So now we know. An industry which sells products in such a way as to preserve an up-market image and to charge prices that generate a retail profit of 40-60 per cent of the retail price, and which refuses to supply outlets which might reduce that price is not acting against the public interest. At least, so says the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in its report on the way, mainly foreign, fragrance companies distribute perfume products in the UK ('Perfume outcome surprises observers', November 12). The report cannot be clearer in its support of high prices when it says: 'Fine fragrances are marketed as luxury products and the MMC accept that the suppliers need to be able to control their distribution in order to protect their brand images which customers evidently value. There is no shortage of other fragrances at much lower prices.' In other words, perfume companies must be allowed to restrict distribution and supply in order to keep prices high; only if they are paying high prices do consumers think they are obtaining value. The MMC judgment on the perfume distribution is perverse and cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged. Otherwise, all future cases of relatively high prices can be justified on the grounds of protecting the brand image to the benefit of consumers. This is not right and is unsupported by mainstream economics. When confronted with the MMC decision the question provoked is - who guards the guardians? One answer could be a House of Commons select committee. If the Office of Fair Trading, MMC and Department of Trade and Industry cannot protect the consumer from price exploitation parliament had better ask why. After all, to remove the barrier to lower prices would reduce the upward pressure on the retail price index and persuade government to be more positive in stimulating growth. To undermine the position of fragrance houses, high price supermarkets, electrical and audio visual shops and so on would be a genuine supply-side improvement that reduced the natural rate of unemployment.

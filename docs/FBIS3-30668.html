			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel  said in his regular radio broadcast "Talks From Lany" today that  his current official visit to India and Thailand had several key  goals.    The Czech Republic, which successfully sought to become a  non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,  ought to prove that it is assuming its share of responsibility  for the state of affairs in the world and that it is not  ignoring any continent, Havel said.    At the same time it is important to develop the widest  possible friendly relations with India and Thailand, especially  in the economic area in which many interesting prospect are  coming into view, Havel said. He added that the foreign and  finance ministers who would accompany him on his visit would  also hold their "various talks."    Havel mentioned his intent to stop over in Kuwait to meet  the  Kuwaiti Emir.    Austria is known for its dislike of nuclear power but  nuclear  power is a world phenomenon and not a specific question of  Temelin, Havel said, asked whether the Czech Republic has a  moral right to complete the Temelin nuclear power plant in south  Bohemia notwithstanding growing protests from Austria near whose  border the plant is located.    Havel said that he understood these protests. "Nonetheless  they can hardly expect that the Czech Republic will stop  completing Temelin given the current advanced state of  construction," Havel said. He said that two things were  important in this question -- first that the plant have the  highest possible level of security and the second that a promise  be fulfilled that after the station is put into operation the  mining of brown coal in north Bohemia and the activity of  thermal power stations, which have a devastating impact on the  environment, are radically reduced.    Regarding the assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak  Republican Party's invitation to Russian ultra nationalist and  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic Havel said: "It is  interesting that a party which presents itself as a very  patriotic one is inviting a man who questions the Czech  Republic's future existence."    "Mr. Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he  therefore can come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will  be up to him what he will say here and whether or not our  authorities will consider it appropriate to expel him  eventually," Havel said.    He said that the Foreign Ministry, having considered the  situation, came to the conclusion: "If Zhirinovskiy comes let  him come."    Havel also directed his attention to the situation of  non-profit organizations in democratic states. "There are very  many non-profit organizations in democratic countries which are  not and should not be fully state-owned but which are at the  same time not of a commercial nature. And in the Czech Republic  all this sphere has yet to be "covered with some umbrella law."    He said that on Friday, when his broadcast was recorded he  had an opportunity to touch on the topic in an informal talk  with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus.    Havel said that organizations called partly-subsidized  public  organizations such as schools, hospitals, Czech Television,  Czech Radio and others serve some public interest and the state  thus is interested that they function and serve it. That is why  the state is subsidizing them to a certain extent. "But these  organizations should be separated from the state to a certain  extent. They should have their own regulations of management  and should not be bound with rigid ordinances," Havel said.    However these organizations should not only comply with  valid  laws but also respect "the general will of the state."    "Then there are other organizations -- cultural ones, such  as  theaters, museums, galleries... And also typically non-profit  organizations such as various funds and foundations which are  important because they ensure plurality in supporting public  interests," Havel said, adding that tax relief is very  important for the activity of these institutions.    Havel said that according to the information he possessed  two  laws would probably be needed in this sphere. One would set  down regulations for the activity of non-profit organizations  and the other would define possibilities under which the current  state-owned budget and subsidized organizations could be  transferred into non-profit ones.</p>

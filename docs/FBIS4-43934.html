			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zaire, Rwanda's neighbor, will  serve as a base for the French troops for Operation Turquoise.  The Zairean ambassador to France, Baya Ramazani, explained to  Luc Lemonnier why he entirely approves of France's intervention:    [Begin recording] [Ramazani] This is not an intervention  against one ethnic group or another, but to end genocide. It is  easy to moan and wonder who is criminal and who is not, but the  problem we are facing clearly is to put an end to genocide.    [Lemonnier] Do you think France is suited to lead this  intervention?    [Ramazani] I don't think there is one country better than  another to end this genocide. It is up to the international  community to do something. We cannot observe passively what is  going on. Zaire has agreed, within the framework of this  intervention, to put operational bases at the disposal of the UN  forces. I don't think it will be an easy operation, but it is  necessary. Should we continue to denounce the genocide and do  nothing? [end recording]</p>

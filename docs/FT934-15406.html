			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Observer: Greek to me Andreas Papandreou, the newly elected Greek prime minister, has an astrologer among his advisers and his wife Dimitra, a former Olympic Airways stewardess, is a firm believer in the irrational. Could this be why Papandreou failed to produce a cabinet list the day after his Panhellenic Socialist Movement won a resounding victory in Greece's general election? Issuing the names yesterday would have meant swearing in the new cabinet on a Tuesday - unlucky in Greek eyes, because that was the day Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453. Nor would Wednesday October 13 quite do. With the Socialists in power, decision-making in Greece is obviously slowing still further.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / French radiotelephone bidding: World News Digest The licence to operate France's first truly urban radiotelephone network will be awarded by the end of this summer to one of three French bidders, Alcatel, Bouygues and Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French telecommunications ministry announced yesterday. In addition to local partners, Alcatel has teamed up with Stet of Italy and Telefonica of Spain, Bouygues with Veba of Germany and US West, and Lyonnaise with Thyssen of Germany, Belgacom of Belgium and Bell South of the US, to bid for France's third radiotelephone network. France Telecome and Generale des Eaux already operate two Global System for Mobile Telephones networks in France. But they generally require users to be outdoors or near a window. The ministry said yesterday the third network was designed more for urban office use, requiring an investment of FFr10bn-FFr15bn. France has around 150,000 radiotelephone users, but hopes to have 3m by the end of the century.</p>

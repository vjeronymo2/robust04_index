			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LOSING CBA COACH IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT  </P> <P> Charley Rosen, coach of the Rockford (Ill.) Lightning of the Continental  Basketball Assn., was arrested after storming out of a locker room and punching  the coach of the Cedars Rapids, Iowa, team.  </P> <P> Rosen, 49, a former English professor and sportswriter, was charged Friday  night with assault, interference with official acts and disorderly conduct. He  posted $405 bond and left Cedar Rapids with his team.  </P> <P> The dispute began after Rosen was kicked out of the game with 90 seconds left  after receiving his second technical foul. He attempted to charge Cedar Rapids  Coach George Whittaker, but was restrained by officials.  </P> <P> As the players were leaving the court after Cedar Rapids' 119-98 victory, Rosen  again charged Whittaker, witnesses said. Security men and police wrestled Rosen  away from Whittaker and pushed him back into the locker room. Additional police  were called in to arrest Rosen, described in the CBA media guide as the  league's tallest coach at 6-foot-8.  </P> <P> Rosen has been suspended by the league on at least two occasions. His last  run-in was on Nov. 26, 1988, when he drew four technical fouls in a game at  Rapid City, S.D., and accused the officials of fixing the game. The league  suspended him for four games, fined him an undisclosed amount and placed him on  probation.  </P></p>

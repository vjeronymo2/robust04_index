			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Officials keep a waryeye on the bubble IN OTEMACHI, Tokyo's business centre, office workers crowded around a stock price board in a Yamaichi Securities branch yesterday as the Nikkei average closed above the psychologically important 20,000 mark for the first time in over a year. The renewed enthusiasm for stocks coincided with the release of the government's emergency package yesterday, and the talk now is not how far the Nikkei average will fall but how much it will surge in coming days. However, the sudden change in sentiment has a dark side. Apart from sending most issues flickering higher on the electronic boards in brokerages around the country yesterday, the package has also intensified concern over the possibilty of a resurgence of an asset 'bubble' last seen in the late 1980s. Government officials claim that they are keeping close watch over any signs of an asset bubble. 'We've formulated the package after closely reviewing what happened in 1986,' said Mr Yoseki Nagase, director general at the Economic Planning Agency. The comparisons, however, are compelling. Interest rates then were cut to historical lows, and a Y6,000bn (Pounds 35bn) emergency economic package was introduced in 1986 to help companies recover from a strengthening yen. But Mr Nagase argues that the current economic background is very different from the mid-1980s, when money supply was posting double digit gains and stock and property prices were also surging. 'Capital investment and consumer demand will not be able to recover without assistance,' he added. However, the latest stimulatory package comes at a time when some analysts believe that some statistics have indicated a bottoming out of the economy. A 23 per cent rise in the stock market over the past two months has restored confidence in the country's brokers, who are now urging investors to return to the market or risk missing out on a the chance of making a quick profit. The recovery in share prices will aid Japanese companies, which have been forced to write off losses on their stock portfolios. According to stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo, a 15 per cent rise in the stock market theoretically creates about Y45,000bn of financial wealth. With the stock market higher, the package may help inflate property prices, another 'bubble' characteristic. The package includes a total of Y1,600bn to be pumped into the property market through advance land purchases for publics works. Limits on housing loans provided by quasi-governmental housing loan organisations will now be raised, while lending rates on the loans will be lowered. There are also fears of overheating due to a bunching of the government's infrastructure projects. The full effects of the public works projects from last August's Y10,700bn emergency package have yet to be felt fully, as the govern-ment expects the bulk of the projects to be started in this financial year. Additionally, the government intends to front-load 75 per cent, or Y12,208bn worth, of public works contracts for the current year's usual budget into the April-June quarter. While government officials flatly reject suggestions of another asset bubble emerging, they admit that they are also aware of the implications of low interest rates and large fiscal stimulus. 'But we are able to learn from experience,' said Mr Nagase. 'In the 1970s we managed to handle the second oil shock from our experience of the first one.'</p>

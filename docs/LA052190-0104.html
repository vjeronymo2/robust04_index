			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Out of Law: Cable News Network anchorwoman Catherine Crier told a gathering of  lawyers in Grand Rapids, Mich., that courtroom competition and unnecessary  lawsuits drove her from her post as a Texas district judge. Crier, 35, told  members of the Grand Rapids Bar Assn. last week she accepted CNN's offer in  October, 1988, in part because she was frustrated by unnecessary litigation,  including the case of a woman who sued her obstetrician because she suffered  pain during childbirth.  </P> <P> Another Merger: Let's forget East and West Berlin for a minute and give North  and South Yemen equal time. Thousands in those states of the United Arab  Emirates danced the weekend away to celebrate the imminent merger of North and  South Yemen, with people from both sides embracing and shouting "Long Live  Yemen" as loudspeakers blared the national anthem of the new country. "The  celebrations will continue until unification is proclaimed later this month,"  North Yemeni ambassador Mohammed Hatem al-Khawi told reporters in Abu Dhabi.  </P> <P> Auctioning Dad's Advice: A New York auction house is selling a 1967 letter  Ronald Reagan wrote to daughter Patti, counseling her on smoking's dangers and  the benefits of telling the truth. The handwritten, four-page letter, signed  "Love, Dad," is expected to bring between $40,000 and $45,000 when sold next  month. The letter responds to a note Patti, then 14, wrote from boarding school  to tell her father she had admitted to smoking cigarettes and was being  punished. He warned her against "compromising the truth no matter how trivial"  and put a sexist twist on smoking. "Unfortunately, women are more susceptible  to habits than men and find them much harder to break or change," he wrote.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Back in Bonn: On the day the two Germanys signed a treaty to allow  market forces to rule in East Germany, East Berliners got a chance to make --  and lose -- money in the country's first casino. Doors opened Friday evening at  the modest gaming room with three roulette and two blackjack tables, where the  minimum stake is $3. But as long as men wear jackets and ties and women do not  wear jeans, they can play the slot machines for just 60 cents a shot. Croupiers  are West German, but East Germans are being trained and will take over in July.  </P></p>

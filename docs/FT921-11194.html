			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Thorn EMI quits electricalretailing and cuts 800 jobs THORN EMI, the UK music and rentals group, is quitting electrical retailing, which has lost the company about Pounds 50m over the past three years. Its chain of about 450 Rumbelows shops, which has not made a profit since 1986-87, will be converted to rental outlets for consumer electrical goods. About 800 head office, service and distribution jobs will go. The shops are expected to break even once operating alongside the group's 1,000-plus other rental outlets, trading as Radio Rentals, Multibroadcast and DER. There will then be a review of the division which could lead to 200 store closures. The estimated cost of the changes is between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m, which Thorn will take as an extraordinary item in its accounts for the year to March. Thorn had been trying to sell Rumbelows for about three years. The electrical retail market contracted by 8 per cent in 1990-91 alone and is one of the high street areas worst affected by the recession. Rumbelows' market share of 6 per cent puts it behind Dixons, which includes Currys; electricity board shops and Comet, owned by Kingfisher. Mr Charles Nichols, stores analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said Rumbelows' departure represented the first big shake-out in a sector suffering from over-capacity after strong expansion in the 1980s. Thorn said it was possible that Rumbelows' sister chain, Atlantis, would be sold. The 45 out-of-town stores have a turnover of about Pounds 80m. Yesterday's announcement added to the interest already being shown by potential buyers. Last year the rentals division, with 53 per cent of its Pounds 1.01bn sales overseas, made a Pounds 138m operating profit. This was, however, 26 per cent down on the previous year and Thorn admits that the UK rental market - which it claims to lead with a 55 per cent share - is declining. To counteract this, it said: 'We will test out in the Rumbelows shops the sort of options offered overseas. On the Continent and in the US, we give customers the option to buy during the rental period.' Ms Jane Anscombe, leisure analyst at stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said Thorn was 'making the best of a bad job' with Rumbelows. The elimination of losses led her to revise her group pre-tax profit forecast for 1992-93 upwards from Pounds 300m to Pounds 310m. Thorn's balance sheet will be little affected. Last March, the ratio of net debt to net assets stood at 44 per cent on borrowings of Pounds 394.2m. By this March, gearing is expected to fall below 40 per cent. To allay the fears of football fans, the group has promised to continue its sponsorship of the Rumbelows League Cup. New direction, Page 7 Lex, Page 24</p>

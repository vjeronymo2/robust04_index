			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / People: JCB digs deeper in search for European victory JCB is strengthening management of its European sales and service operation to raise its share of what the Staffordshire-based construction equipment producer has long viewed as its 'home market.' Pierre Leboucher, formerly head of the company's French subsidiary, right, has been appointed to the new post of European director. He will henceforth be responsible for sales and distribution development throughout Europe and for targetting the major markets of Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Leboucher is being succeeded as managing director of JCB France by Francoise Rausch, far right, who now becomes one of the few women to reach such an elevated position in what is still a male-dominated industry. Leboucher's new job has been created by John Patterson, a JCB main board director who last year was appointed managing director for worldwide sales and service. The European market is crucial for JCB; Europe, including the UK, accounts for 72 per cent of JCB's Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m annual sales. The company is Europe's largest supplier of construction equipment in unit terms - although not in value. Patterson says JCB lifted its share of a declining European market from 9.5 per cent to 11.8 per cent last year, based on the eight main product types it competes in. But he wants to increase this to 15 per cent by 1996. Leboucher's tasks will be to formulate how and where JCB expands on the continent, as the market comes out of recession. He will also be taking overall responsibility for, among other things, improving European logistics and implementing a revised product strategy based around three groups - heavy, main and compact lines. Leboucher, who joined JCB in 1971, was one of the original team at the French subsidiary, which later became the model for other European operations. He sees increasing JCB sales in Germany as a top priority. Rausch, meanwhile, is taking control of JCB's largest single export market, apart from that of the US. JCB France had sales of FFr400m last year but Rausch - who has been with JCB for 21 years - believes sales could increase this year, helped by new JCB products, as well as an overall market pick-up spurred on by public works funding and lower interest rates. Rausch says that though the French construction equipment market has fallen by 50 per cent since 1989, it could rise by 5-10 per cent this year.</p>

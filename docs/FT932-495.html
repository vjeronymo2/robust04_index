			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK accuses EC of 'plot' over fuel tax BRITAIN'S environment minister, Mr John Gummer, claimed last night to have defeated an EC ambush intended to get the UK to agree that a Community-wide energy tax was a pre-condition for the Twelve to ratify the Rio climate change convention. As a result of the row, expected agreement on ratification of the convention  -through which the EC commits itself to stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 - looked certain to be postponed. Six EC member states led by Germany and the Netherlands said in March that the Rio target was not possible without the tax, calling into question ratification of the convention. In April, energy and environment ministers from 11 member states agreed on the principle of an EC energy tax, although finance ministers of the 12 earlier this month shelved further discussion of the tax. The tax, due originally to have started this year at Dollars 3 per barrel of oil equivalent, is supposed to rise to Dollars 10 by 2000. Mr Gummer said the Danish presidency 'tried to bounce us by getting a piece of paper which said the 11 took one view but we took another'. He derided the attempt as 'a plot that failed, happily', because even pro-tax member states like Germany objected to 'the stitch-up', and doubters like Spain underlined there was still no consensus on how the burden would be shared. Mr Hans Alders, the Dutch environment minister, said the UK minister 'was at another lunch' and that 'the British are still in an isolated position'. He said a May 27 memorandum from Sir John Cope, the UK paymaster general, had definitively ruled out Britain's acceptance of an EC-wide tax, and invited 'those member states who wished to do so to introduce a tax which is compatible with the single market'. The Dutch minister said the Commission would be bringing forward detailed plans on 'burden-sharing' before the summer break, and the ratification issue would not be settled before October. Mr Gummer also claimed that at last week's Copenhagen summit, EC heads of government 'said very clearly' that how to reach the emissions target was for national governments to decide, as the UK had done by introducing fuel and heating oil taxes. Mr Svend Auken, the Danish chairman of the stormy meeting, described Mr Gummer's interpretation of the Copenhagen conclusions as 'purely personal', while Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, added that the British minister's reading of Copenhagen was 'arbitrary'.</p>

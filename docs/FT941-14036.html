			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / The comedians have the last laugh 'It's unbelievable,' sighed Mr Yutaka Shimomura, an upper house MP, overcome with relief after the unexpected defeat of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform bill yester-day. Mr Shimomura, a comedian by profession, is dead serious when it comes to politics. Clad in a formal brown kimono, he sternly cast his green ballot against the bill yesterday with a dignified manner. It may be the first time in Japan's postwar history that small, obscure parties such as his Niin Club, a loose coalition of three comedians and two independent MPs, have been pushed into the limelight. The coalition and opposition parties, desperate for votes, have tried to woo upper house members from the entertainment and athletic patch - those traditionally snubbed because their popularity is based on their jokes or their wrestling techniques rather than their policies. Mr Shimomura claims that his party is the 'conscience of the upper house'. 'We've got to show people that the upper house is not just a shadow of the lower house,' he says. The Niin Club has opposed the political reform bills because the small constituencies created by them would put smaller parties at a disadvantage. The larger parties make the same claims. Mr Hosokawa managed to win votes from the Sports Peace party, formed by Mr Antonio Inoki, a square-chinned professional wrestler, and Mr Takenori Emoto, a former baseball star. However, the Niin Club firmly resisted the faxes and telephone calls from coalition parties, announcing last week that they would oppose the bill. But although Mr Shimomura is delighted by the bill's defeat, he now faces the prospect of having to accept the compromise bills from the Liberal Democratic party, the leading opposition. 'The LDP's version of political reform is worse,' he says.</p>

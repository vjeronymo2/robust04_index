			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> L.A.'S PASSAGE TO INDIA;  </P> <P> THE BHARAT BAZAAR BRINGS A WEALTH OF FLAVORS FROM THE EAST TO THE WESTSIDE  </P> <P> MANY WHO THINK they know Indian food, based on their experience dining in  restaurants, are amazed when they first visit the Bharat Bazaar and gain some  inkling of how vast and varied the cuisine can be. This well-stocked market in  Los Angeles is run by Phulan Chander, who guides shoppers through its aisles in  her flowing sari and jogging shoes, pointing the way to ingredients and  explaining how to use them.  </P> <P> "Add a spoon of this to your rice," she suggests, indicating biryani masala (a  spice blend from Bombay that includes coriander, turmeric and peppercorn). Or  she'll offer a taste of mint chutney, and if the reaction is favorable, she'll  tell how to make it.  </P> <P> Recently she invited a customer to the stockroom to watch her prepare sooji ka  halwa, a dessert made with cream of wheat (sooji). Working over a tiny hot  plate, Chander fried the cereal in ghee (Indian-style clarified butter) until  the grains glistened. Then she stirred in sugar and water to make a thick  pudding. The subtle, toasty taste of the ghee should be seasoning enough, she  says, but one could also add cardamom and almonds.  </P> <P> The Bharat Bazaar is owned by Chander's husband, Ramesh, who oversees the  family's wholesale warehouse in Hawthorne while his wife runs the market. Other  family members own four stores in Northern California. The proliferation of  such businesses reflects the growth of California's Indian population. About  70,000 people of Indian origin now live in Los Angeles and Orange counties,  estimates Mangu Rohit, president of the Federation of Indian Assns. The  greatest concentration is in Cerritos, and the major shopping district is  "Little India" in Artesia.  </P> <P> Although Chander has lived in the United States for 20 years, she is still  thoroughly Indian -- a Punjabi Brahman, she says. That means she is a Hindu of  the highest caste and comes from the Punjab in northwestern India. Born in  Jullundur, Chander often wears a Punjabi suit -- a long silky top over pants.  The athletic shoes that she has adopted are a practical way to deal with long  hours of standing.  </P> <P> Located on a quiet stretch of Washington Boulevard, the Bharat Bazaar is the  Westside's answer to Bombay's bustling Crawford Market or Delhi's venerable  shopping street, Chandni Chowk. Of course, it's a lot smaller and quieter than  either of those. But the scope of the stock is amazing. Along with such staples  as basmati rice (an aromatic long-grain rice from Northern India), spices,  lentils and ghee, there are rare fresh curry leaves, which are essential to  South Indian cookery, and fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves. Methi is used in a  variety of dishes, including the flat cornmeal bread that is typical of Punjabi  cuisine. Sometimes the market has pale, magenta-bordered pea pods called papdi,  or a small green vegetable with pretty striations, known in India as tindora.  Okra and bitter melon are also usually on hand.  </P> <P> Rich sweets stacked in plastic containers on the counter might include bright  green pistachio burfi; round, syrup-soaked gulab jamun and squares of  saffron-yellow patisa topped with cardamom and melon seeds. Nearby is a pan  full of potato-stuffed samosas (deep-fried pastry). And usually there is paan,  which Indians chew after meals as a digestive. Paan consists of a fresh betel  leaf folded around betel nut and various flavorings. Chewing it reddens the  tongue and produces a faint numb sensation. Some find paan addictive, but  Chander warns that overindulgence is not good for the teeth.  </P> <P> Like bazaars in India, Chander's market is a sociable place that offers much  more than food. Community notices are posted on a bulletin board, and families  drop in to rent Indian films on videotape. "This a good movie?" Chander  inquires as a customer returns a video. Shelves near the entrance hold  cassettes of religious songs, Punjabi music and the haunting melodies known as  ghazals. Sometimes Chander plays these to make the shop more lively.  </P> <P>  One counter displays multicolor bangles for slim wrists. There are also saris  and scarfs, incense from Mysore, herbal toothpaste from Calcutta, Indian  cigarettes called bidis and cobra-head spoons that are used in temple worship.  Kitchenware includes three-legged round boards for rolling out chapatis (Indian  bread), gleaming steel boxes to hold the cooked chapatis, woks from Bombay and  steaming racks for idli, which are small cakes made of ground rice and lentils.  </P> <P> Non-Indians come in with shopping lists from cookbooks, and Chander directs  them to such unfamiliar items as jumbo black cardamoms, pungent-tasting black  salt and amchoor powder, a souring agent ground from dried mangoes.  </P> <P> Indian shoppers are eager to help, too, and a question about cooking can set  off a lively discussion. One interchange concerned milk masala, a costly blend  of nuts and spices that is almost impossible to find outside of India. "Just  make it yourself," advises Chander. All you do, she explains, is grind together  pistachios, almonds, saffron and cardamom. A spoonful of this blended with hot  milk and sugar produces a bracing beverage that is India's answer to hot  chocolate.  </P> <P> Despite long hours on duty, Chander cooks wholesome, traditional meals for her  husband and two children, even making chapatis twice a day. "I take time, but  I'm making very good food," she says. The Chanders are strict vegetarians, as  are many Indians, so their meals concentrate on dal (lentils); vegetables,  which often come from their garden; fruits; bread, and yogurt.  </P> <P> Although ghee is basic to the Indian larder, Chander often switches to olive  oil as a health measure. Garam masala -- a blend of such spices as cloves,  cardamom, cinnamon and pepper -- seasons many of her dishes, and turmeric goes  into her dals and vegetables. Amchoor adds a pleasant tang to some foods. And  cilantro, cumin and ginger root are other essentials that appear in the  following recipes, which are from Chander's personal collection.  </P> <P> The Bharat Bazaar is located at 11510 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, and is  open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Tuesday.  </P> <P> PHULAN'S BIRYANI RICE  </P> <P> 1 cup basmati rice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds  </P> <P> 2 cups water  </P> <P>  1/2 cup thawed frozen peas  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons coarsely broken raw cashews  </P> <P> 4 whole green cardamoms  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons packaged biryani masala  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Soak rice in water to cover generously 15 minutes.

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Manders shopping centre sold for Pounds 82m Manders, the paints, inks and property group which on December 19 sold its decorative paints division for Pounds 55m, announced yesterday the sale to Prudential of the Mander Centre, its Wolverhampton shopping centre and sole investment property interest, for about Pounds 82m. Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, explained that the sale, following the paints disposal, 'strategically realigns the group as a speciality chemicals company with the emphasis on printing inks'. On December 16, Manders augmented its inks division with the Pounds 26.7m acquisition of the printing inks and graphic supplies business of Croda International. Mr John Farmer, finance director, said: 'We were a stool with three legs and we've chopped off two.' However, he added that there was sufficient spread within the inks business - not least geographically since the Croda acquisition - for one leg to be steady enough for the group. Asked about how the cash consideration would be used, Mr Farmer said that UK acquisitions would be 'small and useful', but that the serious money would go to expand the international side of the inks business. Mr Farmer reckoned that the consideration - payable on June 24  - had 'set a new level in terms of yield for shopping centres'. It had been given an open market valuation of Pounds 65m at the end of December 1989; by the end of 1991, that figure had fallen to Pounds 57.5m. A potential tax liability of up to Pounds 10m - payable in September 1995 - will result, said Mr Farmer, though this was a 'worst-case scenario'.</p>

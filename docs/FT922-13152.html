			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / People: Salomon takes gilt from Greenwell Salomon Brothers International, on a drive to increase its share of the gilts market, has hired 28-year-old Michael Brook, one of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged's top young salesmen as an assistant director on the gilt-edged team. While Salomon's gilts operation suffered after the US treasury bond rigging scandal last year, the US investment house claims now to be rebuilding successfully, and says it is poised to make effective use of the vastly increased supply of gilts expected over coming months. Bob Pearce, head of gilt sales, says of Brook: 'Money is not the over-riding thing in this appointment. It is more the potential for career development; if you subscribe to the idea of convergence of European bond markets on the way to a single currency, you have to believe there will be an increasing amount of cross-market activity. Ours is a shop where you can take full advantage of that (because of the strong presence in other European markets).' Brook's departure is another blow for Greenwells which, as well as last year's senior defections, has just lost two other gilts salesmen to Goldman Sachs. While Greenwell's parent Midland denies that these moves will affect its position in the marketplace, attempts to capitalise on its gilts strength so as to develop a flourishing European bond business have so far come to little. ***** Ron Reilly has been promoted to md of PEERLESS FOOD PRODUCTS, a division of Acatos and Hutcheson; he succeeds James Falconer who has been appointed md of Pura Foods, the group's retail division. ***** Anthony Orvis, formerly md of Westmill Foods, part of ABF, has been appointed md of JLI's food processing division. ***** Jonathan Radford, group secretary of STAG FURNITURE HOLDINGS, has been appointed to the board. ***** Jim McGill has been appointed treasurer of HERTZ EUROPE; he moves from Arjo Wiggins Appleton. ***** Conor McCarthy has been promoted to chief executive of AER LINGUS COMMUTER. ***** Philip Yea, currently director of financial control at Guinness, is appointed finance director of GUINNESS BREWING WORLDWIDE. ***** Gordon Midgley is appointed director and general manager of Dunlop Precision, part of BTR. ***** Jack Criswell has been promoted to md of AMOCO (UK) EXPLORATION on the retirement of Charles Carr Jr. ***** Robert Bowden, formerly a senior partner of Conrad Ritblat, has been appointed property investment director of THE BRITISH LAND CORPORATION. ***** Tony Maynard has been promoted from marketing director to become md of Parker Knoll, part of CORNWELL PARKER. Martin Fear, formerly design director of Derwent Upholstery, part of Hillsdown, will become md of GP&amp;J Baker, another subsidiary, from July; John Kitching resigned in December. ***** John Gerry has been appointed md of WICKES BUILDING SUPPLIES. ***** Andrew Jenkinson is promoted from finance manager for Prudential Financial Services to become finance director of PRUDENTIAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS.</p>

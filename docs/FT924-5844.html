			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Le Pen turns hate to votes: France THE rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front (FN) with its aggressive anti-immigration stance has been a dominant feature of French politics in recent years, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. There are other extreme right-wing and anti-immigration groups in France but the FN is the only serious player on the electoral scene. Its share of the vote in regional elections has risen from 9.8 per cent in 1986 to 13.9 per cent this year. The FN was founded in 1972, but it was after the mid-1980s, as the communists lost momentum and the socialists swung to the centre, that it emerged as a significant force. If the regional result was translated into a proportional national poll, the FN would win 77 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, rather more than the single seat it presently holds. This week, the tombstones of French Moslem soldiers were vandalised at a military cemetery. In the past year several Jewish cemeteries in France have been desecrated with neo-Nazi graffiti.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Nam Song-hyon from New York] </F>   [Text] A working-level contact between North Korea and the  United States has resumed on the morning of 26 February [local  time].    Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for East  Asia and Pacific affairs, disclosed before the meeting that the  working-level contact was being held upon the request from the  North Korean side, thus strongly hinted that the North Korean  negotiators have received instructions from Pyongyang. Hubbard,  head of the U.S. side, when asked what is the biggest stumbling  block in the talks, said it is an exchange of special envoys  between the North and South, a condition for the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks.    Prior to the working-level contact, an official of the North  Korean mission to the United Nations revealed that something may  happen and perhaps a conclusion may be reached today [local  time], thus fueling speculations that a certain decision has  been made in Pyongyang in connection with the exchange of  special envoys.    Attention is now focused on how the two sides will narrow  their differences in today's contact over the exchange of  special envoys.    Diplomatic sources speculate that, if today's contact fails,  chances are high that North Korea will buy time until 28  February, the date that the International Atomic Energy Agency  will convene the special Board of Governors' meeting, and try to  meet the U.S. side once more to tug out the final agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana  radio and television in Spanish between 30 March and 4 April.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 30 March reports that  solidarity  groups from Ukraine are shipping 400 tons of milk to Cuba as a  token of appreciation for the treatment provided to the  Ukrainian children affected by the Chernobyl disaster.    Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 30 March reports that the vessel  (Wals Wabi) owned by (Grupo Uno) is unloading 15,650 tons of  bulk wheat in the Port of Havana. The ship, which is returning  from a four-month journey, visited ports in Suriname, Brazil,  France, and England where wheat was loaded. The ship has seven  holds for freight.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 30 March reports that in  Matanzas,  milk production has increased, while the death rate for cattle  has dropped considerably, compared to the same quarter of 1993.  This report was released by Jorge Pena, a local Agriculture  Ministry official. Pena said that milk production for the first  quarter of 1994 increased by 1.5 million liters in comparison to  the same period in 1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 31 March reports that the  supply  of recycled paper and cardboard to Havana City Province's main  paper and cardboard recycling center has decreased by  approximately 70 percent and that Cuba is buying old paper  abroad in order to produce various types of containers, like egg  cartons and ice cream cups. A recycling official stated the  center is now recycling one ton a month, as opposed to the three  tons per month it formerly recycled.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 March reports that six  provinces -- with Havana Province in first place -- had  fulfilled, as of 30 March, the sugarcane planting schedule that  covers the period up to 31 March. Cuba attained 90 percent of  this quarter's goal, planting 2,811 caballerias, a figure that  may increase once the final calculations and adjustments are  made.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 April reports that seven  platoons from the Espana Republicana sugar agroindustrial  complex in the municipality of Perico, Matanzas, have cut 1  million arrobas of sugarcane this harvest. Two of these platoons  have already cut 2 million arrobas and are striving to attain  the third million.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 2 April reports that after 10  years of inactivity, the Patricio Lumumba plant in Minas de  Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, has resumed producing  sulfuric acid. The director of the (Sulfo-Metales) enterprise  said resuming production will help save the nation $69 per ton  of sulfuric acid currently being imported. This plant is  expected to produce some 35,000 tons of sulfuric acid yearly, in  addition to byproducts.    Radio Reloj at 1501 GMT on 2 April reports that Jose Luis  Arias Munoz, a Spanish communist residing in Switzerland, has  made a personal donation of medicines worth $4,000 to the Centro  Habana Pediatric and Teaching Hospital. This is Arias' third  trip to Cuba and his second donation.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 April reports that a physical  rehabilitation facility at the General Calixto Garcia Teaching  Hospital has undergone a $50,000 renovation and that a new  endoscopic, minimal-trauma surgery unit will be inaugurated soon.    Radio Rebelde Network at 1700 GMT on 4 April reports that  the  Spanish Ibero-Star company, which participates in the joint  administration of the Tripton and Neptuno Hotels in Havana, has  announced that these hotels will be refurbished to enhance  service and attract more tourists, thus obtaining more currency.  The general manager of these hotels said that rooms will be  enlarged and all bathrooms and furniture replaced or renovated.  We have also decided to build a larger kitchen here at the  Neptuno to offer full pension service to clients, he said.  Together with our Cuban partners, we hope to find, either in  Mallorca or in Cuba itself, a discotheque expert because we are  interested in establishing a discotheque in the Tripton Hotel.</p>

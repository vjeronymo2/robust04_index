In a  statement, Feissel said the United Nations continues to believe  that both sides are willing to approach the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] in a reasonable manner. He said: Any specific  progress will come a few days or a week after the proximity  talks resume on Thursday [24 February].    Feissel said resolving the dispute on Varosha depends on  agreeing on the issues of safe movement and a timeframe for  implementation. He added that the Turkish Cypriot side is asking  for assurances that it will receive the benefits described in  the CBM's.</p>

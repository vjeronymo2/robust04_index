			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix M&hyph;VII&hyph;B. The term ``patient'' and its variants are used in the text as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shorthand designation for ``patient-subject.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P. Physical and Biological Containment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable to the greenhouse conduct of experiments involving recombinant DNA-containing plants, plant-associated microorganisms, and small animals. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the NIH Guidelines apply to plant research activities with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following modifications:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P shall supersede Appendix G when the research plants are of a size,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number, or have growth requirements that preclude the use of containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions described in Appendix G. The plants covered in Appendix P include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but are not limited to mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and vascular plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including terrestrial crops, forest, and ornamental species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant-associated microorganisms include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protozoans, certain small algae, and microorganisms that have a benign or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial association with plants, such as certain Rhizobium species and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms known to cause plant diseases. The appendix applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms which are being modified with the objective of fostering an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association with plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant-associated small animals include those arthropods that: (i) Are in obligate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association with plants, (ii) are plant pests, (iii) are plant pollinators, or (iv)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmit plant disease agents, as well as other small animals such as nematodes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which tests of biological properties necessitate the use of plants. Microorganisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with such small animals (e.g., pathogens or symbionts) are included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one individual with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise in plant, plant pathogen, or plant pest containment principles when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiments utilizing Appendix P require prior approval by the Institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Biosafety Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;I. General Plant Biosafety Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;A. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unintentional transmission of a recombinant DNA-containing plant genome,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including nuclear or organelle hereditary material or release of recombinant DNA- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived organisms associated with plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;B. The containment principles are based on the recognition that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms that are used pose no health threat to humans or higher animals (unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberately modified for that purpose), and that the containment conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the possibility of an unanticipated deleterious effect on organisms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecosystems outside of the experimental facility, e.g., the inadvertent spread of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious pathogen from a greenhouse to a local agricultural crop or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unintentional introduction and establishment of an organism in a new ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;C. Four biosafety levels, referred to as Biosafety Level (BL) 1_Plants (P), BL2&hyph;P, BL3&hyph;P, and BL4&hyph;P, are established in Section II. The selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of containment levels required for research involving recombinant DNA molecules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in plants or associated with plants is specified in Section III. These biosafety levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are described in Appendix P&hyph;II. This appendix describes greenhouse practices and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special greenhouse facilities for physical containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;D. BL1&hyph;P through BL4&hyph;P are designed to provide differential levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of biosafety for plants in the absence or presence of other experimental organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contain recombinant DNA. These biosafety levels, in conjunction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological containment conditions described in Appendix P&hyph;III, provide flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches to ensure the safe conduct of research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;E. For experiments in which plants are grown at the BL1 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BL4 laboratory settings, containment practices shall be followed as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix G. These containment practices include the use of plant tissue culture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or experiments performed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open benches. Additional biological containment practices should be added by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Greenhouse Director or Institutional Biosafety Committee as necessary (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;III), if botanical reproductive structures are produced that have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential of being released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;II.

Biosafety Level 1_Plants (BL1&hyph;P)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL1&hyph;P)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a. Greenhouse Access (BL1&hyph;P)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Access to the greenhouse shall be limited or restricted, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discretion of the Greenhouse Director, when experiments are in progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Prior to entering the greenhouse, personnel shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to read and follow instructions on BL1&hyph;P greenhouse practices and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. All procedures shall be performed in accordance with accepted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greenhouse practices that are appropriate to the experimental organism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

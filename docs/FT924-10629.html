			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Daewoo chief backs out of presidential challenge MR Kim Woo-choong, chairman of South Korea's Daewoo business group, yesterday abandoned plans to stand in December's presidential election. The announcement came as a relief to Mr Kim Young-sam, candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), who feared the Daewoo chairman's candidacy could cost him the election. Although the 56-year-old founder of the country's fourth biggest conglomerate had little chance of being elected, his candidacy would have reduced support for the DLP and possibly delivered the election to Mr Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party. The withdrawal of Daewoo's Mr Kim, who indicated earlier this week that he was interested in a presidential bid, may also be a fatal blow to a revolt by dissatisfied DLP members against Mr Kim Young-sam, now the leading candidate in the election. The DLP dissidents last week formed the New Korea Party (NPK), but have had difficulty in finding a credible presidential candidate. The Daewoo chairman was considered one of the last available prominent figures to lead the party. Mr Kim Woo-choong said he decided not to enter the election because he needed to concentrate on his business activities. But he may also have bowed to pressure from President Roh Tae-woo, who publicly criticised Mr Kim's planned election bid. President Roh feared that the Daewoo chairman's entry would help swing the election to Mr Kim Dae-jung. Daewoo has enjoyed close ties with the Roh administration. Political opponents have referred to the president as Roh Daewoo because of the favouritism he has shown to the conglomerate. Daewoo, for example, has been given special government support in developing business contacts with North Korea. There was concern that the government might try to stop Mr Kim's candidacy by applying the same pressure to Daewoo that was meted out to Hyundai, the nation's largest conglomerate, earlier this year when its chairman, Mr Chung Ju-yung, decided to stand for president. The government campaign against Hyundai, which ended in August without forcing Mr Chung to abandon his campaign, involved state-sanctioned credit squeezes and tax penalties. Daewoo is believed to be less able to withstand credit restrictions than Hyundai since debts among its 22 subsidiaries total Won7,000bn (Pounds 5bn). Even if official retribution had not materialised, Daewoo would have been weakened by the departure of Mr Kim, who has largely concentrated decision-making in his hands throughout the group's 25-year history. Investors reacted to Mr Kim's announcement yesterday by sending the share prices of Daewoo companies climbing on the Seoul bourse.</p>

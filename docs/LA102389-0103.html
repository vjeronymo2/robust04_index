			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REGAN RAPS NANCY REAGAN BOOK  </P> <P> Former White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan, renewing his feud with Nancy  Reagan, said today the former First Lady "has no gratitude for anyone."  </P> <P> "I think she takes too much pity on herself," Regan said on NBC's "Today" show  about Nancy Reagan's new book, "My Turn." In the book, she is critical of a  number of her husband's associates.  </P> <P> Regan also said things that the former First Lady wrote about Raisa Gorbachev  might have gone better unsaid. "All this bashing of the president of the Soviet  Union's wife isn't going to help Soviet-American relationships," he said.  </P> <P> Regan was fired as Reagan's chief of staff after Nancy Reagan lobbied her  husband to dump him, and the two have since traded barbs.  </P> <P> "She doesn't seem to realize what's been going on during those eight years,"  Regan said. "She has no gratitude to anyone. In yesterday's Los Angeles Times,  they had a full spread on this book, and in it they showed 20 people, all of  whom Nancy Reagan criticizes."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren, Sally Blyth and Chip Tsao] </F>   [Text] Chinese officials have indicated that they are not  prepared to make significant concessions at today's long-awaited  meeting of the Sino-British airport committee.    These unexpectedly negative signals came as yesterday's  meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ground to a halt  when Guo Fengmin, the leader of the Chinese team, told British  officials that he was unable to hold further discussions on  issues remaining on the table. It is understood that the  Chinese negotiating team is waiting for fresh instructions from  Beijing on the crucial issue of the handover of military land.    The main Chinese objection to Britain's position appears to  be China's unwillingness to give the Legislative Council a final  say on funding for redevelopment of the military lands,  particularly the new naval base.    Recent indications of China's willingness to be flexible  over  the level of government equity injection in the airport project  have produced high hopes of a successful outcome for today's  one-day airport committee meeting.    However, Chinese officials have described these high hopes  as  "unrealistic".    In a newspaper interview published on Wednesday, Lu Ping,  the  director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that  Beijing would be prepared to countenance a level of debt for the  airport project higher than the $5bn [billion Hong Kong dollars]  level, which had been China's previous bottom line.    But Lu was also careful to stress that progress on the  airport talks depended on the "attitude" and the "co-operation"  of the British -- a point emphasised by Chinese officials last  night.    British diplomats are also pessimistic about the outcome of  today's talks because of the mixed signals coming out of Beijing.    Although the outlook for the talks is bleak, neither team is  prepared to totally discount the possibility of an agreement.    After yesterday's JLG meeting it was suggested that a  separate experts' meeting on military lands, which has been held  simultaneously with the JLG, could continue over the weekend but  no agreement was reached on when it would reconvene.    Aside from the problem of Legco's role in funding  arrangements for the redevelopment of the military sites, it is  understood that disagreement persists over the size of the new  naval base to be built at Stonecutters Island.    Britain has been insisting that the price for developing a  larger naval base at Stonecutters will be a shortfall of funds  to refurbish military facilities elsewhere in the territory.    China's objections to giving the Legislative Council a  primary role in determining the funding for the redevelopment of  the sites stems from its insistence that Legco is merely an  advisory, colonial body, not a decision-making institution.    Britain, however, would find it difficult to accept an  agreement which excludes the role of Legco in determining the  funding proposals. Nor can it agree that British funds will be  used to make up the difference if Legco only agrees to the  partial provision of the financing agreement recommended by the  JLG.    A senior British official said Britain was trying to work  out  a compromise formula.    "You have to have provisions which enable the thing [the  fund] to be put into effect. If the Chinese side does not like  the way in which the money is made available, then we have to  look at other ways. We have to find some wording which does not  openly contradict the position of both sides.    "Equally, Britain will not accept the obligation to pay if  Legco denies the money. Both sides will have to find a  phraseology to make sure, from the legal point of view, that  neither side's position is compromised unacceptably, otherwise  there is obviously no deal," he said.    The Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday tried to put a  positive  slant on the adjournment of the JLG meeting.    "We've [been] talking about the future of the defence estate  for about seven years. That is an indication of how difficult  and complex the issues are," he said.    "I think that it's fair to say that both sides have been  working extremely hard over the last few weeks to try to put an  agreement in place as soon as possible. It is complicated. It  is difficult."</p>

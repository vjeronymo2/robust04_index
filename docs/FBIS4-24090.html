			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Nigerian opposition leader  Moshood Abiola, sought by security forces since June 11, on  Wednesday defied the military regime by making a public address  to more than 2,000 people in the heart of the capital. Abiola  supporters went wild when the Muslim millionaire tycoon, missing  since he slipped away under the nose of police earlier this  month while under house arrest, suddenly surfaced in Lagos. He  proclaimed himself president and Armed Forces commander-in-chief  on June 11, saying he was the legitimate winner of the June 12,  1993, presidential elections later cancelled by the military  authorities.</p>

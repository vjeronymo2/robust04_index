			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Warning from Sherwood Computer SHARES IN Sherwood Computer Services lost almost a third of their value yesterday after the group warned that its first-half profits would be 'substantially below' those for the same period last year. The shares, which reached a five year-high of 350p at the end of February but have since dropped sharply, fell by a further 63p yesterday after the profits warning to close at 145p. The group, which has developed specialist software for the insurance and housing finance markets, blamed the expected profits downturn on 'the well publicised difficulties in the Lloyd's market and uncertainties surrounding local government financing.' Last year, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.75m for the six months to June 30, bolstered by lower interest costs and a Pounds 522,000 exceptional credit which offset a Pounds 200,000 charge related to earlier difficulties in the Lloyd's insurance market. The 1993 interim results have been brought forward and are now expected to be announced later this month. Mr Richard Guy, chairman, said the shortfall was largely attributable to the problems in the Lloyd's market which have resulted in reorganisations and contractions of agencies and the closure of syndicates. In particular, Sherwood has been badly affected by the reorganisation at Sturge, the largest Lloyd's managing agency. Mr Guy said this, together with the general uncertainty in the market, had resulted in a 'drastic reduction' in software licence revenues at a time when Sherwood was customising its Sceptre software to meet the requirements of Sturge. Similarly, he said uncertainties in local government financing caused by the replacement of the community charge with council tax had created a difficult environment for sales of Threshold, Sherwood's public sector housing software product. Despite the setback, directors said they remained positive about the group's prospects for the remainder of the year. 'Substantial new contracts have been won which will have a positive effect in the second half and the company's finances remain sound,' they said.</p>

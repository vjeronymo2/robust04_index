			<p>BFN     [Text] Almost 100 Haitian boat people were repatriated on  25 April to Port-au-Prince by a U.S. Coast Guard patrol ship  that intercepted them. The 98 refugees, who were trying to reach  Florida on board a makeshift boat, were intercepted on 22 April  in the Windward Passage between Haiti and Cuba. The boat people,  including three children without parents, sailed from the island  of La Tortue.    It should be recalled that on Saturday, 95 Haitians,  survivors of a shipwreck on an island of the Bahamas, were  repatriated by plane from the Bahamas to Port-au-Prince.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo in Malian project Anglo American Corporation is to develop a Dollars 200m open pit gold mine in Mali in partnership with the Mali government and Iamgold, the Canadian concession holder. Anglo, South Africa's largest mining house, announced yesterday that a feasibility study of the 'world-class' deposit at Sadiola in south-western Mali had been completed and said it hoped to start development early in 1994. A business vehicle will be formed by Anglo, Iamgold and the Malian government - in the ratio 40:40:20 - to undertake the development. Mr Neville Keys, projects director at Anglo's New Mining Business division, said the mine was expected to be a cheap producer. The pit is shallow, the grade is good, 2 grammes a tonne, and there are no metallurgical complications - the gold will be recovered by conventional carbon-in-pulp technology. The mine has more than 50m tonnes of treatable ore and, at an annual mining rate of about 4m tonnes, should have a life-span of about 13 years. Peak production will be about 11-12 tonnes of gold a year, with total production of 116 tonnes anticipated over the life of the mine. Mr Keys said that although the project was not technologically complex, sparse infrastructure made it logistically challenging. Accordingly the group is cautious about how soon the project will be operational, though it is contractually bound to be commissioned by the beginning of 1997. Agreement was reached just over a year after Anglo signed the initial option agreement with Iamgold. Mr Keys said Anglo would be looking to finance its stake in the project mostly through offshore loans. He said it was a good project and maximum project finance was being sought.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will retain responsibility for assessing the ``previous participation'' of mortgagors, contractors, consultants or management agents in HUD programs and for intergovernmental and environmental review. HUD will delegate to HFAs the functions pertaining to a project's affirmative fair housing marketing plan and certain activities under the Davis-Bacon Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to HUD environmental reviews, it should be noted that section 307(b)(4) of the 1994 Act authorizes the Secretary of HUD, under such regulation in lieu of the environmental protection procedures otherwise applicable, to provide for agreements to endorse for insurance mortgages under this pilot program upon the request of qualified HFAs if the State or unit of general local government, as designated by the Secretary, assumes all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decision making, and action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other relevant laws. The statute goes into further detail as to what specific provisions will be contained in any regulations the Secretary may issue. The Department has in process draft regulations to implement this section 307(b)(4) of the '94 Act, which will be promulgated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a separate rule, which will amend both this final rule and 24 CFR part 58_Environmental Review Procedures for the Community Development Block Grant, Rental Rehabilitation, and Housing Development Grant Programs. Until such time as this new rule takes effect, the Department will retain responsibility for assuring compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and related laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 542(c) of the Act does not statutorily require payment of prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act on projects receiving mortgage insurance under the pilot program. However, the Department has administratively determined that it will require payment of Davis-Bacon wage rates on certain projects receiving mortgage insurance under the program. As provided in &sect;266.225 of the rule, Davis-Bacon wage rates will be required to be paid to all laborers and mechanics (except volunteers) employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects (1) for which advances are insured under this part; (2) which involve new construction or substantial rehabilitation; and (3) which will contain 12 or more dwelling units. Davis-Bacon requirements will apply only if all of these conditions are met, unless Davis-Bacon wage rates are applicable by reason of assistance from another Federal program. (For example, if assistance under Section 8 is also used in connection with a project under this part that involves minor rehabilitation, Davis-Bacon requirements would apply to the project if it contains nine or more Section 8-assisted units.) The Department has decided to require payment of Davis-Bacon wage rates to ensure that prevailing wage requirements under this program are generally comparable to similar provisions required by statute for multifamily mortgage insurance programs under the National Housing Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule also states that while the Commissioner retains responsibility for enforcement of labor standards under this section, the Commissioner may delegate to the HFA information collection ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> payroll review and routine interviews) and other routine administration and enforcement functions, subject to monitoring by the Commissioner. The Department intends to delegate such routine administration and enforcement functions to HFAs. This delegation is consistent with the Department's decision to delegate many of the functions relating to insurance of individual projects to the HFAs. The delegation is also consistent with the Department's longstanding delegation of routine Davis-Bacon functions to States and local governments under the Community Development Block Grant program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Processing, Development, and Approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D describes functions that the HFA and HUD will undertake in relation to a loan origination and HUD insurance endorsement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An HFA that assumes 50 percent or more of the risk associated with a loan may use its own underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions to underwrite and approve loans. Where an HFA assumes less than 50 percent of the risk, underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions are subject to HUD review, modification and approval. The rule provisions also cover responsibilities of HFAs concerning such matters as project feasibility, acceptability of the mortgagor, and inspections during the project construction period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 266.310 provides the circumstances where HUD will insure loan advances, or agree to insure the entire mortgage upon completion of construction. Where a mortgage is endorsed for insurance, the interim rule provides that the HFA must remain the mortgagee of record for as long as mortgage insurance is in force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Mortgage and Closing Requirements; HUD Endorsement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E contains requirements that relate to the mortgage and the property that secures the insured loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that section 542(c)(2)(E) provides that HFAs are permitted to use their own underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions for purposes of underwriting loans to be insured under this program where the HFA is assuming 50 percent or more of the risk of loss. Where the Secretary retains more than 50 percent of the risk of loss, section 542(c)(2)(E) permits the Secretary to impose additional underwriting criteria and loan terms and conditions on loans to be insured under the program. However, it is the Department's view that Congress intended, in enacting section 542(c), to develop a fiscally prudent mortgage insurance program. The interim rule cited several examples of HUD regulations being imposed by the Department, including the requirement that the HUD-insured mortgage constitute a first lien. Subsequent to publication of the interim rule, Congress expressly amended the Act to establish as a program requirement that the insured mortgage be a first lien. However, the Department believes that Congress did not intend to preclude other HUD regulations that would provide: (1) that the HUD-insured mortgage be regularly amortizing; (2) that the insured mortgage contain a covenant against the change in use of the insured property; (3) that the insured mortgage contain a covenant requiring the mortgagor to keep the property, which is security for the mortgage, insured against loss due to fire or other hazards; and (4) that the regulatory agreement executed by the mortgagor contain a provision requiring that the mortgagor be a sole asset mortgagor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

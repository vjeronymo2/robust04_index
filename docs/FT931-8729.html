			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Keating in drive to win marginal votes PRIME MINISTER Paul Keating of Australia yesterday stepped up efforts to win the support of voters in marginal seats by offering ADollars 600m (Pounds 285.7m) in federal funds to assist a financially embarrassed state Labor government. Mr Keating said federal financial support was essential to help the state of South Australia recover from a ADollars 3bn loss incurred by the government-owned state bank. The offer was widely seen as an attempt to shore up Labor support in South Australia, where the government is defending four marginal seats in the federal election, due on March 13. Labor trails the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition by up to 12 points in the opinion polls. The coalition needs a swing of 0.9 per cent to take power. Mr Keating's offer was accepted by Mr Lynn Arnold, leader of South Australia's minority Labor government. He said the bank would be privatised to reduce the state's ADollars 7bn debt burden. The privatisation, which was expected, is likely to take place next year. Analysts said the sale would probably return about ADollars 1bn to the state government. Mr Keating's offer follows claims by the South Australian conservative opposition that the federal coalition would provide ADollars 400m to the state over 10 years if it wins the election. Mr Keating said he was not worried the offer would be regarded as an electoral bribe. The government and opposition are also locked in a bidding war for the support of voters in seven marginal seats in the Queensland and northern New South Wales sugar belt.</p>

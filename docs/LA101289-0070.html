			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: HOW TO AVOID STIRRING UP TROUBLE IN THE MICROWAVE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy cooking with my microwave, but when a recipe says to  stir, is it still necessary since the microwave has a turntable?  </P> <P>  -- RENE, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR RENE: If a recipe says to stir, it is very important that you do so even  though the microwave has a turntable. Stirring usually keeps dishes from  cooking unevenly on the bottom and around the edges. The turntable has metal  gears that may block out some of the microwaves and the food might cook  unevenly.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My husband discovered a way to keep the contents of two-liter pop  bottles from going flat after being opened. Put the cap back on loosely, then  squeeze the plastic bottle until the remaining liquid comes right up to the  neck or as close to it as possible. Then, while holding it there, tighten the  cap.  </P> <P> With practically no air remaining in the bottle, the contents will retain most  of their original qualities. This works except for the last few ounces.  </P> <P>  -- MAYLO, Glendive, Mont.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I read in your column a hint about mixing and preparing frozen  orange juice by using a potato masher to break down the frozen juice.  </P> <P> I know an easier way. The night before I want to serve the juice, I dump the  frozen juice out of the can into my plastic container, then add the required  amount of water. I place the container in the refrigerator and when I take it  out in the morning, the frozen juice has thawed and I only need to stir or  shake it.  </P> <P>  -- JEAN, Concordia, Kan.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My daughter and I had a half-bushel of cherries to be pitted. It  was taking us forever and I thought there had to be an easier way. A good  thought came to me -- try a carrot peeler.  </P> <P> I put the end of the peeler through the top of each cherry and pulled the seed  out. It really saved time and lots of trouble. Wanted to pass this along to  other cherry pitters.  </P> <P>  -- HAZEL, Henderson, Ky.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Coffee filters sure are versatile. I use them for so many things.  </P> <P> Our family is watching calories and fat intake, so I steam as many things as I  can. One of our favorite steamed dishes is fish. The problem is in removing the  fish, which crumbles into a zillion little pieces. What a mess.  </P> <P> I came up with this. Before placing the fish in the steamer, I place it in a  coffee filter. When the fish is done I simply lift it out in the filter in one  piece. It looks more appetizing this way too.  </P> <P>  -- RONNIE, Scottsdale, Ariz.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I bought some new smoked glass pie plates, but they look smaller  than my standard nine-inch pie plates.  </P> <P> I don't want to prepare pie filling for a nine-inch pie and find that it won't  all fit into one of my new plates. How can I test them?  </P> <P>  -- ANN, Casper, Wyo.  </P> <P> DEAR ANN: Our home economist suggested the following method: Pour four cups of  water into the plate. If it holds it, then it is a nine-inch pie plate. A  nine-inch pie plate should hold four cups of liquid exactly.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I just moved into an apartment and really have a problem with  insects. Any tips sure will be appreciated.  </P> <P>  -- CELIA, Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR CELIA: One of the most important things to do to keep insects away is to  regularly clean the areas where they are most commonly found. Usually these  areas are the kitchen, bathroom, basements or areas that are damp and dark.  </P> <P> To discourage these pests, clean under all appliances and heavy furniture. You  may want to treat this area with an insecticide to deter any stubborn  residents. Read all label directions on any insecticide and follow them  exactly.  </P> <P> Don't forget to clean areas like air ducts, cracks, baseboards, floor  registers, corners and other areas where insects can hide and breed. These  areas can also be treated with an insecticide.  </P> <P> All foods should be stored properly with tight-fitting lids or they should be  covered appropriately. When bringing grain products home, place the products in  the oven at 130 degrees for 30 minutes or place them in the freezer at zero  degrees for seven days. If the products have weevils, this procedure will keep  them from spreading.  </P> <P> If there is a heavy infestation of unwanted insect tenants, call a professional  exterminator. This is often the only way to totally rid a home of all unwanted  pests.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When cooking pasta we all know the trick of using a drop of  cooking oil in the water to keep the pot from boiling over, but here is another  idea.  </P> <P> Spray a light film of vegetable-oil spray on the inside of the colander before  you drain the pasta in it. You can now drain the pasta for as long as you want  and it won't stick to the surface of the colander.  </P> <P>  -- J .I., Washington  </P></p>

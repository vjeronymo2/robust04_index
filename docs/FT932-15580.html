			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Fiat tries to brush off the impact of arrests WHILE its factories start humming again after the Easter break, a growing silence is descending on the executive eighth floor of Fiat's headquarters on tree-lined Corso Marconi in Turin. The issue last week by Milan magistrates of a cautionary warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, takes to seven the number of its senior executives embroiled in the country's political corruption scandals. The focus of the magistrates has moved steadily up Fiat's executive hierarchy in recent months. The latest detentions of top officials have cast doubt on the ability of Italy's biggest private sector company to brush off the scandal's impact. Mr Garuzzo, in London on business when the warrant was issued, is expected to return to face the magistrates this week. His lawyers are trying to negotiate the terms of his return, and he will probably be hoping to avoid the 38 days spent in Milan's San Vittore prison by his counterpart, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, arrested in February. The absence of one, and possibly both, senior executives could hardly come at a worse time. Fiat is at the start of a crucial model replacement programme designed to restore competitiveness, especially in the crucial domestic market, where its share fell to 43 per cent last month. To compound matters Fiat is in the run-up to the change of chairman from Mr Agnelli to his younger brother Umberto. Meanwhile, Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's veteran chief executive, will eventually make way for a younger successor, widely seen as Mr Garuzzo. So far, Fiat has played down the impact of the arrests on its affairs, stressing the image of business as usual and the innocence of its managers, whom it implies were victims of a corrupt system. It has discreetly attacked magistrates' use of summary arrests and detentions to extract confessions. Significantly, its tactics changed slightly with Mr Garuzzo. Fiat alluded to the potential damage to its business. Pointing to recession and cut-throat competition, Fiat said the magistrates' tactics left it 'preoccupied'. Fiat has been dealt a difficult hand by the arrests. Immense public support for the magistrates rules out direct attacks. A ham-fisted approach could also be taken as 'proof' of its guilt. Pointing out the potential risks of the investigations to one of Italy's biggest companies is far more astute. Recession and fears of rising unemployment mean public opinion is more receptive to arguments based on business, rather than legal or political, grounds. But Fiat does not want to create undue uncertainty among its workforce or shareholders. Its shares have been rising sharply this year on a variety of fundamental and speculative factors, and it would think twice about creating an atmosphere of uncertainty. Yet there is no doubt the investigations are now hurting, and not just the group's image. The impact is twofold. First, with the arrest of Mr Mattioli and likely detention of Mr Garuzzo, two of Fiat's three most senior non-family executives have now been sidelined. Mr Mattioli, now out of jail but under house arrest in Rome, is in charge of Fiat's financial affairs and non-industrial activities, such as the big Fidis financial services operation. Mr Garuzzo is the head of Fiat's industrial operations, principally the auto business. The arrests of two such senior figures inevitably trigger doubts as to how secure are the positions of those further up the ladder. Only a few weeks ago, just suggesting magistrates might consider acting against Mr Romiti, let alone one of the Agnellis, would have been considered a joke. Given the magistrates' current confidence and the new mood sweeping Italy, such hints are no longer a laughing matter.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sale of Procordia faces delay until next year THE PRIVATISATION of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, may be delayed until next year, according to Mr Jan Ekberg, managing director. The sale of the Swedish government's 40 per cent stake, expected later this year, was postponed due to poor market conditions. Recently, Procordia's position in the privatisation queue has slipped following the government's decision to give priority to the sale of the Celsius defence equipment group later this year. As a result, Procordia's privatisation 'will probably be postponed until next year,' said Mr Ekberg. However, the potential delay could help the deal, as it would give Procordia more time to digest Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the Italian pharmaceuticals group being merged with its Kabi Pharmacia subsidiary, he argued. The joint unit will be the world's 18th-biggest pharmaceuticals company, with sales of about Dollars 3.6bn. The two companies will be among the market leaders in a number of niche areas such as clinical nutrition, growth hormones, oncology and cardio-vascular drugs. The expansion in Procrodia's pharmaceuticals activities should make the group 'easier to privatise,' said Mr Ekberg. In spite of the recent downturn in investor interest in pharmaceutical stocks, Procordia should be more attractive and command a higher price once FCE has been digested, he claimed. Procordia agreed to buy 51 per cent of FCE from Italy's Montedison in March. The Swedish company also has an option, almost certain to be exercised, to buy the remaining shares by 1995. The acquisition will reinforce Kabi Pharmacia's position in the increasingly competitive pharmaceuticals business, particularly at a time of rising pressure on prices. The merger will boost research spending to about Dollars 500m, create a much stronger manufacturing base and boost the two companies' marketing presence, said Mr Hakan Astrom, Kabi Pharmacia's chief executive. However, Procordia is clearly interested in expanding further into pharmaceuticals. Although Mr Ekberg said no big takeovers were being planned, he left open the door to 'smaller strategic acquisitions in certain areas'. The group, which will now be among the leaders in Italy, Sweden and Spain, is particularly keen to strengthen its role in the US and Japan, where it is still weak. While much of its expansion will come from organic growth of existing activities, it is also looking at potential alliances or complementary acquisitions. A first visible step towards integrating its growing international operations will come with the choice of a new name, to replace Kabi Pharmacia Farmitalia Carlo Erba, probably by the autumn.</p>

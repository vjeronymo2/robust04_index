			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: PUTTING A FINGER ON THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY;  </P> <P> HIS FANS THINK HE'S GREAT, BUT SOME CRITICS AREN'T SO SURE  </P> <P> Harry Connick Jr. is making a lot of people upset. He's upsetting a lot of jazz  fans for turning his back on the musical developments of the last 40 years and  championing the early piano styles of Earl (Fatha) Hines, Fats Waller, Art  Tatum and Duke Ellington.  </P> <P> Connick, who pleaded his musical case last week at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano, also is upsetting a lot of jazz critics for putting more energy  into his increasingly Hollywood-ized stage act than into his piano playing or  singing.  </P> <P> And all this brouhaha is upsetting his rapidly growing following, which is  angry with those close-minded critics and snooty aficionados for suggesting  that this would-be Emperor of Jazz has nothing going for him except those  stylish new clothes.  </P> <P> Of course, there is far more to the canonization of Connick than his musical  talent. The fact is that he wouldn't have one-tenth of the copy flowing out of  writers' pens if he wasn't so young (21), so Southern-gentlemanly affable and  so gosh-darn handsome. James Booker was a great piano player too, but a  one-eyed black one with an odd walk and a foul mouth. You hardly heard anything  about him.  </P> <P> I had gotten a little touch of Harry on his home turf at the New Orleans Jazz  &amp; Heritage Festival last year, but the Coach House show was the first full  performance I had seen. I wanted to like him a lot, because I agree with what  Connick told the audience Tuesday night: that once upon a time, jazz was both  great music and great fun.  </P> <P> Much criticism of Connick centers on his outgoing personality and will to  entertain -- two things that have seemed anathema to jazz in the post-War era,  as the notion that jazz is indeed An Art Form has gone to the musicians' heads.  </P> <P> Experimentalists from Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk to Ornette Coleman and  Charles Mingus developed a new vocabulary. But they also turned jazz into  something more for musicians themselves than for audiences.  </P> <P> Stereotypically, post-bop jazz must be musically complex, intellectually  demanding and personally remote. It's as though musicians would taint The Form  by so much as acknowledging the audience.  </P> <P> It's kind of like the Middle Ages, when a select circle of monks guarded all  knowledge, reserving wisdom to themselves lest the lowly masses soil it with  their grubby fingers. It's an attitude that irritated me through college, when  I played in jazz big bands and often ran into other musicians who looked down  their noses at anything as populist and accessible as rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> While instrumental proficiency has grown exponentially, the modern jazz  musician, as well as many critics, seems to prize technique over all else. Last  year one of this paper's critics panned classical clarinetist Richard Stoltzman  when he fronted the Woody Herman band at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center.  </P> <P> The complaint was that Stoltzman, whose reputation was built on his Beethoven  and Mozart and not on his Benny and Woody, didn't have the chops of any number  of competent jazz reed men. True enough. But for my money, his fluid and  melodic soloing had far more heart.  </P> <P> So, for a variety of reasons, it was encouraging to hear Connick talk about his  love for an earlier generation of musicians who played music that could appeal  to the listener emotionally as well as intellectually.  </P> <P> The reviews?  </P> <P> "Columbia Records is doing for Harry Connick Jr. what it did for Wynton  Marsalis in 1982. The difference between the two, however, is that Marsalis had  the talent to warrant the hype; Connick, as indicated during his hourlong  opening set, does not," wrote Times critic A. James Liska about Connick's  performance at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in L.A. earlier this month.  </P> <P> Daily News music critic Richard S. Ginell wrote that in a 1987 performance at  the Roxy, Connick left the impression "of a fumbling, heavy-handed pianist who  couldn't swing to save his life. Now," Ginell wrote, "it is astonishing to see  that Connick has become some kind of media idol . . . pursued by Hollywood,  accompanied by hurrahs from reviewers and other media nabobs who perhaps don't  know any better." The Connick who returned to Southern California this month,  Ginell said, "was pretty much the same performer we saw at the Roxy -- only  slicker and more personable."  </P> <P> Connick addressed the critical fusillade at the Coach House on Tuesday, saying  he would rather win over 500 regular people than 5 critics. The audience ate it  up.  </P> <P> Truth be told, those reviewers did go too far. His runs and flourishes weren't  always metronomically precise, and he never approached the wizardry of Tatum or  the other greats he idolizes. But he played energetically, with a particularly  strong left hand, and at times engaged in stimulating exchanges with bassist  Ben Wolfe that represented the best of symbiosis. Other times, though, he  restricted his keyboard efforts to pointless noodling, and his singing was  rarely more than pleasantly forgettable.  </P> <P> The biggest question raised by his performance, though, is why he seems  interested in being a devil-may-care raconteur who shows everyone a great time  rather than a musician who touches everyone with great music. Connick's real  problem isn't the critical barbs; it's that in rebelling against the somberness  of most jazz, he has swung too far the other way.  </P> <P> By succumbing to the accolades at such an early point in his career, Connick  may be giving short shrift to what could be a big talent. Remember what  happened when Elvis decided to be a superstar instead of just a great rock 'n'  roll singer? Connick isn't the Elvis of jazz, though some of the hype might  lead you to think so.  </P> <P> Saving graces are that he is young enough to grow out of his adolescent  reaction to stardom, and that he does have a great sense of history, evident in  a repertoire that includes standards such as "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off,"  "The Sunny Side of the Street" and "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone."  </P> <P> At least Connick is on the right track. A shot in the arm, or perhaps a kick in  the pants, is just what jazz needs to get it off its smug keister.  </P> <P> But in his zeal to get audiences humming "I'm Just Wild About Harry," Connick  shouldn't forget that when it comes to his music, it's gotta be "All or Nothing  at All."  </P></p>

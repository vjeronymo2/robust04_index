			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Bosnian Croat forces  Thursday prevented the UN from evacuating ill civilians from the  Moslem sector of Mostar, in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] said.    Spokesman Kris Janowski said the evacuation of 22 patients  and 16 of their relatives had to be called off after the Croat  forces (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] failed to give  authorisation for it to go ahead.    Among the ill was a five-year-old girl with bone cancer who  needed urgent medical attention, he said.    A spokeman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) meanwhile  said intense fighting broke out Wednesday between the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army and the HVO at Fojnica, 40 kilometers  (25 miles) west of here.    Spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck said UN military  observers  who reported renewed clashes between Bosnian-controlled Fojnica  and the Croat-held town of Bakovici, three kilometers (two  miles) away, had no further details.    The new outbreak of fighting came after Croat forces Monday  recaptured the Moslem village of Here, near Prozor, 30  kilometers (20 miles) south of Fojnica.    The village has great strategic significance for the defense  of Jablanica and Konjic, towns under Bosnian control, and for  communication between Sarajevo and central Bosnia.    The mountainous village of Here and two others held by  Bosnian forces, Kute and Scipe, stand along a road built by  Croat forces to link Kiseljak, 30 kilometers west of Sarajevo,  to western Herzegovina, which they control.    UN observers also reported renewed exchanges of light and  heavy automatic gunfire at Gornji Vakuf, in central Bosnia,  between the Bosnian Army and the HVO.    Serb forces stepped up their bombing of Sarajevo on  Wednesday, wounding eight civilians, Lieutenant-Colonel van  Biesebroeck added.    He said 350 shells hit the Bosnian capital. Of these, 60  percent were aimed at Bosnian positions on Mount Zuc, 30 percent  at the southwestern districts of Dobrinja and Mojmilo and 10  percent at the centre of town.</p>

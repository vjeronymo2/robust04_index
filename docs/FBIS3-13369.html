Police escorting the Royal Rhapsody cruise boat fired back  but the gunmen escaped along the Nile River near the Islamic  militant stronghold of Asyut, 360 kilometers (216 miles) south  of Cairo, security services said.    The tourists were sailing from Suhaj to the capital Cairo.    For the past year police have escorted tour boats in rubber  dinghies in a broad effort to protect tourists targeted by  militants seeking to sabotage the Egyptian economy and bring  down the secular government.

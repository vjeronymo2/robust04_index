			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / High-tech fibres mimic silk THE FASHION DESIGNERS of the 1990s are returning to nylon and polyester after decades of consumer resistance. Unlike in the 1960s, though, their use is not just a whim of fashion, according a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. High-technology materials once intended for sports and outdoor wear have generated new fashions that are being sold from the catwalk to the high street. The technology behind the materials is microfibres - polyester or nylon filaments finer than silk. That fineness imparts a luxurious 'handle and drape' to machine-washable clothes. Different weaves create a silk or suede touch and fabrics can be made to feel like peach skin or be given a powdery surface. Mr Paul Smith, a London fashion designer, said yesterday: 'The peach-finish microfibre was the real breakthrough. Man-made fibres have always had a man-made nastiness about them, but microfibres have a fluid touch. They can feel like silk or suede.' The biggest demand for microfibres is in 'fashion plus function', where looks are as important as technical performance, according to the report. Microfibre weaves can be made so fine they do not need further treatment to be rainproof and at the same time allow the wearer to sweat. Mircrofibres were developed in the 1970s by Japanese chemists seeking a more realistic artificial silk. Japan still leads the field, but new competitors include ICI in the UK and Hoechst in Germany. 'Microfibres are overpriced,' Ms Katharine Hamnett, the London fashion designer conceded. 'But they feel absolutely wonderful.' Prices may fall as sales grow. But consumers beware: 'microfibre' labels are being sewn on to more ordinary high street clothes and, the unit warns, quality is already a casualty in the race to cash in. Textile Output March 1992.

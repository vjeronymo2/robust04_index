			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CORONA DEL MAR;  </P> <P> BAYSIDE DRIVE SEWER LINE WORK TO BEGIN  </P> <P> A contractor was selected this week for the Bayside Drive phases of a sewer  line project to serve planned homes on Newport Coast, the unincorporated Irvine  Co. land between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> McGrand &amp; Associates of Calimesa, Calif., was awarded the $2-million  contract for the installation of sewer lines along scenic Bayside Drive from  Coast Highway in Newport Beach to Marguerite Avenue in Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Work will begin in about six weeks, said Corinne Clawson, County Sanitation  Districts spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The final phase of the project, to be installed through the Corona del Mar  business district on East Coast Highway to the south city limits, will be under  construction after Pelican Hill Road is completed next year, according to a  resolution passed earlier that prohibits downtown upheaval before the bypass  road is in place, said Councilman Phil Sansone.  </P> <P> Sansone said sections of Bayside Drive, a popular alternate route for  commuters, will be restricted or closed during the construction. Traffic is  expected to worsen on Coast Highway until summer when construction is scheduled  for completion. LESLIE HERZOG  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BSkyB and UIP settle row caused by Dollars 800m deal UNITED International Pictures, the distributor for three Hollywood studios and British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, yesterday announced that they had settled all their legal differences. In what could have become a messy and expensive series of law suits, BSkyB decided to try to overturn an Dollars 800m (Pounds 442m) movie rights deal it signed with UIP in 1988. BSkyB, a venture in which Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, claimed that the UIP joint venture for distribution and licensing of pay TV rights was anti-competitive and in breach of the Treaty of Rome. BSkyB also issued a writ in London seeking damages of more than Pounds 150m. In October UIP went on the offensive and announced it was beginning legal action to try to break up BSkyB, which was formed from the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television. UIP argued that the satellite company was an anti-competitive cartel. Yesterday all the litigation was called off, apparently without any money changing hands: The legal proceedings between BSkyB and UIP in the High Court are being brought to an end; UIP has withdrawn its case against BSkyB's shareholders over the merger; BSkyB is withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission against UIP. The rows between the satellite broadcaster and one of the most powerful of Hollywood's film groupings largely grew out of BSkyB's pressing need to renegotiate film deals entered into at a time when BSB and Sky were competing desperately against each other. BSkyB now has a deal on a long-term basis to show films from the UIP studios  -Paramount, MCA and MGM-Pathe - on both of its subscription film channels. Film channel subscriptions are the financial heart of the BSkyB business. Both sides made the following statement yesterday: 'UIP and BSkyB are satisfied that the new deal is fair to each of the parties and good for the consumer.' The UK satellite company now has revised deals with all of the Hollywood studios, apart from Warner Bros, the Time Warner subsidiary where talks are continuing. BSkyB is expected to break even on an operational basis later this year. In the last three months new satellite dish installation in the UK has been above 100,000 a month.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / At unease with itself Britain's establishment is not at ease with itself. There is disquiet in the upper ranks. It goes beyond concern about the latest unemployment figures, or the balance of payments deficit, or the ballooning of the public sector borrowing requirement. The winter does not help. The recession certainly has a lot to do with it. But it is more than that. The chattering classes, whose perceptions sometimes influence the rest of the nation, are once again telling one another that all is not quite right with the state of affairs on these islands. I record this with apologies to my former boss, Sir Geoffrey Owen, who wrote in these pages last week that 'exaggerated gloom about all things British is unnecessary and counter-productive'. Quite so. Our post-1945 history has not been all gloom and bust. Yet confidence in the British polity seems to me to be sagging. One reason is that the keystone of our constitution, the throne, is looking shaky. Mr Jack Straw, an opposition frontbencher, has voiced the opinion of many in the Labour party that the monarchy should be reformed. A weekend report suggested that perhaps a quarter of Labour members are republicans. Loyal defenders of the Queen are to be found in all sections of the House of Commons. They constitute a solid majority. The difficulty arises when the talk is of her successor. Then there is a division of opinion, a general shuffling of feet. If the Prince of Wales divorces his wife, it will be incongruous for him to become 'supreme governor' of the Church of England. Yet in order to succeed his mother, he would have to adopt the role of temporal head of the Anglican church. This prospect has stimulated a modest revival of the centuries-old debate about whether the church should become disestablished, or separated from the state. If - when - it does, an ancient appendage of the English constitution will have fallen away. According to figures in the government's statistical annual, Social Trends, we may one day be talking of having an Established Mosque to take its place. Since 1975, the number of Moslems in Britain has more than doubled, to just less than a million. In the same period, Anglican church membership fell from 2.27m to 1.84m. The church is painfully aware of this. Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, is no disestablishmentarian. He has, however, proposed that the coronation oath be adjusted to reaffirm religious freedom for all. He was principally motivated, I suspect, by Christian ecumenism. This deserves strong support. Yet the assertion, contained in our education laws, that Britain is predominantly Christian is belied by the decline in the membership of most churches. If we cannot be certain of either the C of E or the next king, what is left? For some, the national spirit has long been bolstered by Britain's position as a principal player on the world stage. This week Mr Douglas Hurd contrived to bring us down to earth. 'Britain simply does not have the option of turning its back on the wider world,' he said. But that is not the whole story. Pluck out another sentence from the foreign secretary's speech: 'Obviously we cannot be everywhere and we cannot do everything.' And a third: 'Where we act, our action must be proportionate.' Most tellingly, Mr Hurd warned that 'We shall probably have to say 'no' more often than 'yes'.' One purpose of this important lecture was to ward off American demands that more British troops be sent to Bosnia. It was, however, more significant than that. It marked a further ratcheting-down of Britain's global reach. Our army is overstretched, and under budgetary constraint. Admitting as much, Mr Hurd pointed out that we have an excellent diplomatic service. He did not say that in dealings with other countries and international bodies the Foreign Office's quickness of tongue often disguises the slightness of its hand. This cannot go on forever. Sooner or later the UN Security Council will be reformed. When that happens, Britain will be lucky to keep its place as a permanent member. There are other possible explanations for our generally pessimistic mood. The national political pulse is not stimulated when the same political party wins four general elections in a row. The Conservatives have been through a bad five years. Things started to go wrong in 1988, when the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government was overflowing with pride. The splits over Europe, the resignations, the poll tax, the toppling of the former prime minister all followed. The Tories have never really recovered. Today a divided party is barely supporting a government with a shrunken parliamentary majority. There is no solace in looking to the opposition. It is not in any shape to inspire us, let alone win an election. As matters stand, it looks as if the existing, less than glorious government can continue in office for many more years. It is, however, a weak administration. I like this: the less power ministers command, the better. But the British psyche is conditioned to expect strong government. That means that when the cabinet decides something, it is automatically passed by the Commons. This is not happening. The combination of a low majority and a divided party has the government running scared. Some parliamentary select committees are beginning to exercise a degree of influence over the administration that they previously only dreamed of. Backbenchers' opinions are actually being solicited by ministers. To the traditional English way of thinking this is a minor revolution. It is as disturbing as all the tiresome talk about the monarchy, the church and our role in the world. I prefer to give this kaleidoscope a twist. The picture becomes brighter. Look: the monarchy is reformed. Church and state are to be disentangled. People start going to church again. Look again: we tailor our foreign policy according to our cloth. The political marketplace forces Labour to become an electable opposition. The emergence of a parliament that can check the cabinet is generally welcomed. With experience, this government improves. The economic cycle has not been abolished. Spring is on the way. The two latter propositions are undeniable. The rest are merely items on a wish-list.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning during his speech at the 24th OAS  General Assembly in Belem do Para, Brazil, Paraguayan Foreign  Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner asked the rich countries to  increase their cooperation with poor countries to fight poverty  and seek development. Addressing the other OAS foreign  ministers, the Paraguayan foreign minister also endorsed the  enhancement, development, and progress of the democratic system  in all the American countries.    Ramirez Boettner criticized the gap between rich and poor  countries, claiming that after the end of the Cold War, world  assistance funds to overcome poverty and seek development have  become increasingly scarce and inaccessible. Ramirez Boettner  emphasized: "And it is surprisingly paradoxical that, when the  new international order makes clamorous announcements of an era  of international cooperation and solidarity, there actually are  so many symptoms of a growing and fragmentary isolationism  between the rich and the poor."    Ramirez Boettner then asked for increased cooperation  between  rich and poor countries for the sake of the development and  well-being of most countries. He added that international aid  to enhance democracy and reduce poverty "has become elusive and  preconditioned."  <H5>  Democracy for All </H5>   In his message to the OAS foreign ministers' meeting,  Ramirez  Boettner deplored the fact that democracy has not reached all  American countries and that there still are exceptions. Ramirez  Boettner said: "All of us want all our American brothers to  equally join in democratic development and progress, with the  restoration of all liberties."    In order to receive more technical and financial assistance  from the "rich" countries, the foreign minister pointed out that  it is necessary for American countries to close ranks and raise  in successive meetings the hopes of the poorest countries.    In his message to the OAS General Assembly, the Paraguayan  foreign minister asked that the Inter-American System be  enhanced and strengthened.  <H5>  Will Return Tomorrow </H5>   After participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly in this  Brazilian city, Ramirez Boettner will return to our country at  1050 on 8 June. On 9 June, Ramirez Boettner will join President  Wasmosy on a visit to Montevideo, Uruguay, to dedicate the  dredging of the Martin Garcia channel.</p>

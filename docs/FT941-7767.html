			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Provisions cut helps Bradford &amp; Bingley Bradford &amp; Bingley building society, the UK's eighth largest, yesterday reported a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 91.3m to Pounds 134.3m for the year to end-December. The result was helped by a steep fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, from Pounds 81m to Pounds 43.7m, which the society said was a result of lower interest rates and a slight improvement in the housing market. However, it has also set aside about Pounds 5m against possible liabilities as a result of its 6,000 pension transfer cases. Total mortgage lending was down slightly, to Pounds 1.8bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Mr John Smith, finance director, said that reflected both the strong competition in the mortgage market, and the society's tightening of its lending criteria and refusal to carry out uneconomic lending. Despite the strong competition for retail savings, net retail savings receipts were Pounds 348m - about 16 per cent of the building societies' savings market. The percentage of wholesale funds fell from 25.6 per cent to 23.7 per cent. Income from the society's financial planning business - it is an independent financial adviser - rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 30.9m. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said the results were in line with the 'bounce-back' of the sector as a whole after the difficulties caused by the levels of bad debts in recent years. He added that the results were particularly impressive because the growth followed 'reasonable' results last year as well. Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 154m (Pounds 139.6m) and operating profits came through at Pounds 178m (Pounds 172.3m). Assets grew by 6.3 per cent from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 13.9bn. Coventry Building Society achieved a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 32.1m in the year to December 31. The advance was largely because of a fall in mortgage arrears which enabled the society to cut provisions by 60 per cent to Pounds 5.5m. The pre-tax result was after a Pounds 1.2m exceptional charge for management reorganisation. The society's assets grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 2.97bn. Pre-tax profits of the Newcastle Building Society rose by 6 per cent from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 13.9m in 1993, after a fall in provisions for loans and advances to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.13m). Total assets increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds 1.08bn).</p>

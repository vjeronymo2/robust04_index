			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Tax bill holds KBB earnings rise to Fl 87.2m A SHARPLY higher tax bill limited the increase in 1992-93 net profit at KBB, the Netherlands' largest non-food retailer, to 2.4 per cent. The company, primarily active in the Netherlands but also owner of the US toy chain FAO Schwarz, said net profit before extraordinary items rose to Fl 87.2m (Dollars 48.4m), from Fl 85.1m a year earlier. Including extraordinary items, net profit rose 26.6 per cent because the previous year's figures were depressed by a Fl 16.2m charge to reorganise Hema, one of KBB's Dutch store chains. Pre-tax operating profit rose by 9.2 per cent to Fl 150.1m.</p>

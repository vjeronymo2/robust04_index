			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Cheeky one Has prominent Budapest stockbroker Csaba von Csiky lost his shirt in the market? Sharp-eyed delegates to the Budapest gathering of the CSCE this week would have noticed von Csiky flashing an identity pass describing himself as a 'janitor' at the Hotel Kempinski. As far as Observer is aware his finances are in perfect order, but he has had a spot of bother of a different kind. For the duration of the conference, Hungarian police had ordered that no one could stay or enter the Kempinski - normally a salubrious enough pad - or any of the city's top hotels, for that matter, unless part of an official delegation, or a member of staff. It didn't matter one jot to the police that von Csiky is actually a resident at the Kempinski. He was told he had to move elsewhere. Consequently, the embarrassed hotel management found the only way it could outwit Hungary's notorious ex-communist bureaucracy was by putting von Csiky on its staff.</p>

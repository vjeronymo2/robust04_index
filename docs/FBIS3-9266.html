			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our colleague Dragoljub Stankic reports on the  reaction in Knin to the events in Zagreb:    [Begin recording] [Stankic] All information arriving via  satellite links between the government seat here and the Russian  Embassy in Zagreb are received with great attention here in  Knin. So far, there have been few reports and all that we can  say now is that the Krajina delegation landed at [Zagreb] Pleso  airport aboard an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopter at  0930. With tight security measures, they arrived at the Russian  Embassy at 1000. At the meeting with the Russian president's  special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, the head of the Krajina  delegation expressed discontent with the composition of the  Croat delegation. Namely, the Croatian side is not being led,  as was agreed, by Gojko Susak, but by Hrvoje Sarinic.    While the first results of the negotiations are awaited, let  us say that President Milan Martic is currently holding a  meeting with his closest associates. We, however, have asked  Djordje Bjegovic, chairman of the caretaker government, to say  something more for Belgrade Radio about the draft agreement that  is most probably being discussed in Zagreb. Is this a new  agreement, or is it something that has now been seen for the  first time in these regions?    [Bjegovic] First of all, I think that it is most important  to say that the good thing is that peace is being discussed.  Certainly that this first stage regarding the cease-fire and  [word indistinct] signing such a document is the most important  task, which should be regarded as a preliminary one. I think  that what we may say in this situation is that there are no  other agreements apart from corresponding modalities in a  section of the line of separation. This part of the job should  be documented with corresponding plans, that is, maps that would  certainly verify this line of separation, so that one knows what  we are talking about. The agreement, as a text, has never been a  problem. The problem lay in the deployment of forces and  certainly in the most important part of the job, the one that  ensures peace, so that the artillery can finally be moved and  thereby opportunities to shell one position from another are  removed. I think that, in this situation, this is extremely  difficult.    I think that the other aspect is most important. I think  that, as the Croatian delegation has already changed its  composition, it is impossible to expect anything to be signed in  such a situation. The most important thing to say in the present  situation is that our delegation is in Zagreb for the first  time, and I think that, in this case -- let us express it in a  sportsman's way -- we now have the white pieces [as in chess]  and I am sure that this part of our cooperativeness will be  (?appreciated) by the world.    [Stankic] One more question: The negotiations are being  held in the Russian Embassy, at the Russian initiative, and with  Vitaliy Churkin, special adviser to the Russian president,  attending. What can you tell us about the Russian role in all  this?    [Bjegovic] Well, you know, Russia [words indistinct] plays a  relevant role. I think that at this moment, their role is much  more specific than it was a year ago. The job that Russia wants  to complete is exactly of the kind that we may expect, with a  far greater level of security, to reach results, than was the  case in the past. However, I can also say in this situation  that this is not the time for us to be too optimistic. I would  be happy if the Russian representatives would now exert their  influence in an (?equality) way, that is, if they would exert  their influence in the [word indistinct] stage, which now means  the cessation of hostilities. Therefore, not partially, but  (?completely).    [Stankic] Mr. Bjegovic, thank you for this conversation. We  are going to report again when we have new information. [end  recording]</p>

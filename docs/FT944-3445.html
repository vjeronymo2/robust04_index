			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scotia licence Scotia, the UK's third biggest biotechnology company by market capitalisation, has licenced a dermatitis drug to Galderma, a company jointly owned by L'Oreal of France and Nestle of Switzerland. The deal will bring Scotia 'in excess of Pounds 3m in cash' over the next three years. The drug treats seborrhoeic dermatitis, a fungal skin disease. Galderma is already a licencee for the drug in Germany. The new deal extends that arrangement to the rest of Europe and the US. Under the terms of the agreement, Galderma will bear the cost of clinical trials needed for regulatory approval in the US.</p>

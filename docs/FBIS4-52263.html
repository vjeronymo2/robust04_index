			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Korea National Red  Cross (KNRC) urged North Korea Monday to allow exchange visits  by elderly parents with South Korea and to resume the  South-North Red Cross talks.    Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, said  in an address at a ceremony marking "World Red Cross Day" that  exchanges of hometown visits by aged parents between South and  North Korea should be realized as soon as possible.    "And the South-North Red Cross talks should be resumed at an  early date," Kang said.    The 10th main talks of the South and North Korean Red Cross  were held in December 1985. North Korea rejected the 11th  talks, urging the South to stop staging "Team Spirit," the  annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise.    An estimated 10 million people in South Korea have family  members in the North who they were forced to leave behind during  the 1950-53 Korean war.    "North Korea should keep its word, first of all that it will  return crew members of the 'Tongjin-ho,' a South Korean fishing  ship," Kang said.    Son Song-pil, chairman of the North Korean Red Cross, sent a  telephone message to the South on Jan. 21, 1987, saying the  crew of the Tongjin-ho would be returned.    The Tongjin-ho and its 12 crew members were captured by  North  Korean ships on Jan. 15, 1987, about 28 miles northwest of  Paengnyong Island in the West Sea.    Kang emphasized that to solve these problems, consultations  between the South and North should be realized as soon as  possible, urging Pyongyang to give a positive answer.    The South Korean Red Cross is studying ways to propose the  11th main talks of the South-North Red Cross after waiting for  Pyongyang's reaction.</p>

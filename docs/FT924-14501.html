			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Indian Petrochemicals planning to go public INDIAN Petrochemicals Corp (IPCL) said yesterday it is to go public on November 16, making India's largest petrochemicals company the first government-owned enterprise to invite equity participation from the public. As part of the government's phased privatisation programme, it had already divested 20 per cent of the Rs26bn (Dollars 918.7m) company, which will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange later this month. The company will offer 20m shares of Rs10 each, at a premium of Rs150 a share to raise Rs3.2bn. The sum will fund its third petrochemicals complex at Gandhar. This will reduce the government's stake to 72 per cent, and to 51 per cent after a further public offering next year. The company has projected gross profits of Rs3.9bn on turnover of Rs22.12bn for the current year, against Rs2.24bn on Rs19.35bn the year before.</p>

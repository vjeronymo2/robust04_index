			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / High-flyer alights on ScotRail: Chris Green tells James Buxton about the challenges and pitfalls of running Scotland's trains Mr Chris Green, one of British Rail's high-flyers, sometimes looks like a caged lion. Until the end of last month he was managing director of BR's flagship InterCity, a profitable, vertically integrated business with a turnover of nearly Pounds 900m a year. Now he is director of Scot-Rail, which operates passenger trains in Scotland. Its expenditure this year is likely to be only about Pounds 320m - he has direct control of only a third of it. Mr Green chose to go to Scot-Rail, which he had managed successfully in the early 1980s, when it became clear last year that his job at InterCity would disappear with the dismantling of British Rail. He makes no secret of his sadness at the break-up of InterCity or of his doubts about the wisdom of the new railway structure, which will be based on contracts between more than 50 companies. He still wants to be involved in running trains. ScotRail is one of the largest of the new train-operating companies, and the government has designated it to be one of the first to be franchised. Mr Green hopes late next year to win the franchise for a management-employee buy-out team. However, he has far fewer levers under his control than he did when he ran ScotRail in the 1980s. The company operates and maintains the trains, but track and signalling are in the hands of Railtrack. British Rail Infrastucture Services (Bris) maintains the infrastructure, while trains are leased from a state-owned company. So far the contracts are only phrased in generic terms. They will be closely defined in the coming months as the shadow franchise takes shape. The most crucial contract is with Railtrack, to which Scot-Rail is being asked to pay annual track-access charges of Pounds 175m. 'So far there is less transparency than under the old system because we don't know what we're paying for,' says Mr Green. 'But we are gradually defining our relationship with Railtrack and getting this year's bill down.' He fears that Railtrack will not vary its track-access charges to reflect fluctuations in business caused by the state of the economy. 'We need to be able to share a sudden drop in our income with Railtrack through variable track-access charges. But we are afraid that Railtrack will ignore us and press on with infrastructure projects that would be delayed under a unitary system,' he says. After payments to Railtrack, and for leasing trains and renting the big stations, only about Pounds 100m of ScotRail's costs are left directly open to Mr Green's management. That is about the same as the income ScotRail gets from fares - the rest being subsidies from the director of rail franchising and payments from Strathclyde region's passenger transport executive for running trains in the greater Glasgow area. Strathclyde is disputing the payments with Railtrack because Railtrack's charges are not itemised. Most of the Pounds 100m under Mr Green's control are staff and materials costs. He sees only limited scope for making efficiency savings. But he has hopes of boosting revenues in the medium term by stepping up the frequency of services between Edinburgh and Glasgow from every 30 minutes to every quarter of an hour, and trying to lengthen the tourist season in the Highlands. Mr Green says the attraction of ScotRail is 'the chance to focus at a level of detail that was never possible before. We will be very close to our staff, which is only 4,000 people; and we will be dramatically closer to the customer, and that will show. Staff will respond and customer service will improve. That part is going to be great fun to manage'. He tells of an incident last week when signalling and information systems on the lines outside Glasgow's Queen Street station suffered a severe power failure. Senior ScotRail executives, who previously would have dealt with the fault, could only advise Railtrack and Bris - which was frustrating. But instead they made exceptional efforts to help stranded passengers get to their destinations. 'The good news that incident tells about the new system,' says Mr Green, 'is the total focus that senior staff were able to devote to the customer. The bad news is that three lots of people were making every decision. I do worry about the complexity of what we are trying to do.'</p>

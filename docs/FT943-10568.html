			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / People: Brent man's new vocation Stephen Cuthbert, who quit a year ago as boss of Brent International, the speciality chemical maker, has emerged as director general of the Chartered Institute of Marketing. Cuthbert, 51, received over Pounds 250,000 in compensation when he stepped down from Brent last August, following growing City discontent about the performance of the company. His early career was spent with Price Waterhouse and he was finance director of Brent from 1976-80 and chief executive from 1980-93. Cuthbert has been active in the CBI and was chairman of the CBI southern regional council. Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, who is also president of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said that Cuthbert's 'strong corporate background will give the Institute further weight in its urgent task of establishing marketing at the top of every business agenda'. The former CIM chief executive, James McAinsh, has retired. He held the post from March 1992. The CIM, which has a total of 50,000 members and students, is the professional body for marketing and sales, and is particularly known for its training courses.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / NZ rebels force minimum wage Two rebel National party MPs have forced New Zealand's government to implement a minimum wage for young workers by threatening to vote with the opposition, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The government has a majority of only two. Former Finance Minister Ruth Richardson criticised the move, saying the party had capitulated for 'political expediency'. The government had argued that minimum rates for under-20s undermined their chances of a getting work. But critics claimed the young were being exploited. Young workers will now be given 60 per cent of the adult minimum wage, or NZDollars 147 (Pounds 56) a week.</p>

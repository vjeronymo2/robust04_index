			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: All go on the Eastern front Investors wanting to put money into the Far East are almost spoilt for choice at the moment. In addition to the Edinburgh New Tiger and Martin Currie Asian Opportunities fund launches mentioned last week, the Fleming Japanese investment trust is issuing conversion shares and Henry Cooke is launching an Asian unit trust. Fleming is hoping to raise at least Pounds 20m with an issue of conversion shares in its Japanese trust, which has assets of about Pounds 250m. Shares in the trust are trading at a premium of about 4 per cent to net asset value  -investors pay 4 per cent more for shares than the assets attributable to each share are worth - which indicates a high level of demand. The fund is the best performer of five in its sector over three years to January 1, but fourth out of six over one year (source: Micropal). Richard Boyton, an independent financial adviser, says the Fleming C-share issue could be the cheapest way into Japan at the moment. Rather than buying ordinary shares at a premium, buyers of the C-shares will pay only the asset value of the shares plus the administrative costs of the new issue, which will be 2 per cent or less. Investors will also get one free warrant for every five shares issued; the warrants were trading at 117p this week. Money raised from the C-share issue is kept separate from the main fund until it is at least 90 per cent invested, when the C-shares will be converted into ordinary shares. 'The Fleming Japanese investment trust is the largest investment trust specialising in Japan with an impeccable track record. Investors should not miss the opportunity of being able to buy into this fund at a cost of some 2 per cent,' Boyton says. Japanese shares have slumped since their peak in 1989 - the Nikkei index is now at less than half its peak value. A slight recovery last year was wiped out by recent political uncertainty over the coalition government and its reform programme, but some fund managers see the Tokyo market's depressed state as a good buying opportunity for those who take a positive long-term view of Japan's prospects. The Fleming public offer opens on Tuesday and closes on February 23. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,500 for existing investors in the fund and Pounds 2,500 for new investors. Annual fee is 0.5 per cent. Investors keen on the Far East but preferring to avoid Japan may be interested in the Henry Cooke Eastern Enterprise fund, the first non-European unit trust from this Manchester-based group. The fund is to be managed by Lloyd George Management in Hong Kong, which is responsible already for a range of offshore south-east Asian trusts. It will be invested for long-term capital growth throughout south-east Asia and India, with the largest amounts initially in Hong Kong (including indirect exposure to China), South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Minimum investment is Pounds 500, with a 1 per cent discount on the usual initial charge of 6 per cent between January 31 and February 11. Annual charge is 1.5 per cent. Save &amp; Prosper is the latest group to come out with a global emerging markets trust. Its Emerging Markets fund will invest mostly in Asia and Latin America, with 47 per cent and 39 per cent of the initial portfolio respectively, but there will also be about 13 per cent in European emerging markets such as Turkey, the Czech Republic and Greece, and a tiny proportion in the Middle East. The trust, aiming for long-term capital growth, will be managed by Fleming Investment Management. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 35 a month in a regular savings scheme. Charges will be 5.5 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually; but between February 5 and 25, there will be discounts on the initial charge of 1 per cent on investments of Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,999, and 2 per cent on Pounds 3,000 or more.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;518.22 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in section &sect;518.21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds are not used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

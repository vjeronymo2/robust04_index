			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / French are wooed in tourism drive THE BRITISH Tourist Authority today begins a campaign to persuade even more French visitors to cross the Channel, with the official opening in central Paris of a new UK tourist centre, Maison de la Grande Bretagne. The centre will be opened by Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary. More excitement is likely to be generated by Jane Birkin, the Paris-based British actress, who has promised to make an appearance. Food will be provided by Marks and Spencer, which has a store down the road. The centre's ground floor offers video displays and a bookshop. British Rail International has an office there, as do some ferry companies. Mr Bruce Taylor, the authority's manager in France, says the centre was set up because 86 per cent of French visitors to the UK make their travel arrangements independently rather than through travel agents. The new centre will enable them to make all their bookings at the same time. Last year 2.5m French residents made a trip to the UK, second only to the 2.7m American visitors. But the average French tourist to the UK spent only Pounds 28.10 a day last year, compared with an American tourist's average expenditure of Pounds 55.20 a day. One of the reasons is that many French visitors are students. In 1991, 24 per cent of French tourists were under 16 and more than 40 per cent were under 25. On present form 60 per cent will come back as higher-spending adults. Mr Frederic Simonet, a technology student, and Ms Anne Morvan, studying English, were at the centre last week to book a weekend in London in October. London has three attractions, they say. It is nearby, they can practise their English and the shops are different.</p>

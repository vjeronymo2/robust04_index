			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: EASTERN EUROPE ON TOUR AGENDA  </P> <P> Love Holidays, a tour operator specializing in the mature market, has changed  its name to Love Holidays/Uniworld to reflect its expanding sphere of travel to  worldwide destinations. The company formerly emphasized travel to Eastern  Europe, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> The Socialist countries of Eastern Europe should be among the most popular  destinations for mature travelers this year, due to the warming trend between  Eastern and Western governments and the controlled exchange rates in most  Socialist countries that rarely fluctuate, in contrast to the U.S. dollar.  </P> <P> For this year, Love/Uniworld is offering a series of new tours that provide a  choice of Eastern European destinations beginning in Austria and, depending on  choice of itinerary, continuing to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania,  Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Danube Cruise  </P> <P> Several of the Love/Uniworld tours combine the land portion in one or more  countries with a seven-day cruise of the Danube that can offer visits to  Belgrade and Budapest, as well as other cities on the river, depending on the  itineraries. The vessel is the comfortable Rousse, which has all outside  cabins, each with private shower and toilet.  </P> <P> Typical of the Love/Uniworld tours is the "Highlights of Eastern Europe,"  highly regarded by first-time visitors to the Socialist nations. The pace of  the 15-day itinerary is relaxed, and cities on the tour -- which begins in  Vienna -- include Brno and Prague in Czechoslovakia; Dresden and East Berlin  (crossing into West Berlin via Checkpoint Charlie); Poznan and Czestochowa,  Krakow and Warsaw in Poland, and finally, a visit to Budapest, Hungary, before  returning to Vienna for the trip home.  </P> <P> The "Highlights of Eastern Europe" tour includes round-trip air fare from West  Coast cities (via Austrian Airlines), first- and superior-class hotels, daily  breakfast, dinner each night (except in Vienna), highlight dinners in Prague,  Warsaw and Budapest, including wine and entertainment, sightseeing fees and an  experienced tour guide.  </P> <P> Land portions are by modern air-conditioned buses (no smoking permitted). The  all-inclusive price for this tour is from $2,272 to $2,427 per person,  depending on departure dates.  </P> <P> Arrangements can be made for Danube cruises only, land tours combined with  cruises on the Danube, or land tours only. All cruises begin in Vienna and  visit one or more countries in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Other Love/Uniworld tours emphasize Yugoslavia, with visits to Mostar, Sarajevo  and Dubrovnik as well as cities along the Dalmatian Coast.  </P> <P> A 23-page brochure just released by Love/Uniworld is available, listing  itineraries, hotels, departure dates and prices. The free brochure may be  obtained by calling (800) 456-5683, (213) 873-7991 or (818) 501-6868. Or write  to Love/Uniworld, 15315 Magnolia Blvd., Sherman Oaks 91403.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> If Florida's Walt Disney World and Epcot Center are in your 1989 travel plans,  a family hotel four miles from the Magic Kingdom is offering a 50% room  discount for seniors, resulting in a modest $35 a day rate for two people.  </P> <P> It's the Regency Inn, a 230-room low-rise resort set among lush tropical  gardens. The Regency has two swimming pools, one covered and heated, free  tennis courts with lights, a game room and a playground for children, and a  guest laundry. Youths under 18 in the same room are housed free; rollaway beds  are $6.  </P> <P> Seniors must be 55 or older; a driver's license or membership in any of the  major national senior organizations qualifies for the discount. Although the  50% rate is on a space-available basis, reservations at that rate are confirmed  if space is available at the time the reservation is made.  </P> <P> The Regency Inn also has a series of modestly priced packages such as the "All  in One," an eight-day, seven-night package that includes a one-day pass for  each person to Epcot, Disney World and Sea World, a choice of Busch Gardens or  Cypress Gardens for one day and a choice of three other attractions.  </P> <P> The package price is $281 per person, double occupancy. For an extra $33 you  can get a rental car for the week, with unlimited mileage.  </P> <P> For a brochure describing all of the Regency Inn packages with complete price  information, write to Regency Inn, Dept. MT, 8660 Irlo Bronson Memorial  Parkway, Kissimmee, Fla. 32741, or call toll-free (800) 327-9129.  </P></p>

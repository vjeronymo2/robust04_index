			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Mostar wounded evacuated FOURTEEN wounded patients were evacuated from a makeshift hospital in the besieged Moslem quarter of Mostar yesterday as part of a reciprocal agreement between Moslem and Croat military leaders, Reuter reports from Mostar. Spanish peacekeeping troops took the 14, mostly soldiers but including one injured woman and a child, to the nearby town of Medjugorje. The evacuation had been delayed since Saturday. From there, they set off by Bosnian army helicopter to the Moslem-held town of Zenica. Nato fighter aircraft flew over the Medjugorje area before and during the airlift, dropping flares to discourage attacks. During an airlift of Croat wounded from Nova Bila hospital in central Bosnia last week, a helicopter pilot said his aircraft had been fired on by Moslems. His claim could not be independently verified.</p>

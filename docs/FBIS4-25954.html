			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's economy is  expected to grow by about 12 percent in the first half of this  year, making it easier for the country to achieve the 9-10  percent growth in 1994, government officials said here today.    "This will be much better than expected," said officials  from  the State Economic Commission (SEC) in an exclusive interview  with XINHUA.    China's economy has been growing fast and steadily over the  past months and remains sound thanks to effective price controls  and further implementation of macro-economic regulation  measures, the officials said.    Latest statistics indicate growth of retail commodity prices  is falling and industrial production of state-owned enterprises  going up. China's inflation rate was 18.9 percent in May over  May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from the  previous month.    The added value of Chinese industries totalled 619.6 billion  yuan in the first five months this year, up 16 percent over the  same period last year.    The officials also predicted a bumper harvest of summer  crops, based on favorable weather condition and farmers' growing  enthusiasm.    Government statistics show that investment by state  enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for the first five months  this year, up 34.2 over the same period last year. The growth  rate of these investments was down nearly 30 percent, with the  number of new projects under control, and more money going into  the key national projects, the SEC officials said.    The first five months saw steady growth in government  income,  24.3 percent up over the same time last year, with the volume of  taxes collected up by 22.6 percent.    Because of more state bonds issued and more bank savings,  the  country's banks withdrew more currency from circulation in the  first five months. New bank savings in the five months amounted  to 422.4 billion yuan, and a total of 8.5 billion yuan was  withdrawn from circulation in May alone, the statistics showed.    The country's export growth outpaced the import growth,  according to governmental figures. In the first five months,  China's imports were 18.1 percent higher than in the same period  last year, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent. The trade  deficit in this period was down to 1.79 billion U.S. dollars.    The SEC officials called for continued efforts to rein in  price rises, implement the macro-economic control measures, and  maintain the balance of overall supply and demand.    They also warned that more attention should be paid to the  rising gap between sales and industrial production, to promote  the efficiency of industrial production. The proportion of  output sold in this period was 92.38 percent of production -- a  ratio of 1.75 percentage points lower than in the same period  last year.    The SEC believes that with such healthy trends continuing  and  the above problems solved, the planned 9-10 percent annual  growth rate for the national economy is beyond doubt.</p>

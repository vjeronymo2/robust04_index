			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Sultan, member of the Palestinian </F> Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, by Kawthar  Salam; place and date not given]    [Text] Q: What is your evaluation of the current economic  situation in the occupied territories today?    A: The economic situation is very difficult and  embarrassing. The circumstances in which we are now, with the  closure of the occupied territories, the curfews, the inability  of people to commute or reach Jerusalem, and the prohibition of  laborers to reach their places of work in Israel, have paralyzed  the whole situation in a way never seen before in our area.  Shops have closed and factories are empty, becoming a burden to  their owners. The people have become a consumer society using  their savings if they have any.    The loss to our economy is between $6-7 million daily, not  to  mention the mental stress through which the people are going.    Q: What about the economic loss in Hebron?    A: The situation in Hebron is a little different, and the  losses there are worse than in all other parts of the occupied  territories combined. The daily losses in Hebron alone, during  the closure, have been $2 million, and the overall effect is  very visible.    Q: What are the necessary requirements to develop the  Palestinian economy in the next stage?    A: The requirements could be summarized in the following  points:    1. Political and social stability. Giving the people the  freedom to make their own choices politically and economically.  This is one of the most important elements for the development  of the Palestinian economic situation. When they are given the  freedom to choose, then more doors are open to them, and they  have the opportunity to develop economically.    2. Organizing the infrastructure of the Palestinian  authority and its public and primary institutions so that it  will be ready to operate.    3. Determining the legal framework and required legislation  for the economic and social activities that will give  Palestinians the opportunity to lay down social and economic  laws that are required for economic development.    4. Continuing the development of human and natural resources  to provide an effective basis for economic activities, which  includes raising the standards of the Palestinian individuals in  all domains, knowing that the availability of human resources is  very important.    5. Concentrating on the financial infrastructure for the  Palestinian economy, as well as the social infrastructure, and  limiting priorities, such as correction of the health situation,  water networks, sewage systems, roads, modes of transportation  and power networks.    Setting up a strong industrial base in the West Bank and  Gaza  Strip, which includes support for the already existing  industries, and at the same time, develop new industries.    Expanding housing developments to absorb the growing  population and those returning from the diaspora.    Encouraging the export sector and finding the necessary  support services for that sector.    Expanding and developing the agriculture sector including  the  livestock sector.    Developing the Palestinian countryside, which in turn will  create jobs for the unemployed as well as providing educational,  health and entertainment services, so that the countryside will  start attracting people.    Organizing the financial sector to serve those investing in  the economy through different institutions.    6. Strengthening Palestinian economic ties with the other  Arab countries and the world, and opening new markets in order  to promote and sell various Palestinian goods.    7. Using natural resources to the maximum.    It is also important to let all Palestinians, inside and  outside the occupied territories, invest in the infrastructure  and facilitate the opportunities for those abroad, in terms of  tax reductions and so on.    Q: How do we achieve Palestinian economic independence in  the transitional period?    A: There is a Palestinian plan for development until the  year 2000. If implemented according to all economic principles,  it will be a good start for an independent Palestinian economy.  I think that in the absence of occupation and with the presence  of a Palestinian authority, economic independence from the  Israelis will follow. It will give the Palestinians the  opportunity to develop and take charge of themselves.    Q: Do you see any dangers facing the Palestinian economy in  terms of the funding which has been pledged by various  institutions and countries?    A: There are studies which deal with the needs of the  Palestinian economy, the most important of which are the ones  done by the World Bank and the Palestinian plan for development  until the year 2000. This plan will take an estimated $12  billion.    There are promises from the World Bank and some countries to  support the latter plan depending on its priorities. Several  agreements were signed in regards to it.    Some EC countries have also shown their willingness to  support certain projects. Some of the support will be in the  form of grants and some in the form of loans without any strings  attached. If used correctly, this money will aid in building  the economy.</p>

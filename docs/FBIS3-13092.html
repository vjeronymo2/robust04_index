Vogel in Tunis: "'Arafat Increasingly </F> Under Pressure From PLO Grass Roots"]    [Text] When PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat convened a meeting  of the PLO Executive Committee after the massacre in Hebron,  only eight of 18 members came to Tunis. From Amman Sulayman  al-Najab, secretary general of the formerly communist  "Palestinian People's Party," let it be known that the Executive  Committee had "not achieved a quorum" and was incapable of  coming to a decision.    Previously, al-Najab had been one of the advocates of the  Oslo agreement, even though he was not one of the closest  friends of 'Arafat's, whose leadership style he increasingly  disapproved of. He finally distanced himself from 'Arafat when  the PLO chairman initialed an interim agreement with Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 10 February. The  formula, which 'Arafat agreed to at that time -- special  protection of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, in  return for Israeli-Palestinian control of the border-checkpoints  between Jericho and Jordan as well as Gaza and Egypt -- "means a  new prison for Palestinians," al-Najab told DER STANDARD.    However, 'Arafat has not just lost followers. Some of his  former critics have jointed him in these difficult days. One of  them is "Foreign Minister" Faruq Qaddumi. In December he had  listed the weaknesses of the Oslo agreement. Now he fully  supports his chief.    Marwan Kanathani, 'Arafat's press spokesman, says that there  is a certain temptation for his boss to stop the negotiations:  "If 'Arafat were to say that this entire damned process is  over, he would become absolutely the most popular person among  the Arabs again." And "if 'Arafat were to feel that he is  losing control over the PLO leadership and the Palestinian  people, he will do everything to remain in power. This includes  a freezing of the peace process."</p>

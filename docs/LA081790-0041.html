			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ANTIHISTAMINE EFFECTS  </P> <P> Question: Everyone seems to know that antihistamines can cause a person to  become drowsy. I know that whenever a doctor has told me to use an  antihistamine, I'm usually warned not to drive and not to work around  machinery.  </P> <P> But aside from drowsiness, are there other side effects?  </P> <P> Answer: Some elderly individuals who take antihistamines may experience a  degree of confusion. In addition, antihistamines may increase the effects of  alcohol.  </P> <P> Q: I know that there's no cure for a cold, but would you have any suggestions  about how to relieve the sore throat that comes with it? I find that that's the  worst part of a cold.  </P> <P> A: There are a number of over-the-counter preparations that can ease the  discomfort of a sore throat, including a variety of pain relievers. It might  help if you would increase your intake of liquids and gargle with warm salt  water. A humidifier might also relieve symptoms.  </P></p>

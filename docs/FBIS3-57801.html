			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Home Front Support Needed in Brussels"] </F>   [Text] The phase that was considered right from the start  to be the most difficult of all, the negotiations on the status  of our farm sector in the European Union (EU), is just now  beginning in Finland's negotiations with the EU. Finland's  negotiating tactic has been to waste as little gunpowder as  possible on the easier issues so that there would be enough of a  charge left to defend interests of national importance to us in  the farm sector and rural policy.    This in itself also problematic negotiating tactic and the  order in which issues are being dealt with seem to have produced  the false impression on some people that Finland's negotiations  are progressing too well and that we are not defending our  interests in Brussels as determinedly as the other countries  engaged in negotiations. But then they forget that for Sweden,  for example, agriculture is not a particularly problematic  negotiating issue. Sweden is probably closer to the conclusion  of negotiations than Finland, even though superficially this  does not yet seem to be the case.    The starting shot for the negotiations on agriculture will,  in a manner of speaking, be fired tomorrow, when the EU  Commission for the first time officially assumes a position on  Finland's goals for its farm sector. According to preliminary  reports on the preparations being made by EU officials that have  leaked out, the Commission is adopting a very negative position  on our goals for agriculture, especially the transitional  periods and a regional subsidies for South Finland's farmers.    Since the Commission's position is to be made public very  soon, the wisest thing for politicians to do would be to wait  for it, not to go ahead and jump to all sorts of conclusions on  the basis of reports and conjectures that are still inaccurate  anyway. Unfortunately, many politicians, from the foreign  minister to the presidential candidates, have hastened to make  rash statements about one another and Finland's prospects in the  negotiations. A broad consensus seems to be in jeopardy just  when it is most sorely, in fact really needed for the first time.    Hardly anyone assumes that Finland's grandiose goals for  agriculture could be accepted as they stand. They are certainly  acceptable as a starting point for negotiations. The status of  agriculture affects national interests that are felt to be  important. This will by no means be a pushover for Finland. In a  speech he delivered in Strasbourg last week, President Mauno  Koivisto uncompromisingly nailed down interests of vital  importance to Finland.    According to Koivisto, the transitional periods and the EC's  present forms of support alone are not enough for Finland. The  Community must also adapt the goals of its own agriculture  policy to the special conditions prevailing in Finland, not just  the opposite. This means, for example, new forms of support  within the compass of which there will also be room for South  Finland's grain farmers. It is impossible to agree to equating  them with Central European farmers. Presumably, this will also  be understood in Brussels. It would be even better understood if  we were a bit more patient on the home front until the final  positions are settled on.</p>

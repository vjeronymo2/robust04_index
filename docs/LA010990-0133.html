			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> News item: NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz calls for sweeping changes.  Reaction: OK, for a sweeping change, how about passing legislation that truly  benefits the student-athletes? . . .  </P> <P> For instance, let them share some of the revenue the schools collect from their  huge basketball tournament and bowl-game television contracts. . . .  </P> <P> The Rams actually had a 2-1 edge over San Francisco in 1989. They won an  exhibition game in Tokyo. . . .  </P> <P> Every time I watch a coin toss before overtime, I'm reminded of Abner Haynes'  goof in the 1962 AFL championship game. Haynes, the Dallas Texans' captain, won  the toss but mistakenly chose to defend a goal, and his team wound up kicking  into the wind against the Houston Oilers. . . .  </P> <P> Fortunately for Haynes, the Texans won, 20-17, in a second overtime period. . .  .  </P> <P> The pros should follow college football's lead and make pass interference a  15-yard penalty instead of spot-of-the-foul. . . .  </P> <P> Whatever happened to the Three Amigos? . . .  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard will do a fine job as general manager of the San Diego Chargers  if owner Alex Spanos allows him to. . . .  </P> <P> It's no surprise that the majority of NCAA I-A football coaches don't want a  national championship tournament. A win in a bowl game satisfies the alumni a  lot more than a loss in a playoff game would. . . .  </P> <P> Bo Schembechler's switch from football to baseball isn't unique. Among others,  Jim Finks was president of the Chicago Cubs, and Stu Holcomb was general  manager of the Chicago White Sox. . . .  </P> <P> Bill Curry, who had enough of the pressure, decided to leave Alabama long  before the Sugar Bowl. . . .  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith plans to meet with linebacker Junior Seau and safety Mark  Carrier this week. Both have a year of eligibility remaining but could opt for  the NFL draft. . . .  </P> <P> Appearing on Prime Ticket's "It's Your Call," Darryl Strawberry again sounded  as though he wants to play for the Dodgers when he becomes a free agent after  this season. . . .  </P> <P> It's not always like father, like son. Jack Nicklaus Jr. was among those who  missed the cut at the qualifying school for the Ben Hogan Tour. . . .  </P> <P> How meaningful are college basketball polls? The last wire-service national  champion to win the NCAA tournament was North Carolina in 1982. . . .  </P> <P> We'll know a lot more about UCLA after its Saturday afternoon game against  Arizona at Pauley Pavilion. . . .  </P> <P> Watch out for Colorado State, where Boyd Grant is doing the same kind of  coaching job he did at Fresno State. . . .  </P> <P> George Raveling could get the first home sellout of his USC career Saturday  afternoon. The game against Arizona State will be played in 2,200-seat Lyon  Center on campus. . . .  </P> <P> It is to the credit of Jerry West that the Lakers, who have drafted low for  many years, are one of the deepest teams in the NBA. . . .  </P> <P> The old Clippers would have folded if they trailed the Knicks, 22-9, in the  first quarter at Madison Square Garden. But Don Casey's kids fought back  Sunday, took New York into overtime and lost only after what looked like a  goaltending violation by Patrick Ewing. . . .  </P> <P> Dick Enberg's legacy will be, "Oh, my!" . . .  </P> <P> Rhythm won the Eclipse Award for 2-year-olds because he beat Grand Canyon in  their only head-to-head meeting, but this wasn't really comparable to the  Miami-Notre Dame situation because Grand Canyon accomplished a lot more the  rest of the year. . . .  </P> <P> Dan Kenny, part-owner of Sunny Blossom, the Santa Anita six-furlong  record-holder, disputes our claim that an extremely fast track was responsible  for his colt's 1:07 1/5 time and points out that he ran a 1:07 2/5 last year en  route to a 6 1/2-furlong victory. . . .  </P> <P> KFOX radio sports-talk host Bud Furillo suggested to George Allen on Thursday  that he hire Pro Football Hall of Famer Willie Brown as an assistant coach at  Cal State Long Beach. Allen did on Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Furillo's next suggestion for a spot on Allen's staff is former Banning High  coach Chris Ferragamo. . . .  </P> <P> On ESPN's "Sports Reporters" Sunday, Howard Cosell showed that he hasn't  changed. . . .  </P> <P> The Angels still may be a trade away from serious contention in baseball's  toughest division, the American League West. . . .  </P> <P> New Dodger relief pitcher Jim Gott said club publicist Mike Williams, a  teammate on San Marino High's championship team of 1977, is the best shortstop  he has ever played with. Jim was either joking or forgetting about his former  Toronto teammate, Tony Fernandez. . . .  </P> <P> Maury Wills, the base stealer who merely revolutionized the game of baseball,  again will be slighted when the Hall of Fame balloting is announced tonight.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado yesterday  condemned the threats made by self-styled "revolutionary"  groups, saying they are more likely the product of sick minds  that want to maintain unrest in our country.    "It is condemnable that at this time there are sick minds  that use anonymous statements to spread terror and generate  unrest," Defense Minister Gen. Corado said yesterday, referring  to an anonymous statement that purports to be a "communique by  the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front," which has circulated in San  Salvador. The statement includes deaths threats against several  members of the cabinet and people from democratic sectors under  the pretext that "if something happens to the people threatened  by the `Domingo Monterrosa Command,'" they will take reprisals.    Gen. Corado said no one has proven the existence of the  so-called Monterrosa Command, which is most certainly a ruse by  the same leftist groups, just as it happened with the so-called  Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez Brigade. It is most likely that  they, the so-called "radical left," want to get rid of certain  people and are grandly "condemning them to death" to then  "execute them and take reprisals." Leftists of the Mao Zedong  line invented this tactic. The official said anonymous groups  are trying to besmirch the name of Colonel Monterrosa, who is  regarded as a national hero.    "As soldiers living in a time of peace, we must condemn all  violence promoted by any sector, regardless of its affiliation,"  he stressed.    To declare this or that place "a military objective" will  only generate distrust and make life impossible for a government  that is struggling to maintain peace," Minister Corado said.  [no opening quotation mark as published]    "We as soldiers regret that there are still some sick minds  circulating these kinds of anonymous statements," the ranking  officer said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman granted an  interview in the Presidential Palace in Zagreb this evening to a  group of U.S. journalists from the newspapers TIME, the LOS  ANGELES TIMES, and THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES in which he spoke about  the Washington agreement, the policy pursued by the Croatian  leadership aimed at reintegrating UN protected areas [UNPA] into  the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia  in a peaceful way, normalization of relations between Croatia  and Serbia, and the new UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate  in the Republic of Croatia.    The resolution that the UN Security Council is about to  adopt  will emphasize the political standpoint about the recognition of  borders of the Republic of Croatia and Croatia's territorial  integrity. The resolution will extend the UNPROFOR mandate by  six months, not by 12 months as proposed by UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali. According to the resolution, UNPROFOR will have  the right to seek air support if prevented in the implementation  of its tasks, President Tudjman said in reply to the question of  what Croatia expects from the new UN Security Council resolution.    President Tudjman then went on to say that in a political  sense Croatia could be completely satisfied with the resolution,  although, he added, the UNPROFOR mandate, due to the lack of  funds and forces, was not as operational as Croatia would like  it to be. President Tudjman stated that for its policy Croatia  had guarantees by the United States and other international  players. He informed the U.S. journalists that Croatia had  requested from the United Nations and the Security Council that  UNPROFOR control the borders between Croatia and Serbia and  Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent the arming of  the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and in the UNPA in Croatia. We  also demanded the reopening of roads and the oil pipeline and  the return of around 400,000 refugees to their homes.    Asked whether an agreement on a cease-fire and on the  resolution of the issue of the Serbs living in the occupied  areas in the Republic of Croatia would be reached in  negotiations being held in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb,  President Tudjman, laying an emphasis on the current  international situation, said that the Serbs from Knin, under  the current international circumstances, would agree with the  peaceful solution. If they failed to accept that, Croatia would  then, in line with UN resolutions, be able to resort to other  means and in that it would enjoy the support of international  factors. I hold that we shall be able to reintegrate these  areas into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic  of Croatia in a peaceful way, the Croatian president stressed.    President Tudjman said that the problem of the UNPA's was  the  main precondition for the normalization. He said that relations  could not be normalized as long as Serbia maintained its  occupation of Croatian areas. Tudjman stressed that despite the  fact that the Serbian and Yugoslav Governments, under  international pressure, accepted that the time was ripe for the  normalization of relations, resolute political moves were  lacking and extreme Serb war-mongers were still active.    After this, President Tudjman replied to questions in  connection with the solution of the crisis in Bosnia. Asked if a  possible confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia  could be linked with the solution for the UNPA's, President  Tudjman said that these issues could not be linked as Serbs were  one of the three constituent nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  Serbs in Croatia were a national minority that do not have a  right to self-determination in accordance with international  standards. President Tudjman said that the UNPAs have always  been an integral part of the Republic of Croatia.    In reply to a question about Croatia's policy towards  Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman repeated Croatian  positions to the U.S. journalists. These positions were first  demonstrated by Bosnian Croat votes at the referendum on an  independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, then by the support for a  proposal to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into provinces, and it  should also be stressed that Croatia was the first state to have  recognized the independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia's policy  has always taken into account the overall interests of the Croat  nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Tudjman said and  stressed that the Washington agreement would not have been  possible if the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna that protected  the interests of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina had not existed.</p>

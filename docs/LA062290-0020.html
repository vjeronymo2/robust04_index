			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUSANDS OF IRANIANS DIE IN MASSIVE QUAKE;  </P> <P> DISASTER: ENTIRE VILLAGES ARE DESTROYED. THE SEARCH FOR VICTIMS TRAPPED IN  RUBBLE IS SLOWED BY BAD WEATHER AND LANDSLIDES. U.S. OFFERS ASSISTANCE.  </P> <P> More than 10,000 people died in the massive earthquake that rocked northern  provinces early Thursday, severely damaging several cities and leveling scores  of villages, Iran's Cabinet announced in Tehran.  </P> <P> But some Iranian officials put the toll even higher, at 25,000 dead and tens of  thousands injured. Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi,  said in New York that officials at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran gave him  those numbers.  </P> <P> "We estimate the number will be increased" as more bodies are uncovered, he  said.  </P> <P> The Cabinet, after an emergency session, issued a statement saying that a "sad,  painful and horrible tragedy has so far claimed 10,000 lives and left thousands  of others wounded," according to a broadcast by the official Islamic Republic  News Agency (IRNA) monitored here.  </P> <P> The agency said the Cabinet placed all government organizations "on full alert"  and ordered that an air bridge be established between Tehran and the affected  areas to take out survivors.  </P> <P> Rescue missions trying to reach the disaster area by road were being delayed by  landslides, it reported. Bad weather was said to be hindering air operations.  </P> <P> The news agency added that some relief teams, including several hundred  Revolutionary Guards, had reached the scene and were searching flattened homes  for trapped victims while others cared for the injured.  </P> <P> Casualty figures were rising from hour to hour in the two hardest-hit  provinces, Zanjan and Gilan, which are situated northwest of Tehran in a  mountainous, agricultural area on the Caspian Sea. More than 2.7 million people  live there.  </P> <P> "The big problem now is to reach some rural areas," an official of Iran's Red  Crescent Society told Reuters, the British news agency, in Tehran. "We know  some of the villages have been destroyed 90% or even 100%."  </P> <P> With the physical obstacles and the understandable confusion in the region, it  was impossible to vouch for the reliability of the death tolls announced by the  Cabinet or reported by the unnamed officials at the Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> The official news agency did keep broadcasting revised lists of villages, towns  and cities worst-hit by the temblor but offered no explanation of how  information was being collected to assemble the casualty numbers being  reported.  </P> <P> In Washington, a State Department spokesman said Iran has contacted the U.N.  Disaster Relief Office. The United States has already offered assistance, as  have Britain, France, Switzerland, the European Community and Japan.  </P> <P> "We are saddened by the damage and the loss of life," said White House Press  Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who reported that President Bush has sent a message  of condolence to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Since the United States  and Iran have no diplomatic relations, it was delivered through the Swiss  Embassy, which looks after U.S. interests in Iran.  </P> <P> At the Geophysics Center of Tehran University, the quake was measured at  magnitude 7.3, but the U.S. Geological Survey at Golden, Colo., put the  intensity at 7.7. It placed the quake's center at a point in the Caspian about  15 miles off the Iranian coast. The Geophysics Center also recorded a series of  aftershocks, including one almost 12 hours later of magnitude 6.5.  </P> <P> The main quake occurred just after midnight, sending residents in the capital,  125 miles from its center, scrambling into the streets.  </P> <P> Iran Television, also monitored here, showed grim scenes of relief workers  removing broken bodies from the rubble of shattered buildings and placing them  on stretchers. Heavy equipment was already on the scene in some areas, clearing  away debris. Stunned women in black chadors stood outside crumpled homes and  public buildings.  </P> <P> Mountains of rubble were shown in the village of Ab-Dar, and a narrator said  these were all that was left of apartment buildings. They appeared to have been  shaken off their foundations, collapsing like playing cards.  </P> <P> Primary roads were blocked by landslides, and a dam burst near Rasht, the Gilan  provincial capital, where relief headquarters have been established. Much of  the area was flooded around Rasht, which is situated on the Caspian Sea. At  least 20 deaths were reported there, and dozens of rescue vehicles, including  trucks carrying food supplies and ambulances, have been unable to get through.  </P> <P> Helicopter pilots taking part in rescue operations told IRNA that "no point  between Rasht and Loushan 80 miles to the south has been spared by the  disaster."  </P> <P> Late reports said the most severe damage occurred in Zanjan, where at least  1,600 fatalities were recorded in more than 70 villages. About 1,000 of these  were at Ab-Dar, where every house was destroyed, according to IRNA. In Qazvin,  an industrial city and the largest in the province, the death toll was put at  768.  </P> <P> Seventy percent of the buildings in the towns of Manjil, Loushan, Roudbar,  Bouin and Tarom-e Oleya were reported heavily damaged.  </P> <P> The national airline, Iran Air, flew relief supplies into the region and  returned carrying casualties, using three U.S.-made C-130 cargo planes and a  number of helicopters. Many of the injured were taken to hospitals in Tehran.  </P> <P> Thousands of tents and blankets were flown in, along with rice, tea, sugar,  cheese and canned foods, IRNA said. The Red Crescent Society and hospitals  appealed for blood, blankets and powdered milk.  </P> <P> Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that buildings swayed in Baku,  the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan, 160 miles north of the center. Tass said  there were no casualties but some minor damage.  </P> <P> President Rafsanjani declared three days of official mourning and ordered every  agency of the state to be prepared to take part in the relief effort. Then he  and the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite Muslim spiritual leader, flew to  the area to supervise relief operations.  </P> <P> Khamenei was quoted as saying that the earthquake was a "divine test."  </P> <P> "The bereaved and other people," he said, "should pass this test with pride  through their patience, endeavor, cooperation and assistance."  </P> <P> IRNA said many Iranians were awake when the temblor occurred, watching the  telecast of a World Cup soccer match in Italy. Some windows were broken in  Tehran, and many people ran into the streets, but no major damage was reported  there.  </P> <P> The quake was Iran's most severe since September of 1978, when one measuring  7.7 shook the eastern desert region and caused about 25,000 fatalities. Soviet  Armenia was hit by a quake in December of 1988; it measured 6.9 and also caused  about 25,000 deaths.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WORST EARTHQUAKES SINCE 1975  </P> <P> Date: Dec. 1988  </P> <P> Location: Soviet Armenia  </P> <P> Magnitude: 6.9  </P> <P> Death toll: 25,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Sept. 1985  </P> <P> Location: Mexico  </P> <P> Magnitude: 8.1  </P> <P> Death toll: 9,500  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Oct. 1983  </P> <P> Location: Turkey  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.1  </P> <P> Death toll: 1,300  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Dec. 1982  </P> <P> Location: Yemen  </P> <P> Magnitude: 6.0  </P> <P> Death toll: 2,800  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Nov. 1980  </P> <P> Location: Italy  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.2  </P> <P> Death toll: 4,800  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Oct. 1980  </P> <P> Location: Algeria  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.3  </P> <P> Death toll: 4,500  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Sept. 1978  </P> <P> Location: Iran  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.7  </P> <P> Death toll: 25,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: March 1977  </P> <P> Location: Romania  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.5  </P> <P> Death toll: 1,541  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Nov. 1976  </P> <P> Location: Eastern Turkey  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.9  </P> <P> Death toll: 4,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: August 1976  </P> <P> Location: Philippines  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.8  </P> <P> Death toll: 8,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: July 1976  </P> <P> Location: Tangshan, China  </P> <P> Magnitude: 8.2  </P> <P> Death toll: 242,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Feb. 1976  </P> <P> Location: Guatemala  </P> <P> Magnitude: 7.5  </P> <P> Death toll: 22,778  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Sept. 1975  </P> <P> Location: Turkey  </P> <P> Magnitude: 6.8  </P> <P> Death toll: 2,312  </P></p>

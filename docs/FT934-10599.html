			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rhino pays Pounds 12.5m for Virgin Games Stores RHINO GROUP, the fast-growing computer and video games retailer, is paying Pounds 12.5m in cash to acquire Virgin Games Stores, the joint venture UK retailer owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and WH Smith. The purchase, which includes Pounds 3.5m for the stock, will be funded by Rhino through a 5-for-9 rights issue priced at 44p a share to raise Pounds 12.4m net. The deal will combine the two biggest specialist computer and video games store chains in the UK. Rhino already has 34 stores, trading as Future Zone, while Virgin Games Stores has 29 in the UK and one in the Irish Republic. In the year to May 31 the Virgin operations, which had net assets of Pounds 4.3m, generated Pounds 2m in profits before central overheads on turnover of Pounds 24.3m. The deal will enable the USM-quoted Rhino Group, launched 13 months ago when Mr Bev Ripley and Mr Terry Norris - former directors of Cityvision, the Ritz video hire shops operator - took control of JMD Group, to accelerate its own development plans which set a target of 130 stores in three years. The purchase and the rights issue, which is fully underwritten by Panmure Gordon, are subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary meeting on November 19. Dealings in Rhino's shares, which were suspended on Tuesday at 58 1/4 p pending the announcement, are expected to recommence on November 22. Mr Ripley, Rhino's chairman, said yesterday that the two operations were 'a near perfect fit' and would enable Rhino to have 75 specialist computer games stores operating in the important pre-Christmas trading period. The deal will also allow the Virgin Retail division to concentrate on building the Virgin Megastore multi-product retail chain. Virgin's 21 existing Megastores already sell computer games in addition to music and videos.</p>

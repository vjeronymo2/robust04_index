			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lebanon's Hizballah revolutionary movement  expressed concern over a recent decision taken by that country's  government to ban the broadcast of news and political programs  by a number of private radio and television transmitters  throughout Lebanon.    On the basis of a Central News Unit report from Beirut, a  statement issued by Hizballah today states: The decision of the  Lebanese Government contradicts the most basic social rights and  freedom of speech. In respect of the critical situation that  Lebanon is facing -- due to the Zionist regime's aggressions --  it is essential to safeguard national achievements, particularly  the freedom of speech and the press.    In another part of the statement, Hizballah supports the  government of Lebanon's decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces  Party [LFP] which is accused of involvement in recent bombings.</p>

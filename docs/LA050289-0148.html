			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POSTAL SERVICE REVENUES RUN SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS, POSTMASTER GENERAL SAYS  </P> <P> The Postal Service is facing a financial crunch, with revenues running short of  what was expected following last year's rate increase, Postmaster General  Anthony M. Frank said today.  </P> <P> The mail service still expects to finish this fiscal year in the black, but  with a significantly smaller margin than had been planned, officials said.  </P> <P> Frank told the agency's governing board that changes must be made to hold down  costs and improve revenues.  </P> <P> So far in the fiscal year, which began in October, the Postal Service took in  $18.5 billion and spent $17.6 billion, leaving net revenues of $847 million,  reported Senior Assistant Postmaster General Comer S. Coppie.  </P> <P> That was $104 million less than expected in the wake of the postal rate  increase that took effect in April, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Mailers Switched  </P> <P> Because it is required by law to break even over the long run, the Postal  Service counts on showing a surplus in the period right after a rate hike, in  order to balance losses which will occur as its costs rise.  </P> <P> Lately, rate hikes have come every three years, and Frank has said he hopes to  maintain that cycle, with the next increase in 1991.  </P> <P> Income has been less than expected because of changes in the "mix" of mail,  Coppie said. In other words, many large mailers have switched from more costly  first-class mail to the pre-sorted first or third class, which costs them less  and brings in less revenue for the post office.  </P> <P> While managers expected some of this switch, it has occurred faster than they  expected with the resulting decline in revenue, Coppie said.  </P> <P> At the same time, continuing efforts to cut costs have not been as successful  as had been hoped for, he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressing Automation  </P> <P> Frank told the postal Board of Governors that he is continuing to press forward  with automation of the postal system as a means of cutting costs and speeding  delivery.  </P> <P> Also, he said, he is trying to improve employee relations and is looking for  ways to broaden product lines and make prices more competitive.  </P> <P> The Postal Service cannot change its domestic rates without seeking approval  from the independent Postal Rate Commission.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] When interviewed recently at the Sino-U.S. symposium  on antidumping issues, Zhang Yuqing, a division chief of the  Treaty and Law Department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], pointed out: Accusing China  of dumping is apparently unfair. Because China's raw materials  and labor are inexpensive, the costs of its export goods are  accordingly low. Chief Zhang Yuqing also disclosed that the  practice of certain foreign-trade businesses which compete to  sell goods by cutting prices have seriously hurt the overall  interests and [word indistinct] of China's exports. Here is a  report filed yesterday by station reporter Ji Yuping:    [Begin recording] [Ji] The market economy is an economy  based  on the law. While this seems easy to understand, it is not so  simple in practice. Zhang Yuqing, an official of the MOFTEC's  Treaty and Law Department, maintains that many Chinese export  businesses, in knowing very little about the trade laws of  European countries and the United States, have been selling  their goods by cutting prices unrealistically. When they are  fined, they still do not know what they have done wrong.    [Zhang] Many factories and trade companies do not know that  dumping is not permitted abroad. They do not understand why it  is wrong to sell their goods very cheaply. They ask: Is it a  mistake to sell our goods cheaply and that shoppers have  benefited from low prices? They do not know that this is wrong.  While the importing countries cannot stop our increasing  exports, all they can do is label it as dumping and fight it  accordingly.    [Ji] Most of the countries in the West are GATT members.  According to GATT regulations, GATT members cannot control  imports by increasing tariffs or the amount of required  licenses, but they are allowed to fight dumping. According to  statistics, in 1993 there were 37 cases in which foreign  countries accused China of dumping. A large percentage of such  goods are machinery, electronics goods, and textile products --  sectors which China has given priority to developing.  Antidumping has seriously affected the growth of Chinese  exports. According to Zhang Yuqing, when Chinese businesses in  U.S. and European markets are accused of dumping, they often do  not know what to do. Instead of contesting the charge, some  simply withdraw from the markets. More often than not,  antidumping accusations have side effects. They often hurt  other Chinese businesses which operate according to regulations.    [Zhang] Ordinarily when we deal with an international trade  dispute, we follow the rule that whoever violates the contract  should bear the responsibilities. Rules for combating dumping  are not identical. For example, once we have been accused of  selling cups at dumping prices, other exporters which have never  exported any cups will still be subjected to antidumping tariffs  for many years when they want to export cups.    [Ji] In other words, when one business sells products  inexpensively, it will also hurt many other exporters. In  short, Chinese enterprises, both large and small, have very  little understanding of European countries' and U.S. antidumping  laws. It has been reported that once a Chinese business has  been accused of dumping its goods in the United States, Japan  and EC countries will also resort to the same sanctions  measures, and the markets for Chinese exports thus will become  smaller. MOFTEC data shows that some countries have time and  again investigated whether China was dumping its traditional  goods -- such as silicon carbide, bicycles, shoes -- in those  countries; that antidumping tariffs have been imposed on these  products; and that certain markets for China's export goods have  been lost.    The MOFTEC official maintains that antidumping will become a  major international trade issue in the future and that Chinese  exporting businesses must do several things. First, they must  thoroughly study relevant international regulations and rules.  Second, they must stop competing between themselves by cutting  prices. Third, they must export goods of a higher grade and  better quality -- goods that they can sell profitably. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican </F> cooperation and interethnic relations in the government of the  Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and vice president of the  Croatian Democratic Community of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Ivan  Sabic; place and date not given: "Talks Are Running Quite  Successfully"]    [Text] Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican  cooperation and interethnic relations in the government of the  Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and vice president of the  Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is  quite an interesting person to interview at present because he  is one of the participants in the Croatian-Bosniak negotiations  on the implementation of the federal constitution, which,  despite initial optimism, are not proceeding at the planned  pace. Hence our first question.    [Sabic] Is the Washington Agreement perhaps being sabotaged?    [Akmadzic] It is obvious that we will not be able to meet  all the envisaged deadlines, but I do not think that the  Washington Agreement is being sabotaged. There are simply still  too large differences in the views on some issues and we need  time to bring these views closer.    [Sabic] Why has the Bosniak side persisted with the  nomination of Alija Izetbegovic, even after the Croatian side  made a major concession by withdrawing the nomination of Mr.  Zubak?    [Akmadzic] The Bosniaks hold the view that because their  people have experienced the greatest suffering, they have the  moral right to have their man as the head of the federation  first. They claim that Mr. Izetbegovic enjoy enormous trust  among his people, while our argument is that his second term of  office had already expired in 1992 and that, according to the  rotation system, it is now the turn of a Croat, and that since  the setting up of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1974,  the Croats have held this post for only three years. In our  view. Mr. Izetbegovic also bears certain political  responsibility for the people's lack of readiness to defend  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I nevertheless believe that reason will  prevail, that both sides will still think it over and that we  will reach an agreement.  <H5>  We Need To Create a Climate of Trust </H5>   [Sabic] Nevertheless, some things appear to have been agreed  on successfully.    [Akmadzic] The talks are actually running quite  successfully. We have achieved peace, people are moving freely,  we have reached a very important agreement of the government of  the future federation, on the ministries and departments that  will work for the government. We have also reached agreements on  regulating imports and exports, the transit of goods within the  federation, setting up of telecommunication links, and the  supply of electric power. Prisoners have been exchanged. True,  there are still a number of misunderstandings, but these are  gradually being eliminated. We have agreed on the pace of  return of the refugees and the evicted and displaced persons.  The election of the leading people of the federation is the key  issue, because it encroaches directly on the equality of the  peoples. However, I think that it is more important at present  to talk about what we have achieved. We need to create a  climate of trust, as stipulated by the joint declaration that  was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in September  last year.    [Sabic] It is often said that an agreement on the leaders  cannot be achieved without the intervention of the  representatives of the United States, without those who mediated  in the signing of the agreement?    [Akmadzic] I do no think that we will be forced to seek the  help of the United States or anyone else to solve the leadership  issue. We simply must resolve this ourselves. The issue of  electing the first president of the federation is difficult, but  once this has been resolved, the rest will be considerably  easier.    [Sabic] What are the arguments of the Bosniak side against  the election of Mr. Zubak?    [Akmadzic] The Bosniak side is presenting arguments in favor  of its candidate, but is not interfering in the nomination of  our candidate. This is what was agreed in principle and applies  to all candidates. Therefore, the Bosniak side has not  presented any arguments against Mr. Zubak personally.    [Sabic] The statements made by some Bosniak officials give  the impression that, despite the fact that the constitution of  the federation is very clear, an attempt is being made to secure  some advantage for the more numerous nation.    [Akmadzic] The constitution of the federation does not go  into the size of individual nations. We do know that the Muslim  nation is considerably more numerous and therefore we do not  demand parity at all levels, but only in the leadership, where  the equality of the peoples is reflected. The size of the  nation "argument" has appeared among the Bosniaks, but this has  never affected the talks directly. The United Nations does not  recognize factors such as the size of a nation nor the size of a  country.    [Sabic] There are some fears in the public that the  agreement could be seriously affected as a whole if no agreement  is reached on the leader of the future state. Was there any  indication of that during the talks?    [Akmadzic] So far, the agreement and the implementation of  the federal constitution have never been brought into question  for a minute. We have some objections regarding the release of  prisoners, we demand greater flexibility in the election of  leading people, we demand that the media campaign calm down,  especially in Mostar, and we demand that they themselves remove  those individuals who are against the constitution. I think  that in this respect we are making more resolute moves than the  Bosniaks.  <H5>  Ethnic Criterion Is Main, But Not Only Criterion </H5>   [Sabic] Regarding the removal of the individuals who oppose  the constitution, one should also mention that the Bosniak side  claims that in the Croatian leadership there are those who are  responsible for crimes and that they cannot be involved in the  implementation of the agreement.    [Akmadzic] We agreed that the representatives of both  nations, each one in its own house, clear this problem, that we  do not accuse each other, and then, when we finish this, see  what to do next.    [Sabic] Is this agreement respected?    [Akmadzic] Yes, it is at present. However, neither side has  carried out the necessary investigation as yet, and therefore we  do not have enough information of the conduct of responsible  persons at all levels, but know what the situation is in the  leadership.    [Sabic] How is the work on setting up cantons going on?  There is a mention of great opposition by the Bosniak side to  the cantons being based on the ethnic criterion?    [Akmadzic] The federal constitution clearly states that the  federation will be made up of federal units and that these units  will not bear national attributes in their names. The federal  law will regulate the methods and ways of determining cantonal  borders, whereby the ethnic criterion will be the main, but not  the only criterion. We have already asked our representatives  in the expert team to establish detailed criteria. At our  recent meeting in Sarajevo we jointly concluded that this work  should be speeded up.    [Sabic] In some parts of the free territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as Mostar and Travnik, there are a  large number of Muslims who were expelled from the parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina currently occupied by the Serbs. Will their  presence have any influence on the borders of the cantons. They  are not foreign citizens and many of them have been issued  personal documents in these new places of abode.    [Akmadzic] The constitution is taking into account the  results of the last census. We have agreed with the Bosniak  side, and we have also said this to the international community,  that all refugees and displaced persons must return to the  places they had to flee from. We spoke to the Bosniak side  about this at length and agreed that if the refugees, if they  cannot return to the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under Serbian  control, should go to the cantons in which their nation  constitutes a majority. However, there will be no forced  eviction from any region, nor forced return of refugees.  <H5>  It Is Not Time for Politicking </H5>   [Sabic] Can a process similar to the one taking place in the  HDZ of Croatia be expected in the HDZ of Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Some HDZ deputies in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina have  allegedly been preparing the founding of a new party?    [Akmadzic] It is understandable that events in Croatia most  directly affect the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina are already organized in several political  parties, which is good. It is a known fact that the HDZ is the  strongest party among them, that it has practically won all  Croat votes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, unanimity cannot  reign in the HDZ either, which is also good. Differences in  views do exist, but the majority of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly those in the HDZ, want the war  to stop and the federal constitution implemented. This is in  the interest of us as a nation and not as a party. I do not  know whether anyone will decide to form a new party for one  reason or the other, but if he does, I do not think that this  will affect the HDZ much. No one has ever been ruined because  someone else has become strong, but because he has become weak.  I think that this is not the time for politicking. This  generation of Croats has the task and the opportunity, after 900  years, to create and preserve a Croatian state and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is also the state of the Croatian  people.    [Sabic] How many HDZ deputies are, presently, three and half  years after the elections, willing to carry through the party  policies? How many votes can you count on with certainty?    [Akmadzic] The Croats have a total of 49 deputies in the  Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of these, 44 have been elected  as HDZ candidates. A great majority of them voted for the  federal constitution, which contains fundamental principles of  our policy, which means that they support the policy of the HDZ.  We also count on this political orientation in the future.  There used to be some misunderstandings about the existence of  Herzeg-Bosna, allegedly ambiguous attitudes toward the Muslims  people, and about relations among the Croats who live in the  parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where they constitute a majority and  those in their regions where they are a minority. Some of these  problems will be solved with the implementation of the federal  constitution. We will find out what people really think only at  the next elections. I personally believe that the people will  again extend their support to the HDZ.</p>

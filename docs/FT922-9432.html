			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Observer: Just relief Another Dollars 1.5m of Lloyd's names' money has just been sent down the tubes by a federal judge in America. But his ruling against the insurers' objection to paying a robbery claim by a US diamond wholesaler will bring relief to office workers everywhere else on the planet. Lloyd's policy with the NY Diaco diamond company stipulated that it must have a minimum of two employees on duty at all times. It turned out, however, that the robbery took place while one of the two staff present - the company president  - had stepped out to the lavatory. Lloyd's therefore declared the policy void and refused the Dollars 1.5m claim. But Judge Louis Stanton has ruled the insurers' objection unreasonable. 'A brief trip to the restroom at various times during the day is not inconsistent with being on duty or attending the office,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 2ND-QUARTER ROLLING HILLS BURST SILENCES PV, 69-50  </P> <P> Trying to find a turning point in Rolling Hills' 69-50 victory at Palos Verdes  Saturday night?  </P> <P> Look no further than the second quarter at the Sea Kings gymnasium when the  Titans netted the first 14 points of the period and outscored their hosts,  29-11. The run, which lasted more than five minutes, silenced the Palos Verdes  contingent in the standing-room-only crowd of 2,000 and paved the way for an  easy victory for Rolling Hills, which was also well supported in attendance.  </P> <P> The victory solidified the Titans' first-place hold in Bay League competition  as they improved to 7-0 in league play and 16-3 overall, while Palos Verdes  fell to 1-6 in league and 3-12 overall.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills scored the first 5 points of the game but fell behind, 10-9,  midway through the first period when Palos Verdes forward Cris Castello  completed a 3-point play. The Titans reclaimed the lead seconds later on Mark  Tesar's 3-pointer and led, 18-14, at the end of the quarter.  </P> <P> Center John Hardy and guard Ron Dinnel scored 7 and 5 points respectively in  the first three minutes of the second quarter as Rolling Hills built a 32-14  lead, and Tesar's 3-pointer at the buzzer capped off the second-quarter blitz.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes could get no closer than 15 points thereafter, and the Titans  never looked back.  </P> <P> "When we're running and making those shots, we look like a different team,"  said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren. "At first our shots weren't going in,  that's all."  </P> <P> He added: "I think Tesar's 3-pointer just before half-time really gave us a  boost, too."  </P> <P> Both teams were somewhat sluggish in the third quarter, but a 10-0 Palos Verdes  run pulled the Sea Kings to within 49-35 with 5:10 remaining. But Tesar and  Rick Judge scored easy lay-ups and Dinnel swished two free throws to again pad  Rolling Hills' lead.  </P> <P> "We came out wanting to win the third quarter and play like the score was back  to 0-0 again," said Sea Kings Coach John Mihaljevich. "We wanted to establish  our offense and get some good shots. I think we did that, but we just weren't  hitting them."  </P> <P> Hardy led all scorers with 21 points, and Tesar contributed 20, including three  3-pointers. Dinnel chipped in with 14 points.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes was paced by junior forward Scott Wilson's 14 points. Guard Craig  Nagle scored 9.  </P></p>

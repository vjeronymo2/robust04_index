			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW THEY GOT SO LIGHT  </P> <P> "Basically, people throw themselves into the holidays, using it as a license to  overeat," says Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietitian. "The meals get bigger  and fattier, and there are holiday goodies everywhere -- at the office in desk  drawers or on table tops at home. People figure that come January they will go  on their famous annual diet. That is not a good idea because it usually doesn't  work, and there is an easier way to do it."  </P> <P> Since the typical holiday menu can contain as many as 2,000 calories and half  of those can come from fat, eating half as much is a reasonable goal. On a  1,000-calorie plan, you're allowed 33 grams of fat.  </P> <P> This is the requirement we asked the chefs to follow in developing a lighter  holiday menu: Each of the following ingredients is equal to 1 teaspoon of fat;  the chefs were allowed 6 to 7 teaspoons of fat per person. Outside of these  restrictions, the chefs were free to select any items they desired.  </P> <P> * 1 teaspoon butter, regular margarine, shortening or oil, including olive oil  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon diet margarine  </P> <P> * 1 teaspoon mayonnaise  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon diet mayonnaise  </P> <P> * 1/8th avocado  </P> <P> * 6 whole almonds  </P> <P> * 10 large or 20 small peanuts  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon hazelnuts, sunflower seeds or pine nuts  </P> <P> * 2 whole pecans or walnuts  </P> <P> * 2 teaspoons pumpkin seeds  </P> <P> * 1 slice bacon  </P> <P> * 2 tablespoons shredded coconut  </P> <P> * 2 tablespoons sour cream  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon whipping cream  </P> <P> * 1/2 cup whole milk  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon cream cheese  </P> <P> * 1/4 ounce salt pork  </P> <P> * 1/3 ounce unsweetened chocolate  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon chocolate pieces  </P> <P> * 1 ounce low-fat cheese such as Lifetime, Weight Watchers  </P> <P> * 1/2 ounce hard or semisoft cheese  </P> <P> * 1 tablespoon regular salad dressing such as blue cheese, Russian, Thousand  Island, French or Italian  </P> <P> * 2 tablespoons reduced-calorie salad dressing  </P> <P> * 10 medium olives  </P> <P> * 1 egg yolk TONI TIPTON  </P></p>

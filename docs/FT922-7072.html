			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Long-term jobless total rises THE NUMBER of people unemployed for more than one year rose by 94,000 in the quarter to April to reach 841,000, the highest since October 1988. The 286,000 increase since April last year is the biggest yearly rise since 1982. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, regretted the increase but pointed out that long-term unemployment was still only two thirds the level it was five years ago. She also said that the number of very-long-term unemployed, people unemployed for more than five years, was at the lowest level since January 1985. All regions suffered an increase in long-term unemployment with the largest percentage increases in south Wales, the south-east - including London - and East Anglia. Among those aged 18 to 24, the figure has risen 168,300, the highest level since April 1988. The Unemployment Unit, a lobby group, said the long-term unemployed were becoming a larger proportion of the unemployed, rising from 25 per cent to 31 per cent in the past year. The unit also pointed to the fact that the main Department of Employment training schemes do not cater for the long-term unemployed. Employment Training, for unemployed adults, concentrates on those unemployed for between six months and one year.

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NADER ASSAILS MEDIA 'TILT' ON REAGAN  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader lambasted the media today for a "tilted  evaluation" of the Reagan record, saying the President's real legacy is less  public health and safety for bigger corporate profits.  </P> <P> Nader, appearing at a news conference with representatives of five  environmental, health and auto safety groups, charged the media and Democrats  have rolled over and allowed President Reagan to cast a "Hollywood-type gloss"  on a record that should be seen as disastrous for the average American. "This  is a regime that came in on a philosophy of establishing a government of Exxon,  by General Motors and for Du Pont," he said. "He left consumers, workers and  pollution victims defenseless and gave corporate interests pretty much what  they wanted."  </P></p>

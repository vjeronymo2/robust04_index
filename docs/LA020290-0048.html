			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> CAUGHT BETWEEN HARD ROCK, MA MAISON, PACIFICS COPES WELL  </P> <P> Pacifics is in an awkward situation: under an escalator, a few steps east of  the Hard Rock Cafe, across the street from the new Ma Maison. Especially that  last part. As a shopping-mall restaurant (it's in the Beverly Center, though  you have to enter from the sidewalk), it could seem almost impressive, but the  other side of the street from Ma Maison is a desperate place for a restaurant.  </P> <P> True to its name, it leans heavily to seafood, starting with an appetizer list  of decent oyster-bar fare. The crab cocktail, for instance, is not random  scraps of claw meat mixed with sauce but whole chunks, the sauce served on the  side. This is a noble way of doing things, even if the crab meat might be a  little more flavorful.  </P> <P> Pacifics throws clams around with a generous hand. The best dish on the menu is  probably the linguine in thick cream sauce loaded with clams and garlic. The  clam chowder, of a floury rather than a creamy texture, is well stocked with  clams. Pacifics even puts chopped clams into Caesar salad; the clams do add  something subtle and meaty to the salad, though some people are going to have a  hard time with the little gray lumps of stuff that look as if they're climbing  around on the lettuce leaves.  </P> <P> The seafood entrees are mostly straightforward things like broiled swordfish  sprinkled with paprika on a bed of spinach, though with that one you do get  French-fried julienned yams (call them shoestring potatoes made from yams).  Even the dishes on special are likely to be reassuring old favorites, like  blackened red snapper, that little Southern California Cajun tradition of ours.  It's not bad as blackened snappers go, in a crunchy crust much heavier on cumin  than red pepper.  </P> <P> Sometimes, though, Pacifics gets high on sauces. Chicken New Mexico is chicken  breast in a rich cream sauce pleasingly flavored with pecans, corn kernels and  chunks of sweet pepper. Trout Santa Fe is much the same with tomatoes in place  of pecans. The highly flavored sauce is delicious, but is that really a trout  under it? Who can tell?  </P> <P> And sometimes it gets maybe a little too high on sauces. Scallops Cho-Cho San  come in a very exotic mixture of white wine, cilantro and plum sauce, plus  paddy mushrooms and broccoli. The aroma is oddly reminiscent of an old Madeira  wine mixed with cilantro, and a bit sweet in the bargain. I guess I like it,  though I can't think what I'd like it on. Not scallops, anyway.  </P> <P> And Pacifics has a very mistaken idea that there is a special affinity between  seafood and orange juice. It serves excellent barbecued shrimp sprinkled with  hot paprika, but they come with a pilaf mawkishly dashed with orange juice and  a most absurd barbecue sauce that tastes like ketchup plus orange juice. Alas,  the restaurant is about to introduce a new menu, which they boast will contain  yet more orange sauces and even some tangerine sauces, not to mention  black-bean sauces -- which sound ominous in their own right.  </P> <P> It's odd that Pacifics doesn't seem to have any orange desserts. Mostly the  dessert list is a selection of semi-familiar pastries: cakes and tarts and that  box thing made of slabs of chocolate with more chocolate stuff inside. The  caramel pecan basket, though, is unusual and quite good, a basket of pecans  lined with chocolate on the inside, filled with vanilla Bavarian cream and  strawberries. It looks homely but the flavors and the textural contrast are a  great success.  </P> <P> Pacifics is in an awkward situation, but aren't we all sometimes? I'll say this  much: If I don't have the money for Ma Maison or the right attitude for the  Hard Rock and I'm on the sidewalk outside the Beverly Center, it's where I'm  going for clam linguine, anyway.  </P> <P>  Pacifics, 8500 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 652-1974. Open for lunch and  dinner seven days. Parking in Beverly Center. Wine and beer. American Express,  MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $27-$73.  </P> <P> </P></p>

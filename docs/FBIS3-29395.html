			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Government on  Friday [18 February] decided to launch an investigation into  alleged dumping of Pakistani cotton yarns in Japan under the  Customs Tariff Law.    A team of officials from the Finance Ministry and the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will be sent  to Pakistan soon, and on the basis of its findings the  government will decide within a year whether or not to levy a  countervailing duty on cotton yarns imported from Pakistan.    This is the second time that the Japanese Government has  investigated alleged dumping of goods in Japan by foreign  interests.    The first case involves the dumping of ferrosilico-manganese  in Japan by Chinese, Norwegian and South African concerns.    The Finance Ministry took up the yarn dumping issue in  response to a suit filed last December by the Japan Spinners'  Association, which claimed about 200 Pakistani manufacturers had  exported cotton yarn for towels and sheets to Japan below the  fair market value, causing damage to Japanese yarn manufacturers.</p>

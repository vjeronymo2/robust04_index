			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 9 Feb -- In the view of Donald Tusk, the  leader of the Liberal Democratic Congress [KLD], the essence of  the problem in Poland is not personal skirmishes between members  of the coalition but those announcements and decisions of the  Pawlak government that clearly undermine the reforming  achievements of the last few years.    In a statement issued after the Wednesday meeting of the  National Board of the KLD, the suspension of the self-government  reform of the state, an increase in inflation over the last  quarter of last year caused, in the KLD's view, by budget  expenditures directed more at social welfare protection than  active forms of counteraction of unemployment, and also the  slowing-down of privatization, were listed as being among the  threats to the long-term policies of the economic development of  Poland.    The congress also inter alia listed the introduction of  lump-sum taxation for small firms, and which constitutes a real  threat to their existence, as being among the unfavorable  decisions [of the government].    In the statement, it is stressed that in a situation where  the Suchocka government was -- thanks to budget discipline --  able to decrease the budget deficit in 1993 by over 20 trillion  zlotys, "it ought to be realistic to take decisions reducing the  tax burden and stimulating enterprise, and not wasting money  through unrealistic and uncontrolled welfare expenditures and  also the massive arousal of social expectations."    Speaking on the subject of the Wednesday demonstration by  Solidarity, Tusk stated that in a situation where the trade  union right is demanding the implementation of ever greater  workers' demands, and the government is capable of giving way  before these expectations, in accordance with that which it  promised in the election campaign, all the more significant is  the voice of "the milieux that are today weak, so that the logic  of the economic reform be defended."    As Tusk told journalists, the congress is pleased with the  fact that, in accordance with the Tuesday assurances of  Democratic Union [UD] activists, the statement by Mazowiecki  from a few months ago remains applicable, that the idea of the  creation of a new party from the milieux of the UD and KLD is  conceived as an alternative relative to the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. UD activists have  assured the congress that there are not and will not be any  talks on the subject of possible closer cooperation with the SLD  until the time of the April Unification Congress of the two  parties, Tusk added.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Fierce street fights loom in leafy suburbs Ealing, Enfield, Brent, Croydon  - for most people, these names conjure up little more than quiet, leafy and nondescript suburbs of London. But over the next three weeks, the boroughs on the outskirts of the capital will be the focus of some of the most intense local election campaigning. The outer London boroughs comprise the last large patch of Conservative blue on the local authority electoral map of the UK. In 1990, the last time London took part in local elections, the Conservatives lost ground around the country but retained control of 13 of the capital's 32 borough councils. Suburban boroughs, such as Croydon, have never been anything other than Conservative. Others, such as Barnet, are archetypal Tory territory. To lose them would be disastrous for the party's image at a time when it holds only one county council. According to Professor Patrick Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics: 'The Conservative London boroughs have represented an important bridgehead for the party in local government.' Serious Tory losses would worry the many MPs with constituencies in these areas, adding to pressures on Mr John Major's leadership. For Labour, the campaign also poses a difficult challenge. The party's defeat in the last general election was largely put down to its inability to make headway in the affluent south of England. If it were unable to take many of the Tories' council seats, doubts about Labour's electability in the south would intensify. The Tories hold several of the London councils by small majorities. In Ealing, which went Tory in 1990, Labour needs five seats to gain control. In Enfield it needs three. A single-figure swing against the Conservatives in London could lose them Harrow, Croydon and Redbridge. Doublefigure swings would dislodge them from Barnet, Bexley and Bromley. The nature of the contest will vary from borough to borough. In Croydon and Enfield, a straight, old-fashioned contest is expected between Labour and the Conservatives. Labour believes this is fertile ground, containing middle-class voters who were Labour supporters in the 1960s. In the more affluent suburbs of Sutton, Harrow and Barnet, the Liberal Democrats will be very strong challengers to the Tories. In Labour-held Greenwich, a strong showing by the Liberal Democrats could create a hung council. In Kingston-upon-Thames, the Liberal Democrats have the best chance of wresting the council from the Conservatives. A strong showing by the Liberal Democrats at the expense of Labour may help reduce the Conservatives' embarrassment in the face of serious losses. Prof Dunleavy says: 'At the end of the day, the Tories might still contain the misery of their defeat by saying 'Look what happened to Labour'.'</p>

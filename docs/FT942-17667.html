			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UN forces may go to Gorazde The United Nations is considering the despatch of 800 Ukrainian peacekeepers to Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, a UN official said yesterday. The move comes as Serb attacks on Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area, have left 30 people dead and 132 wounded since Monday. By contrast, Serbian media reported that an all-out Moslem offensive was under way as the two sides fought pitched battles in the fiercest clashes since the war began in April 1992. UN officials said some of the Serb attacks may have been in response to Bosnian government 'infantry probes'. The UN was also considering the deployment of reinforcements for the French peacekeeping contingent in Bihac, in Bosnia's north-western Moslem area, where Serb and Bosnian forces yesterday signed a ceasefire, said a senior UN official. The plans for bolstering the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia follows approval by the UN Security Council on Thursday of an extra 3,700 troops and advisers.</p>

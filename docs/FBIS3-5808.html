			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Just Denunciation on the One </F> Who Infringes Upon Human Rights"]    [Text] According to reports, Amnesty International, the  London-based human rights organization, issued a report on 9  March on traitor Kim Yong-sam's first year in office.    The report pointed out that Kim Yong-sam has done next to  nothing to end human rights violations and enumerated human  rights violation cases in detail. The report said South Korean  peace activist Kim Sam-sok and his sister, Kim Un-chu, were  beaten and sexually assaulted by the Agency for National  Security Planning after their arrest on national security  charges in September, 1993.    It was a just denunciation and protest on the Kim Yong-sam  puppet group which, under the cloak of a so-called civilian-led  regime, has turned South Korea into a barren land devoid of  human rights.    As everyone knows, traitor Kim Yong-sam took office a year  ago raving that he would make South Korea a more democratic  society and resolve the human rights issue. Nonetheless, the  current situation in South Korea clearly shows that it was an  imposture of a political prostitute who attempted to win the  people's favor by hiding the rebellious nature of the  treacherous regime that has changed its nameplate from a  dictatorial system to a civilian one.    In order to make South Korea a democratic society and  resolve  the human rights issue, the National Security Law, the most  vicious law in the world, and other fascist evil laws should be  abolished first and foremost. The Agency for National Security  Planning; the Defense Security Command; and other suppressive  organs, which are the breeding center of human rights  violations, should be dissolved as well.    Raving about human rights while keeping intact the evil laws  and suppressive organs that systematically and physically  infringe upon human rights is in fact preposterous. However,  traitor Kim Yong-sam, saying he will carry out reforms, left  intact all the evil laws and went so far as to enhance the  suppressive organs' role.    Under such conditions, the patriotic students and the people  who called for independence, democracy, and reunification have  been mercilessly suppressed by the police and put behind bars.  Workers who called for the right to live have been trampled  under the puppet soldiers' combat shoes. Until last October,  compared to the same period of No Tae-u's early days in office,  the number of students and people who have been arrested  invoking National Security Law has increased by 2.5 times. This  fact clearly reveals how malicious the Kim Yong-sam fascist  clique's suppressive maneuvers are.    In addition, the innocent people have been terrorized in  broad daylight and patriotic students have been kidnapped only  to be found in a deep valley or at sea as corpses. Universities  and work places have been raided by the police and those who  have different ideologies have been arrested and executed.  Brutal medieval-type torture, such as sleep and water  deprivation and sexual assaults, are openly carried out in South  Korea. All of these can only be committed in South Korea.    According to materials, approximately 340 people are wanted  by the South Korean police and there are now some 300 long-term  prisoners. Among them, there are long-term prisoners who have  spent their days in a cell for 42 or 44 years.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who advertised himself as being a  civilian-led government's leader, is an infringer of human  rights, surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators who  gained notoriety for their military dictatorship. South Korea  is an area in which human rights is infringed upon and a living  hell in which no one can live.    This notwithstanding, the fascist clique did not stop there  and raved that it is acceptable to proceed with torture on  political detainees. In doing so, they encourage human butchers  to commit brutal torture and killings.    The fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam clamors about his  so-called respect for human rights and democratic development is  nothing but a sophistry to hide his ugly color as a ringleader  of human rights violations. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a wolf in a  lamb's skin. The reason why human right violations are openly  committed in South Korea is because the present regime has  sprung from the deep root of the Fifth and Sixth Republics'  military dictators.    It is self-evident that the Kim Yong-sam regime, which has  sprung from the deep root of the military dictatorial regimes,  can only but take the road of human rights violation. The Kim  Yong-sam regime is a succeeding regime of the Sixth Republic.    At a time when human rights is most valued around the world,  how can a brutal human rights situation be permitted in South  Korea? Amnesty International's indication that nothing has been  done to improve the human rights condition in South Korea is  just.    As long as South Korea remains as a U.S. colonial country  and  traitor Kim Yong-sam holds power, South Korea's human rights  situation will never be improved. As a crazy dog should only be  caught after being beaten to death with a stick, the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique, which runs amok in trampling on human  rights and committing manslaughter, will receive a stern trial  of the history.    The South Korean people will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam  ring, a fascist tyranny for the century.</p>

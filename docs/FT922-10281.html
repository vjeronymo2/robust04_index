			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Management: When fine words will butter no parsnips - Lucy Kellaway has some advice about talking in English to foreigners They can be spotted in expense account restaurants all over the world: British businessmen shouting in English, while their dining companions sit smiling and nodding in polite confusion. The British have never been good at foreign languages; it seems they are not much better at speaking their own to foreigners. Complacent in the belief that anyone worth talking to can communicate in English, and ignorant of what it is to struggle in a foreign language, British managers make few concessions. When faced with a floundering foreigner, they tend either to shout or to speak very slowly. Both approaches can be downright insulting: foreigners are not deaf and if they do not understand something, they will still fail to grasp it delivered at a snail's pace. In extremis, the British adopt a foreign accent, hoping that talking like Inspector Clouseau will make it easier for a Frenchman to get the point. It need not be like this. Companies know that poor communication can mean lost business; many are realising that it is can be cheaper and quicker to train staff to use their own language than to start teaching them new ones. Cert*, a London-based training consultant, has been teaching executives 'foreigner-friendly English' for the last four years. Marianne Aston, the architect of the course, says the main difficulty facing foreigners is not that the British mumble or speak too quickly. It is more that the words they use are too complicated and the grammar too convoluted. She argues that if executives follow a few simple rules, communication will go a little more smoothly. VOCABULARY This is the biggest stumbling block. Most British executives have no idea how limited the vocabulary of a foreigner is likely to be. To pass the equivalent of A-level exams in a language, you need about 2,000 words, while a native speaker will use 10 times as many. The secret is not to avoid the most complicated words but to make a point of going for the very simplest. If you want to say that someone has a lot of money, say they are rich. Don't say they are well-off, wealthy, loaded, well-heeled, affluent or opulent. Colloquial words should be treated with care: even people who speak no English understand 'OK'; fewer are likely to be familiar with 'gobsmacked'. IDIOMS Some idioms will be comprehensible, and others not so. You need to pick and choose carefully. For instance, a foreigner can probably understand 'We'll cross that bridge when we come to it', but will almost certainly be perplexed by 'a piece of cake'. If you tell them to 'pull their socks up', they will probably reach under the table. There are a few idioms that sound all right but are not: 'At the end of the day', can cause an upset, as your audience will almost certainly take it to mean you want something by 6pm. GRAMMAR Try to think in sentences that do not need punctuation. There should be one idea expressed in each sentence and no sub-clauses. Avoid all meaningless little filler noises, as these may convince the foreigner that you are about to say something. If you start saying 'Um', they may expect you to say umbrella. Many languages do not have any such noises. For example, in Scandinavia, if people have nothing to say, they are quiet. Indeed, silence is helpful to foreigners as it gives them time to collect their thoughts. CULTURAL REFERENCES Any reference specific to one culture should be avoided altogether. Don't say to someone in Budapest: 'Doesn't he look like Terry Wogan'. Also, do not talk about British qualifications, standards or brand names without explanation. FALSE-FRIENDS Be careful with words which may mean something quite different in a foreign language. If you tell a Spaniard that you are 'embarrassed', he is likely conclude that you are pregnant. UNDERSTANDING THE FOREIGNER The problem is not just making sure that the foreigner understands you. There may be difficulties in the other direction. Here, there are fewer short cuts because understanding someone with very poor English is going to involve unpicking their particular accent. This obviously varies according to where they are from. For instance, when a Frenchman says 'ease', he may actually mean 'his' 'he's' or 'is'. But if you do not understand, do not be critical. Make it seem that it is you, not the foreigner, who is being slow. *Cert. Tel 071-924-3444</p>

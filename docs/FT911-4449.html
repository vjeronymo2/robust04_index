			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Sandoz yields on foreign investors SANDOZ, the large Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said yesterday that it would open all its shares to foreign investors. At the same time, it announced a capital restructuring and a one-for-20 rights issue to raise SFr400m (Pounds 157.8m). Mr Victor Bischoff, head of group finance, said proceeds from the 'shareholder-friendly' rights issue would be added to Sandoz's net cash reserves of SFr1.2bn. The company was looking at several possible acquisitions. At present, only Swiss residents can buy Sandoz-registered shares, which account for 70 per cent of the company's issued capital and 87 per cent of its voting rights. Foreigners are restricted to 'bearer shares' and non-voting 'participation certificates'. From May 16 anyone will be allowed to buy any of the three classes of equity. But Sandoz will maintain the restriction that no shareholder may own more than 2 per cent of the capital. In abolishing the traditional Swiss rule that prevents foreigners owning registered shares, Sandoz is following the lead set by Nestle in 1988. Some other industrial companies, including Ciba-Geigy, the big chemical group, have already done so. Mr Serge Ledermann, head of Swiss research at Lombard, Odier, the Geneva bank, welcomed the trend. 'It should help to raise the capitalisation of the Swiss market,' he said. But he pointed out that the banking and insurance sectors had not made similar moves. Sandoz registered shares jumped by SFr675 to SFr11,025 on the Zurich bourse yesterday, in anticipation of foreign buying. Bearer shares fell by SFr550 to SFr11,350 and participation certificates dropped by SFr140 to SFr2,160. Under the terms of the capital restructuring, both registered and bearer shares will be split 5:1. Holders will receive five new shares of the same type for every single old share. At the same time, they will have the right to subscribe SFr1,100 to receive one additional new share for every four old shares. Participation certificates will not be split, although their nominal value will be changed to bring them into line with new shares. Holders can subscribe SFr1,100 to receive one new certificate for every 20 old ones.</p>

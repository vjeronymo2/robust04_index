			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant loss at Pounds 15.4m GOODE DURRANT, the industrial holding company, yesterday announced a deepening of pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 15.4m over the 12 months to April 30 1993, as accounting treatments obliterated small operating profits for the second successive year. However, the shares rose 7p to 93p after the recommended final dividend was maintained of 3.25p, giving an unchanged total of 5.4p. Losses per share were 31.2p (6.3p). Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said: 'For the first time for a number of years we can now look forward with confidence.' He said the company remained cautious about the outlook for the economy in general. Turnover fell to Pounds 173.5m (Pounds 178.2m) including Pounds 101.8m (Pounds 103.5m) from Laidlaw Leasing, which the company sold to Quick's Group after the year-end for Pounds 8.2m cash. The company incurred an Pounds 18.4m loss on the Pounds 26m acquisition, made in 1987, as a result of a goodwill write-back. The comapny had already provided for this and it did not affect shareholders' funds. Under new accounting rules, this and other one-off charges made a total of Pounds 19.8m in exceptional items which wiped out pre-exceptional profits of Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 5.09m). The Northgate vehicle hire division made the largest contribution of Pounds 3.53m (Pounds 2.52m) to pre-exceptional profits and pre-tax profits, with associated undertakings contributing Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.08m). The remaining element of Laidlaw, a leasing business, made reduced profits of Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 341,000), contributing to pre-exceptional profits with equipment hire declining into losses of Pounds 172,000, compared with profits of Pounds 300,000 in the previous period. Housebuilding and construction also contributed a pre-exceptional loss of Pounds 168,000 against profits of Pounds 362,000 last time. Goode Durrant had net borrowings of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 34.8m), with the Laidlaw disposal helping to reduce debt by about Pounds 15.6m. Gearing, including vehicle finance, fell from 71 to 39 per cent.</p>

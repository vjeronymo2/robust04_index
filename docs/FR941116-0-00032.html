			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Principal Maintenance Inspector Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These same commenters request that a statement be added to proposed paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) to indicate that the ``AD is no longer applicable once a revision to the FAA-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance program is implemented.'' These commenters indicate that it would be less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumbersome to operators to accomplish all of the AD-required tasks within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters of their FAA-approved maintenance program, where the cognizant PMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be the FAA official permitted to approve any further changes to the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters contend that it is much more appropriate for the PMI, rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) engineering staff, to approve subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the program once the program has been approved. The commenters consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the PMI is more qualified than the ACO staff to approve tasks on training, reporting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and adjustments to the leak check intervals based upon reliability program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations. The commenters point out that the subject matter of the rule is clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance-related, and the ACO staff is not equipped to effectively respond to requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for maintenance interval changes that may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with this request for the same reasons it did not concur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a similar request made by these commenters to the previous supplemental NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FAA agrees that the PMI may be permitted certain oversight of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative maintenance program provision of the rule (specifically with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping), the FAA does not agree that the PMI should be tasked with approving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain adjustments of the program. As was explained in detail in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemental NPRM, failure threshold criteria and definitive leak/failure rate data do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist for the majority of the subject valves; therefore, a PMI would have no data on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to base the approval of an extension of a leak check interval for many valves with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that the valve would not fail within the adjusted interval. In light of this, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential that the FAA, at the ACO level, have feedback as to the leak and failure rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced in the field. Although the PMI's serve as the FAA's critical link with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators (and the PMI's oversight responsibilities will not be minimized by this AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action), it is the staff of the ACO that provides the engineering support necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate whether increases in leak check intervals will maintain an acceptable level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the FAA considers it essential that any adjustment of the required leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check intervals, seal change intervals, and data reporting procedures should be approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a uniform manner in order to ensure that the program is administered uniformly (and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately) fleetwide. The staff of the Seattle ACO is in the best position to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this is accomplished. Additionally, given that possible new relevant issues might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revealed during the approval process, it is imperative that the engineering staff at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACO have such feedback. In any case, the ACO staff will work closely with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cognizant PMI to ensure that any approved revisions to this aspect of the maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are appropriate and workable for the applicable airline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Leak Check Instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include a procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for performing the leak checks. The commenter suggests that the instructions contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Boeing Service Letter 737&hyph;SL&hyph;38&hyph;3&hyph;A (which applies to Model 737 series airplanes) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in order to ensure that all affected operators perform the same leak check. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA does not concur totally. The instructions contained in Boeing Service Letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 737&hyph;SL&hyph;38&hyph;3&hyph;A address only the forward lavatory service panel (not the aft or executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> panels), and do not correlate with the requirement to perform a leak check of the outer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap on certain valves. The instructions do contain procedures for performing a leak test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve, which are appropriate for performing that leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check in accordance with the requirements of this AD; therefore, the FAA has added a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note to paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(3) to indicate that operators may consider the leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> check procedures relative to the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service letter as an acceptable means of compliance with those paragraphs. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does agree that a standard leak check procedure would be beneficial, and will consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision of this final rule to include one if an acceptable procedure becomes available in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for conducting the leak check of the dump valve. This commenter suggests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this leak check should be performed by filling the toilet tank with water or rinsing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluid to a level such that the bowl is approximately half full (at least 2 inches above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flapper in the bowl) and waiting at least 5 minutes to determine if leakage is present. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA concurs and has revised the rule to include a new  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Note 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators may conduct this particular leak check in accordance with the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested by this commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Service Panel Waste Drain Cap Leak Check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters request that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (b)(2)(i) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule be revised to delete the requirement to perform a leak check of the service panel waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drain cap that does not have an inner door with a second positive seal. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that, to perform this leak check, approximately 20 gallons of contaminated waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water are required to be dumped on the ramp; such dumping violates various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not agree that conducting this leak check will necessarily require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spilling a vast amount of waste water on the ramp. Compliance with FAA rules is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license to violate environmental regulations. Operators could devise a means to catch or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handle the waste water to ensure that they will be in compliance with applicable State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal environmental regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

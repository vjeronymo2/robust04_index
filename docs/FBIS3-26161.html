Reform means that  we shall speed up reforms according to the decision adopted by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in  order to set up the framework of the socialist market economic  structure; development means that we shall maintain the  sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170  4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy;  while maintaining social and political stability is the major  foundation for reform and development. Correctly handling the  relationships between reform, development, and stability will  ensure the healthy development of the socialist cause with  Chinese characteritics.    In the field of economic development in 1994, we still need  to promptly adjust the intensity of macro-control, properly  control the size of capital construction, the size of credit,  and the momentum of inflation. In the action of macro-control  in 1993, it was impossible to solve all the problems arising in  the process of high-speed economic growth since 1992. The  macro-control measures in 1993 curbed inflation and restrained  the excessively growing size of capital construction and credit  and the excessive monetary input in some sectors, but the  problems were not thoroughly solved in the investment and  banking systems. Now, the size of capital construction is still  too large, and the belated effects of the excessive monetary  input will continue to arise in 1994. It will take time to  overcome such belated effects. That is to say, the  macro-control tasks in 1993 have not been completed fulfilled,  and the economy has not effected the "landing." Therefore, in  1994, we shall continue to work for the "soft landing" in order  to ensure the economy's healthy development and to prevent  losses caused by violent ups and downs.    Now, the size of the ongoing construction projects  throughout  the country is much greater than that in 1991, and one third of  such large-scale construction is supported by bank loans. If  such a large amount of capital construction is to be completed,  it will require excessive monetary input. How then can the  economy endure all this? Therefore, it is necessary to actually  cut down on the size of capital construction. In 1993, the  party Central Committee and the State Council did not adopt  administrative measures to order all localities to cut down on  construction projects; instead, they mainly relied on measures  for strengthening and improving macro- control measures. In  1994, such practice will continue. All localities should make  adjustments according to their own conditions, and should really  cut down on the excessively expanded amount of capital  construction.    Over more than 10 years, China's economic development has  repeatedly proved that out-of-control capital construction is  always the beginning of the out-of-control economic aggregate,  in which aggregate demand substantially exceeds aggregate  supply. Therefore, it is of great importance to reform the  whole economic structure, including the investment structure, to  form an investment mechanism that may properly exercise  self-control. In 1994, the pace of reform will be speeded up,  and this also reflects the necessity of such reform. In the  process of forming the new investment structure, the steps for  strengthening and improving macro-control, promptly adjusting  the intensity of such control, and promoting the improvement of  the economic structure and the enhancement of the economic  efficiency are all extremely important points in the 1994  economic work.    China is a large country. Any slight action of construction  in villages or factories may bring about a tremendous demand on  material and fund input for capital construction, and the  swelling size of investment will inevitably strain the supply of  raw materials and bid up their prices. Take steel products as  an example. In early 1993, its price was 1,600-1,800 yuan per  tonne; later, it increased to over 4,000 yuan; after the  macro-control measures were adopted in July and August, it  declined to a level below 3,000 yuan; but it is rising again.  The upwward tendency of the steel and cement prices will bring  about chain effects. This shows that it is a critical link to  control the amount of capital construction in the efforts to  curb the price increases.    Of course, this does not mean that no investment will be  made  in capital construction. Necessary capital construction remains  a major means of maintaining the lasting momentum of economic  development. What we should do is to keep construction at an  appropriate size. Good things cannot be accomplished overnight  or even in one single year. The structure must be rationalized  in the orientation of strengthening the basic industries.  Priority should still be given to such basic industries and  infrastructural facilities as agriculture, transportation,  communications, and energy production so the "bottleneck"  effects of these industries which are relatively lagging behind  may be removed. As for the development of real estate,  especially the construction of high-class hotels, office  buildings, luxurious villas, and holiday resorts, its scale must  be resolutely cut down.    The speed of economic growth should be appropriate; the  amount of capital construction should be appropriate. These are  major conditions for the smooth process of reform and also major  conditions for maintaining social stability. We must be very  prudent on this point.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate passed far-reaching legislation that would exempt up to 10% of  federal workers from the Civil Service uniform pay scale and allow the Defense  and Energy departments to pay 525 scientists and engineers as much as $134,250  a year. That level of compensation exceeds the $89,500 paid to members of  Congress and Vice President Dan Quayle's $115,000 salary. The legislation  includes limited exceptions to laws that prevent retired military officers from  "double-dipping" and block Energy Department employees from going through the  "revolving door" to work for private firms on the contracts they helped manage  for the government. Double-dipping is the practice, mainly restricted, of  simultaneously receiving a military pension and a full salary from government  employment in a civilian post, for total government yearly pay of more than  $75,500.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 17 (CTK) -- The time has come for  Slovakia to make good the promises it made a year ago when  entering the Council of Europe, Pal Csaky, a deputy for the  ethnic Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), told CTK  today. Next week the parliament will deal with governmental  bills designed to satisfy the basic demands of the ethnic  minorities. In Slovakia there are 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (10  percent of the population).    "Deputies have a great opportunity to show their willingness  to be tolerant and their ability to think democratically," Csaky  commented on the amendments to the laws on registration offices,  official language and administrative set-up.    The laws will make it possible for the ethnic minorities to  use their first and family names in their original form.  Moreover, towns and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic  minority members will have the right to a place-name in the  minority's language.    The opposition and Matica Slovenska [Slovak Heritage  Foundation] have protested against the proposals approved by the  government. Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational  organisation which strives to preserve Slovak legacy and  national feelings. Its leadership stated that the prepared  bilingual names of 560 towns and villages were reminiscent of  the "Horthyite occupation" (by Hungary between 1938 and 1945) of  south Slovakia and that it feared a threat to integrity of the  young state.    "The issue can be abused for an all-out struggle between the  current and past coalitions," Csaky said. "Matica is playing a  negative role in shaping modern society. It is not able to get  rid of prejudice and people with political ambitions," he  stated, adding that Matica, being a cultural institution, should  not meddle in politics.    Csaky described as "pure nonsense" the statement by Roman  Hofbauer, former transport minister in Vladimir Meciar's  government, that the bilingual names would require modifying of  all official documents, while people would have to master, use  and respect all the variants of the names. "The laws will not,  of course, harass anybody," Csaky stated.    On the decision of the Slovak National Party (SNS, 9  deputies  in the 150-seat Slovak parliament) to allow only native Slovaks  to join the party Csaky noted: "I regret this, but it is no  surprise in a party with views from the 18th or the 19th  centuries."    Csaky pleaded for the formation of a coalition of three  ethnic Hungarian groupings, Egyutteles (9 deputies), the MKDH (5  deputies) and the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS,  extra-parliamentary) for the forthcoming elections (September  30-October 1). He dismissed the proposal by Egyutteles Chairman  Miklos Duray for creation of a union. "The election law mentions  only parties and coalitions, not unions," Csaky stated, adding  that the MOS had its electoral base so that neither the MKDH nor  the Egyutteles would be damaged by the three-member coalition.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to change the rules of the funding game FOR a supposedly pragmatic and practical people, the British have an abiding love of complex, rule-based systems. Whether the game is cricket, Cluedo or financing the government deficit, no effort is spared in making sure that complicated regulations bring maximum satisfaction to the players involved. Britain's rules for financing or 'funding' the public sector borrowing requirement are a case in point. The subject is rich in theology and tradition. It has spawned a language unique to UK financial markets. Nowhere else in the world do people speak of 'funding', 'fully funding', 'underfunding' or even 'unfunding' the deficits which governments routinely run in the management of national economies. But with Britain set to run Pounds 50bn annual deficits into the foreseeable future and UK inflation falling to below 2 per cent, the time may be ripe for changing Britain's long-standing, self-imposed restrictions on how to finance the PSBR. In a period in which UK economic policy and performance have gone through many changes, the rules about plugging the government deficit have been surprisingly constant. The authorities today, as in the mid 1980s, 'seek to fund the net total of maturing debt, the PSBR and any underlying increase in the foreign exchange reserves by sales of debt outside the banking and building society sectors'. This so-called full funding rule means that the government does not set out to sell debt to the UK's banks and building societies. Indeed, if any such sales take place, it will deliberately sell more gilts to the non-bank private sector to compensate. Any rule that forces the government to increase its gilt sales in this way is clearly inconvenient, and especially so at a time of ballooning deficits. But since becoming chancellor in November 1990, Mr Norman Lamont has firmly rejected any shift away from full funding. In evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee last November, he ruled out any idea of 'underfunding' the deficit which would be one consequence of allowing banks and building societies to invest in government bonds. No other industrialised nation draws this distinction between funding and financing deficits. Other governments sell their debt without worrying whether it is bought by banks, the local equivalent of building societies, financial institutions such as pension funds or individuals. Britain's peculiar approach is rooted in its inflationary past and the country's inability in the early 1980s to control inflation by targeting the growth of broad money. The economic rationale for the full funding rule is that the government should not print money to finance the deficit. In its Budget 'Red Book' of March 1990, the Treasury clarified the counter-inflationary reasons for Britain sticking to the full fund rule. The rule, it said, 'ensures that the PSBR is financed by means other than any increase in issue of notes and coin. It also means that the direct effect of the PSBR on broad money is neutralised, with none of it financed by net borrowing from banks and building societies'. However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Global Markets, has argued that the combination of a large PSBR and a policy of full funding may actually reduce the growth of broad money, rather than be neutral. Mr Bootle's case is that financial flows from the deficit to industrial and commercial companies and individuals may help reduce their borrowing from banks and building societies and hence curb the growth of the UK money stock. Such a development would matter little if broad money played no part in British monetary policy. But since Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September, the government has decided to monitor M4, the broad money measure which includes bank and building society deposits. The cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent on January 26 was triggered primarily by the news that M4 was growing at below its 4 to 8 per cent annual 'monitoring range' and that there was no sign of any lift-off in bank and building society lending. The weak growth of broad money and so-called M4 lending, together with the fall in inflation to its lowest level for a generation and a reversal of gilts yield curve since September from an inverse to a conventional, upwards-sloping, pattern, could provide the rationale for the government to ease its funding rules without too much loss of face. As broad money is currently growing at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent, the authorities should be able to sell an estimated Pounds 10bn of debt to banks and building societies without M4 coming close to the upper limit of its monitoring range. Admittedly, there is some doubt about whether banks would want to invest in UK government bonds. But the sharp fall in inflation to an annual rate of 1.7 per cent in January, coming on top of the change in the shape of the yield curve since September, could increase the attraction of gilts for UK banks. Gilts would be even more appealing if, as most City commentators expect, short-term interest rates fall further from 6 per cent around the time of the Budget on March 16. The Treasury is currently reviewing the whole issue of funding. It is also a subject of active debate in the Bank of England where some senior officials have been urging the adoption of continental-style financing rules for the PSBR instead of full funding. The fact that other countries can finance their deficits without fueling inflation should be a strong argument for change. One objection might be that it is dangerous to abandon any rule that conveys anti-inflationary rigour in a country as inflation-prone as the UK. But Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London, says that a simple answer to this would be for the government to declare firmly that it will not use short-term borrowing to finance the deficit. Its borrowing rules would then be in line with best practice abroad and Mr Lamont would find it less of a struggle to plug the deficit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 28 -- The Freedom Union (UW) has  forwarded Michal Boni, former labour minister in the Jan  Krzysztof Bielecki government, as its candidate for the  president of Warsaw, it was announced on Tuesday.    The Warsaw chapter of the Social-Democracy of the Republic  of  Poland (SDRP) declared its willingness for talks, but did not  take a stand on Boni's candidature. The coalition of the  Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party  (PSL) has won 29 out of 85 seats in the Warsaw Council.    The SDRP will decide about the UW candidature after it  learns  the answer for its conditions presented in the talks the party  is conducting now. If they are not met, the SDRP threatens it  will boycott the election of the president of Warsaw who is  chosen in the presence of at least two thirds of councillors.    Warsaw SDRP said that the number of seats won in the local  government elections obliges the SLD-PSL coaliton to care for  the city. The party wants to have one third of seats in the  Warsaw local government assembly.    Leader of the Warsaw chapter of the SDRP Andrzej Zelazowski  said that his party is conducting unofficial talks with  representatives of other political groups except the right-wing  parties about eventual coalitions in local government.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERSEE KGB? SURE, CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of the KGB, said Thursday that the Soviet security  and intelligence apparatus is "interested in" and "absolutely" supportive of a  commission of the new Congress of People's Deputies that would oversee his  secret police agency.  </P> <P> And he said that under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, "a great  deal of noble aspects of KGB activities" will become more apparent, such as  "our struggle against terrorism." In that effort, he added, the KGB had had  "certain contacts" with the United States.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov discussed the KGB with several Western reporters a day after Yuri  Vlasov, a Moscow deputy to the new congress, condemned the feared intelligence  agency as an "underground empire" that "exercises a comprehensive control over  society."  </P> <P> The boldness of Vlasov's remarks, yet another sign of the new freedoms set  loose by perestroika, caused a sensation among the deputies. Vlasov accused the  KGB of still holding dissidents in psychiatric hospitals to prevent political  opposition.  </P> <P> "If he spoke such a speech seven years ago, he would have gone to prison 10  years at a minimum," said an Estonian deputy.  </P> <P> Also remarkable has been the access Western and Eastern Bloc reporters have had  to traditionally inaccessible figures such as Kryuchkov and members of the  ruling Politburo.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov, who became head of the KGB last autumn, said Thursday that the  agency now considers the battle against terrorism "the most important direction  of our operational activities."  </P> <P> "We are ready to cooperate with anyone in our struggle against terror," he  said, expressing appreciation for Israel's handing over hijackers who had used  Soviet schoolchildren as hostages to get a plane to Israel last December.  </P> <P> The head of the KGB also said his agency wants to see an oversight commission  on state security formed by the new congress. "Maybe we'll have to borrow some  experience from Americans," he said referring to congressional committees that  are supposed to oversee the CIA. "We are interested in such a commission. Maybe  (some activities) will be corrected. There'll be a chance of discussion."  </P></p>

Making a sustained  effort in refurbishing the theater of military operations and in  maintaining techniques, the Central Army engineering regiment  obtained the special Victoria-25 Emulation award. Engineering  Unit 3170 received the award of being the first group of its  type in the country, and the banner that raises it to the level  of National Vanguard of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, an award  obtained for the sixth consecutive year.    During 1993 this unit made laudable efforts to build  tunnels,  silos, and firing positions, and achieved considerable progress  in conserving resources and improving the troops' living  conditions.    On evaluating the fighting capacity of the regiment,  Division  General Joaquin Quintas Solas said:    [Begin recording] The fighting readiness of this regiment,  as  well as that of the other regular units, the militia, and the  production and defense units throughout the Army territory, is  high and is equal to the times in which we are living today. All  warriors clearly understand that only by fighting does one enter  this country, and one leaves -- well, we all know how, if one  manages to leave.    I was told that the readiness of this unit is very  satisfactory, an outstanding grade within the Revolutionary  Armed Forces. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / EU to pressure US on Bosnia Members of the European Union are expected to urge the US to take a more active part in the Bosnian peace process when the foreign ministers of the Twelve meet in Brussels next Monday. The French and the British have already done so during direct talks between their foreign ministers, Mr Alain Juppe and Mr Douglas Hurd, over the past week. Yesterday, their Dutch colleague, Mr Pieter Kooijmans, also said he had written a letter in the same vein to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Mr Kooijmans said on Dutch television that he had told Mr Christopher: 'Play a more active role in the peace talks in view of the terrible alternative - a war which will demand more victims.' Mr Hurd, who gave a very similar message to Mr Christopher during his talks in Washington last Tuesday, did not, however, go as far as the French, who irritated the Americans by calling upon them to put pressure on the Moslems to accept the present peace plan dividing Bosnia into three ethnic states. In the knowledge that such a demand would be flatly rejected by the US administration, Mr Hurd merely made clear that Britain wanted the US to be 'up front' in the peace process, since that would hasten the day when a settlement was reached, according to officials in London. However, Mr Christopher apparently declined to spell out the conditions under which the US was prepared to take a more active role. The continued presence of United Nations peacekeeping troops in Bosnia now appears to be assured, following consultations between the main contributing countries such as Britain, France, Canada, Spain and Russia. All the troop contributors agree that a decision should be taken jointly by them, before the end of March, on the basis of reports by the UN, its special representative in former Yugoslavia and its new military commanders on the spot. Mr Hurd is understood to consider it most unlikely that there will be a simple decision to withdraw, since the war would then become even more savage than it already is and the effect on the very people the UN was trying to help would be catastrophic. Meanwhile, the new 'hardline, hard-nosed' policy of the recently appointed UN military commander in Bosnia, Britain's General Sir Michael Rose, has achieved its first positive results. Bosnian Serb militia backed down after UN troops threatened yesterday to send in armoured vehicles to clear a blocked checkpoint 15 miles west of Sarajevo.</p>

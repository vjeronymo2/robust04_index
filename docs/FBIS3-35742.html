Representatives of different parties, movements, public  organizations, district (?hakimats), various nationalities, and  intelligentsia gathered together in the State History Museum  building.    Bishkek Mayor Ibraimov addressed those present. He drew  their attention to the fact of the utmost importance of the  meeting between the head of state and citizens of Bishkek. He  said that major intellectual, scientific, and industrial forces  are represented in the capital. Bishkek is a sort of a  barometer of Kyrgyzstan's conscience.    President Askar Akayev emphasized the importance of the  meeting. He presented a speech, saying that all the regions of  the country were attempting to equal Bishkek. It should set a  good example of stable peace and prosperity. Therefore, topical  problems have to be solved first in the capital. One of them is  the restoration and revival of industry. Kyrgyzstan should  develop further as an industrial state and Russia should become  its main partner. This choice was made by Kyrgyz ancestors who  understood the importance of the union. We should hand on the  friendship baton to future generations.    The president reminded those present of the unselfish  assistance that was rendered to Kyrgyzstan by Russia at times of  emergencies. He also said that the spring sowing campaign is  approaching and we do not have any machinery or spare parts. We  are short of fuel and mineral resources. Around 1 billion soms  will be needed for the sowing campaign. Where can we get this  money?    We pin great hopes on the upcoming visit to Kyrgyzstan by  Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. It is expected that a  number of documents on economic cooperation will be signed. Our  main goal is to preserve the intellectual potential which is the  important asset of the country, said the head of state. We  should cleverly use our experts. They represent our nation, it  is a locomotive which is ascribed to play a major role in  lifting the country's economy out of crisis and help in building  an industrial state. Of course they need to be socially  protected. Commissions have been set up in the government so as  to supervise the timely payment of wages [to them] since these  categories of workers mainly rely on their wages.    The president also spoke about dual citizenship. The  president believes that the migration of Russians could only be  stopped provided we show our good attitude -- by introducing  dual citizenship.    Akayev urged people to get rid of the psychology of national  self-conceit and to get rid of it, not only in politics, but  also in everyday life. Let us be united and set a good example  to other regions. Each ethnic group should feel safe and secure  in Bishkek. By doing this we will maintain our independence,  strengthen it, defend sovereignty, and build a healthy market  economy. Only peace and stability can contribute to  facilitating economic reforms.

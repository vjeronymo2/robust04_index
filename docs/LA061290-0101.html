			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: A MODEL FOR EAST BLOC WORKERS  </P> <P> There is something delightfully anomalous about a campaign by America's  worker-owned companies to persuade leaders of the Soviet Union and East  European countries to replace their admittedly failing state-owned companies  with worker-owned ones.  </P> <P> The idea of workers owning the companies that employ them was once considered a  radical, socialist scheme. But, while still limited, it has spread more rapidly  in the capitalistic United States than in any other nation on earth.  </P> <P> Now more than 11.5 million American workers own a significant part or all of  their companies, and the number of firms selling or giving stock to their  workers is growing by from 600 to 800 a year.  </P> <P> To spread the good word about power sharing, 80 U.S. employee-owned companies  last week sent letters to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other  leaders of what were once communist countries, inviting them to send  delegations here to learn firsthand about giving economic power to workers.  </P> <P> Some experts say that because of its huge size, the almost-completed employee  buyout of United Airlines might turn out to be a model for those countries  because most of their state-run companies are also large.  </P> <P> The United buyout will give employees the dominant voice in every major  management decision. It will give the company's 71,000 workers full ownership  of the nation's second-largest airline and is by far the largest such buyout  yet in the United States.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, no plans have yet been made to give the United worker-owners a  role in day-to-day top management decisions or even in decision making related  to their own individual jobs. That isn't unusual in worker-owned companies, but  the system functions best when workers are involved in decision making at all  levels.  </P> <P> The Soviets and Eastern Europe aren't waiting for the United deal to go through  before taking lessons from America's rapidly growing experience with employee  ownership, says Corey Rosen, executive secretary of the Oakland-based National  Center for Employee Ownership.  </P> <P> Some initial exchange visits by worker-ownership advocates have already been  made between those countries and the United States. Legislation to encourage  the practice is being drafted in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland,  Hungary, Yugoslavia and East Germany.  </P> <P> But there are serious obstacles that must be overcome if those countries are  going to have a significant amount of worker ownership as they make the  historic transition to more market-oriented economies.  </P> <P> For instance, they urgently need foreign investment capital that will not be  easily obtained under any circumstances, and will be even harder to get for  economically troubled companies owned by workers, says Rutgers Professor Joseph  Blasi, author of "Employee Ownership: Revolution or Ripoff?"  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Blasi, who has met with officials of some Eastern European  nations, is convinced that workers in most of those countries will have at  least a "significant minority stake in their companies."  </P> <P> The employee buyout at United Airlines demonstrates the difficulty of getting  investors to put money even into a financially healthy worker-owned company in  America.  </P> <P> It certainly looks like a good deal. United's employees expect to buy it for  $4.36 billion, far less than the $6.7 billion the pilots said they were ready  to pay for it last year but couldn't because they failed to get the financing  and because of bitter arguments between the unions involved.  </P> <P> Those arguments are mostly resolved and the new buyout plan would give  employees 100% ownership, which means the government can provide tax advantages  worth more than $1 billion.  </P> <P> Also, the workers will take an initial pay cut of about 4%, and, after  regaining that loss next year, their wages will be frozen for the next four  years.  </P> <P> The wage freeze and work-rule changes are worth an estimated $2 billion. In  other words, to buy United, the workers, through their unions, are going to  need about $1.3 billion from investors.  </P> <P> That's a real bargain, according to the employees' financial advisers and  others involved in the buyout, including Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.  </P> <P> But, bargain or not, there was limited interest from investors until the unions  got former Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald to lead the buyout and  serve as chairman and chief executive officer if it goes through, as expected.  </P> <P> The UAL buyout might be a model, but the Soviets and the Eastern Europeans will  probably be a bit bewildered by it. They may think it bizarre that, to make the  buyout possible, United's 71,000 workers needed just one key person --  Greenwald.  </P> <P> And while all of those employees will have to freeze their wages for four years  and promise not to strike, Greenwald will get $1.1 million a year plus millions  more in stock options and a $5-million bonus just for agreeing to be their  leader. Even if the deal falls through, he reportedly will walk away with $9  million. True, he has never run an airline before, but he knows finances, and  that's what counts to investors.  </P> <P> John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Assn. of Machinists, who  helped put the deal together, says that while he is still not an enthusiastic  supporter of worker-owned companies, "things were so messed up at United, we  had no choice except to try and buy it, and so with a relatively small  investment we are protecting our jobs and ought to be able to make United a  very successful airline."  </P> <P> However, while investors may be putting all their hopes on Greenwald, in the  real world it is the workers -- with their skills and with key roles in  decision making -- who can make the company succeed and let it serve as a role  model for the Soviets and the Eastern Europeans.  </P></p>

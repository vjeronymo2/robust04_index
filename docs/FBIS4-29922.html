			<p>BFN     [Text] The dear leader has performed undying feats in  increasing the might of our country and making the people's life  affluent by wisely guiding socialist construction.    Each time an important task was raised in socialist economic  construction, he indicated the path to victory by laying down an  outstanding economic strategy and policy and an appropriate  slogan. Under his distinguished leadership, our people have  successfully fulfilled a series of long-range plans and  increased still further the might of the independent national  economy of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and hard work in the teeth of economic blockade  and continued military provocations of the allied forces of  imperialism.    Under his tested guidance, the line of socialist cultural  construction has been implemented successfully and a great  heyday of literature and art has come to this land.    The dear leader has wisely guided the building of the  revolutionary Armed Forces as a whole, thereby strengthening the  People' Army into a cadre, modern steel-like army each one of  which is a match for a hundred foes and turning our country into  a powerful country self-reliant in defence where all people are  armed and the whole territory is fortified.    The dear leader with his outstanding wisdom and wise  guidance  has courageously led the struggle for national reunification,  putting the enemy on the defensive, and strengthened militant  solidarity with the revolutionary parties and peoples of the  world under the banner of independence, peace and friendship,  making an immortal contribution to mankind's cause of  anti-imperialist independence, the cause of socialism, paying  deep attention to the cause of rebuilding and developing the  socialist movement on a new basis.    The reporter called on the whole party and the entire people  to resolutely defend and brilliantly accomplish the cause of  socialism, bearing deep in mind the great national fortune of  having the illustrious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head  of the party and the revolution.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The armed forces must always  realize that the money used for the purchase of weapons comes  from the national budget; that is, tax money collected from the  people. Since the government cannot simply print banknotes, it  must be careful and make sure that the money is spent properly.  It is apparent that someone has profited from commission fees  associated with every weapons purchase the armed forces have  made. Hence, the thundering news conference held by the  military top brass reminds us of the old saying: "A careless  utterance tarnishes a good image."</p>

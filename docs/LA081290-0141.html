			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH DEVICE WILL KEEP TABS ON GANG MEMBERS  </P> <P> Faced with escalating gang violence, including murder, the Los Angeles County  Probation Department is testing a way to keep gang members off the streets  during times of trouble by using a computer.  </P> <P> It works this way:  </P> <P> Gang members who are on probation will be told to stay home during "Red  Alerts," declared by the Probation Department -- in conjunction with police and  sheriff's deputies -- when conflict threatens to escalate into open warfare.  </P> <P> To make sure that they do that, a computer will telephone the designated gang  members at random during the hours they are restricted. The computer will  direct them to state their names and repeat after the computer as it names  several states.  </P> <P> The computer will then electronically analyze their responses and compare the  findings with voice tapes made earlier. If the computer questions any of its  contacts, it will notify monitors, and a probation officer will be sent to  check in person.  </P> <P> The six-month pilot program will be tried first at Aliso Village, a city  housing project east of downtown near the San Bernardino Freeway. The project  is home territory of at least 10 gangs, described by authorities as "very, very  reactive and violent."  </P> <P> "There have been some recent shootings there, and . . . we're really worried  that all hell could break out," said Probation Department Deputy Director  Michael Lindsey.  </P> <P> "We've got to find a way to stop it. . . . We're saying, 'Let's try something  unique.' "  </P> <P> Lindsey is optimistic that it can make a difference in protecting the public  and gang members themselves from gang-related violence that has changed  drastically in recent years.  </P> <P> The veteran probation official recalls that in the early 1970s feuding gang  members intent on retaliation generally played pranks or fought, with a  stabbing "once in a while" or a rare shooting.  </P> <P> "These days, when we have retaliation, we really worry about drive-by  shootings," Lindsey said. "We worry about innocent victims. . . . We worry  about whether it's going to escalate, because there are so many guns out there.  So much firepower and the gangs can become very violent."  </P> <P> And the threat is growing, he noted.  </P> <P> Chris Wong, supervising deputy probation officer of the East Los Angeles gang  unit, said that so far this year there have been at least 15 gang-related  murders in her area, which includes unincorporated regions of East Los Angeles  and Eastside neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At this time last year, 13 people had died in gang-related slayings in her  area, Wong said.  </P> <P> She estimated that there are now at least 82 "very big, active gangs" on the  Eastside alone. In the last year, she said, "they've become extremely violent."  </P> <P> Lindsey expects the computer-monitor program to be in place sometime this  month. If it is deemed a success, he wants to extend electronic monitoring to  the entire county, with upward of 1,000 gang members in the system eventually.  </P> <P> But first, the present program must be perfected, he says.  </P> <P> The $19,000 system employs a computer and voice-analysis software provided free  to the Probation Department for six months by BI Inc., a Boulder, Colo., firm.  </P> <P> Currently, four college students are preparing background information for the  computer on 100 designated gang members. Next, deputy probation officers will  record their charges' voices for comparison by computer.  </P> <P> When gang trouble develops, the police and probation officers will identify the  street gangs involved, determine what members are on probation and tell them  individually to stay home for periodic checks by the computer.  </P> <P> Lindsey hopes that computer-monitoring will afford soft-core gang members an  excuse to stay out of trouble.  </P></p>

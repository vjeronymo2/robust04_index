			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Consultants form strategic alliance R. Watson and Co, the UK's leading actuarial consulting firm, yesterday said it had formed a strategic alliance with US-based benefits consultants The Wyatt Company. The two groups will take a stake in each other. Mr Philip Cobain, senior partner in charge of Watson's UK pension practice, said the firm had sought an international partner because 'our largest clients have subsidiaries all over the world. In five to 10 years we would have been in trouble if we could not have given our clients global advice.' He added that Watson had had many approaches from potential suitors but its senior partners had been anxious to preserve the firm's independence.</p>

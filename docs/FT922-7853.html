			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Shell shares rise on strong first-quarter results SHARES in the Royal Dutch/Shell group, the Anglo-Dutch oil company gained Pounds 1 3/32 to close at Pounds 46 5/8 yesterday as the company announced surprisingly strong first-quarter results. Increased earnings from exploration and production helped the company to increase net income on a historical cost basis to Pounds 858m, up just over 1 per cent from Pounds 847m in the same period last year. With the price of Brent crude around Dollars 3 a barrel lower than in the first quarter of 1991, analysts had forecast figures of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 650m. Current cost net income, which includes stock gains or losses, fell 22 per cent to Pounds 954m from Pounds 1.23bn. The figures reflected a strong performance in upstream and downstream businesses outside North America. Shell said margins in its Asian market remained relatively firm because of lower levels of export from the Middle East and growth in demand. Mr Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said: 'These are very intriguing figures and completely at variance with anything any other company has managed to deliver. They reflect a great deal of success in holding on to margins at the pumps and the refineries.' Shell's oil production in the first quarter rose 6 per cent to 2.22m barrels a day. Gas sales volumes also rose 9 per cent to 8.31bn cu ft a day. Earnings in the exploration and production sector rose to Pounds 468m from Pounds 443m last year, with higher production and special items including a US contract settlement and tax adjustment more than offsetting the lower oil price. Downstream manufacturing and marketing earnings increased to Pounds 298m from Pounds 254m, although they fell on a current cost basis to Pounds 390m from Pounds 624m because of lower margins. Gains from corporate items - including Pounds 85m from exchange rate movements - also boosted the figures. However, the chemicals sector saw income plummet to Pounds 21m from Pounds 89m in the same period in 1991. The 1991 figure was itself a drop of Pounds 70m from 1990. Most of the reduction was in the market outside the US, where lower product margins reflected depressed markets, particularly for bulk petrochemicals. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FINE ARTS SCHOOL IN LAGUNA REJECTS GRANT FROM NEA;  </P> <P> OBSCENITY: THE PRESIDENT OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TELLS THE  FEDERAL AGENCY THAT ACCEPTANCE OF $15,000 WOULD ENDORSE A FORM OF CENSORSHIP.  </P> <P> The Art Institute of Southern California, in rejecting a $15,000 grant from the  National Endowment for the Arts, has become the first Orange County  organization to turn down money from the embattled agency.  </P> <P> On the recommendation of their president, Russell E. Lewis, trustees of the  small fine arts school voted unanimously late last week to turn down the grant  rather than sign an NEA-mandated anti-obscenity certification required of all  1990 grant recipients.  </P> <P> "By accepting the grant, the institution would be taking the first step down  the very dangerous path of censorship," Lewis wrote in a letter to the NEA.  </P> <P> The obscenity clause is the result of protests from right-wing groups against  federal support of art exhibits containing controversial work. In its 1990  funding bill for the NEA, Congress last fall outlawed support for obscene work  that does not meet unspecified artistic standards.  </P> <P> In his letter, Lewis voiced support of the NEA as "a major force in the  fostering of creativity in America," but protested the congressional ruling:  "Speech and expression should not be restricted or legislated by Congress."  </P> <P> About a dozen artists and arts groups across the country have rejected NEA  grants to protest the obscenity oath. They include Los Angeles' Bella Lewitzky  Dance Co. and the New School for Social Research, a university in New York  City, both of which have sued the NEA over the new restriction.  </P> <P> Several Orange County arts groups have written the NEA to protest the  anti-obscenity certification, but until now none had turned down grants.  Indeed, the Pacific Symphony, Pacific Chorale, Laguna Art Museum, Orange County  Philharmonic Society and Opera Pacific all have accepted grants. The Newport  Harbor Art Museum has not decided whether to accept three pending grants  totaling $100,000.  </P> <P> About 100 students attend the Art Institute, the only art institute in Orange  County that awards a bachelor of fine arts degree. Plans call for enrollment to  triple over the next several years. In his letter, Lewis wrote of the impact of  the grant rejection decision on students.  </P> <P> "As a practicing attorney and president of an institution dedicated to  fostering creativity in the intellects of college students, I would find it  impossible to in any way sanction actions which erode the rights guaranteed by  the First Amendment to the United States Constitution," he wrote.  </P> <P> The NEA grant would have been the school's first and would have subsidized  planning of an on-campus, outdoor public sculpture park, a spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

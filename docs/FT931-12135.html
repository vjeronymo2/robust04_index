			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / MPs favour turning the tide of coal imports: The trade and industry committee's proposals for making mining competitive RECENT growth in coal imports will be rapidly reversed under proposals to be made by the Commons trade and industry committee. The recommendations are likely to be adopted at least in part in the government's white paper on energy. The electricity generators, which until last October were preparing for further strong import growth, have begun to tell overseas suppliers to expect cuts in demand and are not renewing contracts. The likelihood is that import facilities that National Power and PowerGen have built up in the past two years at a cost of more than Pounds 150m will, in the near future at least, be significantly under-used. Cutting imports is by no means a simple option for the government. Last year the UK imported about 20m tonnes of coal, not all of which could be replaced by UK coal. About 8m, brought in by British Steel, is coking coal of a type not available in Britain. Other large companies import directly and would want to keep a toe in the international market. One opening would be provided if British Coal could prove its claim that some foreign coal is dumped on the European market. But neither the European Commission nor the government has shown much enthusiasm for this. British Coal's chances of competing are also hindered by the quality of its output. One company that buys coal from Colombia says the sulphur content is less than half of most British coal. But the main problem is price. The UK suffers because of the age of its industry, which means that most coal near the surface has already been extracted. Cheaper opencast mines are plentiful in countries such as Colombia, the US and Australia, helping them to deliver to UK ports for between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.20 a gigajoule. In tentative contracts with generators, drawn up before the pit closures announcement, British Coal was to charge Pounds 1.51 a gigajoule for the 40m tonnes envisaged in the year from April 1993, falling to Pounds 1.33 by the end of the five-year contracts. Most analysts and British Coal expect production costs will be considerably lower by then. In the meantime import prices, although currently falling, are expected to rise. This is partly because of an increase in shipping and insurance rates and partly because the US is likely to want more low-sulphur coal, currently exported in large quantities, for its domestic market. All this means that UK coal could be internationally competitive in Britain at least by the mid to late 1990s. The problem is what to do before then. The Commons committee's answer is to provide a subsidy for 19m tonnes, some of it to replace imports. The money would come from either the nuclear levy or the taxpayer. The idea still faces opposition from the cabinet and may yet be challenged by other coal-producing countries citing protectionism. But as options narrow, some sort of financial support looks increasingly likely.</p>

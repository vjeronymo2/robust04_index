			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- The ZHONGGUO JIAO YU BAO  [China Education Journal] reported that Hunan's Xintian County  has never owed its teachers any pay and that all funds due them  have been paid in full all these years.    Xintian County takes three measures to guarantee the payment  of teachers' salaries. First, educational funds are budgeted at  the beginning of a fiscal year with appropriate annual  increments according to needs, making very sure that funds for  personnel are adequate. Second, when money is tight, top  priority is given to teachers' salaries. Because Xintian County  derives its revenue from flue-cured tobacco, all funds will have  to go to the procurement of tobacco leaves in the first half of  the year, and revenues will only be collected in the second half  of the year when peasants sell their crops. As such, the county  has established the following priorities for paying salaries:  middle and primary school teachers first, grass-roots cadres  next, and units directly under the county government last.  Third, individual villages and towns having difficulties will  receive the personal attention of the secretary and the county  head.    Because they have been affected by the financial and  taxation  reform, the county's revenues will be reduced sharply this year.  What happens to teachers' salaries? After study, the county has  found its way out of the situation by dividing the educational  funds into three parts -- funds for organ and school personnel,  projects, and funds -- with separate management.</p>

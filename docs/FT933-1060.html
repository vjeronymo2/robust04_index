			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stronger on crisis THE CONTINUING crisis in Russia was again the dominant theme in currency markets yesterday, pushing the dollar up to a high of DM1.6575 on the day, writes James Blitz. For most of this week, the movements in the dollar/exchange rate have been entirely determined by events in Moscow. Yesterday, the dollar got off to a very strong start as news was flashed on agency screens that there had been shooting outside the headquarters of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Yeltsin's order that troops inside the White House building had to disarm themselves also helped the dollar to its highs for the day. An additional factor was the onset of the weekend: few dealers wanted to be short of dollars over Saturday and Sunday lest events got out of control. However, towards the end of European trading yesterday, a succession of statements suggested that there would be no violence in Moscow in the immediate future, and the dollar drifted down again. The US currency closed at DM1.6485 from a previous DM1.6450. Events in Moscow are so unpredictable that it would probably be unwise for any dealer to be too short of dollars next week. But the experience of the market is that political crises like the Gulf War and the overthrow of President Gorbachev have only short term effects on exchange rates, and the dollar is likely to drift down again. The Bundesbank meeting in two weeks time will also be Mr Hans Tietmeyer's first as Bundesbank President - so there is unlikely to be any easing in German monetary policy until October 7 at the very earliest. The D-Mark's performance on the European crosses matched that against the dollar. While weak in the European morning, the D-Mark soon came back. It closed unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.481. The Danish krone has had a far more robust performance in recent days, and was further helped by yesterday's  1/2 percentage point cut in Danish interest rates. It closed at DKr4.04 from a previous DKr4.07. Sterling had a weaker performance against the D-Mark than any other currency. Thursday night's report from the Confederation of British Industry showed that export orders for manufactured goods have slipped this month to their lowest level since April. This prompted more rate cut speculation in sterling money markets and this had a knock-on effect on the currency, which closed at DM2.4750 from a previous DM2.4775.</p>

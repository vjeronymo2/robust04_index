			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Leading Article: Conservatives and the Union JOHN MAJOR has played the Union card, but he is unlikely to find it a trump. The disillusioned home buyers of England are shaken by their economic prospects, not stirred by past tunes of glory. Nor will Scots thus be frightened into supporting the party of Mrs Thatcher's English ascendancy. Even if Mr Major were to win by these means, his victory would be Pyrrhic. A fourth Conservative term would be more likely to increase Scotland's disillusionment than reconcile it to the status quo. The worry is whether, however tactically inept, Mr Major is right to prophesy that Scottish devolution would lead to dissolution of the UK. For where he is correct is in his belief that the Union is worth preserving. Scots do not disagree. According to the polls, parties supporting the Union are likely to obtain almost three quarters of the Scottish vote. At the same time, the party supporting the status quo is likely to get less than a quarter of the vote. How then can the Scots be denied what they obviously want: a greater degree of autonomy within a still United Kingdom? They cannot be. The question is rather how that desire can be accommodated. The difficulty - the so-called 'west Lothian question' - is how to reconcile Scottish home rule with politically legitimate government in England. Untenable solution The Labour party hopes to have its cake while eating it. It plans to rule Scotland with its Scottish votes, but also to rule England with its Scottish votes. It intends to give a new Scottish parliament control over local government, health, housing, transport, the environment and some economic powers, including the right to alter income tax by 3p in the pound. Meanwhile, it wishes to introduce a feebler form of regional government into England, but otherwise to rule England from Westminster on the basis of a presence that will probably include some 50 Scottish members. This would prove no more tenable a solution than the status quo is to Scotland now. An ad hoc solution would be to reduce Scottish representation from its present level of 72 MPs to a more demographically correct level of around 58. The justification for combining Scottish devolution with government of England by a Westminster parliament with such a reduced Scottish representation, would be that Scotland is so outweighted by England in the determination of the Union's common policies that its voters should be allowed a compensating say in English internal matters. The acceptability of such a solution to the English (if not to the Labour party) might be further enhanced by lowering Scottish representation at Westminster below that justified by its share in the population of the UK. Alternative way An alternative solution would be to admit that what is sauce for the Scottish goose is sauce for the English gander. Yet if only English representatives could vote on purely English matters, there might have to be a separate government of England. Even if limited to supposedly internal matters, such a government would be an even more formidable rival to the Union government than Mr Yeltsin's Russia was to Mr Gorbachev's Soviet Union. Finally, England might be federalised. Provided the powers given to the new 'states' were roughly comparable to those granted to the proposed Scottish parliament, this would avoid the anomalies of the other two options. But there remains a large problem. England has no history that would support such a division. Local government is one thing; federation another. The demand for a degree of Scottish self-government cannot be resisted. On this, Mr Major is wrong and the Labour party quite right. But the Union should also be preserved. This cannot be done if Scottish self-government is not combined with further radical changes to the government of the UK. Somehow a way must be found, acceptable to people on both sides of the border, that will preserve the Union, while giving Scotland the autonomy it seeks. Nobody should be fooled into believing it will be easy to find; nobody should be fooled into believing it can be found without deep changes in British government; but nobody should be fooled into believing that it can be stopped by just saying no.</p>

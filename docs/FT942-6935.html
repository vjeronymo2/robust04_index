			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: New condom helps LIG gain foothold in Japan A new polyurethane condom is set to take London International Group into the Pounds 430m-a-year Japanese condom market for the first time. LIG, the world leader in branded condoms, yesterday announced a joint venture with Okamoto Industries, which has 56 per cent of the Japanese market. Japan, with 3.8m condoms sold annually, is second only to the US in the world market. But the US market is valued at only Pounds 262m a year, partly because the Japanese are more prepared to pay for quality. LIG claimed last year that its new Avanti condoms represented a technical breakthrough. The polyurethane product, to be known as Duron, is twice as strong as latex, enabling the manufacture of very thin condoms.</p>

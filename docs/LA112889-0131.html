			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DO WE MISS THE BIG PICTURE WITH OUR SPLIT-SCREEN LIVES?;  </P> <P> BEHAVIOR: SPEEDED-UP NOTIONS OF EFFICIENCY AND TIME MANAGEMENT PRESSURE PEOPLE  INTO BELIEVING THAT DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE GETS TWICE AS MUCH ACCOMPLISHED.  </P> <P> I am watching an ad for a new television set that offers a screen within its  screen. The beauty of this technology, I am told, is that it lets the viewer  watch one channel while scanning the others.  </P> <P> But this particular electronic creature gives you more than a window of  opportunity into the wide world of network and cable television. If you are  into double vision, it actually lets you watch two channels at the same time.  </P> <P> I confess that I have trouble finding one program I want to watch, let alone  two. But I am convinced that this is a product of superb marketing strategy. It  is attuned to the updated and speeded-up notions of efficiency and time  management that now rule our lives.  </P> <P> Remember the quaint needle-pointed idea taught by childhood teachers? The idea  was that we should do "One Thing at a Time." To this day, many of us fight  losing battles with our children in a vain attempt to convince them that they  cannot learn multiplication tables while listening to New Kids on the Block and  watching MTV.  </P> <P> It is time to admit that most adults are leading split-screen lives. Nobody who  is anybody does just one thing any more. Our burgeoning breed of 1-minute  managers, in-putters and maximizers of potential have come to believe that  those who do two things at once get twice as much accomplished.  </P> <P> Busy-ness itself is no longer a symptom of workaholicism but a badge of  efficiency. Such twofers as dialing and driving have become status symbols for  executives. It isn't considered ditsy any more to drink coffee, apply makeup  and insert contact lenses while commuting to work. It's seen, perversely, as  being well-organized.  </P> <P> Time is now regarded as a precious and rare resource, so wasting it is the  modern sin of human ecology. We are expected to conserve, even recycle, every  minute and to use several of our five senses at a time. So it is that we have  come to breakfast with the newspaper and our kids, lunch with business  associates and print-outs and shower with a waterproof radio.  </P> <P> This double- and triple-shifting comes with its own technology. We are able to  watch one television program while taping a second, vacuum while talking on a  portable phone, bike 20 miles on an Exercycle while studying Swahili from a  tape and log on to our portable computer in an airport waiting room. And so we  do.  </P> <P> What's behind all this is the true passion of the times: a lust for  productivity. Remember the pursuit of the elusive simultaneous orgasm? We now  pursue the illusion of simultaneous accomplishments.  </P> <P> There is a course offered in Cambridge, Mass., that teaches students several  languages at the same time. That is nothing compared to the curriculum we set  up for ourselves. Those who pass today's finals must be able to spend time with  their kids while losing weight and making three new business contacts during  one intensive hour at the gym. Is it any wonder we are suffering from  performance anxiety?  </P> <P> This ideal of simultaneous accomplishments fuels the favorite fantasy of the  decade that if we were only more organized and blessed with all the proper  electronic helpers, we would be able to squeeze at least two lives into the  time for one. Instead of making choices, we think we can make time.  </P> <P> When life is as split as the new television set, the second screen does show  you a whole lot of options. But when it's on, funny how much harder it seems to  focus on the big picture.  </P></p>

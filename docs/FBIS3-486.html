			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, the director of  Nigeria's defense information, has reasserted Nigeria's claim to  the Bakassi Peninsula. He said that the peninsula, including  its eastern part of (?Zabari), had been part of Nigerian  territory since 1914 and will remain so.    Speaking on a Voice of Nigeria interview, Brig. Gen. Chijuka  said the territory which Cameroonians are also claiming, was  handed over to Nigeria at independence by the British who  themselves had controlled the area since their 1914 agreement  with the French. He said that because of its brotherly attitude  towards its neighbors, Nigeria has consistently refused to be  provoked by the incessant crossborder harassments by Cameroon,  some of which had resulted in the loss of Nigerian lives. The  defense information director said Cameroon had not reciprocated  Nigeria's good neighborliness and so Nigeria now had a prime  objective to assert its presence in the peninsula and make all  know that the area belongs to it.</p>

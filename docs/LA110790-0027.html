			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN KEY RACES, BUSH HAD LITTLE OR NO IMPACT;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE: AN AIDE SAYS GOP LOSS OF THE TEXAS GOVERNOR'S RACE WAS 'VERY HARD  ON THE PRESIDENT.' BUSH ALSO STUMPED HARD IN FLORIDA TO NO AVAIL.  </P> <P> For politicians, sometimes it is the personal losses that count most. Ann  Richards, for example.  </P> <P> President Bush spent the last three days of the 1990 election season in Texas  trying to defeat the woman who ridiculed him in 1988 as "poor George . . . born  with a silver foot in his mouth." He lost.  </P> <P> Bush also spent three days in Florida, stumping for the Republican candidate  for governor, Bob Martinez, whose campaign chairman was Bush's son, Jeb. He  lost.  </P> <P> And at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., Bush held a fund-raiser to boost  the local Republican congressional candidate, David Emery. He lost.  </P> <P> It could have been worse, of course. Bush, a former Republican Party chairman,  spent weeks on the campaign trail over the last year helping his party's  nominees. And many won. Republicans held their losses in the House to a minimum  and won several close Senate contests. Moreover, Republican candidates  prevailed in several important gubernatorial contests.  </P> <P> But in most of the cases where GOP candidates won, even the White House was not  claiming that Bush made the difference.  </P> <P> In many states, most notably California, candidates such as Sen. Pete Wilson  welcomed Bush's aid in raising money, but Administration officials conceded  early on that Bush would have a minimal political impact on the outcome.  </P> <P> By contrast, Bush and his advisers had hoped the President could make a  personal difference in a few states, particularly his adopted home of Texas.  </P> <P> Losing the Texas governor's race was "very rough on the President," said one  aide as Bush sat with friends, watching election returns on television in the  White House.  </P> <P> Not so long ago, the President, who got his political start in Texas, and his  political advisers "were looking for a real break (all the way) down the  ticket" in the Lone Star State, the aide said. White House strategists had  hoped Bush's personal popularity would help the party not only capture the  Statehouse but also several other statewide offices and a couple of  congressional seats currently held by Democrats.  </P> <P> The Republicans had hoped for a similar boost in Florida, one of Bush's  strongest states and the one in which Jeb, the only one of Bush's sons to  launch a political career, has major ambitions.  </P> <P> But in recent weeks, rising concern about the economy and declining faith in  Bush's leadership weakened the President's ability to help his party's  nominees. In several states, in fact, Republican candidates privately told Bush  to stay away, then embarrassed the White House by leaking that information to  the press.  </P> <P> Tuesday night, Administration aides were taking some pleasure in noting that  many of the Republicans who had shunned Bush did no better than the ones who  had welcomed him.  </P> <P> In Illinois, for example, Republican Jim Edgar was trailing Democrat Neil F.  Hartigan in their tight race for the Statehouse. Edgar had made a point this  past weekend of asking Bush not to come to Illinois. And in Oregon, Republican  Dave Frohnmayer, who had invited Bush to campaign for him early in the year but  shunned the White House this fall, appeared to have lost his gubernatorial race  to Democrat Barbara Roberts anyway.  </P> <P> But to round out a bad night for the White House, returns finally came in from  Hawaii, where Bush had campaigned for Rep. Patricia Saiki to unseat Democratic  Sen. Daniel K. Akaka. She lost.  </P></p>

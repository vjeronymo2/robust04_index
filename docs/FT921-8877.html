			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Horton's dual role to be questioned by shareholders BP's institutional shareholders plan to question Mr Robert Horton, its chairman and chief executive, over his dual role. The shareholders said that company's poor fourth-quarter results announced yesterday, and its forecast of tough trading conditions ahead, had forced them to focus on a corporate governance question that up until now had remained a background issue for the company. Mr Horton and other senior BP board officials typically conduct a series of shareholder meetings in the weeks following release of year-end figures. The Bank of England-backed Institutional Shareholders Committee and the Association of British Insurers urge the functions of chairman and chief executive be filled by different people. 'It's obvious that (Mr) Horton is a strong personality and he might need a different chairman to counterbalance that,' one shareholder said. While the dual nature of his role would have caused no more than a passing comment at other times, concern is mounting about BP's long-term strategy and its dividend policy, shareholders said. Mr Horton had earlier promised that dividends would maintain their value in real terms and failure to increase it signals a change in policy. 'We want to know exactly what the dividend policy is,' one shareholder said. Institutional shareholders expressed concern that the dividend may have to be cut in nominal terms later this year. Meanwhile, Mr Horton has responded to shareholder unease by agreeing to appear at a breakfast meeting for oil industry analysts that is usually headed by Mr David Simon, managing director.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abir Fu'ad: "AL-SABIL Visits Al-Quds Radio in </F> Damascus"]    [Excerpts] For years, we have been hearing Al-Quds Radio.  It carries a militant voice that we have missed very much,  especially these days when we are almost suffocated by the dust  of [the Arab-Israeli] talks, whose only objective is to destroy  our cause and terminate our existence. This radio conveys to us  the daily heroic actions of our kinsfolk in Palestine, always  accompanied by songs of revolution and jihad.    It is unlike the other Arab radios filling the airwaves. It  has been distinctly successful in attracting listeners of other  radios inside and outside the occupied territories. Having won  keen and regular listeners, the radio dedicated all its  resources to reporting on and following Palestinian events  anywhere at anytime.    When I arrived in Damascus, I immediately began to look for  the radio building. Few people were familiar with the place.  Therefore, it took me some time before I managed to arrive at  the radio building. It was not a big surprise to me when I  found nothing but a small, old four-story building, the first  story of which is occupied by the radio station. This building  is surrounded by shops and other residential buildings. The  only thing that distinguishes it from other buildings is an  armed guard standing at its gate. I was not surprised because I  knew that the radio officials wanted to keep its location secret  so that it would not become an easy target for attacks or acts  of sabotage.    Since its establishment, this radio has continued its role  of  invigorating our Palestinian people and their struggle against  their enemies, both overt and covert, including those who hide  their treachery and treason under guises of political wisdom.    Al-Quds Radio has managed to worry and annoy Israel, which  was prompted jam it despite the high costs, which has amounted  to millions of dollars. For this purpose, Israel used jamming  devices at the building of the Ramallah radio, something Israel  has not done against any other Arab radio.    Abu-Shadi [Fadl Shururu], director general of the al-Quds  Radio, says: Al-Quds Radio began its experimental transmission  in 1987, and officially announced its name on 1 January 1988,  when it began to identify itself as: "Al-Quds, the Palestinian  Arab Radio on the Road to Liberation of Land and Man." Only 20  days after the beginning of its official transmission, the  Zionists began to jam the radio on the recommendation of  terrorist Mike Gurdus, [Israeli radio's] specialist in  monitoring Arab radios in the Middle East.    Not long after the blessed intifadah broke out, Al-Quds  Radio began broadcasting to become one of the continuous factors  of incitement for our kinsfolk to continue struggle and  steadfastness in face of the Zionist enemy.    The radio broadcasts statements issued by Palestinian  resistance factions, which call for strikes and demonstrations.  It also transmits patriotic songs and follows Palestinian  developments and broadcasts these developments as soon as the  necessary information is available. All this explain the  enemy's costly attempt to jam the radio.    In one occasion, Al-Quds Radio was forced to make 56  frequency changes to evade the Zionist jamming. The  continuation of these jamming attempts by the enemy gave the  workers of the radio lots of experience in changing frequencies  quickly -- in less than two minutes. It is noteworthy that the  radio broadcasts on three waves: the medium, short, and FM waves.    The radio's transmission begins at 0900 and lasts until  2000.  Hence, the question is raised: If the radio shoulders the  responsibility of this important media role to serve our people  and their cause, are the limited transmission hours enough to  realize this objective?    Abu-Shadi says: We wish that we could continue transmitting  24 hours a day because we need to maintain contacts with our  people, but this requires huge material capabilities that are  not available at present. In fact, some large quarters are  prepared to buy our radio on the condition they would turn it  into one of their media horns that markets their ideas and  policies.    The small size of the place is another obstacle to the  development and growth of the radio. As I said before, the  radio is in one floor of a building in which all radio  departments, including the studios, are present.    In the editorial room, which is no more than 3 by 4 square  meters, nearly eight people sit at a rectangular table to edit  news and write reports. You can see the editor of the Russian  newscast beside the editor of the Hebrew newscast, and beside  them sits the editor of the Arabic newscast. The constraints of  the place may cause some problems here or there, but of course  does not prevent the continuation of work in constant force and  enthusiasm. [passage omitted]    The radio also seeks to effect communication with non-Arab  communities. For, it airs programs targeting Jewish immigrants  in Palestine. The radio airs its programs in seven languages,  in addition to Arabic. These languages are the following:  Hebrew, Russian, French, Italian, English, Spanish, and  Romanian. As a matter of fact, the radio has not thus far  received any real feedback from target listeners on these  programs. But, the radio director is almost certain that the  radio programs are also listened to by Jews in Palestine. The  very reasons that prompt the Palestinians of the occupied  territories to listen to this radio's programs are bound to  prompt Jews to do so, the radio director argues.    Having debated with Abu-Shadi the media role being played by  Palestinian factions, I wanted to ask him about the clearly  stepped-up Islamic sentiments enshrined in the programs aired by  this radio, particularly since the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], which is  managing this radio station, has not been known as a front that  promotes Islamic sensibilities. When I asked him this question,  he was disturbed. He retorted, saying: The fact that the radio  was launched by the PFLP-GC does not mean that it belongs to the  PFLP-GC. Al-Quds Radio is the radio of the Palestinian masses  inside and outside the occupied territories. It is the radio of  those denied the chance to make their voices heard. It is not  affiliated with any Palestinian resistance faction. At any  rate, I hope that we will someday become Muslims in deed, and  not only in word, Abu-Shadi added.    Fast reporting is an equally important factor that has  contributed to the radio's wide popularity. The radio is quick  to report on news stories. By the way, the radio has listeners  in various parts of the Arab homeland, as well as Europe.  Abu-Shadi adds: Fast reporting, and accuracy in broadcasting  developments in the occupied territories have enhanced the  radio's reputation, and allowed it to increase the number of its  listeners. These factors have also given rise to myths about  the radio. When the radio first began transmission, there were  numerous guesses as to where it was transmitting from. The  radio was reported to have been transmitting from a secret place  in Jerusalem. In an opinion poll conducted in London last year,  Al-Quds Radio came ahead of both the BBC Arabic Service and  Monte Carlo Radio in terms of preference by listeners.    To obtain its news stories, the radio depends on a network  of  correspondents inside the occupied territories. Abu-Shadi  believes that it is enough for a Palestinian to be a true  patriot enjoying a high sense of responsibility toward his cause  and people to qualify as a correspondent for the Al-Quds Radio.  Zionist troops once apprehended several correspondents of the  radio in Gaza, Rafah, and Nabulus. But, these correspondents  had already trained others to do their job and accomplish news  assignments. Correspondents use fax machines to send their news  reports to the radio in Damascus. The radio also has  subscriptions with several international news agencies; and this  enables the radio to cover Arab and international developments.  Nonetheless, the radio airs news agency-datelined Palestinian  news stories only after it receives a confirmation of these  stories from its correspondents in the occupied territories.  [passage omitted]    [Fu'ad] Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, and  even before that, the Al-Quds Radio has been opposed to the  peace process. What will happen to your radio if Syria  concludes a peace treaty with Israel?    [Shururu] We at Al-Quds Radio still believe that what is  being done is capitulation, rather than peace. We mean what we  say. How can we expect the achievement of peace at a time when  our people are still displaced, and when their objectives are  yet to be achieved? If the Israelis give the Arabs back the  Golan and southern Lebanon, and deny me the right to regain my  land and national soil, there will be no peace. As long as  there is a good reason for Palestinian children to continue to  carry stones, there is no room for any talk of peace. If and  when the Syrian leadership signs a peace agreement with Israel,  providing for a recognition of Israel, something which I cannot  believe even if I were to see it with my own eyes, then we can  discuss this development. In this regard, I would like to  emphasize that Al-Quds Radio is not the only weapon in the hands  of our people. It is an instigator. Our people's struggle will  not come to a halt with any cessation in the radio's  transmission.    [Fu'ad] Then, is it possible that Al-Quds Radio will halt  its  transmission?    [Shururu, smiling] If this were to be forced on us, there is  nothing we can do to ward off such a development.    [Fu'ad] This is Al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab radio  along the path of liberating land and man. It has continued to  exemplify a mature media perspective. We hope that many of our  Arab radio stations will emulate Al-Quds Radio. We acknowledge  that the example this radio has provided is not flawless, for  there is always room for improvement in the radio's performance.    We salute Al-Quds Radio and its employees.</p>

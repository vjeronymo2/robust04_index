			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (8): Buying policies overhauled - Challenges mount as US vehicle makers face stiff competition THE challenges facing the US automobile components industry were graphically underlined recently when General Motors summoned some 600 of its suppliers to a meeting in Michigan and spelt out a radical new approach to its purchasing policies. GM's new approach should mean significant sales opportunities for the strongest, most efficient and most global components companies, but it is also likely to drive smaller, weaker operations out of business. It is therefore likely to accelerate the consolidation that has already been taking place in the US parts industry over the past decade as companies have come to grips with global competition, a growing Japanese presence in the US market, profound changes in the way vehicles are made, and a severe North American recession. The recession has meant a sharp drop in US car and light truck sales - from 13.89m units in 1990 to 12.33m in 1991 - and this year is expected to produce only modest recovery. The Big Three automobile assemblers plunged heavily into the red in 1991. Their components suppliers, thanks to rationalisation measures which cut 100,000 jobs from the industry in the 1980s, suffered less severely, although many saw a sharp drop in profits, due to lack of demand and pricing pressures from Detroit. For example, GM saved Dollars 2bn in 1991 by demanding that suppliers cut prices over three years - by 3 per cent in the first 12 months, then by 2 per cent in the next 12 and another 2 per cent in the final year. Just as the industry starts to emerge from recession, GM is now asking for more price concessions, under the new purchasing policy spelled out at the Michigan meeting by Mr Ignacio Lopez. Mr Lopez, who helped turn around GM Europe in the 1980s through his innovative purchasing policies, has been given the task of doing the same in North America, following April's coup by GM directors dissatisfied with the pace of change inside the business. According to the unhappy suppliers, Mr Lopez has asked them to rebid on contracts they had already won for the 1993 model year and there are suggestions GM will no longer provide up-front money for the tooling suppliers need to make their components. More positively for the supply industry, Mr Lopez also said that GM's own huge, cossetted parts operations would henceforth have to compete for contracts with outside, non-union shops. And he offered GM's help in cutting suppliers' costs through a sharing of expertise and he held out the carrot, for successful suppliers, of selling products to GM worldwide under long-term contracts. For the most efficient suppliers, the overall effect should be positive. 'The GM move has been heartening to the independent side of the business as a whole,' says Mr Greg Macosko, an analyst in New York with Quest Advisory. 'It sees a real opportunity out there.' The trend to global sourcing, and the use of fewer suppliers, linked closely with the vehicle assembler in a long-term relationship, is hardly unique to GM. It has long been common among Japanese manufacturers as a way of cutting costs and increasing quality and has been adopted increasingly by assemblers in North America and Europe. The establishment by Japanese assemblers of plants in North America during the 1980s, and their heavy reliance on US subsidiaries of Japanese parts manufacturers, was a big setback to US-owned suppliers as the Japanese took an ever increasing share of the US vehicle market. However, several factors may now slightly ameliorate, though not remove, this threat. First, statistics for the past few months suggest that Japanese assemblers are finding it more difficult to gain market share. Second, there are increasing political pressures for them to buy parts from American-owned companies. Third, they seem a little more willing to 'buy American' from companies which have convinced them of the quality of their products. However, the opportunities for US suppliers making significant inroads in this area seem limited. At the same time, the 400 or so Japanese parts manufacturers which have set up in the US, and are often losing money in supplying their compatriots, may try to bid aggressively for business from Detroit. An increasing number of the Japanese parts suppliers have set up joint venture operations in North America with US companies, with the aim of serving the Japanese and American assemblers. Mr Macosko believes that over the long term many of the American companies participating in these operations may simply lose their independent identity and be absorbed into the joint ventures. Most the the strongest US components suppliers have long had a substantial presence in the European market, but most of them are now seeking to reinforce this, through acquisitions and green-field investments, in fast-growing sectors. For example, Cleveland-based TRW is investing some Dollars 500m on its power rack and pinion steering business to meet growing demand, much of it in western Europe. And Morton International, the Chicago-based group, recently announced plans to invest in a joint venture with Robert Bosch, the German engineering group, in a European plant to make emergency airbags for cars. Morton has the biggest share of the US market for airbags, which is expanding rapidly thanks to consumer demand and government regulation. Morton sees big potential in the European market, where airbags are rare at present, as does TRW, its main US rival in the business.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 US AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS INDUSTRY 1989          Companies with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank   Corporation                                 Sales (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1      GM Automotive Components Group                29.0 2      Ford Automotive Components Operations         13.5* 3      Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber                        10.9 4      Dana                                           4.9 5      Allied-Signal Automotive                       3.8 6      GM Hughes                                      3.5        Cummins Engine Company                         3.5 8      TRW Automotive                                 3.4        Acustar                                        3.4 10     ITT Automotive                                 2.9 11     Rockwell Automotive                            2.4 12     Eaton                                          2.1 13     United Technologies Automotive                 1.9        Magna International                            1.9 15     Tenneco Automotive                             1.8 16     Masco Industries                               1.7 17     Echlin                                         1.5 18     Arvin                                          1.2        Kelsey-Hayes                                   1.2 20     Lear Seating                                   1.1        Federal Mogul                                  1.1 22     Borg-Warner Automotive                         1.0        Gates Rubber Company                           1.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Estimate  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 US AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS SECTOR 1987-89  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  1987     1988     1989  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value of product shipments (Dollars bn)*         87.8     91.4     96.0 Employment (000)                                  631      639      649 Shipments per worker (Dollars 000)                139      143      148 Value of imports (Dollars bn)                    26.8     31.0     33.2 Import penetration (%)                           26.7     29.5     29.8 Value of exports (Dollars bn)                    14.4     17.8     17.8 Exports as % of shipments                        16.4     19.0     18.5 Trade deficit (Dollars bn)                       12.4     13.5     15.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Excludes services provided by establishments in the automotive parts and accessories industry and tyres and batteries  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

According to the FRY president's  general secretariat [as received], President Lilic added that it  is the FRY's desire that this visit should to be an important  step in the promotion of bilateral relations, especially in the  sphere of economic cooperation which is of great importance for  both countries, stressing that mutual trust and cooperation is  what a true relationship between neighbors should be.    "Within the framework of this cooperation," President Lilic  said, "the Serbian minority in Hungary and the Hungarian  minority in Yugoslavia should represent an important cohesive  factor. As for the FRY, Hungarians living there enjoy all the  rights of national minorities in accordance with the highest  international standards, as well as full equality as citizens.  I hope that the same criterion applies to the Serbian minority  in Hungary," President Lilic said.    Speaking about the aim of his visit, Minister Jeszenszky  underscored that Hungary is aware of the importance and  complexity of the present situation in the FRY and that it  wishes peace to be established in war-affected areas of former  Yugoslavia as soon as possible and that our two countries should  consolidate their mutual relations. This visit reassured me  that the FRY firmly intends to help resolve the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in a peaceful way, Jeszenszky said, adding  that he realizes Yugoslavia is doing everything in its power to  fully achieve this aim.    Minister Jeszenszky spoke in particular about prospects of  the unification of Europe saying that the FRY should be included  in this framework. "As we already know," the Hungarian foreign  minister said, "Hungarians live in several countries and Hungary  will try to resolve the issue of the cultural and national  identity of its minority, not by changing the borders but  through European processes of unification."    "We are also in favor of a united Europe," President Lilic  stressed, "but for a Europe where all peoples and countries are  equal. The behavior of certain members of the European and  international communities -- especially the introduction of the  unprecedented and inhuman sanctions against our country -- shows  that such an ideal has not yet been attained. The efforts made  by the FRY are being ignored -- although certain changes have  been detected recently and the truth is slowly becoming apparent  -- despite the fact that, since the very outbreak of the crisis  in former Yugoslavia and especially the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia always advocated a peaceful  solution to all disputes and a negotiated settlement. Our  consistent adherence to a policy of peace, as well as our  constructive stand and significant contribution to the  acceptance of all the conditions set by the European Union at  the latest round of the Geneva talks, did not result in the  lifting of sanctions. It became obvious after the latest round  of negotiations just how absurd it is to punish Yugoslavia  because one side in Bosnia-Herzegovina opted for war,  unfortunately with support from certain world circles.  Evidently, President Lilic concluded, somebody in the world  cares more about the sanctions against the FRY than about peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Underlining that the sanctions against the FRY are  inflicting  severe damage to Yugoslavia and its neighbors, President Lilic  said he hopes Hungary will significantly alter its stands on the  sanctions and urge the international community more resolutely  to lift them.    We all have to make an appraisal of the consequences of this  unhappy period for our entire region, Geza Jeszenszky said,  which should be forgotten -- like a bad dream. The Hungarian  Government and people wish to see mutual relations and economic  cooperation develop. In this respect, Minister Jeszenszky  added, Hungary will work within the framework of the  international community to improve conditions for the  realization of all that is in our mutual interest.    The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic.</p>

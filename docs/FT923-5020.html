			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bowater squeezes by Judging by the performance of Bowater's shares over the past three years, the market views the company as a model of how to manage in recession. The technique, underlined by yesterday's 19 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, is to squeeze higher margins from some well-defined core businesses. Sales have barely increased since Mr Norman Ireland arrived from BTR in 1987, but profits have grown by 230 per cent over the same period. The acquisitions of DRG and Cope Allman this year have brought more raw material with which to work: operating margins are significantly lower than elsewhere in the group. On past experience this alone should leave scope for earnings growth as efficiency gains feed through to the bottom line. Yet the acquisitions also leave Bowater more heavily exposed to a European packaging market which is showing signs of stagnation. Weak pulp and plastics prices are behind a deflationary cycle which encompasses lower selling prices and pressure on margins. Discounting acquisitions, Bowater's first-half profits from Europe were actually down on last year. The strategy is to defend prices, but margin improvements will be hard to achieve until conditions improve. A sharp increase in provisions may point to some formidable challenges for management. Bowater may be robust enough to pursue its ambitions elsewhere. Gearing of 35 per cent should allow for some smaller acquisitions in less depressed markets. Capital expenditure has fallen but remains comfortably ahead of depreciation. From this position the company must stand a fighting chance of living up to the market's high expectations. A price earnings ratio of 14 times this year's forecast earnings demands no less.</p>

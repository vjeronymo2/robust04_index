			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Mareva injunction ruling defines SIB's powers - Legal Briefs The UK's Securities and Investments Board does not have to give cross-undertakings in damages in relation to Mareva injunctions granted to support claims for restitution and compensation, the High Court has ruled. Mareva injunctions are granted to prevent defendants removing their assets from the jurisdiction of UK courts in order to avoid a judgment. The ruling in SIB's action against Mr Ian Lloyd-Wright, an offshore investment salesman, is widely seen as a significant definition of SIB's powers. It is the first occasion the issue has been fully argued in court. SIB has been granted a number of injunctions restraining the movement of Mr Lloyd-Wright's assets, including one enforcing a worldwide Mareva. Mr Justice Morritt said the Mareva was a remedy provided by statute for the benefit of the public at large or those who had suffered from infringements of the Financial Services Act. It was as much a matter of law enforcement as the granting of an interlocutory injunction, so a cross-undertaking in damages was not required.</p>

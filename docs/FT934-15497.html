			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / China lets off a blast of pique WHEN China detonated a nuclear device underground at its Lop Nor test site last week, it seemed more like a riposte to a world that had not been all that kind to it recently than a blast in the interests of national defence. In Beijing, where the mood is decidedly less buoyant than before China's crushing disappointment over its loss of the Olympics to Sydney, it is possible to detect a sourness towards the outside world: although Chinese officials are careful to avoid suggestions they have been bad losers. The harder edge to Chinese policy statements was apparent in an address by Premier Li Peng on the eve of the October 1 anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. 'We are firmly opposed to all acts of interference in China's internal affairs and acts of violating China's sovereignty and will absolutely not accept them,' Mr Li said. While they might not say so publicly, there is no doubt officials apportion a good deal of blame to human rights campaigners in the west for the Olympics loss. Beijing is finding that constructive engagement with the outside world is not a simple thing, and brings with it pressures that could be ignored, or at least shrugged off, in the past. Now, it is not so easy, if China wants to continue to reap the benefits of its increasing interdependence with the world economy. The nuclear test in many ways encapsulates the problem, with Chinese officials claiming Beijing was being subjected to 'double standards' by an international community whose mission was to keep China weak. The US, as officials point out, has conducted 25 times the number of China's nuclear tests. 'The Chinese Government has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing and the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely limited,' an official statement said. Chinese officials also charge that the west has a vested interested in applying a moratorium on nuclear testing, since this would preserve its advantage in the nuclear arms race. China exhibits similar irritation when an issue is made of its weapons sales, arguing its involvement in the arms business is dwarfed by that of the US as the world's biggest supplier of weapons. This was the theme of Beijing's reaction in August to Washington's announcement that it was imposing sanctions on the export of high-technology items in protest at Chinese missile sales to Pakistan. 'The US', a Chinese official charged, 'has poured large amounts of advanced weapons into the region sensitive to China, threatening its security, and made groundless accusations against it.' Western officials in Beijing have been monitoring carefully Chinese actions in the wake of the Olympics vote for signs of a hardening of attitudes. Indications that Beijing may again be stiffening its campaign against Governor Chris Patten's proposals for extending democracy in Hong Kong before China's 1997 takeover are being cited as evidence of Olympic fallout. Publication on the front pages of Chinese newspapers the day after the Olympics vote of an 11-year-old directive from Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, threatening to seize Hong Kong before 1997 if circumstances deteriorated there, is seen as one of the more conspicuous examples of Chinese pique. Domestically, a wave of executions of criminals and the sentencing to death of officials convicted of so-called economic crimes are also being portrayed as a sign of a more uncompromising leadership. But what is almost certainly true is that China's feelings have been bruised, and its responses to real or imagined slights by the international community are likely to be sharper in the months ahead.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL BOLTON, RONSTADT WIN POP GRAMMYS  </P> <P> Michael Bolton was named top pop male vocalist over the late Roy Orbison, the  evening's sentimental favorite, and Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville were cited  for best vocal by a pop duo as the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards telecast got under  way Wednesday evening at the Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> Jazz great Miles Davis was certain of one award even before the three-hour CBS  program began. Along with former Beatle Paul McCartney, the celebrated  trumpeter was to be honored with a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award.  </P> <P> But Davis, who has won four previous Grammys, also picked up his fifth and  sixth Grammys.  </P> <P> During pre-telecast ceremonies -- in which 61 of the evening's 77 awards were  announced -- Davis was saluted for best jazz instrumental performance by a big  band during 1989 and for best jazz instrumental by a soloist, both in  connection with his album, "Aura."  </P> <P> The Recording Academy was also scheduled to give two posthumous Lifetime  Achievement Awards during the telecast to singer Nat King Cole and pianist  Vladimir Horowitz. Dick Clark was to be presented with a Trustees Award, for  achievements in the non-performing side of the industry.  </P> <P> Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of the National  Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, a nonprofit organization formed to  represent all segments of the recording industry.  </P> <P> Bonnie Raitt was one of the evening's other multiple winners. She was saluted  for best female rock vocal and traditional blues recording, sharing the latter  with John Lee Hooker for their duet on "I'm in the Mood."  </P> <P> Other artists who received multiple awards included British soul-dance group  Soul II Soul and composer-arranger Dave Grusin.  </P> <P> Soul II Soul won the R&amp;B group vocal award for the single "Back to Life,"  and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for "African Dance," a selection from the  group's "Keep on Movin' " album. The group, however, lost in the more-prized  best new artist category to the duo Milli Vanilli.  </P> <P> Grusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more. They were for  the background score of the film "The Fabulous Baker Boys," instrumental  arrangement for the suite from the film "The Milagro Beanfield War" and  instrumental arrangement with a vocal for the rendition of "My Funny Valentine"  in "'Baker Boys."  </P> <P> The Traveling Wilburys, the veteran rock superstar quintet that was widely  viewed in the recording industry as the betting favorite in the competition for  key album of the year, were also honored during the pre-telecast portion of the  program for the best group vocal in rock.  </P> <P> The group consists of rock veterans Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom  Petty and Orbison.  </P> <P> Living Colour's "Cult of Personality" single was named best hard rock  performance of 1989, shutting out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock  band Guns N' Roses. The latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly  racist remarks in a song, "One in a Million," that was included in its "GN'R  Lies" album, which was a contender in the hard-rock category.  </P> <P> About 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the  self-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday,  handing out leaflets that branded "One in a Million" as racist for its use of  racial epithets, and New York rap group's Public Enemy's "Welcome to the  Terrordome" as anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> Public Enemy -- whose "Fight the Power" single was a nominee in the rap  category -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others for possible  anti-Semitic attitudes since a controversial interview by Professor Griff, the  group's former "minister of information," that appeared last May in the  Washington Times newspaper.  </P> <P> Both Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of  Public Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes.  </P> <P> Harry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category Wednesday is likely  to stir criticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to  think of Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. In picking up his first  Grammy for his contributions to the "When Harry Meets Sally" film sound track  album, Connick defeated past jazz Grammy winners Joe Williams and George  Benson.  </P> <P> Two names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee  Jones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. They teamed up  on a version of "Makin' Whoopee."  </P> <P> Veteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in jazz, blues and rock fields, was  named best female jazz vocalist for her album, "Blues on Broadway."  </P> <P> The Pat Metheny Group was honored for jazz fusion performance for the fifth  time since the category was initiated in 1979.  </P> <P> Chick Corea, who had won seven previous Grammys, was honored for best jazz  group instrumental for his album, "Chick Corea Akoustic Band."  </P> <P> Bobby Brown was named best male R&amp;B vocalist, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's  "If You Don't Know Me by Now" was named best R&amp;B song.  </P> <P> In the country field, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Will the Circle Be  Unbroken, Volume Two" was associated with three awards. The band itself won a  Grammy for best group vocal, defeating the Judds, who had finished on top in  this category two of the last three years. The band also shared a Grammy with  Bruce Hornsby for best blue grass recording, while Randy Scruggs was cited as  best country instrumentalist for his work on a song, "Amazing Grace," that  appeared on the "Circle" album.  </P> <P> Rodney Crowell's "After All This Time" was declared best country song.  </P> <P> The Indigo Girls' debut album was judged the top contemporary folk recording.  The traditional folk Grammy was awarded to the Bulgarian State Female Vocal  Choir, a group that had made a considerable pop splash during 1989.  </P> <P> Los Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance.  </P> <P> The late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word  recording for her, "It's Always Something."  </P> <P> "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was named best musical cast show album.  </P> <P> In the composition categories, Carly Simon's "Let the River Run" (from the film  "Working Girl") was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's  "Batman" theme was voted best instrumental composition.  </P> <P> POP WINNERS  </P> <P> Album: "Nick of Time," Bonnie Raitt.  </P> <P> Pop Instrumental: "Healing Chant," Neville Brothers.  </P> <P> Rock Vocal by Duo or Group: "Traveling Wilburys, Volume One," Traveling  Wilburys.  </P> <P> Rock Instrumental: "Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop with Terry Bozzio and Tony Hymas,"  Jeff Beck with Terry Bozzio and Tony Hymas.  </P> <P> R&amp;B Vocal by Duo or Group: "Back to Life," Soul II Soul.  </P> <P> R&amp;B Instrumental: "African Dance," Soul II Soul.  </P> <P> R&amp;B Song: "If You Don't Know Me by Now," Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff.  </P> <P> New Age: "Passion -- Music for the Last Temptation of Christ," Peter Gabriel.  </P> <P> Jazz Fusion: "Letter From Home," Pat Metheny Group.  </P> <P> Jazz Vocal by Duo or Group: "Makin' Whoopee," Dr. John and Rickie Lee Jones.  </P> <P> Solo Jazz Instrumental: "Aura," Miles Davis.  </P> <P> Group Jazz Instrumental: "Chick Corea Akoustic Band," Chick Corea Akoustic  Band.  </P> <P> Big Band Jazz Instrumental: "Aura," Miles Davis.  </P> <P> Country Vocal by Duo or Group: "Will the Circle Be Unbroken Volume Two," Nitty  Gritty Dirt Band.  </P> <P> Country Vocal Collaboration: "There's a Tear in My Beer," Hank Williams Jr. and  Hank Williams Sr.  </P> <P> Country Instrumental: "Amazing Grace," Randy Scruggs.  </P> <P> Bluegrass: "The Valley Road," Bruce Hornsby and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  </P> <P> Country Song: "After All This Time," Rodney Crowell.  </P> <P> Female Gospel Vocal: "Don't Cry," CeCe Winans.  </P> <P> Male Gospel Vocal: "Meantime," BeBe Winans.  </P> <P> Gospel Vocal by Duo or Group: "The Savior is Waiting," Take 6.  </P> <P> Male/Female Soul Gospel Vocal: "As Long As We're Together," Al Green.  </P> <P> Soul Gospel Vocal by Duo, Group, Choir or Chorus: "Let Brotherly Love  Continue," Daniel Winans &amp; Choir.  </P> <P> Tropical Latin: "Ritmo En El Corazon," Celia Cruz &amp; Ray Barretto.  </P> <P> Traditional Blues: "I'm in the Mood," John Lee Hooker and Bonnie Raitt.  </P> <P> Contemporary Blues: "In Step," Stevie Ray Vaughan &amp; Double Trouble.  </P> <P> Traditional Folk: "Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares, Volume II," Bulgarian State  Female Vocal Choir.  </P> <P> Contemporary Folk: "Indigo Girls," Indigo Girls.  </P> <P> Polka: "All in My Love for You," Jimmy Sturr &amp; his Orchestra.  </P> <P> Reggae: "Serious Business," Third World.  </P> <P> Children: "The Rock-A-Bye Collection Volume I," Tanya Goodman.  </P> <P> Comedy: "P.D.Q.

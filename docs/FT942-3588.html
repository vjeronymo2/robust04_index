			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Hope in a bleak house There is one comforting ob-servation to offer Britain's Conservatives this morning. The next general election need not be held until the late spring of 1997. That is nearly three years away. As Lord Wilson might say, 150 weeks is a long time in politics. Contrary to the impression given by some headlines, the government did not change last week. Mr Tony Blair is not the leader of the Labour party, although he is front-runner for that post. Labour did not sweep to power at Westminster over the weekend, although its chances of so doing have improved. Mr John Major is to be found in his office in No 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has the levers of power in his hands. What he does with them can make a difference. He showed this yesterday when he put on a confident performance at a press conference called, cleverly, in the sunny garden of No 10. He is here to stay, he said, and sounded as if he meant it. He might be. In Germany chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed doomed a few months ago. The Social Democrats looked set to take office in October's general election. The economy is only just beginning to emerge from recession. Yet on Sunday Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats plus allies attracted some 40 per cent of the Euro-poll against 32 per cent for the Social Democrats. The British prime minister's explanation is that the recent experience of most democracies is the same. Mid-term protests like last Thursday's in Britain melt away when a general election approaches, as in Germany. Mr Major may be taking lessons in political sumo wrestling from his friend Helmut. He appears to be aware that a hard-nosed reshuffle of his cabinet would be a start. That said, it is difficult to argue that a Tory resurgence is likely. There is a feeling around that the Conservatives' time has come, that whatever they do they are heading for the opposition benches. Their nadir lies ahead, with a lower point to follow. They have broken a series of worse-than-ever records: worst local election performance, worst by-election showings and, in the Euro-elections, worst scores by either of the two largest parties in a national contest since the Labour debacle of 1983. They are tired, discredited, and irremediably divided over Europe. How can such a shambles stand up to the resurgent might of the Labour party? Perhaps by cutting taxes. The most commonly cited reason for the government's unpopularity is that it won in 1992 by falsely promising lower taxation. As the ghastly results of the Euro-elections have come in, some leading Conservatives have started to talk of a tax cut that would restore the government's fortunes. There is a small obstacle in the way of such a strategy. The two Budgets of 1993 planted a long series of voter-repellent irritation machines in the calendar. In October we will get the insurance premium tax of 3 per cent, plus an impost of Pounds 5 on domestic and Pounds 10 on foreign flights. Next April, VAT on domestic heating fuels more than doubles, to 17.5 per cent. Income tax allowances and mortgage interest relief fall from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, at a time when the trend in interest rates will doubtless be upwards. The government is committed to adding 5 per cent per future Budget, in real terms, to road fuel tax, not to mention a similar 3 per cent on tobacco. It may, however, cut taxes in the November 1995 Budget, or the following year. Mr Major's attack on beggars during the Euro-election campaign revealed how ruthless he can be if his or his government's survival is at stake. Picking our pockets in order to bribe us with our own money near a general election will not trouble the Conservative conscience next time. It never has. It would be wrong, therefore, to assert that the Tories are finished. It is more fruitful to set out the reasons why so many of us strive to believe that they are. Forget calculations involving percentages, turnout, swing, opinion polls and suchlike voodoo. Labour attracted some 600,000 more voters in last Thursday's Euro-elections than it had in the similar poll in 1989. The Conservative popular vote was 1.1m down. This might be put down to the tax increases, in which case Mr Major is right when he says we should wait for the recovery to percolate through. Alternatively the Tory abstentions, and the accretion of Labour votes, might indicate a greater depth of feeling than mere bribery could reach. Over the past few years, and particularly since Black Wednesday, the political prospect has been depressing. The government constantly trips over itself. The opposition has not presented a credible alternative social or economic strategy. National self-confidence has ebbed away, as the great institutions, from the monarchy downwards, have been shown to be flawed. The high tide of Thatcherite triumphalism of 1988 has receded, to reveal an empty, debris-strewn beach. No political leader has yet been able to shake us out of this mood, certainly not Mr Neil Kinnock or Mr John Major nor, it must be acknowledged, Mr John Smith while he was alive. Suddenly, and perhaps misleadingly, change seems possible. The likely new leader of the Labour party presents a reassuring face at a time when the party itself is regarded, in all regions of the country, as less frightening than it was even two years ago. None of us can tell at this stage whether Mr Tony Blair can live up to his promise, or whether the party he aspires to lead will permit him to do so. What does seem clear is that Labour, or rather Blair-led Labour, seems to offer an end to the bleak management of Britain that has so dispirited us. There is doubtless wishful thinking here. Mr Blair, a master of the art of speaking in a manner that his audience likes to hear, is becoming a screen upon which voters of all parties may project their hopes. This has nothing to do with the mundane question of whether he shares this particular aspiration or that, or could make this or that political dream come true. His hour has arrived just when people are looking for a reason to be optimistic. The desperate Tory dingoes, low and mean in their cunning, will know what to do. They will yelp and bay around him, corner his party, press Labour to come clean with specific policies and costed proposals so that they may be torn to shreds. We voters can only watch, and tremble.</p>

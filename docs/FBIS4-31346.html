			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Too Many Jobs"] </F>   [Text] When Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told industrialists  April 10 that one of his "post-transformation" goals is to see  unemployment rise by about 0.1 percent per month, he most  certainly had in mind Prague, where employers have been loudly  complaining that they can't find help.    At the same time, Klaus' government was putting together  rescue packages for less economically advanced regions of the  country that are being crippled by the opposite problem: rising  unemployment.    Bridging the gap between these extremes, while making the  job  market more competitive by raising overall unemployment, will be  one of the major tasks of the Czech government and business  leaders over the next few years.    The Czech Republic's remarkably low overall unemployment  rate  has long been the envy of all Europe. Currently at about 3.5  percent -- representing 180,000 people -- the rate is expected  to rise to between 4.5 and 5 percent by the end of 1994.    The statistics are telling. In March, unemployment in Prague  stood at 0.3 percent, with the Ministry of Labor and Social  Affairs estimating that for every worker in the city there are  eight job possibilities. But in the most depressed areas outside  the capital, unemployment has exceeded 8 percent, and the  government has recently been compelled to offer a program of  state subsidies for local industry and infrastructure in the  country's four worst-hit regions, three of which are located in  Moravia.    The phenomenon of an east-west imbalance in national  employment is not a new one. According to Vladimir Rudolf,  deputy director of employment policy at the Ministry of Labor  and Social Affairs, in the Czechoslovak First Republic  (1918-1938), the areas of fullest employment were also in the  western and central parts of Bohemia, close to the centers of  Czech and German industry and trade. The poorest regions have  always tended to be in the east, close to the Polish and Slovak  borders.    Investment is now generally following this traditional  route,  which has its source in the wealth of Germany and Austria. Many  areas of eastern Moravia remain in dire need of support, while  the Bavarian border is a veritable flood plain of German  affluence, lined with plush new restaurants, high-tech gas  stations and shops. A Czech-German agreement allows Czechs to  seek better-paying jobs in Germany within a 50-kilometer strip  along the border. For the Bavarians, this constitutes a cheap  but legal source of imported labor.    The same phenomenon has an equal and opposite effect on the  Czech-Polish border, where Czech entrepreneurs find cut-rate  workers from nearby Polish industrial cities. In these areas of  stagnation, where unemployment sometimes reaches 20 percent,  Poles and Ukrainians find good work for good wages, by their  standards. Meanwhile, an increasingly dejected local population  cannot get to work because of rising transportation costs, poor  bus and rail connections and the collapse of communist-era  single-factory communities. Agricultural regions have also been  hard-hit by foreign competition and modernization.    Rudolf said that Czech psychology also plays a role in the  stagnation of various regions.    "For many decades, Czechs were unaccustomed to relocating to  be near their workplaces, as Americans regularly do," he said.  "Now inhabitants of Kladno prefer to pick up welfare checks  rather than come to Prague to work." He admitted that, due to  the chronic housing shortage in Prague, provincial victims of  unemployment find moving to the capital nearly impossible.    The increasingly difficult situation on the country's  eastern  borders is forcing people to re-evaluate their lifestyles. Now  many Moravians are starting to migrate west, renting holiday  cottages in the resort-heavy Sumava and Krkonose areas, near the  German border, and working across the border.    The former East German border is less desirable, with  unemployment as high as 10 percent in the old socialist state.  The Austrian border is also less inviting: Relations between  Prague and Vienna remain tense, with no signed guest-worker  agreements and an Austrian law limiting to 10 percent the ratio  of foreigners in the work force.    For the fortunate minority of unemployed, benefits start at  60 percent of the average income for the first three months,  then go down to 50 percent for the second three months. If the  claimant is still jobless, means testing is applied to determine  the sum for state support, with a minimum amount set at 2,300 Kc  ($79) per month. As part of the government's plans to kick start  depressed areas, this benefit will be paid directly to employers  using previously jobless workers.    "We prefer active, preventive measures to passive support of  idle workers," said Rudolf.    An employee at the Economics Ministry said that the need to  bolster the regions economically had forced Klaus to detour from  his oft-stated policy of laissez-faire economics, because the  high rate of unemployment in the country's four worst-hit areas  seemed likely to induce nostalgia among voters for a command  economy.    The ministry worker said he thought that the 150 million Kc  ($5.2 million) recently earmarked for regional development in  the Moravian areas of Bruntal, Novy Jicin, Znojmo and the north  Bohemian city Louny represents an important first step in  rejuvenating local economies but will not be enough in the end.  "We would need to invest at least four times as much," the  ministry employee said.    Jana Petrova, spokeswoman for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party  (ODS), the main member of the government coalition, said the  amounts reserved are not optimal, but are all that can be spared  at present. She said that the Czech Republic is too integrated  to be split by uneven regional development.    Rudolf also said he is confident that the recovery package,  called the Region Program, constitutes a good start. But one of  its drawbacks may be that it only deals with areas exceeding 8  percent unemployment, he said.    "There are unfortunately another nine areas with 7 percent  or  over," he said. "These could be jealous of those areas targeted  for aid."    If the scheme proves successful, it will lessen the  geographical divide that is threatening to cleave the country on  an east-west basis. If the regional economies cannot be brought  more closely in line, experts warn that the Czech Republic  could, like France, develop a head that is too large for its  underdeveloped body.    But in Prague, with its job surplus, the unemployment  problems seem as far away as the moon. Ludmila Hilova, personnel  manager at Krone, one of city's largest department stores, faces  a special set of problems with the store staff about 80 workers  short.    The problem goes beyond simple city-wide overemployment:  Some  small stores are overpaying employees by up to 1,000 Kc ($34)  per month, Hilova estimated. Some of these can afford to do so  because they have had buildings restituted to them and have few  overhead costs to cover, while others deal in the abundance of  contraband, duty-free goods that regularly enter the country.    But Hilova said the costs of higher wages have caught up  with  many bigger businesses. "Large, reputable stores cannot afford  to do this, although we have the advantage of being more stable  in times of economic hardship."</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Travelcard costs that carry a price How far can London Transport push up the price of its Travelcard - allowing multiple journeys by train, bus and Underground - before it kills the goose that lays the golden egg? Reports that London commuters face an increase of up to 10 per cent in Travelcard prices, with other tickets rising by just 6 per cent, have prompted concerns that the limits of customer resistance are about to be reached. Introduced in 1983, the Travelcard boosted passenger numbers when public transport use was in decline in the rest of the country. For commuters, the Travelcard is relatively cheap and convenient. Weekend and evening journeys on top of the daily journey to and from work are free. The advantages to the transport company are that it is paid in advance, there is less fraud and travellers do not pay each time they get on a bus or a train - allowing passengers to board buses more quickly. Mr John Cartledge, assistant secretary of the London Regional Passengers Committee, a consumer watchdog, said: 'The Travelcard puts public transport on a par with the private car. Once you have bought a car the only marginal cost is for petrol and parking, so you have an incentive to use it as much as possible. The Travelcard also means you can make extra journeys for a nil marginal cost.' But LT thinks the Travelcard is too cheap. It was priced at a discount when it was launched but its price has increased more quickly than other tickets  -for example by 10 per cent in January 1993 when fares in general were increased by 8.5 per cent - but LT calculates that it still provides a saving of 30 per cent. Reports emerging from this year's early talks on fares policy indicate a far larger gap between the two rates of increase this time round. Commuters might be happier if LT used the same method of calculating Travelcard fares as Network Ticketing, which administers the Network Travel Ticket for transport operators in Tyne and Wear. Network Ticketing bases fares on the average charged for individual journeys by the 30 local bus companies, the Tyne and Wear Metro and British Rail. Mrs Julie Johnston, manager of Network Ticketing, said: 'It is a straightforward mathematical calculation, so we can easily explain how our prices are made up.' Its weekly rate is based on the cost of nine journeys, a discount of 10 per cent on a presumed 10 journeys a week for the Monday-to-Friday commuter, although some people make up to 15 journeys on a weekly ticket, a discount of 40 per cent. LT may have greater scope to reduce its 30 per cent discount because many commuters have no alternative means of travel. But if it pushes prices too high travellers might be tempted to take to their cars, increasing congestion. If they stayed with public transport but bought single tickets, queues would lengthen, bus boarding times would increase and the cashflow benefit of advance payments would be lost.</p>

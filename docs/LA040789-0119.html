			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTNER IN DEAL HELPED START 3 OTHER AIRLINES  </P> <P> James Thomas Talbot -- Tom to his friends -- made a fortune building  nondescript factories and warehouses around Southern California. But his first  love is airlines.  </P> <P> That's not surprising, considering that he has helped start three: AirCal, Jet  America and Southwest Airlines.  </P> <P> Now Talbot has returned to the airline business, this time in the big leagues.  The Newport Beach developer is a partner of Peter V. Ueberroth in the former  baseball commissioner's successful effort to buy troubled Eastern Airlines. The  two have been friends for more than 10 years.  </P> <P> Talbot said in a telephone interview from his lawyer's offices in New York  before the final agreement to buy Eastern was reached that he will play an  active role in the transition period and may take an active role in the  airline's management.  </P> <P> However, one airline executive said he would be surprised if Talbot became a  hands-on manager at Eastern.  </P> <P> "He's never really run an airline before," said J. Ray Vingo, chief financial  officer at Seattle's Alaska Air Group, which bought Jet America in 1986. "While  he was chairman of Jet America, he was not active in day-to-day operations."  </P> <P> Talbot acknowledged that while he has not handled day-to-day activities at any  of his airlines, he was chairman of Jet America and very active in its  operations. His role at AirCal and Southwest was as a lawyer, consultant and  shareholder.  </P> <P> The airline connection runs in Talbot's family. In 1925, his grandfather  started the nation's first air carrier, Western Air Express, which shuttled  passengers and mail between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. The airline, later  known as Western Airlines, was merged into Delta Air Lines in 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started Law Firm  </P> <P> Talbot, 53, was born in Los Angeles, but his parents moved to Newport Beach  when he was a child and his roots are in Orange County.  </P> <P> After serving in the Air Force, Talbot graduated from Hastings College of Law  in San Francisco in 1963 and worked for a large Los Angeles law firm. Two years  later, he formed his own firm so he could spend more time starting AirCal,  which was first called Air California. It began flying out of Orange County  Airport in 1966.  </P> <P> Talbot and the other founders soon sold most of the struggling airline to San  Diego financier C. Arnholt Smith, whose financial empire later crumbled. AirCal  was later sold to Orange County home builder William Lyon and apartment builder  George Argyros and is now part of American Airlines. Talbot was on its board  from 1973 to 1981.  </P> <P> By 1980, he was helping start Jet America Airlines, a tiny Long Beach carrier  that also struggled when it ran up against the big airlines on many of its  routes to the Midwest.  </P> <P> Even though Talbot, as chairman, did not handle the nuts and bolts of the  operation, Fred Davis, who Talbot hired as executive vice president of  marketing at AirCal and who held the same post at Jet America, is confident  that his old boss can run an airline.  </P> <P> "If anybody in the industry can (make a go of Eastern), it would be Tom Talbot  and Peter Ueberroth," said Davis, now vice president of marketing at Air  America, a small Los Angeles airline.  </P> <P> Talbot said in the telephone interview that he and Ueberroth met more than 10  years ago as neighbors in Laguna Beach. They have often played golf together,  usually at the Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, and have become good  friends, he said.  </P> <P> They have also been business associates at times. Both served, for instance, as  directors of E. F. Hutton Group, the investment banking firm sold to Shearson  Lehman Bros. in late 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Experience in Travel  </P> <P> Another affluent executive with a crowded resume, Ueberroth came to national  prominence as president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee for the  1984 Olympic Games. Soon after the games, he was named commissioner of major  league baseball. His five-year term ended last Saturday.  </P> <P> Ueberroth's business experience is in the travel industry. In 1963, he founded  First Travel Corp. in Southern California and built it into the second-largest  business of its kind in North America. He sold it in 1979 for $10.6 million,  earning $4.4 million personally.  </P> <P> Talbot's airlines have had few or no union workers, but he said he is not  worried about a possible clash between management and unions like the one that  has dominated the tenure of Frank Lorenzo as head of Eastern. There is no  reason for labor and management to be adversaries, Talbot said, especially when  both sides have ownership stakes in the company.  </P> <P> Ueberroth's agreement to buy Eastern involves wage and work rules concessions  from the airline's employees but, in return, grants them 30% ownership of the  company.  </P> <P> Talbot is at home in the clubby atmosphere of the Pacific Club -- a Newport  Beach dining club he helped start while running Jet America -- and the posh Big  Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, the place to be seen playing golf in  Orange County, where he is known as a pretty fair golfer.  </P> <P> Acquaintances describe him as cordial and low-key. He plays golf fairly  frequently and is "definitely not a workaholic," said Don Shaw, a business  partner of Talbot's.  </P> <P> "When we needed to work 14 hours straight, he was there; but he was not usually  at the office at 7 p.m. yelling at people," Shaw said. "He was very low-key.  Crises just rolled off his back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Built Industrial Buildings  </P> <P> Talbot had known Shaw socially for several years before Talbot left his job as  chairman of developer Dunn Properties Corp. in Santa Ana in 1975 to start Shaw  &amp; Talbot. Dunn Properties was a subsidiary of Pacific Lighting, the parent  company of Southern California Gas, and is now called Pacific Enterprsies.  Talbot joined it as executive vice president in 1970 after selling AirCal  because, he said a few years ago, all his friends were getting rich in real  estate.  </P> <P> The new company built one-story industrial buildings around Southern  California, most of them in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I'm from a construction background -- I've still got cement on my shoes -- and  Tom had a lot of financial savvy and a lot of capacity for negotiating," Shaw  said. "We learned a hell of a lot from each other."  </P> <P> By the mid-1980s, Shaw &amp; Talbot had stopped developing properties but they  remain partners and still own numerous buildings together, Shaw said.  </P> <P> Asked why he and Ueberroth wanted to buy Eastern, Talbot said: "Pete has an  abiding interest in the travel business, and so do I. The business has a  variety of different lures. There's instant gratification; everything is so  visible."  </P> <P> Times staff writers James S. Granelli and John Charles Tighe in Orange County  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Fresh wave of 'Ethnic cleansing' in central Bosnia A FRESH wave of 'ethnic cleansing' has created a refugee problem of huge proportions in central Bosnia, local authorities said yesterday, Reuter reports from Vares, Sarajevo and Zenica. United Nations officials said it was due to a rush by Croats and Moslems to consolidate their holds on disputed areas of central Bosnia as peace talks got under way in Geneva. The small Croat-held industrial town of Vares, 30 miles north of Sarajevo, has been flooded with 15,000 Croat refugees who fled on foot from the Moslem-besieged Kakanj area. The town's normal population is 12,000. Simultaneously Bosnian Croat forces pushed Moslems out of villages they held around Vares, and from the town of Kiseljak, just west of the besieged Bosnian capital. Bosnian radio reported 11 killed and 57 wounded in the fighting in the last 24 hours, although most front lines were quiet. The town of Zenica suffered renewed shelling which killed nine people.</p>

According to Yudakov, 18 percent of the  voters had come to cast ballots by 1500. By 2200, which is the  polling stations' closing time, another 7 percent or more would  have taken part in the elections.    Under the existing regulations, at least 25 percent of the  voters must come to the polling stations if elections are to be  regarded as valid.    On 27 March the Moscow and 30 other regions of the Russian  Federation are holding municipal elections. Voter turnout is  low everywhere. The central electoral commissions of the  Kaliningrad and Kaluga regions say that slightly more than 21  percent of the voters cast ballots by 1500.</p>

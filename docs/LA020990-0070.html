			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LOBSTER' LAUNCHES MIDNIGHT FILM POLICY  </P> <P> With "Lobster Man From Mars," the Royal Theater, long noted for its  distinguished programming, this weekend launches a new Saturday midnight-movie  policy with a winner.  </P> <P> Director Stanley Sheff and the late writer Bob Greenberg have lovingly sent up  the tacky '50s sci-fi/horror drive-in flick with the help of a good cast that  gets into the spirit of the occasion.  </P> <P> It seems that Mars is fast running out of air, and the hideous Lobster Man (S.  D. Nemeth) is dispatched by the King of Mars (Bobby (Boris) Pickett of "Monster  Mash" fame) to Earth to steal its air. (Never mind how he's supposed to manage  it). In any event, the Lobster Man menaces a nice young couple (Deborah  Foreman, Anthony Hickox), and Hickox's scientist uncle (ever-stalwart Patrick  Macnee) gets into the act. So does a weird psychic, played by Billy Barty, and  Tommy Sledge, who as a vintage private eye wrote his own dialogue, a veritable  dictionary of dated, hard-boiled detective slang. (He even carries around his  own taped film noir theme music.) Dr. Demento narrates the film.  </P> <P> Making a virtue of the presumed necessity of a minuscule budget, Sheff and  Greenberg have no end of fun with cheap special effects and familiar outdoor  locales (e.g., Malibu Canyon, much used by Roger Corman). Carrying off such a  picture is not as easy as it seems: A good parody of bad genre pictures  requires more than a passing acquaintance with such films, which are already  self-parodies. It is also a challenge to sustain and control such spoofery, and  Sheff uses a film-within-a-film device that masks both budget limitations and  allows him a breather from the tongue-in-cheek stuff.  </P> <P> This framing story has a nerdy fledgling director (Dean Jacobson), who looks to  be still in his teens, showing his magnum opus, "Lobster Man From Mars," to a  slick Hollywood producer (Tony Curtis, in top form) in desperate need of a  terrible picture to release for tax reasons. From time to time Sheff cuts to  Curtis, who ad-libs a series of amusing reactions to the film. "Lobster Man  From Mars" (rated PG) is an instance where cornball antics has required  considerable sophistication.  </P> <P> Sheff has set off his film with the perfect curtain raiser, "Kimbar," which is  Chapter 1 of an old serial so bad that Chapter 2 was never made! A hilariously  tacky rip-off of Tarzan, it stars bodybuilder Steve Reeves as the loin-clothed  King of the Jungle. To complete the program, Sheff has a couple of laughable  vintage house trailers, one a severe admonition -- i.e., banishment for life --  against talking during the movie and the other the offer of a six-month pass to  anyone who reports vandalism of theater seats.  </P></p>

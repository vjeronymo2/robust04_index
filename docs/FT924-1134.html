			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: BA issues USAir jobs warning BRITISH Airways yesterday accused Washington of putting nearly 100,000 US jobs at risk by linking its Dollars 750m offer for 44 per cent of USAir to liberalisation of the UK-US aviation market. The warning coincided with a last minute effort by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to win Washington's approval for the deal during weekend talks with President George Bush. Amid growing signs that the Bush administration was unlikely to approve the deal next week, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, claimed the US government's apparent determination to make approval of the bid conditional on UK liberalisation was 'entirely to the benefit of the three major US airlines'. American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have spearheaded the campaign to block the BA-USAir deal unless the US government can secure greater access for UK carriers into the London market. Sir Colin said BA remained hopeful the bid would be approved next week by Mr Andrew Card, the US transportation secretary, following the talks between President Bush and Mr Major. However, BA was extremely disappointed that the deal appeared to hinge on bilateral issues which Sir Colin argued had no connection with the commercial agreement between the two airlines. 'For the US government, the upholders of belief in freedom of capital and freedom of movement, to be rejecting this deal, which clearly puts at risk the future of USAir, its 47,000 employees, and a similar number who are providers of services and products, boggles the mind,' he said. Sir Colin, in Sydney to complete BA's ADollars 665m (USDollars 458.6m) purchase of 25 per cent of Qantas, the government-owned Australian airline, confirmed BA had no plans to raise fresh capital to finance its expansion. He said BA could finance the purchase of stakes in Qantas and USAir without a rights issue.</p>

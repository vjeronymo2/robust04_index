			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: CBOE develops volatility index THE Chicago Board Options Exchange has developed a standardised way to measure volatility in the US stock market. Next week, the exchange will begin disseminating real-time calculations of its CBOE Market Volatility Index, and within the year hopes to offer options on the index itself. Volatility has a big impact on stock portfolio valuation and is an integral factor in options pricing. While institutional traders have their own models for deriving volatility, the CBOE hopes to standardise volatility assumptions for the broader public with its index. The index is derived from price quotes of eight near-the-market S&amp;P 100 index options, the CBOE's liquid and actively traded stock index options contract. The new index measures implied volatility 30 days into the future. 'The costs of many static and dynamic hedging, arbitrage and asset allocation strategies depend on market volatility,' said Mr Alger Chapman, CBOE chairman. 'With the impressive growth in the use of and development of derivative instruments, it is more important than ever to be able to access during the trading day a measure of market volatility, and integrate that measure into current trading strategies.' Mr Robert Whaley, finance professor at Duke University, and designer of the volatility index model, said the volatility index concept may eventually be applied to other kinds of markets, including foreign currency options trading. The proposed options on the new volatility index will give traders and investors a means to hedge directly the risk of volatility changes while using regular options to hedge price risk in their stock portfolios. The ability to hedge both price and volatility is currently out of reach of all but the largest and most sophisticated investors.</p>

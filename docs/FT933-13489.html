			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: A castle fit to house a modern monarchy - Architecture Last week two related events occurred that brought a bit of life to the architectural world. One was that Country Life, the magazine with a first-rate architectural editor in the shape of Mr Giles Worsley, announced the results of its competition for the rebuilding of parts of Windsor Castle damaged by fire. The other was also related to Windsor Castle, the appearance of a book Windsor, the Most Romantic Castle by Mark Girouard, which contains a chapter devoted to new ideas for rebuilding the castle's burnt-out St George's Hall. Both sets of ideas form the basis of an exhibition at the Architecture Foundation in London, which it is hoped will then travel to all parts of the kingdom. When the smoke finally blew away from the charred ruins of the castle after the fire last November, crowds of the curious and the impertinent came forward with their views on what should be done. In fact, the damage was not as bad as had been thought. Only the north-east corner of the Upper Ward was affected. But it was a part of the castle that contains several important rooms. The fire began in the private chapel and attacked St George's Hall, the Grand Reception Room, the Octagon Room in the Brunswick Tower, the Dining Room, Crimson and Green Drawings Rooms and the Great Kitchen. It spread with sickening speed through the roofs of these rooms, but, although it damaged the walls, they are not beyond repair. By a stroke of good fortune, the furnishings of these rooms had been removed for a rewiring programme and it all survives. The survival of almost all the furnishings and works of art from these rooms would seem to make it sensible speedily to rebuild the castle exactly as it was in before the fire. But, naturally enough, there have been strange cries from architects calling for contemporary contributions to the rebuilding. Mr Girouard's book and the competition entries from Country Life are part of a campaign to promote a debate which tries to relate the rebuilding of Windsor to the modernisation of the monarchy as an institution. Competitions should be judged by their results, not simply by their good intentions. The 10 proposals for St George's Hall in the Girouard book come not only from architects, but also stage and lighting designers. It is a strange list that seems to demonstrate how difficult it is for architects and designers to understand the purpose of state rooms, the role of history and the functions of the monarchy. The implication is that Wyatt Ville's work at Windsor was dull and there is little understanding of how the castle works when it is filled with the colour and glitter of, for example, a state banquet in St George's Hall or a procession of Knights of the Garter. The sense of continuity is the essence of an hereditary monarchy and the wish of so many of these designers to 'bring light colour and change' into the castle may be almost as destructive as the intrusion of the media. There should be an element of poetry about any scheme for what has been described as 'the most romantic castle' and that is exactly what is missing from so many of the laboured designs in both competitions. The idea of leaving the Great Hall as a ruin, as proposed by Mr Rowan Moore, does have a certain Gothic romance, but also opts out of the architectural debate. More feasible is the plan by Roderick Gradidge to add a steeply pitched roof to the hall and redecorate in a rich, almost Puginesque manner. One entrant, Douglas Binnie, has combined his talents as an architect and a sculptor in his elaborately iconographic schemes, and his Country Life entry is one of the best presented. Of the 10 Girouard schemes, only two are remotely workable. One is Richard MacCormack's bronze and timber roof, inspired by but not imitative of the original Gothic roof of St George's Hall; and the other is by Michael Hopkins, who saw the decorative potential of the motif of the Garter Star. There is, inevitably, a committee to discuss the restoration plans for the castle. A decision is already made to rebuild the chapel area in a contemporary way. This area, where the fire began, was a remodelling by Sir Hugh Casson of the 1842 chapel by Edward Blore. Whether a private chapel is needed at this point in the castle's history may be debatable. The committee may decide to build a modern roof on St George's Hall and they would be foolish to overlook the wonderful timber designs of the Hungarian architect Imrie Macovecz. He designed one of the best pavilions ad Seville's Expo 92 and his work is remarkably original. The committee will have the benefit of the experience of the National Trust who are currently rebuilding Uppark in Sussex after a disastrous fire. They will also take advice from those responsible for the recent excellent restoration of Hampton Court. The real opportunity offered by Windsor is involve in the restoration the expertise of those responsible for the Royal Collection who made such a splendid job of the refurbishment of Frogmore in Windsor Great Park. With the gentle help of one or two good architects, Windsor should be restored very much as it was. Mark Girouard's agreeable book tells us something of the story of life at Windsor. But his selection of contemporary architects and winners of Country Life competition demonstrate that the modern imagination cannot deal with either the romance of the castle or the appropriate panoply for the home of the head of state. Windsor, the Most Romantic Castle, by Mark Girouard, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 20. Exhibition at the Architecture Foundation in Bury Street, St James's, London SW1, until August 29th</p>

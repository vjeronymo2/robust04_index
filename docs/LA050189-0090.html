			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> A Finnish collector and Beatles fan bought a ticket to ride in the style of the  Fab Four when he bid $234,000 at Christie's for a white Mercedes Benz limousine  that belonged to late Beatle John Lennon. The four-door, black-seated  limousine, custom built for Lennon in 1970, later belonged to fellow Beatle  George Harrison before being sold to Mary Wilson, an original member of the  Supremes pop group. Two hand-written verses of a poem by Lennon, illustrated  with a sketch, netted $5,450. A rainbow-colored 1965 Bentley automobile that  once ferried John Lennon and the other Beatles through the streets of London  also goes on the auction block in June. The car, now owned by a New York  couple, is expected to fetch between $800,000 and millionClaudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): What's in a name? - Choosing the right title for your company is no simple matter although it can make all the difference between commercial success or failure When Don Gooding changed the name of his west London travel agency from Budget Travel to Caribbean Gold, business took off. As Budget Travel, the company had appeared to be just another of the many cut-rate outlets on the high street instead of a specialised agency providing holiday packages to Barbados and the Caribbean. 'People could not reconcile paying Pounds 5,000 for a holiday through a company which called itself Budget,' he says. 'People just walked right past us to one of the other travel agents.' The name change was not the only element in Caribbean Gold's new image. It was just one part of a marketing review, undertaken under the government's Enterprise Initiative, which led to improved financial systems, training for the company's 10 staff and a complete refurbishment of the agency. But it was a significant factor in an increase in turnover from less than Pounds 3m to nearly Pounds 5m in the middle of a recession. It also played a key role in emphasising that the eight-year-old company specialised in a particular part of the world and that it offered a quality service. As Gooding found out, choosing a name for your business is not a simple matter. The start-up company in particular does not always know which products or which markets will develop fastest and whether its original title will still appeal or be relevant. Entrepreneurs sometimes name their business after their wives or their children or after the street in which they start up. 'Choosing a name can be very unscientific,' says Mark Pavan, founder of MAPA, a London marketing consultancy. 'It is often very emotive. People don't research it properly and can cause themselves severe embarrassment if they choose a name which is already being used by someone else.' 'People must think through the strategic and personal implications,' warns John Murphy, chairman of Interbrand, a London consultancy which devises names. 'They must not choose a name which they cannot protect or which is not suitable for international markets.' Murphy has recently been advising two service companies which have chosen lengthy titles made up of the names of their founders and friends. 'I think it will end in tears later because some of them will leave and realise that their name is still in the business's title.' Technical names can frequently trip up the unwary. Derek Clissold set up in business making speciality chemicals five years ago as Chiral Organics. Chiral was a technical term which was readily understandable to the chemists to whom Clissold expected to sell his products but meant less to the bio-chemists who actually turned out to be his customers. The bio-chemistry market also proved more promising so Clissold changed the name of his Reading-based company to Cascade Biochem, a reference to the cascade of effects which lead to a particular disease. If Chiral Organics was too specific a name, Immunology Ltd found that its name appeared too general. If the 'Ltd' was left off, there was a danger that the company would become confused with the general scientific term. So Immunology changed its name to Cantab Pharmaceuticals Research to reflect its geographical base (Cantab is abbreviated Latin for Cambridge) and its sphere of activity. In choosing - or changing - a name, a company must first check that it is not already in use. It should carry out a search at Companies House and also check the trade marks register of the Patent Office. Trade mark protection is more effective than simple company registration, says Murphy. A business will not be able to register a name which is considered offensive or illegal and nor can it make use of terms such as Royal, National, Building Society or Bank without fulfilling certain conditions or conforming to regulations governing the sector. But even thorough research and registration do not provide absolute guarantees against difficulties. Cathy Ridley did a careful search before starting up her company relocation business under the Move Plan title six years ago. She began as a sole trader but on the advice of her patent agent registered the name with Companies House in case she ever decided to become a limited company. After five years in business, she discovered that another company was using the Move Plan name. A letter to this company pointing out that the name was already registered produced no result so Ridley went to court. Earlier this year a judge issued an interim injunction ordering the other company to stop using the name. But Ridley says the Pounds 15,000 of legal costs incurred and the time she spent fighting the case were a heavy burden on a businesses with just Pounds 300,000 of turnover and a full-time workforce of four. Before deciding on a company name, the founders should decide what personality they want their business to project, advises Murphy. 'You must decide whether you want your business to be thought of as being high-tech, strong and incisive, caring, British, Italian . . .' he says. Consultancies such as Interbrand tend to work mainly for large companies but they do have smaller clients, says Murphy. A typical name-creation assignment would cost between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 19,000, he says, although the search for an international name in a crowded and difficult market such as computing might rise to Pounds 50,000-Pounds 60,000. Company names can be chosen in four broad categories, says John Abram, joint founder of Abram, Hawkes Associates, a Haywards Heath-based marketing consultancy. They can be based on the names of the founders; they can be descriptive; they can be witty, involving, for example, a play on words; or they can be anonymous, consisting of a made-up name or initials. All four can bring problems. The founders may move on; descriptive titles may lose their relevance or become restrictive; witty titles may become tiresome; while made-up names and initials can be difficult to inject with personality. Whatever name is chosen, it cannot project an image which is not backed up by the company's performance, warns Abram. A business which is seen by its customers as old-fashioned and parochial will not persuade them it is run by international high-flyers just by changing its name. Companies should therefore be very careful before they decide on a name change, the experts advise. 'You must first think what problem you are trying to solve,' says Abram. 'Often it is no more than a vague message from the chairman's office that the company name is no longer modern enough. You must have a good reason for making a change. A name change can appear superficially attractive but it can cause a lot of problems.'</p>

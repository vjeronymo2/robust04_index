			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UN prepares for Srebrenica's evacuation: The enclave's fall would be a devastating blow to Moslem-led forces UN RELIEF workers yesterday finalised plans to evacuate tens of thousands of civilians from Srebrenica, as Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on the enclave in eastern Bosnia. The fall of Srebrenica would be a devastating blow to the Moslem-led Bosnian forces. One of the few remaining strongholds in the once mostly Moslem region of eastern Bosnia, it has become a symbol of resistance against Serb forces. Conflicting radio messages yesterday were the only reports out of Srebrenica, cut off from the outside world for a year by a Serb siege. Crowded with Moslem refugees from the Serb onslaught on neighbouring towns in eastern Bosnia, Srebrenica's population has swollen to some many times its original size. Bosnian leaders broadcast desperate appeals to the outside world for help in defending the town. 'It is a question of hours. . . of whether they will be slaughtered or run over by tanks,' said Mr Stefan Siber, a Bosnian official. Amateur radio reports received in Sarajevo said Serb forces had stepped up their shelling of the town. They described panic among the battered population, hiding in underground shelters. Most are hungry, suffering scabies and body lice. 'In the name of God, do something,' said one Serbian TV said Serb forces had come within 1km of the town. UN reports said Serb attacks had subsided to two shells an hour, in the foothills of the Drina River valley. 'We have been saying since February that Srebrenica would fall if some protective measures were not taken,' said Mr Laurens Jolles of the Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It is likely that Serb forces, after seizing control of Srebrenica, would seek to advance on the two other Bosnian government strongholds, Gorazde and Zepa, to the south. This would further undermine the international peace plan on Bosnia which envisages Moslem control of most of eastern Bosnia, on the frontier with Serbia. Bosnian Serbs have rejected the proposed maps because it separates Serb-designated provinces from Serbia. The fall of nearby Kamenica, which cut off a vital route to Srebrenica, left it completely vulnerable. Further, Croat forces severed supply lines into Moslem-held territory which helped Serb forces advance on the badly outgunned Bosnian fighters. UN officials believe an artillery attack on Srebrenica on Monday, which claimed at least 56 lives, left local military leaders reeling with little hope of defending the town. 'I saw bodies everywhere. The streets had been packed with people, taking advantage of a lull in the fighting to get out because they live in hellish conditions,' says Mr Louis Gentile of the UNHCR, who was in the town centre. 'Serb artillery guns pounded the town from north to south for over an hour in an attack clearly designed to hit the main street. They (Serb forces) can probably lob the odd shell without orders. But for the mass and systematic shelling, approval must have come from above,' he added. Refugees from Srebrenica tell how special forces from the Yugoslav army have been operating around the town. 'The people who are attacking us are not from Srebrenica. I lived there; I know who is local and who isn't. They are from Serbia,' said Mrs Azreta Habibovic, a Moslem refugee who recently fled Srebrenica to Tuzla. UN officials have confirmed reports of Yugoslav Army presence in the area. Diplomats based in Belgrade also say there is evidence of army involvement crossing from Serbia to Skelani, just south of Srebrenica.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UTILITIES DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAX ON DEPOSITS, HIGH COURT SAYS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court handed the Bush Administration a $300-million setback today,  saying utility companies don't have to pay income tax on deposits charged  customers to ensure payment of future bills.  </P> <P> The court unanimously ruled that an Indiana electric utility, Indianapolis  Power &amp; Light Co., does not have to pay taxes when collecting such  deposits.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service estimates that more than 150 such cases involving  over $300 million in potential taxes are pending in lower courts or before the  tax agency.  </P> <P> Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the deposits do not  amount to advance payments for electric service, and therefore are not income  for tax purposes.  </P> <P> Although Indiana Power &amp; Light does receive some economic benefit from the  deposits, he said, "IPL's right to retain the money is contingent upon events  outside its control."  </P> <P> The company requires the deposits from new customers whose credit worthiness is  in doubt and existing customers with a record of late payment of their bills.  </P></p>

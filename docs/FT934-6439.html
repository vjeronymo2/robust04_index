			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Dykes survives selection threat Mr Hugh Dykes, the pro-European Tory MP, appeared last night to have survived an attempt to oust him as candidate for Harrow East at the next general election. A motion that he should not be reselected was withdrawn at a meeting of the Harrow East constituency party executive. Officials said privately, however, that the reprieve might only be temporary.</p>

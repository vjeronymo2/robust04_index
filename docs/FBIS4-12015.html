			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 4 Apr (INA)--Iraq has refused to sign an  agreement reached by the OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee  in its 12th session held in Geneva last week. The agreement  calls for maintaining the current crude oil production ceiling  of 24.52 million barrels per day [bpd] until the end of the year.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, Oil Minister Safa'  Hadi Jawad said that Iraq has reiterated its commitment to the  1990 Geneva agreement because it is the only agreement reached  by the OPEC under normal circumstances, because it defines the  level of production and prices in a legitimate way, and because  it is binding on the OPEC member states.    The oil minister said that the recent agreement, which was  not signed by Iraq, will cause further deterioration in oil  prices in the world market because the ceiling is much higher  than the expected world demand for OPEC crude oil, particularly  during the second and third quarters of this year. World demand  for OPEC crude oil is estimated at 23 million bpd, a figure that  is less than OPEC's current production ceiling.    The minister noted that the convening of this meeting came  at  a time when oil prices have deteriorated to a level not seen  since the beginning of the seventies. OPEC, he said, had to  make a choice: Either to reduce the production ceiling to the  level of demand indicated by the oil prices or to maintain the  current production ceiling and sacrifice the prices.    Dr. Jawad indicated that Saudi Arabia rejected the first  choice because it requires it to make a significant drop in its  output. Saudi Arabia's current output amounts to one-third of  the region's output. He added that Saudi Arabia has claimed  that this choice would encourage non-OPEC states to increase  their output, something that would result in the decline of OPEC  output and its share of the oil market. This, according to the  Saudi point of view, would further weaken OPEC. The minister  stressed that the nine-month period specified by the agreement  will eventually result in weakening OPEC and the market because  its does not take into consideration seasonal changes in the  demand for oil.    Concluding his statement to INA, Dr. Safa Hadi Jawad said  that, out of its concern for the individual and collective  interests of the OPEC member states, Iraq has rejected this  agreement and declared its commitment to the Geneva agreement of  1990 for the reasons mentioned above. He urged the oil  exporting nations to adopt stands that protect their interests  and stop the continued looting of their resources through the  continued reduction in oil prices, which have now dropped to  levels lower than those of the early seventies.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Spring takes a rain check - British Summer Time is here again, but wintery weather is still holding back the country's crops The first official day of spring was just over a week ago and British Summer Time began with the advancing of clocks last weekend. But unfortunately no one seems to have informed the clerk of the weather. Both air and soil temperatures remain below normal and growth of crops sown last autumn, together with spring work on the land, is about three weeks late over most of the UK. Continuing unsettled weather with heavy rain falling every few days on to soil still saturated a few inches below the surface from one of the wettest winters on record has also delayed spring activity on the land. No one has yet begun to panic because early springs seldom live up to their apparent promise in the shape of exceptional yields. There is ample time for those crops already established as well as those yet to be planted to make up for lost time and produce respectable tonnages assuming we get reasonable warm weather from now on. But there is concern over the enormous number of patches on fields. Autumn sown cereals in particular are showing significant damage from winter flooding, from which they will not now recover. Tens of thousands of acres of redrilling - that is planting more seeds into those areas killed off by excessive moisture - have already been done at considerable expense. But although it is a good farmer's instinctive reaction to 'patch' such fields the operation is unlikely to produce economic yields. Added together these patches all over the country amount to a significant area of land that will produce severely reduced or nil yields this year. Together with 15 per cent rotational set-aside, now in its second year as a virtually compulsory EU measure to cut production, this now means it is improbable that the 1994 UK cereal harvest will amount to even to last year's weather-depleted 19m tonnes. It is significant to note that in peak harvest years during the mid 1980s the UK produced up to 25m tonnes. Whatever the rest of the European Union is doing Britain would appear to be doing its share to cut surpluses. Meanwhile there are long term concerns about the damage done to soil structure by excessive rain during the last six to eight months. In the arable east, where I farm, for instance, rainfall during that period was up more than 50 per cent on average and the water table is now higher than at any time since 1953. And that only a few months after the official end to a drought that lasted more than three years. The effect all this recent rain has had on soils, especially those which last winter were growing root crops like sugar beet and potatoes and on which heavy equipment had to be used to harvest the crops, has been very serious indeed. A foot or two under the surface of many such soils it is possible to find 'pans' - that is layers of impervious soil caused by the combination of wheelings and water - through which moisture will not drain, thereby perpetuating the problem. The only remedy is to subsoil. That involves pulling large steel tines or shares through the soil 12 inches to 20 inches deep or just below the level of the pan in order to break it up and allow free drainage once more. It is slow, expensive work and can only be done effectively when the soil has dried out. And even that treatment may not be enough in worst cases. Where the problem persists it will be necessary to lay new drains across the land. This is an expensive operation and one that farmers can well do without as EU guaranteed prices begin to decline. I predict we shall be dealing with the unwelcome legacy of the 1993-94 winter for several years to come. Meanwhile most plantings of both potatoes and sugar-beet for harvesting this year are being delayed by the wet weather. With sugar-beet there is, as yet, no cause for undue concern. The crucial date by which the entire crop should be planted is mid-April, after which potential yield can be reduced. Indeed, I will not be at all surprised if, once again, we find ourselves planting sugar-beet through the Easter holiday. But even that is preferable to being stuck in a traffic jam on the way to the coast. Time is begining to run out, however, for second early potatoes. Few have been planted so far and the deadline for achieving optimum yields is fast approaching. In order to create the ridges in which to plant to the seed tubers it is necessary for the soil to be almost dry. That has occurred only occasionally this spring and potato growers still have much of their work to do. There are, however, fewer of them this year than last. The still uncertain future of the Potato Marketing Board, combined with a couple of seasons of serious losses, has persuaded many growers to cut back or get out of production. Taken together these factors could lead to a significant reduction in production this year. That certainly seems to be the opinion of Potato Futures Traders who have bid up the March 1995 price to levels not seen for a few seasons.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux rights COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French communications, energy and communications group, plans to use its FFr4.13bn (Dollars 702m) rights issue chiefly to invest in electricity generation in the US, radiotelephones in France and cable television in the UK, as well as to retire debt. Giving details of the issue it announced last month, Generale des Eaux said that it planned to issue 1,837,043 shares at FFr2,250 a share. Existing shareholders will have the right to one new share for every 14 they hold. The subscription period will be from November 15 to December 6. The price of the new shares compares with Friday's Paris closing price of FFr2,617 and reflects the fact that companies raising capital in the French market are having to compete with the Balladur government's privatisation programme.</p>

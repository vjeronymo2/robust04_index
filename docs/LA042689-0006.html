			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CHOOSES LUCAS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS POST  </P> <P> President Bush announced Tuesday that he will nominate William Lucas, a black  lawyer who has been criticized by some leading civil rights organizations, to  head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.  </P> <P> Lucas, former sheriff and chief executive of Michigan's Wayne County, which  includes Detroit, has a background in law enforcement but virtually no  experience with federal civil rights laws. His background has led the NAACP,  among other groups, to oppose his nomination.  </P> <P> White House officials, however, have dismissed the opposition, suggesting that  it is motivated primarily by partisanship. Speaking to reporters Tuesday  afternoon in Orange County, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh repeated the charge of  partisanship and gave Lucas a warm endorsement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confidence Declared  </P> <P> "Both the President and I have a great deal of confidence in Bill Lucas'  integrity, experience and competence," Thornburgh said. "He has lived the civil  rights story."  </P> <P> Lucas, he said, "has the President's full backing and my full backing."  </P> <P> Lucas, who was once a Democrat, switched to the Republican Party in the early  1980s and has been one of the few notable examples of success in the GOP  campaign to seek black support. He ran in 1986 as the GOP candidate to be  Michigan's governor but lost badly to incumbent Democrat James J. Blanchard.  </P> <P> Although announcement of the nomination long had been anticipated, it was  delayed for several weeks by background checks. The White House announced the  decision while Bush was here to deliver a speech on trade and competitiveness  at a Ford Aerospace plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Capital Gains Tax  </P> <P> Bush used the speech to repeat his calls for lower taxes on capital gains --  income from the sale of assets such as stocks or bonds. Bush maintains that the  lower tax rate would spur investment. Democratic critics say it would merely  line the pockets of the rich and have declared the proposal dead in Congress.  </P> <P> Lucas' nomination would appear to have a relatively good chance for Senate  confirmation, despite the opposition from the NAACP. He has received the  endorsements of a number of prominent politicians, including Rep. John Conyers  Jr. (D-Mich.), a senior congressional Black Caucus member who represents  Detroit.  </P> <P> As assistant attorney general heading the Civil Rights Division, Lucas would  fill the job held for most of the past eight years by one of the Ronald Reagan  Administration's most controversial figures, William Bradford Reynolds.  Reynolds was the architect of many of the Reagan Administration's attempts to  dismantle traditional federal civil rights remedies.  </P></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Gehe raises offer for French drug group THE BIDDING war for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique (OCP) hotted up yesterday when Gehe, the German drug distributor, raised its offer for France's largest drug wholesaler, to 16.8 per cent above a French-American bid. In one of few recent contested takeovers in France, Gehe is offering FFr985 a share in a full bid for OCP, which is now worth FFr2.6bn (Dollars 480m). Dr Dieter Schadt, Gehe's president, said 'the very high price' reflected his company's desire to 'shorten the process', started by Gehe with a bid of FFr800 a share in February. Gehe, however, was not confident yesterday that its bid would knock out the rival bid mounted by Cooper, a French pharmaceutical company, in alliance with Bergen Brunswick of the US. 'Both sides have a lot of ammunition,' said Dr Dieter Kammerer, Gehe's vice-president. He said a third bidder could not be excluded and noted that McKesson, the large US pharmaceutical wholesaler, had shown interest in getting into Europe. Gehe's first bid was disallowed by the French courts because of an arrangement between the German company and Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, a former president of OCP who runs the French company's operational distribution units Eurosante and OCP-Repartition. The court ruled that the arrangement was unfair because it would have denied the Franco-American consortium effective management of OCP even if it gained the shares of the contested French company. As a result of the ruling, any successful bidder for OCP has been promised effective control of the entire operation. There was no word last night on whether Aura Expansion, the bid vehicle of Cooper and Bergen-Brunswick, wants to improve its FFr865-a-share offer, which runs until June 28. Gehe said if it got OCP, it would bring its German drug wholesaling operation, which has 18 per cent of the German market, under OCP. The new grouping would function as a European unit. Gehe executives said they planned to recoup their investment in OCP by using their information technology know-how to improve the French company's margins. Drug distribution is highly complex in France and Germany because it requires serving lots of individually-owned pharmacies several times a day, in contrast to the UK which allows chains of chemist shops.</p>

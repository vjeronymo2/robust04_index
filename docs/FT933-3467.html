			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / AEA smoothes way for sell-off AEA Technology, formerly the UK Atomic Energy Authority, has announced reorganisation plans which could help smooth its path towards privatisation. AEA has told its 8,000 staff that, from next April, it is to divide its activities into three separate divisions to differentiate more clearly between core businesses. Staff have already been told that the workforce will fall to around 7,500 by next March. A spokesman said yesterday that the reorganisation could lead to a further reduction in employee numbers. No details of job losses are yet available but the company has said it hopes any redundancies can be made on a voluntary basis. Under the structure AEA will run a commercial division, which it hopes will provide the basis for any sell-off, and a government division which will continue to handle all government nuclear installations and liabilities. There will also be a services division. The changes follow an analysis of AEA's activities undertaken as part of the company's representations to the government on privatisation. Ministers commissioned their own report on moving AEA into the private sector in April. Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, said the changes were 'logical and, indeed, essential to securing AEA's successful future'.</p>

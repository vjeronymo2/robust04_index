			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Yeltsin troops seal off parliament: Tension rises as Moscow riot police disperse 3,000 demonstrators PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin sealed off the White House, or Russian parliament, with barbed wire, troops and trucks yesterday and ordered its defenders to hand over their weapons by 11am Moscow time today - 9am in London. The cordon, the biggest deployment of force since Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament a week ago, is designed to step up pressure on deputies and their guards. It may stay in place for some days. With tension rising, about 3,000 anti-Yeltsin demonstrators last night commandeered trolley buses and blocked two of Moscow's main roads near the parliament. But the crowd never looked threatening and riot police with clubs and shields dispersed them with little trouble. Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, said tough measures would soon be taken to remove the 100 or so deputies and their supporters still in the parliament building. He repeated that the building would not be stormed. People wanting to leave the White House were ushered through the security cordon but not allowed back. The cordon was erected through main thoroughfares, back streets, playgrounds and apartment block backyards, including the US Embassy compound and the former Comecon building, now housing - among others - the office of the International Monetary Fund. Inside the darkened, unheated building, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, told the few journalists who found themselves inside the lines that surrender was not on his agenda. 'We are not going to use arms (first) but if there is an attempt to storm it (parliament), we will rebuff it,' he said. 'Blood spilt will be on the hands of those who support the coup d'etat.' The Interior Ministry said greatly increased security was justified, given the number of weapons within the building, displayed by defenders before television cameras in earlier days, and the mental state of those holding them. It, too, said its troops were not about to attack. An official of Krasnopresnenskaya district council, one of many in Moscow that voiced opposition to Mr Yeltsin, said that deputies shut out of the parliament were preparing a 'parliament in exile'. Earlier, Mr Yeltsin ruled out any compromise - especially that which seems to have most support, to convene simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections. He stuck to his plan for elections to a new-style parliament on December 11-12 and presidential elections on June 12. Meanwhile the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II - before whom Mr Yeltsin took his oath of office as president - cut short a visit to the US to plead with 'all branches of power in Russia' to 'reach a reasonable compromise' on the political crisis.

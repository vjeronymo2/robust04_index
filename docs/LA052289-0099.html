			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MAN DIES AFTER FIGHT WITH OFFICERS  </P> <P> A young man who "quit breathing" after a struggle with Santa Ana police  officers who were trying to detain him following an apparently drug-induced  rampage died today at a Fountain Valley hospital, police said.  </P> <P> The man, whose identity was not immediately known, was pronounced dead at 4:47  a.m. at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center where he was taken  after struggling with several Santa Ana officers shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday,  said Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas.  </P> <P> Police had responded to complaints from several residents in the 1600 block of  West Brook Street that a man was running across their rooftops, tearing down  television antennas and "behaving in a wild and bizarre manner," Thomas said.  The man was detained at gunpoint by one of the residents whose home the man had  entered, brandishing a butcher knife. When police arrived a few minutes later,  they attempted to subdue the man without using their weapons, Thomas said. A  fierce struggle ensued, after which the man stopped breathing and Santa Ana  fire paramedics were called. An autopsy is to be performed later today.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . .: GUIDELINES FOR SOUFFLE  </P> <P> There's been plenty of discussion about whether you can -- or cannot --  microwave souffles successfully. We say you can, and we've got the recipe to  prove it.  </P> <P> Microwave souffles may not rise as high as those made the old time way, but  they will puff about three-fourths of an inch above the rim of the souffle dish  and won't collapse the instant they come from the oven.  </P> <P> Microwaved souffles don't brown, it's true. But they are exquisitely moist and  velvety; and with an appropriate sauce, they are superb. For perfect microwave  souffles, read -- and abide by -- these guidelines:  </P> <P> 1. Follow the recipe exactly. Although you can safely substitute one herb for  another, never change the basic proportions of butter, flour, liquid, egg and  principal flavoring (cheese, fish, chicken, for example).  </P> <P> 2. For a slightly more stable souffle, use evaporated milk in place of light  cream.  </P> <P> 3. To stabilize egg whites and make them climb to greater heights, beat them  with a bit of cream of tartar.  </P> <P> 4. For a more evenly risen, evenly cooked souffle, use an ungreased  straight-sided, microwave-safe souffle dish in the size specified, never one  larger or smaller. Also, smooth the surface of the souffle batter lightly;  peaks will only dry during microwaving. Finally, use a turntable. It eliminates  the need to rotate the souffle frequently and gives it a professional look. A  turntable can sometimes speed cooking as much as two to three minutes.  </P> <P> 5. For maximum volume, microwave a souffle uncovered. The top will dry faster,  too -- a definite plus.  </P> <P> 6. To allow a souffle to rise slowly and evenly and to keep its edges from  overcooking before the center is done, microwave on MEDIUM-LOW or DEFROST.  </P></p>

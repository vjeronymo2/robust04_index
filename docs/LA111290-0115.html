			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE CEO PAY GROWS FASTER THAN FIRMS' PROFITS;  </P> <P> COMPENSATION: A STUDY FINDS THAT THE VALUE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES' SALARIES AND  BENEFITS ROSE 9% IN 1989, WHILE THEIR FIRMS' PROFITS WERE UP ONLY 5.9%.  </P> <P> When growth is the yardstick, being a big-time California chief executive is  more profitable than being a big California corporation.  </P> <P> That's the conclusion of management consultant Towers Perrin, which surveyed  CEO compensation at the state's 100 biggest public companies.  </P> <P> The study found that the median increase in CEO compensation was 9% last year,  giving the CEOs median cash pay of $750,000.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, net income of the companies studied rose just 5.9%. Worse yet,  return on equity fell 2.6%.  </P> <P> "Clearly, the relationship between pay and company results is weak," says  Donald L. Lowman, a principal of Towers Perrin. "Executive pay in California,  as in the country overall, is on a far faster track than corporate  performance."  </P> <P> By national standards, the California executives were not egregiously  compensated. Towers Perrin said median compensation of chief executives of the  top 100 U.S. industrial companies was up 9.2% last year.  </P> <P> The California study, based on 1989 proxy statements, looked at pay, incentives  and supplemental benefits of the top five executives at the companies analyzed,  as well as for outside directors.  </P> <P> Other results:  </P> <P> * The natural resources and entertainment industries consistently paid their  executives more than other industries.  </P> <P> * The services and health-care sectors consistently paid less.  </P> <P> * Restricted stock grants are the fastest growing long-term incentive device.  </P> <P> * The median 1989 retainer paid to outside directors was $20,000. The median  board meeting fee was $1,000.  </P></p>

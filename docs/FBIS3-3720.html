Sources from the Tianjin Municipal Land Administration said  that more than 800 square kilometers of virgin land, mostly with  saline- alkali soil, is scattered outside the urban areas of the  city. Most of them, near the city proper and convenient for  transportation, have a large development potential.    Experts say it is rare for such a large industrial city as  Tianjin, about two hours drive from Beijing, to have so much  waste land. However, some of the land is now being utilized.    In the Dagang District, a petrochemical zone, a chemical  plant to manufacture 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is being  built within an expanse of 120 square kilometers of waste land.  Another project to produce 200,000 tons of polyester will also  be built there.    Another 200-square-kilometer piece of land, along a major  highway leading to northeast China, rich in water supply and  near the urban area, will become another industrial zone for the  city.    In addition, a third tract of about two ha. [hectares] of  waste land will be used to grow vegetables and to raise  livestock. Some other areas will be developed for tourism.    Mu Xueming, deputy chief engineer at the Tianjin Municipal  Planning and Design Bureau, said that the waste land will  provide an important site for the development of Tianjin and  Beijing as well.    "While Beijing will become China's political and cultural  center, Tianjin, which is only 137 kilometers away, will be  turned into an economic center in northern China, and the large  amount of virgin land makes it possible to do civil construction  and to expand industries," he said.    XINHUA has learned that over the next ten years Tianjin  plans  to build, within some 350 square kilometers of land, a new city  and an economic zone involving the metallurgical sector, the  chemical industry and commerce, finance and tourism.</p>

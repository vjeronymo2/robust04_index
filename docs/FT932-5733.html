			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: EniChem predicts strong upturn ENICHEM, the troubled Italian state-owned chemicals group which lost L1,560bn (Dollars 1.06bn) after tax in 1992, has forecast gross operating profits of about L1,000bn this year due to restructuring measures. The claim by Mr Giorgio Porta, EniChem's outgoing chairman, has been greeted with some scepticism given the size of last year's losses, which were well above expectations. Mr Porta, who is being replaced by Mr Marcello Colitti, said EniChem's biggest problem was the size of its debts and interest charges. Interest costs, adjusted for disposals, rose by L131bn to L893bn in 1992, while total net debt climbed to L7,391bn from L7,004bn, in spite of a cash injection from the Eni group. Mr Porta said gross operating profits had risen by 46 per cent to L230bn by end-March and should reach L400bn by mid-year - 33 per cent above the corresponding figure for 1992 and 50 per cent higher when adjusted for acquisitions and disposals. Last year, gross operating profits totalled L586bn. First-quarter sales in 1993 were L2,700bn, 4 per cent below the same period last year. Adjusted for disposals, revenues rose by 5 per cent.</p>

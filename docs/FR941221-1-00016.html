			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments were received in response to the ANPRM. In general, there was no consensus among the comments; in fact, some waterways were nominated both for and against escorting. In most cases, arguments were subjective and without supporting data. For example, arguments against escorting frequently cited substantial adverse economic impact, but did not include any cost analyses. Similarly, nominations for a waterway were frequently made on the basis of environmental sensitivity to oil spills, but did not include any analyses of navigational hazards to vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Coast Guard is developing criteria for evaluating the navigational risks of a waterway, and how to determine if escorting is an effective strategy to offset those risks. The purpose of the public meeting is to seek more direct comment on the criteria (refer to Discussion paragraph (5) further in this notice). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Regulatory History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate rulemaking to define areas where single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons (GT) transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two ``towing vessels'' (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101) or other vessels deemed appropriate. By statute, these defined areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska and Puget Sound, Washington (and associated waters). Rulemaking authority under this section has been delegated to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard (49 CFR 1.46(11)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also has broad authority under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S. Code 1221&hyph;1236, to control vessel traffic in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States which the Secretary determines to be hazardous by, among other things, establishing vessel operating conditions. Rulemaking authority under this section has been delegated to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard (49 CFR 1.46(n)(4)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard is implementing vessel escorting regulations in two separate rulemaking projects: CGD 91&hyph;202 addresses escort requirements for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters, and CGD 91&hyph;202a addresses escort requirements for other U.S. waters. A final rule for the first rulemaking action (Prince William Sound and Puget Sound) was published on August 19, 1994 (59 FR 42962). This final rule created 33 CFR part 168. A notice of partial suspension of effectiveness was published on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54519) which suspended one of the final rule provisions (the crash-stop criteria) from going into effect pending further technical study and public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the second rulemaking project, the Coast Guard published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (58 FR 25766; April 27, 1993) seeking comment on other U.S. waters where an escort should be required, and other vessels that should also be escorted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: USAir tie-up with BA gets the hard sell - How two airlines are planning to build on their new relationship TWO airlines, one vision: this is how British Airways and USAir are hammering home the message that they are now linked. The advertisements, for which USAir footed the bill, hit TV screens in the US within hours of the Department of Transportation giving approval to a code-sharing agreement between the two carriers. Mr Seth Schofield, chief executive at USAir, is the first to acknowledge that there is a useful 'halo' effect for his carrier from the relationship with BA. USAir had two troublesome mergers back in the late 1980s, acquiring a heavy debt load in the process. It fell into the 'financially-troubled' class, and its reputation suffered accordingly. But do the ads over-hype the practical impact of BA-USAir relationship? Or can the two carriers use the next 12 months - the period to which code-sharing approval applies - to establish meaningful operational ties? Executives from both companies are tackling this issue. Meetings between nine senior staff at British Airways and 11 from USAir got under way on Monday night, the first top-level forum since the carriers announced their engagement last July. Some plans are already clear. On the code-sharing front, for example, the airlines intend to start operating synchronised flights, sharing the same designator code in computer reservation systems, between London and three US cities - Syracuse, Rochester, Cleveland - on May 1. By January 1994, 'code-share' flights should have expanded to 38 destinations, with the domestic and transatlantic portions connecting at four USAir hub airports (Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Baltimore). On these flights, passengers will find one ticketing point and one baggage check-in. They will then board a USAir jet, still in its familiar USAir livery, for the US portion of the journey. They will switch to a BA aircraft, with BA cabin staff, for the transatlantic segment. In addition, there is to be a 'wet-lease agreement' on London-Baltimore and London-Pittsburgh routes. USAir will provide the cabin crews working on these flights and also the aircraft. However, the flights will look like, and be marketed as, a BA service. The cabin staff will wear BA uniforms, on-board service will match the BA brands, and the Boeing 767 aircraft will be refurbished internally and externally in BA colours. This set-up carries some training implications; USAir employees who are selected to work these routes will be required to learn BA procedures. But Mr Schofield has no doubts that the carriers' operational tie-up can go significantly further, within the confines of existing US approval. It would be possible, he suggests, for USAir to provide ground-handling services for BA in the US, and for BA to do the reverse in the UK. Co-ordination of flight schedules, even when there is no code-sharing, is a likely prospect. Joint buying - whether for fuel, food or aircraft - is another area described as flush with opportunities. In many of these cases, it would be necessary to structure the arrangements carefully, so that the two carriers have 'an arm's length business relationship'. But, via joint-venture companies, and provided each carrier is 'using its business judgment of what is in its own interests', Mr Schofield sees few problems and real savings. The code-sharing agreement itself, meanwhile, requires that the carriers set to work on integrating their computer software for these flights within a specified time-period. The obvious problem in pushing the relationship too far is US anti-trust law. Northwest Airlines and KLM, the Dutch carrier which acquired a minority stake in the US airline in the late-1980s, laboured for some years to build a relationship based on code-sharing and the like. However, according to their submission to the DoT last year, 'a comprehensive alliance . . . between a US carrier and a foreign carrier exposes those carriers to the very real risk that their collaborative planning, scheduling, pricing and marketing of services could be challenged as being per se price-fixing and market allocation agreements between horizontal competitors'. Accordingly, these carriers argued that they were only able to achieve limited benefits, and that the more substantial advantages of 'a truly integrated air service' required anti-trust immunity. Mr Schofield is fairly sanguine that none of the proposals he is outlining will encounter this danger. 'I think we're fine as far as the Justice Department is concerned,' he says, noting that there has been consultation with the authorities on this score and that USAir has been careful to state that it will divest its own US-UK route authorities as part of the deal. So what, at the end of the day, will the revised USAir-BA tie-up lack operationally which the earlier version of the deal would have provided ? Under the first investment agreement announced last year, BA's financial commitment would have been larger - Dollars 750m at the outset, for a potential 44 per cent stake, compared with Dollars 300m for a 19.9 per cent interest. BA would also have had greater control over its US partner, and been able, for example, to veto certain board decisions. Thereafter, it is the full 'principles of integration' - the detailed arrangements which could have led to a common logo, one livery and so on - which are missing. 'Common branding will not be able to go forward,' says Mr Schofield. Whether that will have a big impact on the bottom line is debatable. Northwest/KLM argued that there was an appreciable difference between full integration and their attempts at a more limited blending of operations. Mr Schofield sees it differently: 'From a revenue point of view, I do not believe it will make that much difference'. However, BA insists that its original proposal, involving broad integration of the two airlines, remains its preferred option.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Heir Sues Lawyers for Representing Mother: Oil heir Howard B. Keck Jr., scion  of an eminent philanthropic family, filed a malpractice suit against his  lawyers, claiming their representation of his mother in her divorce is likely  to dilute his expected inheritance. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit stems  from the divorce battle of Elizabeth Avery Keck and Howard B. Keck Sr., whose  father founded Superior Oil Co.  </P> <P> The suit seeks unspecified damages because the Los Angeles firm of Trope &amp;  Trope, in representing Mrs. Keck, allegedly used "confidential information" it  learned while representing Keck's son for 20 years. The younger Keck says his  inheritance could be reduced if his mother prevails in her divorce battle. The  firm denies a conflict of interest. (Filed April 30, 1990. Case No. C759915)  </P></p>

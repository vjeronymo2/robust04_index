			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / US consumer confidence falls sharply: Blow to campaigning Bush as Greenspan concedes that figures are 'quite disturbing' US CONSUMER confidence dropped sharply this month to the lowest level since 1974, raising fresh doubts about the outlook for economic recovery. The news was a blow to President George Bush, who is on the campaign trail trying to win support from disgruntled middle-income voters. The Conference Board, a New York-based business consultancy group, said its widely followed index of confidence fell to 46.3 from a revised 50.2 in January, the fifth consecutive monthly decline. Confidence is more than 30 points below the levels recorded during last summer's stuttering recovery and well under half the level that would indicate a strong economy. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday repeated his prediction that the business climate would improve shortly. But testifying before the Senate banking committee, he was distinctly less upbeat than in his testimony last week. The confidence figures were 'quite disturbing', he said. The Fed had to be 'particularly sensitive to signs that the anticipated strengthening in business activity is not emerging and be prepared to act should the need arise'. recovery should not be exaggerated and warned that the incipient recovery 'could peter out, as indeed the much more vigorous recovery of last spring petered out'. Senator Donald Riegle, the Democrat chairman of the banking committee, called for a more aggressive monetary policy, telling Mr Greenspan: 'I think you are too passive.' On Wall Street, the confidence figures and Mr Greenspan's more bearish remarks renewed hopes that the Fed might cut interest rates again. The long bond was up a third of a point in late trading having surged on release of the confidence figures. Shares fell on fears of a fresh delay in recovery, although they finished above the day's lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 24.59 at 3,257.83. The dollar rebounded strongly in late US trading as the currency market shrugged off the seemingly gloomy data. It closed in New York at DM1.6575 after dropping to DM1.6395 in London. Analysts said the most worrying aspect of the survey was a sharp decline in a component measuring future expectations. This fell to 62.2 compared with 68.7 last month and over 100 last summer, suggesting that consumers have become much more pessimistic. Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the consumer's prime concern was job security. Mr Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the figures made a cut in interest rates likely, probably after next week's employment report.

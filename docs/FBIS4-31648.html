			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gordana Igric: "Belgrade: Newcomers and </F> Old-Timers: Sam Plays It Again"]    [Text] Belgrade at night is reminiscent of Casablanca  in the 1940's. Rich refugees and local "businessmen" drown their  shady profiteer dealings in whiskey.    The watchman at a parking lot in downtown Belgrade, a  refugee  from Gorazde, loudly interprets the Serb right to the city that  was once 70 percent Muslim, complains that he was not permitted  to sing Serb songs there (Tito forbade it) and that he  sacrificed great wealth for that. Now he is annoyed at the  people of Serbia, who are only looking out for their own. He  says that he lived only for a Greater Serbia, but now people  look at his wife and children askance when they pick up their  refugee packet. The people of Serbia do not know what true  Serbhood is.    At that, a master electrician rushes out of the lobby.    "You are still crying for Tito. How is it that I sang Serb  songs and because of that slaved to make an honest living? And  you could have but did not want to. And I assume that you earned  your wealth honestly, with your own two hands? There are bombs  falling on your city while you pontificate to me. What kind of  people are these?" the man from Sumadija says, throwing up his  hands. "They prefer Greater Serbia and Belgrade to their own  Bosnia and their own neighbors."    The tense atmosphere on the street, on a day when bombs were  falling on Gorazde, is simply a reflection of the cold war being  waged by newcomers and old-timers, two afflicted and divided  worlds. People from the war zones have brought to ethnically  indifferent Belgrade the dream of a Greater Serbia and of ethnic  purity, while to the people of Belgrade their Serbhood seems a  bit clumsy and silly. The fabric of wartime Belgrade is being  eaten away by different dialects, customs, economic  expectations, patriotism, and cash-based patriotism.  <H5>  In the Hands of New "Owners" </H5>   The old Belgrade is no more. The new, xenophobic one throws  a  Molotov cocktail at the Committee for Refugees, beats up street  cleaners who do not have Serb surnames. Instead of bohemians,  there are "skinheads," newly formed bullies, cruising around the  city. In the morning, this sort of warning appears on the door  of a building: "Do not tempt your fate. They can beat you up  because they find you at home, they can rape your wife, mistreat  your children--if you do not lock your front door."    Belgrade at night is irresistibly reminiscent of Casablanca,  a big waiting room where very rich refugees and local  "businessmen" drown their shady profiteer dealings in whiskey.  The new owners of the city, arriving from the battlefield, have  little in common with Bogart. Belgradians who managed to survive  the communist invasion in 1945 and the decades of influx from  rural areas bristle at this "new class" that is feeding the  animosity toward all newcomers.    Luxury cars (with registration from the war zone), Rolex  watches, mistresses in white fox coats--these are status symbols  of the "foreign element" in the heart of Belgrade. Special  shops, chains of coffee shops, bought-out boutiques, money spent  mercilessly--this is the smell of the new Belgrade.    At the nighttime bar "Princ," four "businessmen" run up a  bill of 800 German marks [DM] in one night. A tip of only DM200  for the waiter. The "Hyatt" or "Plavi Jahac" are cult locations.  Nightclubs are split into those where drinking is "fear-based"  and where patrons buy on informal "credit" payable every month.  At "Promocija," a waiter who tries to collect a bill gets a  pistol held to his head, and the bill is not paid. The outline  of a pistol inside a jacket serves as a sign to the waiter at  "Princ" that he should not approach that table. Young policemen  drink free of charge, which is how the owners pay for their  protection. Everyday patrons drink on credit and pay at the end  of the month.    The war has given the city a Colombian air. According to  lawyer Rajko Danilovic, an old Belgradian, it all began back  before the war, when hand-picked criminals were doing the  political police's dirty liquidator work abroad. When the war  began, they offered their services to the regime and pillaged  the battlefields under the guise of patriotism. Now they are  seriously counting on recognition and a "reward for service."    "Some of them continue to lay waste to the war zone, while  others are involved in the trade in arms or fuel, together with  the `white collars' and wealthy refugees. With the state's  consent, a new establishment is being born with foreign exchange  and contacts with commercial banks. The dominant role in this  symbiosis is played by newcomers who are `coping'; without them,  there is no `business' in Bosnia. Thus, they are a sort of  lobby, dazzling their fellow citizens with symbols of success.  Belgradians are not easily impressed."  <H5>  Citizens and City-Haters </H5>   "Plavi Jahac" brings together "young Bosnia." The same  guests  come every day, each spending DM100 daily. The people here are  Karadzic's children, snipers from Sarajevo, smugglers of alcohol  and cigarettes, but also cosmopolitan Bosnian youth.    Natasa Markovic, a journalist and the owner of "Plavi  Jahac,"  longs for the old Belgrade and refuses to believe that the  "occupation" will last.    ``Belgradians have closed themselves off in their apartments  and in privacy, while nationalistic madmen and city-haters roam  the heart of the city. This is most of all a war of  civilization. I am frightened of the city-haters. I was sitting  in `Plavi Jahac' with one of the well-known TV editors from Pale  when I was `promised' that in a few years Sarajevo would be an  `ecological city'--a cornfield. Now I know for sure--that is the  dream of the city-haters. I know that they would do the same  thing to Belgrade if they could. I am torn when I look at the  young people in the bar, with their roots severed, but I also  get mad when they say that they have `given everything for the  Serb cause' and that they are our `liberators.'    Zora Cavic-Ilic, a translator and member of a diplomatic  family from precommunist Belgrade, comments with agitation:    ``No one is happy. Only those who are naive, like children.  Those who caused this war should have foreseen the animosity.  We, the old Belgradians, live closed off, attentively following  what is happening from a distance. That is also how we reacted  to the Germans and to the Partisan `liberators.' We maintained  our integrity. We have learned to survive and, like dolphins, to  pass our experience on to our children through our genes. But  the squalor enters every pore. It is in the air, our language is  contaminated by it, there is horrible cursing, and people talk  as if they are shouting from two hills. TV offers mediocrity and  vulgarity as the universally applicable style, impudently  imposing ignorance and vulgarity. And things could get worse.    "But," he warns, "a certain obstinacy has been awakened in  me, an obstinacy to preserve myself like a rare animal. I will  not accept a city of dirty cars, dirty shoes, and greasy hair."    Walking on the same street with the old Belgradians is Rosa  E., a 50-year-old refugee from Sarajevo. A prominent high school  teacher, she lives in an attic with her son, cleans other  people's apartments, and when people scowl at her on the bus  because of her different dialect she closes her eyes and the  past returns: world travel, a weekend place on Korcula, two  luxurious apartments in Sarajevo, crystal, and furs. Everything  has been lost for good. She says that she will nevertheless  return to Grbavica, to a vacated Muslim apartment. Here she has  no roots.    An 80-year-old woman from Sarajevo, a former editor of  PROSVETA who barely survived the first wartime winter in Bosnia,  understands and loves Belgrade, and talks about Karadzic and  Mladic as war criminals, as the biggest enemies of the Serb  nation.    At the other refugee extreme, a 20-year-old disabled veteran  from Brcko, with one leg missing, is embittered toward the  opposition, Vuk Draskovic, and the peace movement. And also  toward the Serbians, the degenerates of the Serb tribe.  Enthusiastically he says: "After the war in Bosnia is over, we  will come here; someone must teach you what Serbhood and  Orthodoxy are."    "I had thought that the invasion of Belgrade was over, but  we  are experiencing it all anew," summarizes Rajko Danilovic. "The  ones in 1945 acted like victors, with a right to city life, our  property, and pretty Belgrade women. The new ones do not  resemble the old ones, because they are experiencing defeat  instead of victory. They bear the stamp of guilt."    What will tomorrow bring?    According to one poll conducted in Belgrade, 70 percent of  those questioned feel that the coming year will be better,  because it cannot be any worse.    Predrag Simic, director of the Institute for International  Policy and Economics, said this to THE NEW YORK TIMES: "Serbs in  Serbia no longer regard Bosnian Serbs as victims. How can you  sympathize with people like General Mladic and others? They are  people who should be pitied. We increasingly regard them as  people who are dragging us into misfortune. Antiwar sentiment  has gained a great deal of strength here."    However, pessimists expect only more misfortune once the war  is over and accounts are settled. In their opinion, some  disoriented people will return, but also arriving in the  "waiting room" will be new people from impoverished Knin or  "liberated" Zvornik. It is believed that Belgrade will never rid  itself of criminals and profiteers. In the future, they will  become influential and respected citizens of Belgrade,  industrialists or politicians with clear positions in the  establishment. They will decide the fate of the meek citizens  who do not have pagers and revolvers.</p>

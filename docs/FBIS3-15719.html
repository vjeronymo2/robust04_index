Kremlin sources, who said earlier that President Boris  Yeltsin's meeting with Nixon was now "problematic", have just  told ITAR-TASS that the Russian president has refused to meet  the American visitor.    Competent sources told ITAR-TASS that the cancellation of  these meetings was decided after the former American president  met former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, amnestied  recently.    Nixon's initiative must have been seen as a sign of  disrespect for the political will of the Russian leadership.    On Tuesday, Richard Nixon told journalists that Russian  authorities had not hampered his contacts with the leaders of  the oppositional forces.    But to all appearances, after demonstrating their democratic  thinking, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Filatov reserved the  right to view Nixon's contacts with opposition leaders,  including one of the organisers of the armed resistance to  President Yeltsin last autumn, as they saw fit.</p>

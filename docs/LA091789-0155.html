			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING / EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> Public hearings continue Monday on the environmental impact report for the  controversial Foothill/Trabuco Specific Plan, which would establish development  guidelines for 6,500 acres of backcountry east of Mission Viejo. County  planners have recommended that 1,700 new homes be allowed in the hill and  canyon country.  </P> <P> Environmentalists gained a victory last week when the Planning Commission  recommended that Rose Canyon Road -- a three-mile-long proposed road through  Trabuco Canyon -- be eliminated from the county's master plan of highways. The  County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the specific plan later this  year.  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Vasco da gaffa Premier Li may be forgiven for thinking that the local press has it in for him. In the Portuguese colony of Macao, hacks have just landed an uncomfortable exclusive, c/o the office of General Vasco Rocha Vieira, the governor. His officials have compiled a profile of Li, describing him as arrogant and incompetent. Of course, it was intended for the general only. But you can't keep a grubby hack down. Very poor show, not least because the general is now on an eight-day official trip to China, where today he will meet Li. Even more poor show, Macao - a Portuguese colony since 1557 - is due to revert to Chinese rule in 1999. Still, five years should be enough for the general to find himself another job.</p>

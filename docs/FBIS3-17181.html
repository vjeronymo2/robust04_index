He said at a sitting of the government presidium  that the policy of economic stabilization should lie in  implementation of the most promising projects capable of bearing  fruit in 1994-1995. The deputy prime minister believes that if  such a policy is carried out, within a year the slump in  industry will reach 12 percent, while the gross domestic product  will be 80 percent of the 1993 level. If this happens, Shokhin  predicts that the monthly rate of inflation could reach seven to  nine percent by the end of the year. The deputy prime minister  believes it necessary to mobilize all means of increasing the  revenue side of the budget.</p>

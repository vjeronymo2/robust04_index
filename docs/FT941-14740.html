			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Jobs: Turn of the tide is confirmed - Why changes in executive employment may cause upheavals in housing and pensions markets Three cheers are nowhere near enough for the Jobs column's present writer to call for this morning. The reason is that, with only two weeks to go before giving way to my successor and heading for retirement, I would much rather hand over on a rising tide than on the ebb. Hence the breathless hush that awaited the latest executive-demand statistics was not due entirely to my addicted smoking. Five solid years of decline in the United Kingdom market are scarcely conducive to optimism, and though July-to-September last year had shown an upturn, it was slight enough to have been blotted out by a renewed plunge in October-December. Then up came the new figures from the M S L International consultancy, and . . . Whoopee] The results, which refer only to job-offers which are advertised in UK national journals, are summarised in the table alongside. First we have the number of posts offered in eight broad types of executive work. The broadest by far is the 'Others' category which sweeps together such people as buyers, company legal staff, economists and variegated consultants. Each opening is counted as one, by the way, no matter how many times the advertisement for it appears. Next comes the annual total, which is broken down below into the quarterly tallies. As may be seen, the tide is rising, albeit from much the lowest low recorded since MSL began its three-monthly checks on the advertised demand 35 years back. Even so, it is not only the increased total which provides encouragement; more is to be found in the counts for the separate types of work above it. What prompted my previous scepticism about a sustained rise was that the small upturn shown by the September figures was fuelled by year-on-year increases in only two of the eight work categories: sales and marketing, and computing. All the rest were still sliding downwards. Now, happily, the position has been reversed with six on the rise and only two sinking, of which production has plummeted to only about a quarter of the record high of 7,589 which it reached in 1988. But there is less cause for gloom in the still falling counts for personnel shown by the table, which probably underestimate the true strength of demand. That is because - unlike other categories, in which the national journals checked by MSL are the standard medium for advertising executive-level vacancies - most openings in personnel are offered through the professional press. Moreover, there are further heartening signs in the separate counts MSL makes of demand in four particular industrial sectors. All were up last year on their 1992 figures. The smallest of the increases was just over 8 per cent to 774 jobs in energy and related industries, compared with 17 per cent to 579 posts in what used to be termed 'food, drink and tobacco', but in the interests of political correctness has now been reduced to 'food and drink'. Retailing did better with a 58 per cent rise, even though to only 758 openings in total. Best of the lot was the high-tech field which leapt by 83 per cent to 1,847. On the whole, therefore, it looks as though my successor will be bringing you cheerier news than I have done this past half-decade. Nevertheless, while it's to be hoped that the demand will never again plumb such depths, I doubt that it will ever again rise to even near the 40,202 tally of 1988. My suspicion is that, in the UK at least, executive employment has undergone severe and permanent shrinkage, whose ramifications will be far-reaching. One close observer who agrees - seeing housing and pensions, particularly, as likely to feel the effects - is Jack Daniels. He is director of the careers service at the University of St Andrews, and over the years the Jobs column has come to regard him as Britain's foremost salesman of the services of new graduates. The reason is that, although his ancient university has the disadvantages of being small and off the beaten track except for golfers, its degree-winners have consistently done better in the jobs market than those of the great majority of the other UK universities. But he tells me that St Andrews's consistent success conceals radical changes in the pattern of graduate recruitment. One of them is that short-term contracts, often of only a year, are fast replacing the open-ended employment that used to be the rule. Meanwhile degree-winners have less chance of any job with a big organisation straight after university. Instead they are increasingly having to make their way in the world for a couple of years on their own resources, since fewer and fewer employers will consider them until they have already had work experience. 'That means a drop, not just in the number joining pensions schemes in their early 20s, but in the number with the steady income expectations needed for a mortgage,' said Mr Daniels. 'So there might soon be a trend away from home-ownership in favour of rented accommodation, and what effects might that have on the housing market?' The Jobs column groaned inwardly . . . thinking of the house that it will soon need to sell on moving out of London.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           UNITED KINGDOM ADVERTISED DEMAND FOR MANAGERS AND KEY                 SPECIALIST STAFF (Year to December 31)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1993            1992              1991                      Posts   Change   Posts   Change   Posts     Change Type                 adver-   from    adver-   from    adver-     from of                   tised    1992    tised    1991    tised      1990 work                         percent          percent            percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Research &amp; dvlpmnt   1,304    +2.5    1,272    -26.6    1,733    -46.5 Sales &amp; marketing    3,574   +44.2    2,478    +12.9    2,194    -23.2 Production           1,962   -11.4    2,215    -16.2    2,642    -47.9 Accounting           2,855    +9.7    2,602    -19.6    3,238    -40.6 Computing            1,446   +39.7    1,035     +1.7    1,018    -54.1 General management     950   +10.9      857    -12.2      976    -25.0 Personnel              363    -6.2      387     -4.7      406    -48.9 Others               3,855    +8.6    3,550     -7.0    3,817    -41.8 Total               16,309   +13.3   14,396    -10.2   16,024    -41.7 Jan-March            3,955    -2.5    4,058    -11.2    4,572    -45.6 April-June           4,007    -0.4    4,023     -5.0    4,235    -44.6 July-Sept            4,623   +36.8    3,379     -6.9    3,630    -40.8 Oct-Dec              3,724   +26.8    2,936    -18.1    3,587    -32.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1990              1989                             Posts   Change    Posts    Change Type                        adver-   from     adver-    from of                          tised    1989     tised     1988 work                                percent            percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Research &amp; dvlpmnt          3,242   -22.1     4,160     +3.9 Sales &amp; marketing           2,858   -27.4     3,934    -31.1 Production                  5,068   -16.0     6,032    -20.5 Accounting                  5,448   -19.1     6,731    -12.8 Computing                   2,216   -37.1     3,521    -28.8 General management          1,302    -3.7     1,352    -16.7 Personnel                     794   -29.3     1,123     +2.4 Others                      6,559   -15.1     7,723     +2.7 Total                      27,487   -20.5    34,576    -14.0 Jan-March                   8,397   -23.1    10,915     -2.7 April-June                  7,641   -16.7     9,176    -13.4 July-Sept                   6,131    22.0     7,858    -15.8 Oct-Dec                     5,318   -19.8     6,627    -26.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Redwood to hit at 'unnecessary' green regulations A rightwing cabinet minister will today launch an assault on unnecessary environmental regulations. In a fresh indication of how economic hardship has pushed 'green' issues down the political agenda, Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, will announce a review to assess whether all protected areas in the principality need to be so protected. In his address to Tory activists in Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, Mr Redwood will also touch on subsidiarity by arguing that planning decisions should be left wherever possible to local councillors. It should be up to councillors to decide whether to give priority to jobs or wildlife, he will say. 'We are not in the business of frustrating people who want new jobs and new homes.' In remarks which will do little to further the efforts of Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to build a 'green' image for the government, Mr Redwood will argue that environmentalism in Wales has tended to develop in a 'random' way. He will say the Welsh Office's efforts to encourage prosperity are often blocked by environmental regulations from London or Brussels. In his efforts to restore a higher-profile government approach to environmental issues, Mr Gummer recently attacked the encroachment of 'urban sprawl' on the countryside and the construction of shopping malls outside towns. Last month he called for tighter protection for green belts - areas where development is curbed in order to prevent growing towns from joining together. Last November a report from the Government Statistical Service cast doubt on the success of the government initiative to regenerate the south Wales valleys, saying manufacturing jobs created had been more than offset by job losses. This prompted Mr Redwood to make a strong defence of the initiative, saying it was important to persuade new investors that 'this was a beautiful part of Wales with a future, and not just a scarred piece of Wales with a past that had gone wrong'.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Japan's industrial production drops INDUSTRIAL production in Japan fell by 5.3 per cent in March compared with a year ago as the recession in Japan's manufacturing sector continued to tighten its grip, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday. On a seasonally adjusted basis, industrial output fell 2.8 per cent in March compared with February. This was the fourth consecutive month of declining output and sharpest decline since last June. The size of the decline will make it extremely unlikely that the government will have been able to reach its target for economic growth of 3.7 per cent in the 1991 fiscal year, and increases the likelihood that the Japanese economy is technically in recession. Inventories fell by a seasonally-adjusted 1.1 per cent compared with February in a further sign that companies are taking action to reduce a large overhang of unsold goods. However, the process has some way to go as inventory levels remained 7 per cent higher than a year ago. Indeed, the decline in inventories appeared almost entirely attributable to reduced production as industrial shipments fell by 2.7 per cent month-on-month, while the ratio of inventories to sales rose by 1.2 per cent. Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency reported that the index of leading indicators stood at 30 in February. This is the 18th consecutive month in which the indicators fell below 50, which indicates a slowing economy. One bright spot in the indicators was a revival of housing investment.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SCHULLER TO PRODUCE SOVIET TV PROGRAMS  </P> <P> A representative from the Soviet Union Wednesday finalized a deal with the  Crystal Cathedral's Robert Schuller to produce inspirational prime-time  television messages for Soviet citizens.  </P> <P> The formal contract establishes a new nonprofit joint entity called Spirit to  Spirit and Heart to Heart, a church spokesman said.  </P> <P> Its objectives are to produce one 30-minute television program once a month  during the next 12 months and to publish and distribute Schuller's book "The Be  Happy Attitudes" in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The contract solidifies plans made earlier this year when Schuller appeared on  Soviet television, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The contract specifies that Schuller's messages are to be designed to "generate  hope and dignity, moral support, universal values and truth and build on family  and religious traditions."  </P> <P> It also directs Schuller to provide "proof of God's provenance" and "build an  edifice for the Church in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Schuller is to speak for 20 minutes. Ten minutes are reserved for classical  music "hopefully by Russian composers."  </P> <P> The programs, taped here in English, will be aired with subtitles on prime time  on the Soviet Channel 1 and possibly other channels.  </P> <P> The Soviet branch of the new association will publish and distribute Schuller's  book, which has already been translated into Russian.  </P> <P> The contract was signed by Svyatoslav Rybas, director of Gosteleradio's  department of literature and arts, who had accompanied a film crew that spent a  week filming a documentary on Schuller at Crystal Cathedral.  </P> <P> The documentary will be used to introduce the regular inspirational television  programs, a church spokesman said.  </P> <P> The film crew is due to leave today for Washington, where it will interview  "prominent Americans" before returning home Oct. 11.LYNN SMITH  </P></p>

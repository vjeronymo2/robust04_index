			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Labour to probe Christmas expulsions Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, is to question Home Office ministers early in the new year about 28 Jamaicans refused entry to Britain on Christmas day. The Labour party said yesterday Mr Blair was concerned about the Home Office's reasons for deporting 28 people who had arrived in Britain on December 21 and were deported from London's Gatwick airport on Christmas day. The party said Labour MPs were particularly concerned about how the Jamaicans were treated in Home Office custody, and the reasons why immigration officials picked out the charter plane on which they had travelled. In Jamaica, the deportation was the subject of official concern, amid indications that the authorities may file a protest to the British government. Some deportees informed the island's foreign ministry officials of their experience, and Mr Paul Robertson, the foreign minister, met Mr Derek Milton, the British high commissioner, to discuss the matter. Jamaican foreign ministry officials said the government would consider carefully the reports of those refused entry, and 'take whatever diplomatic and political steps' it thought appropriate. Some of those refused entry yesterday accused British immigration authorities of 'naked racism'. 'They say that this is normal procedure for people coming into Britain,' said one. 'When was the last time they did that to a plane load of visitors from Australia or New Zealand?'</p>

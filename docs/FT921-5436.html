			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Treasury market sell-off affects Eurodollar paper PLACEMENT of more than Dollars 1.5bn of fresh paper in the Eurodollar bond market yesterday was hampered by a sharp sell-off in the US Treasury market for the second day running. Further signs that the US economy is starting to recover prompted concern that interest rates are unlikely to fall further. While the US Treasury market was the hardest hit, with traders reporting large liquidations of positions even before the opening of New York trading, the Eurodollar bond market was also affected by changing sentiment. Swap spreads collapsed as counterparties willing to pay the fixed-rate side of the transaction evaporated. With substantial portions of unsold paper launched at the start of the year still on underwriters books, retail-targetted deals, which generally take several weeks to filter down distribution networks, suffered most. The African Development Bank, which made its debut offering in the dollar sector yesterday, proved virtually immune to the wave of negative sentiment. The deal, arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation, met strong investor demand, due to its triple-A rating and its rarity value, as well as an extensive run of pre-marketing. The deal was priced at a yield spread of 38 basis points above the 10-year Treasury yield, reflecting the marked difference in perception of the African Development Bank's credit, compared with other triple-A rated international agencies like the World Bank. The African Development Bank, which plans to raise around Dollars 1bn this year in the financial markets, hopes to reduce this pricing differential over a period of time. The proceeds of the deal were unswapped, as the bank was keen to lock in low dollar interest rates. Two US companies, Du Pont and Phillip Morris, which are well regarded by Swiss investors, launched aggressively priced offerings totalling Dollars 250m each via Credit Suisse First Boston. In a difficult market, these retail-targetted deals attracted few takers. Du Pont's 10-year deal was priced to yield 45 basis points above the 10-year Treasury, while Phillip Morris' five-year paper was launched at a spread of 60 basis points above the curve. Both traded outside fees, and, despite the declining Treasury market, the yield spreads widened by three and five basis points respectively. A Dollars 300m five-year deal for IMI Bank International, the Italian financial institution, and a Dollars 350m four-year deal for Chubu Electric Power, the Japanese power company, were both considered fairly priced but also suffered from the fall-out.</p>

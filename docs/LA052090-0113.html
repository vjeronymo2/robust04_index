			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED RINGLEADER ACQUITTED IN RACIAL MURDER  </P> <P> The accused ringleader of a white mob that killed a black teen-ager and  inflamed already heated racial tensions in the nation's largest city was  acquitted Friday of murder.  </P> <P> Keith Mondello, 19, was cleared of all murder and manslaughter counts but  convicted of lesser charges in the fatal shooting Aug. 23 of Yusuf Hawkins, 16,  whose death became New York City's most explosive racial case in years.  </P> <P> The verdict came a day after a separate jury convicted the triggerman, Joseph  Fama, of murder in the killing last summer in the predominantly white Brooklyn  neighborhood of Bensonhurst.  </P> <P> Mondello, who stood with tears streaming down his face, was found guilty of  riot, weapons possession and a series of lesser charges.  </P> <P> The courtroom erupted into pandemonium as the verdict was announced in state  Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The Mondello family embraced in tears as the Hawkins  family shouted at them. One said, "You'll get yours."  </P> <P> A second jury Thursday convicted Mondello's co-defendant, Fama, 19, of  second-degree murder for showing "depraved indifference to human life" for  being part of the attack in which Hawkins was shot twice and died on the  street. Fama had been accused of being the gunman but was acquitted of  intentional murder.  </P> <P> Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, said, "I think Mr. Mondello was happy with  the verdict. But when a young man's dead and another young man's in jail for  murder, I don't think there's any winners."  </P> <P> Mondello faces one to four years in jail. His bail was revoked after the  verdict and he was to be sent directly to jail.  </P> <P> Outside, two groups of demonstrators numbering about 150 marched to the back of  the courthouse, overturned and ripped up four blue police barricades, and  scattered parts of them onto the courthouse steps and onto cars. Angry  demonstrators shouted, "We're going to burn Bensonhurst, to burn it down. Burn,  baby, burn!" With raised fists they shouted, "Yusuf, Yusuf, no peace, no  justice!" They threatened a boycott of white businesses in the city.  </P> <P> A free-lance photographer was injured in the melee.  </P> <P> As jury forewoman Mimi Snowden announced the first "not guilty," Mondello's  father, Michael, screamed out, "Oh, thank God" and began to sob hysterically.  </P> <P> "It's God! It's Jesus! Jesus has risen!," the elder Mondello exclaimed.  </P> <P> On the other side of the aisle, relatives and supporters of the Hawkins family  screamed, pointed at the jurors and shouted threats.  </P> <P> "He did it, he did it!" several of them screamed as the verdicts were read by  Snowden.  </P> <P> Two people were ejected from the courtroom for their outbursts.  </P> <P> Mondello and Fama were the first of eight young men to be tried in the slaying  that triggered months of bitter racial demonstrations, marches and vigils --  all in the midst of last year's mayoral race.  </P> <P> The killing fueled accusations of bigotry, and the trial, which coincided with  several other racially divisive incidents, heightened tension to the point that  Mayor David Dinkins went on television to appeal for calm.  </P> <P> In his closing argument, Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul Burns said Mondello  organized the white mob that stalked the black youths, encircled Hawkins and  left him dying on the street after he was shot.  </P> <P> "Does one of these guys stick around to help Yusuf Hawkins?" Burns asked. "No.  They all run. Like a mob they came, like a mob they left. Group courage masking  individual cowardice."  </P> <P> Mondello, his hands crossed on the defense table, looked skyward and began  crying as the verdict was read. After the announcement on the final count, he  hugged his lawyer.  </P> <P> Mondello was found guilty of riot, three counts of unlawful imprisonment, three  counts of menacing, four counts of discrimination, and one count of weapons  possession.  </P> <P> In the hours before last August's attack, about 30 young white men, many armed  with baseball bats, had gathered near the home of Gina Feliciano, Mondello's  former girlfriend.  </P> <P> According to testimony during the trial, Mondello and Feliciano argued after  she told him she was dating black and Hispanic youths and said she had invited  a group of them to her 18th birthday party.  </P> <P> According to the defense, the dispute between Mondello and Feliciano escalated  after she told him some of her new friends were coming into the neighborhood to  beat him up, and he recruited his friends and armed them with the bats.  </P> <P> As the gang of youths milled about the street, Hawkins and three black friends  came into the neighborhood to look at a used car. The mob mistook them for the  rumored group of Feliciano's friends and attacked.  </P> <P> In the melee, four shots rang out, and Hawkins fell mortally wounded on the  sidewalk.  </P> <P> During the trial, the most damaging evidence against Mondello was a statement  he gave to police shortly after the killing. In it, he described recruiting his  neighborhood friends for the attack.  </P> <P> Feliciano testified that Mondello bragged about getting ready to attack any  blacks who came to her birthday party.  </P> <P> A neighborhood woman testified that she saw the mob run by seconds before the  attack on Hawkins, with Mondello in the lead.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Reaction to Hebron Mosque Massacre    2. Signs of Islamic Victory in Algeria    3. Call for Trial of Minister Yusuf Wali    4. Commentary on Kuwait and Iraq    5. Article by Bosnian President Izetbegovic    6. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's Column  <H5>  REACTION TO HEBRON MOSQUE MASSACRE </H5>   In its 1 March issue, the newspaper AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of  the opposition Labor Party, carries extensive reports, comments,  and articles on the 25 February massacre at the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron. On pages 1 and 7, it features a 480-word  statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood denouncing this "ugly  criminal, an incident that shows the perfidious and corrupt  nature inherent in the treacherous enemy." The statement calls  for placing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem under  international supervision and for sending international forces  to protect the unarmed civilians.    On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper publishes an 850-word  statement issued by the Labor Party condemning the massacre and  describing it as "one of the ugliest criminal acts ever  committed."    On page 7, the newspaper publishes a joint statement issued  by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Labor Party, the Wafd Party, the  Liberal Party, the al-Azhar 'Ulema Front, and some public  figures, trade unionists, and writers denouncing the incident.    On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper carries an 800-word report  by  Mahmud Bakri, who castigates the Egyptian Government for not  being outspoken in condemning the attack. He says: "While the  ugly massacre has exposed the indifference of the international  community, especially the U.S., which colludes with and supports  Israel, Egypt has contented itself with condemning the  massacre." This Egyptian stance has provoked "broad popular  anger," more so because the "Egyptian Government has not  declared a state of mourning for the souls of the martyrs and  has taken no measures to confront the aggressors." Blaming  Israel for the blast at a Maronite Church on 27 February, Bakri  says: "The Zionists have decided to escalate their war against  Muslims and Christians by sowing sedition between them to  deflect attention from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre."    On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B also carries a 1,000-word report  on the various demonstrations that have erupted at Egyptian  universities to protest the "ugly massacre" against the  Palestinians in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The reports  adds that "violent clashes" occurred between the Cairo  University students and the police, who used tear gas to  disperse the demonstrators marching toward the Israeli Embassy.    On page 2, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by  Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he describes the massacre as  "unprecedented" and the "fruit of the wicked policy" of the Arab  and Muslim rulers, a policy that has led Muslims to be  "slaughtered like lambs." He criticizes the Arab governments,  especially the Egyptian Government, for saying that peace will  be pursued despite the massacre. He goes on to say: "Israel's  friends in Egypt and the Arab world are accomplices in this  massacre, because they have taught Israel to do to us what it  wants." He adds that the Egyptian Government, which has  portrayed the "crippled" Gaza-Jericho agreement as a victory and  a solution of the Palestinian issue, is now completely exposed,  naked, without a "fig leaf" to cover itself. The writer calls  for the "popular trial" of Yusuf Wali, secretary general of the  ruling National Democratic Party, for his "subversive role in  supporting Israel at the expense of his country's interests."  He adds that force should be met with greater force, saying:  "There must be revenge. We must inflict wounds on the  Israelis. We must strike them on the head. We must strike them  everywhere. This is God's law."    On page 2, the newspaper carries a 700-word article by Dr.  Mahjub 'Umar in which he says that Israel's current leaders,  including Rabin and Peres, were directly behind the massacre to  achieve external and internal political objectives.    On page 3, the newspaper carries a 2,000-word investigative  report by Mahmud Bakri in which he interviews several figures on  their reaction to the massacre. Among those interviewed are Dr.  Ahmad Sidqi al-Dajani, a Palestinian opposed to the Gaza-Jericho  accord; Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab; Hafiz  Isma'il, former adviser for Egyptian national security;  'Ali-al-Din Salih, leader of the Misr al-Fatah Party; and  AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Salah-al-Din Hafiz. They all denounce the  massacre.    On page 5, the newspaper carries a 1,000-word article by  Mustafa Mashhur, deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. He  asks: "Who can guarantee that this massacre will not be  repeated" and "How can peace be achieved in this charged  atmosphere." He also asks what is the use of Rabin's  expressions of regret over the incident and Clinton's remarks  that it should not obstruct the peace process. Mahjub  sarcastically congratulates 'Arafat on the condolences he has  received from some heads of state and for the Israeli  Government's readiness to compensate the relatives of the  victims. He adds that the Palestinian people will not forget  this incident and will take their revenge on the "Zionist enemy."   <H5>    SIGNS OF ISLAMIC VICTORY IN ALGERIA </H5>   An unattributed 300-word report on page 1 describes the  Algerian authorities' recent release of several Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] leaders as a "victory for the Islamist  current in Algeria." The newspaper links this release with  reports on "an impending Cabinet reshuffle in Algeria in which  Islamist elements might join the government." This will be  considered a victory for the FIS and an admission by the  Algerian authorities of the broad popular support for FIS  leaders.  <H5>  CALL FOR TRIAL OF MINISTER YUSUF WALI </H5>   AL-SHA'B continues its long campaign against Dr. Yusuf Wali,  deputy prime minister and agriculture minister and secretary  general of the ruling National Democratic Party, for his alleged  pro-Israeli views and stands. On page 5, it carries a  3,000-word article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of  the Labor Party, in which he urges a "popular trial" for Wali,  who "deliberately" delivered an "official" statement before the  People's Assembly praising Israel's scientific and technological  superiority. He calls on the Egyptian people to act to remove  this "shame." He maintains that Wali could be politically  tried "according to Article No. 159 of the Constitution, which  gives the People's Assembly the right to refer a minister to  trial" for the crimes he commits while performing his duties.  He further maintains that this popular move does not absolve  the president from using his powers to question the minister  about his actions and behavior; otherwise, the people will be  excused for believing that the president approves of Wali's  statement before the People's Assembly on 5 February.  <H5>  COMMENTARY ON KUWAIT AND IRAQ </H5>   On page 8, the newspaper publishes a 1,000-word article by  Mahmud Shukri entitled "Kuwait Celebrates the U.S. Victory and  the Victim is the Iraqi People." He says: "Tomorrow, drums  will be beaten in Kuwait on the anniversary of the  Anglo-U.S.-Israeli victory in the Gulf." He adds: "Those who  celebrate the 3d anniversary of the Arab massacre in Iraq, what  do they celebrate?" "Do they celebrate because they have  enabled the imperialist forces in the United States, France, and  England to destroy a Muslim Arab country." "Do they celebrate  because they have turned Kuwait into a Western military base?"  <H5>  ARTICLE BY BOSNIAN PRESIDENT IZETBEGOVIC </H5>   On page 9, AL-SHA'B publishes an 800-word article by Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic entitled "Islam Between East and  West." He maintains that Western civilization can't face the  invasion of licentiousness that is destroying it. He cites the  high crime and suicide rates in the United States and Europe and  attributes them to licentiousness and alcohol abuse.  <H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI'S COLUMN </H5>   On page 12, the newspaper carries a regular column by  Islamic  preacher Muhammad al-Ghazali entitled "This is our Religion."  In his 500-word column, al-Ghazali says the United States is a  superpower and a very civilized country. But there are  disturbing health, social, and mental conditions in the United  States, he says, citing the U.S. health secretary on the number  of crimes and diseases. He says the United States, "which  excels scientifically and industrially, is backward religiously  and morally." He contends that instead of reforming its  internal conditions, the United States is busy fighting Islam.</p>

In  1974, he was appointed Deputy Lead Designer and, in 1981, Lead  Designer -- Executive of "Vympel" GosMKB. G.A. Sokolovskiy is a  corresponding member of the Russian and International  Engineering Academies, a doctor of technical sciences, has been  decorated with orders and was awarded the rank of USSR Council  of Ministers Prize Laureate.    Valeriy Yakovlevich Kozhinov graduated from Kazan  Aviation Institute in 1963. He has been working at "Vympel"  GosMKB since 1975 and has been a department chief since 1983. He  is a candidate of technical sciences.    "Vympel" GosMKB is one of Russia's leading enterprises that  develops aircraft weapons and guided missiles for air defense  missile complexes. It has highly-skilled cadres and good  technical tools for drafting, designing, and manufacturing test  models and small series, and ground and flight tests of the most  modern weapons models. The GosMKB's main product is air-to-air,  air-to-surface and surface-to-air guided missiles, aircraft  launchers for guided missiles and unguided rockets, various  electromechanical, electrohydraulic, and pyrotechnic onboard  devices for aircraft and helicopters and electronic warfare (EW)  systems. "Vympel" GosMKB has its own KB [Design Bureau] and test  plant. The KB consists of several departments: future  developments, design critical analysis, and ground optimization.  The test plant manufactures models for tests and small series  for sale.    The firm's products have long enjoyed a good reputation in  many of the world's countries. For example, the French magazine  PARIS MATCH wrote the following about the "Kub" Air Defense  Missile Complex's 3M9 missile (NATO designation SA-6 Gainful) in  October 1973 during the intensification of the Arab-Israeli  Conflict: "Sometime the Syrians will erect a monument in honor  of the inventor of these modern missiles. He is deserving of  that. Surface-to-air missiles not only played a decisive role in  the defense of Syria from air raids but also had an enormous  psychological impact on the population. Residents of Damascus  and its suburbs were witnesses to the missile shootdowns of a  dozen Phantoms, Sky Hawks and Mirages, the aircraft crashed to  the ground and the pilots were forced to eject."    Today there is practically not a single CIS-produced  aircraft  or helicopter that would not have "Vympel" GosMKB items on  board. The firm's products were supplied to various countries  for many years but no one knew who had developed them. The time  has come to talk about that.    "Vympel" GosMKB was formed in 1949 as a developer of  aircraft  machinegun-cannon and bomb weapons. This direction of work has  been preserved until the present day. Designs of guided missiles  became a priority in the 1950's. Ivan Ivanovich Toropov was  assigned as the first Lead Designer at the GosMKB. The Tu-4  aircraft's bomb and cannon systems were developed in 1955 under  his leadership.    At the same time, the GosMKB conducted the development of  radar seekers for air-to-air missiles, K-7 air combat missiles  with semiactive radar guidance, air defense missiles with solid  fuel engines and R-13 missiles.    The R-13 (AA-2 Atoll) -- this is a short range missile  (approximately 7.6 km) with infrared guidance that was developed  as an equivalent for the well-known American Loral Aeronutronics  AIM-9B Sidewinder missile. It is in the inventory of MiG-21  aircraft of many of the world's countries. The R-13 is the first  air-to-air guided missile that was accepted into the fighter  aircraft inventory of the USSR and the people's democratic  countries in 1962.    In 1959, "Vympel" GosMKB began developing the "Kub" Air  Defense Missile Complex's 3M9 missile. Its development was  completed under the leadership of new Lead Designer Andrey  Leonidovich Lyapin who headed "Vympel" MKB in 1961.    The 3M9 is the first Soviet air defense missile with  semiactive radar guidance and a combined rocket-ramjet solid  fuel sustainer engine which permitted providing it with  relatively long range with the missile's comparatively small  dimensions and weight. The missile has a flight range of 24-28  km and supports the interception of airborne targets at low (to  30 m) and medium altitudes. The missile weighs 600 kg. The  rocket-ramjet solid fuel sustainer engine employed on it was  developed by the GosMKB for the first time in the world. The  missile has been repeatedly modernized, as a result of which  jam-proofing of the guidance system was increased, its  power-to-weight ratio and accuracy were improved, and design and  operating specifications were increased. The missile, as part of  the "Kub" Air Defense Missile Complex, is in the inventory of a  number of countries until the present time. The 3M9 missile is  installed on a self-propelled mount.    Later, "Vympel" GosMKB concentrated its efforts on the  development of second, third and fourth generation guided  missiles (primarily air-to-air missiles), launchers, and also  bomb racks, turret machinegun-cannon systems and chaff cartridge  and infrared decoy dispensers. Lead Designer G.A. Sokolovskiy  has headed this work since 1981.    The idea of modular utilization of interchangeable infrared  and radar seekers on the missile's basic design that has been  set forth in the R-13 missile has become one of the fundamental  ideas in the GosMKB's work. This idea was utilized during the  design of other elements of the missile which permitted us to  substantially expand the capabilities of the aircraft weapon  platforms of the R-23 (24) (AA-7 Apex), R-40 (AA-6 Acrid) and  R-27 (AA-10 Alamo) missiles during attacks against targets at  various speeds, ranges, altitudes and under conditions of  natural and man-made interference. At the same time, many other  engineering tasks were carried out, the urgency of which has  been preserved until the present day. For example, the R-40  missile, designed to destroy high-speed, high-altitude targets  and in the inventory of Su-15, MiG-25 and MiG-31 aircraft, with  relatively high weight (470 kg) and medium range (up to 70 km)  as before remains the highest altitude air-to-air missile. It  permits the destruction of targets at altitudes of up to 32 km.  The issues of the employment of passive and active thermal  protection have also been worked out on it (the latter is  ensured using freon that is supplied from a tank that is located  in the launcher), jam-proofing of a combined radar-optical fuze  and the technology of the utilization of titanium alloys in the  design (including the body of the missile engine).    The R-60 (AA-8 Aphid) missile with infrared guidance is the  organic weapon of the Su-15, Su-17, Su-24, Su-25, MiG-21,  MiG-23, MiG-25, MiG-29, MiG-31, and Yak-38 aircraft. This highly  maneuverable air combat missile weighs 44 kg and permits the  destruction of targets at ranges from 200 m to 15 km. During the  design of the R-60, the firm's engineers resolved the task of  ensuring the destruction of targets maneuvering at maximum  G-loads at very short distances. This was a unique technical  breakthrough in world practice in the sphere of close combat  air-to-air missiles. Based upon the assessments of foreign  experts, the lead totaled approximately 10 years.    Later the GosMKB developed the following air-to-air missiles  in this direction: the R-73, R-27, RVV-AE, and the R-33 with  which the Russian Air Force is equipped today.    The R-73 (AA-11 Archer) -- the light (it weighs  approximately  105 kg) close air combat (up to 30 km) missile utilizes combined  aerodynamic command and control. It is designed to destroy  aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles under conditions of  heavy jamming. Protection of the infrared seeker from jamming is  ensured through the selection of a photo receiver range and  utilization of time-pulse modulation and the employment of a  digital signal processing unit with independent channels. The  missile has a reverse launch mode to protect the aircraft weapon  platform from the rear hemisphere. According to the opinions of  Western experts that were published in JANES DEFENCE WEEKLY  magazine in June-September 1989, the R-73 missile "has  outstripped" the ASRAAM missile "by 10 years". Superiority in  maximum launch range is nearly a factor of two.    The R-27 -- is a multirole medium- and long-range (72...130  km) missile that was developed in a modular design. It has two  engine variants (normal and enhanced power-to-weight ratio) and  two seeker variants (infrared and semiactive radar). The weight  in the heaviest variant totals approximately 350 kg. A  combination of modules permits obtaining four types of missiles  with various technical specifications. The missile has combined  guidance: command-inertial in the initial phase of the  trajectory and homing in the terminal phase.    The R-27 missile is designed to destroy aircraft,  helicopters, cruise missiles and antiship missiles.    The RVV-AE (AMRAAM-ski) is a medium range (90 km) missile  that was developed to intercept various types of targets,  including aircraft, helicopters, air-to-air missiles (such as  the Hughes Aircraft AMRAAM and Phoenix missiles) and  surface-to-air (such as Patriot air defense complex missiles)  and also cruise missiles in complex meteorological conditions  and under conditions of heavy electronic jamming in the  background of the earth or water surface. The missile weighs  approximately 175 kg. It has a combined guidance system:  command-inertial in the inertial phase of the trajectory and  active radar in the terminal phase. High jam-proofing is ensured  through spatial-time signal processing, Kalimanovskiy filtering,  continuous resolution of kinematic equations and the  availability of the inertial phase of the trajectory. The  missile has two modifications: M and M2. The second variant has  a greater target interception range, enhanced seeker  jam-proofing, and a greater target destruction probability at  super-low altitudes (up to three meters) due to the utilization  of a radio altimeter. The RVV-AE missile is being installed on  tactical and strategic aviation aircraft. In accordance with the  conclusions of experts that were presented in articles in the  August-October 1992 issues of FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL magazine, the  RVV-AE, while beating the AMRAAM missile in weight-dimensions  specifications, has an entire series of advantages, including  greater launch range (by approximately 20%) and a higher  maneuvering target and low-altitude target interception  probability.    Employment of latticed control surfaces controlled by an  electric drive on the RVV-AE is an original technical solution  that has been utilized on an air-to-air missile for the first  time. Holding back the adjacent flow using a large number of  planes, these control surfaces retain their effectiveness up to  large angles of attack at limits of 40. The lattice's  separate lifting surfaces provide a total lift force that is  several times higher than a monoplane control surface  (approximately a factor of three for the missile's maximum speed  that equals Mach 4). The dependence of the lift force  coefficient on the angle of attack remains constant in all  flight speed and altitude ranges. Furthermore, the latticed  control surfaces, having significantly less chord, permit the  use of a less powerful drive. "Vympel" Design Bureau, jointly  with the Ukrainian Institute of Electric Welding imeni Ye.O.  Paton, has developed a unique technology for manufacturing these  latticed control surfaces.    The R-33 (AA-9 Amos) -- is a long-range missile (120 km)  that  is designed to intercept aircraft and cruise missiles. It weighs  approximately 490 kg. It has a combined guidance system:  command-inertial in the initial phase and semiactive radar in  the terminal phase. A catapult launch technique from a  semi-recessed position under the MiG-31 aircraft fuselage was  employed for this missile for the first time in world practice.  That positioning of the missile permitted a substantial  reduction of the frontal resistance of an aircraft weapon  platform with a combat load.    Along with air-to-air and surface-to-air missile  developments, "Vympel" GosMKB has the experience of developing  air-to-surface missiles. Today Su-17, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27,  MiG-23, MiG-27, and Mirage F1 aircraft are equipped with Kh-29  (AS-14 Kedge) missiles that were developed at our KB.    The Kh-29 missile is designed to destroy hard to hit  ground-based (large bridges, powerful concrete shelters, and  airfield runways) and naval surface (surface combatants and  submarines in the surfaced position) targets. It weighs 660-680  kg. The missile was developed in two variants: with television  and laser guidance systems. The television seeker ensures target  lock-on prior to launch at ranges of 10-12 km. After the  appearance of the image of this target on the cockpit display,  the pilot conducts the launch and autonomous guidance is carried  out from then on. The semiactive laser seeker carries out target  lock-on at ranges of 8-10 km and requires target illumination  either from a ground set or from the aircraft weapon platform  which must be equipped with "Klen", "Kayra", "Smerch" or ATLIS  type systems. Work that is being conducted at the present time  to increase the jam-proofing of the Kh-29 missile's seeker will  permit an increase of its operating range to 25-30 km, having  preserved a circular deviation of approximately 1-2 m from the  center of the target being destroyed.    Two types of launchers have been developed at the firm for  practically all of the listed missiles: using rail launchers  from which missile separation is ensured using the missile  engine's energy and using catapult launchers, which support  missile separation from the aircraft with push rods that utilize  the energy of pyrotechnics or hydraulic systems.    In contrast to a number of foreign firms such as, for  example, Frazier Nash (Great Britain) or ACMA (International  Consortium) which have recently been developing rail launchers  utilizing easily removable modules, "Vympel" GosMKB is following  its own path. At the firm, we think that with all of the  positive qualities of a launcher with easily removable modules,  they have an entire series of shortcomings. They are more  complex in design and require more highly skilled maintenance  personnel in operation and additional buildings for work with  and storage of the modules. The reliability of the launchers is  reduced and the amount of equipment for the aircraft weapon  platform is increased.    As a rule, "Vympel" GosMKB conducts the development of rail  launchers for definite weapon platforms which permits the  production of the assembly of the launchers under conditions of  the plant-manufacturer and simplifies operation. In the process,  the tasks of optimizing the launchers for weight, aerodynamic  resistance, and the manufacturability of the design are  resolved. The kinematic diagrams of fasteners and other  mechanisms are original and have been simplified to the maximum  extent possible which increases the launchers' reliability.  Their standardization is being conducted along the following  directions: for various weight groups of missiles, for one  weight group of missiles for various types of aircraft, for  various weight groups of missiles for one type of aircraft, and  also according to the connection points (for example, the APU-13  is easily mounted on hardpoints or on bomb racks). In a number  of cases, the firm is resorting to the installation of up to  three types of lugs on the missiles to mount them on various  types of launchers.    Similar approaches are also being employed during the  development of catapult launchers. The original design solutions  of catapult mechanisms and synchronization of movements of the  forward and aft push rods permit providing the required speed of  separation while observing safety for the aircraft weapon  platform. For example, the catapult launcher for the RVV-AE  missile, having a similar fundamental operating scheme with the  Frazier Nash launcher for the Sky Flash missile (British  Aerospace) and the AMRAAM, is distinguished from it by its  simpler and more reliable catapult mechanisms and  synchronization of the operation of the push rods through the  utilization of special hydraulic compensators-batteries. This  significantly simplifies the launcher itself. The issues of the  placement of the self-contained power source, the designs of the  catches that reduce aerodynamic G-loads on the missile, and the  readjusted hardpoints were also resolved in an original manner  on it.    "Vympel" GosMKB has also developed launchers for 50-122 mm  unguided aircraft rockets with 5-20 barrels. They are also  disposable or reusable and are equipped with one or multichannel  launch systems.    Launchers for small caliber guided missiles have tubular  launch rails, for example, the APU-8 and the PU-O-25L, and  support launches of air-to-surface missiles with semiactive  laser and radar seekers.    All CIS-manufactured frontal aviation, antisubmarine  warfare,  and long range aviation aircraft are equipped with "Vympel"  GosMKB bomb holders. The holders support suspension of  conventional and guided bombs, canisters with machinegun-cannon  weapons, guided missile and unguided rocket launchers,  torpedoes, rescue equipment, canisters with submarine detection  equipment and other cargoes weighing from five to 25 kg. They  are designed both for external and internal employment. Based  upon critical analyses, the holders have a different number of  fasteners and are distinguished by a high degree of  standardization. It is attained through the employment of a  large number of standard circuits from which, like from separate  units, the design is assembled. The firm's latest achievement is  a bomb holder that is loaded independently prior to its  installation on the aircraft.    In the sphere of EW systems, "Vympel" GosMKB has developed  and introduced into operation several generations of passive  jamming and decoy dispensers for all classes of CIS aircraft and  helicopters. Since the beginning of the 1980's, they have been  developed on modern microcircuitry and according to the modular  principle.    At the present time, there is a broad selection of  internally  and externally mounted functional-design units with manual,  semiautomatic and automatic control for dispensing 26-, 50-, and  140-mm infrared decoy and chaff cartridges. The dispensers'  software permits creation of a cloud or a trail of jamming that  varies by assigned or random laws with the following parameters  in accordance with the flight modes and the directions of  attack: the number of cartridges in a salvo, the number of  salvos in a series, and the number of series and the intervals  between them.    At the present time, the firm is developing a special air  target based upon the 3M9 missile that is equipped with jamming  dispenser systems for fire rehearsal of ground-based and  shipborne air defense missile-gun complexes.    Each design that comes out of the design bureau today, as a  rule, contains dozens of inventions. More than 800 of the firm's  original technical solutions are protected by patent documents.  Among them: common layouts of items; various systems; the design  of individual compartments, assemblies, mechanisms and  connections; stands for modeling and ground work, and also  technological devices and accessories.    For many years, "Vympel" GosMKB was among those enterprises  that was financed from the state budget. Since 1987, the  situation has changed. The enterprise is gradually transitioning  to contract relations. A number of developments were initially  financed from the state budget and, later, through contracts.    At the present time, the firm is experiencing financial  difficulties caused by the overall state of Russia's economy,  the disruption of ties with contractors and series-production  enterprises, the absence of a new military doctrine and the  totally illogical conversion program of industry's defense  sectors. During the last two years, the firm's strength has been  reduced by 25%, however, its creative potential has been  preserved. Additional difficulties are also arising as a result  of the fact that the Air Force is not utilizing an integrated  approach to ordering aircraft, helicopters and their weapons but  is ordering them from separate chief and lead designers.    The new economic situation is compelling the firm to  increase  the rates of scientific-research and experimental-design work:  to develop new models of equipment, modify already existing  models to impart greater flexibility and effectiveness of  employment to them and to expand the spectrum of weapon  platforms, including foreign weapon platforms. At the present  time, "Vympel" GosMKB's engineers, jointly with foreign experts,  are conducting work to determine the possibility of mating the  firm's missiles with foreign aircraft. Negotiations are being  conducted to equip aircraft from Brazil, the United Arab  Emirates and China with "Vympel" GosMKB missiles and also for  the firm's participation in the modernization of MiG-21 aircraft  that are in the United Arab Emirates, India, China, and Syria.  "Vympel" GosMKB has developed a method and has conducted  research that demonstrates the possibility to utilize bomb  holders that have been developed at the enterprise to suspend  foreign aircraft bombs on combat aircraft manufactured in the  CIS.    A series of additional measures is being conducted for the  standardized employment of items on the whole, their elements  and individual systems. Special attention is being paid to  standardizing different types of air-to-air and surface-to-air  guided missiles. In the process, three well-known approaches are  being utilized. The first approach consists of realizing the  advantages of modern air-to-air missiles on the whole and their  separate systems, first of all active seeker systems. For  example, the AMRAAM missile is being employed for the Norwegian  NASAMS Air Defense Missile Complex. The second approach consists  of expanding the capabilities of air-to-air missiles that have  proven themselves in a surface-to-air variant through a certain  amount of reconfiguration and by increasing their power plant  capabilities. That is what Raytheon is doing for the American  Sparrow missile in the Ivolvd [transliteration] Sparrow variant.  The third approach consists of a combination of the first two.  For example, they plan to utilize the AMRAAM missile in the  ASAM-1 Air Defense Missile Complex.    Right now the GosMKB is developing designs of fourth  generation missiles that have many fundamentally new scientific  and technical solutions that include the missile's external  appearance, its aerodynamic specifications, methods for forming  its command and control, guidance and engine thrust control  systems, and also optimization of all components based upon  their standardized or, on the contrary, based upon their  specialized employment and based upon cost-effectiveness  criteria. According to the assessments of the firm's experts,  the new designs do not lag behind such future foreign  developments as the American Loral Aeronutronics and  Ling-Temco-Vought HAVE DASH and Hughes Aircraft, Raytheon,  General Dynamics, and Westinghouse AAAM air-to-air missiles and  also such developments as the French Aerospatiale "Aster", the  Franco-German Euromissile Association's Roland RM5 and the  American Ling-Temco-Vought ERINT air defense missiles.    In the sphere of electronic warfare systems, the enterprise  has begun developing complex systems that consist of missile  attack warning sensors, automatic dispenser command and control  subsystems and canisters with chaff and infrared decoy  cartridges.    The deterioration of the economic situation has compelled  "Vympel" GosMKB test production to shift to operating modes for  the production of small lots of series-produced products for  export deliveries as part of combat aircraft complexes.  Furthermore, "Vympel" GosMKB is expanding the sphere of civil  production which today totals approximately 10% of the  total  volume of developments. Preference is being assigned to  scientific-intensive and specialized models that permit us to  utilize the enterprise's potential to the maximum possible  extent.    "Vympel" GosMKB demonstrated its products at the Central  Exhibition Field in Moscow in 1989, and also at the "Le  Bourget-91", "Kubinka-92", "Mosaeroshow-92", "Athens-93" and  "IDEX-93" exhibitions.    The firm is most qualified to resolve the following issues:  theoretical research, drafting and design; compilation of  algorithms and computer programs; calculations; modeling;  testing for durability, vibration, strikes and on environmental  impact; flight testing; development of  electro-pneumatic-hydromechanical systems and pyrotechnical  devices; development of telemetry equipment; technological  processing of designs and others. Having a great deal of  experience in the development of weapons systems, "Vympel"  GosMKB is working jointly with many CIS enterprises and proposes  cooperation to all of the world's firms.</p>

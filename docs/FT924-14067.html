			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Worms expansion to go ahead despite fall WORMS, the French holding company with interests in insurance, shipping and luxury goods, sustained a sharp fall in first-half net profits to FFr379m (Dollars 75.3m) from FFr1.11bn a year earlier, because of the downturn in the property market. Despite the profits downturn, Worms is pressing ahead with expanding its insurance business by concluding a cross-shareholding agreement between Athena, its insurance subsidiary, and Wurttembergische, a German insurer. Under the deal Athena will hold 5 per cent of Wurttembergische which will take 5 per cent of the French company. The Wurttembergische deal is the latest in a series of alliances between French and German insurance groups. Assurances Generales de France has built up a sizeable holding in Aachener &amp; Munchener, while Union des Assurances de Paris is in talks with France's Suez group to acquire an interest in Colonia, another German insurer.</p>

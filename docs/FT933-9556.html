			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fokus Bank Fokus Bank, Norway's third-largest commercial bank, bounced back into the black in the first half with a profit before extraordinary items of NKr145.9m (Dollars 19.7m). The result, which confirms an improving trend among Norwegian banks, compares with a NKr175.6m loss in the same 1992 period. The turnround was due to improved net interest, reduced loan losses and operating costs, and profits from securities and foreign exchange dealing. Fokus is more optimistic about its prospects than earlier in the year, when it was looking to get back into profit by 1995. This follows a fall in interest rates. Mr Leif Klevan, managing director, said: 'If the positive trend in the interest market continues, and we do not experience any unexpected losses, then Fokus Bank will be able to close the books for the year showing an important profit.' The bank last made a full-year profit in 1989. The latest figures benefited from a NKr89.9m gain from the sale of securities, compared with a NKr9.8m loss in the same 1992 period, and higher profits from foreign exchange dealing of NKr35.1m, against NKr28.2m. Loan losses fell to NKr199.7m from NKr404.6m.</p>

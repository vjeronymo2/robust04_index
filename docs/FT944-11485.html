			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Down but still battling - Leslie McClements remains optimistic about his pension prospects After leaving a public sector pension scheme, the author took a lump sum transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. When the annual charges rose, he decided he could do better by himself and transferred the personal pension into a small self-administered scheme . . . By mid-summer, the likelihood of a rise in base rates had increased. The prospect of more short-term interest rate rises over the next year had also grown, so it was time to reduce further the portfolio's exposure to interest-sensitive stocks. This assessment was confirmed when base rates were increased by half a percentage point on September 12. Early in August, I sold the Abtrust Preferred Income investment trust income shares and Bristol and West permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). While the sales yielded capital gains of 79 and 15 per cent respectively on their purchase prices in early 1993, the proceeds were 13 to 14 per cent below the peak prices of late January 1994. With hindsight, I should have acted six months earlier. I wanted to increase my overseas weighting and felt Australia and New Zealand should benefit from both higher commodity prices and their trade with the more dynamic Pacific economies. So, I bought NM Smaller Australian and New Zealand investment trusts, although they have since declined by 14 to 15 per cent. While the yields are much lower, these stocks should have better prospects over the next couple of years. I have also experimented with traded options. A small proportion (2.5 per cent) of the fund was used to open Redland and BTR call options early in September. With interest rate worries and the weakness in the US dollar, both are showing substantial losses. But as they are the February 1995 series, I hope they will recover before then. Nonetheless, I continue to feel options are too volatile for me. Sphere investment trust income shares, with a 1.6-fold increase since early 1993, are the star performer in my fund. Early in October, Dartmoor investment trust offered eight new shares for every 25 Sphere shares and the prospect of an improved yield. In response, Sphere intends to pay an enhanced dividend. The market reaction has been adverse, however. The bidder and two fund managers, who account for more than half the Sphere income shares, have accepted the Dartmoor offer but I have decided to retain the Sphere shares until the wind-up in October 1995. By that stage, the discount of more than one-tenth should be eliminated. Meanwhile, the net asset value will increase with any recovery in world markets. Artesian Commercial and Artesian Second Commercial, the unquoted property companies, have produced their first audited accounts. Commercial has achieved an 11 per cent increase in its net asset value and will pay a gross dividend of 12 per cent for the year. Second Commercial began to acquire properties only this year and issue costs led to a small decline in shareholders' funds. Both companies are geared highly but their borrowings are protected by interest rate caps. Mucklow Group is my fund's other property investment. It specialises in Midlands industrial estates and should benefit from continued growth in manufacturing output. In all, property now accounts for one-fifth of the portfolio. I have reduced exposure to interest-sensitive stocks greatly since the beginning of the year (see chart). The portfolio is now down 10.8 per cent on the position in January, which compares with a fall of 6.8 per cent in the FT-SE-A index adjusted for gross dividends. But the fund should outperform in a market recovery. *The author is an economic consultant. Earlier articles appeared on January 8, April 16 and August 6.</p>

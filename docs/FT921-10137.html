			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Shoring up the house of Ucatt / A look at a union hit by defections and corruption THE BUILDING union Ucatt is to make what could be a last bid for survival when it announces a relaunch at the end of this month under its new general secretary, Mr George Brumwell. A series of events over the past year - including allegations of ballot rigging, the suspension of the general secretary and mass defections of officials to rival unions - have shaken the union to its foundations. If the relaunch fails, Ucatt may finally find itself unable to resist pressures to merge with another union. A conference for full-time officials in three weeks will hear the grim truth about the state of the union. Mr Brumwell is to spell out the need to halt the decline in membership figures, eliminate corrupt practices, and establish a new political direction for the union. The latest chain of events may well be seen in future years as the start of Ucatt's renaissance or the begining of its end. The process began in May with a change of control in the union's executive. It is misleading to define factions within Ucatt as 'right' or 'left' - what can be said is that the members of the newly elected executive stood together in wanting change. Within a short time they had suspended Mr Albert Williams, who retires officially next week as general secretary, and announced the setting up of an independent inquiry under Mr John Hands QC into allegations of misconduct during Mr Williams' tenure. There followed the unedifying spectacle of Mr Williams, with financial assistance from the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members, battling with his own union in the High Court to retain his position. He was eventually reinstated when it was proved that the suspension had not been carried out according to Ucatt's own rule book. The defections, which at one time threatened to engulf the entire union movement in a row over poaching of members, boiled over in June during Mr Williams' suspension. A total of 13 senior officials, many of them frightened that they would be victimised by the new executive, left the union. Their first stop en masse was the GMB general union, where Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, offered what he said was a 'safe haven' to Ucatt members and officials. Mr Edmonds argued that Ucatt faced 'virtual disintegration and financial collapse'. The TUC was saved from having to intervene publicly - and perhaps discipline its second-largest affiliate - by the withdrawal of most of the GMB job offers to the ex-Ucatt officials. All but two of the officials then turned to the non-TUC- affiliated EETPU electricians' union. Since then, Ucatt's membership base has been under attack from the rival union. Undoubtedly some damage was done to Ucatt by the EETPU, although it is impossible to disentangle the propaganda put out by both sides from the facts. Ucatt officials feel the worst of the threat from the EETPU is now over. Amalgamation talks between the EETPU and AEU engineering union have dampened the electricians' ardour: the AEU strongly opposed the EETPU's poaching moves and the TUC has indicated that it could not look on the merger favourably if the EETPU continues such activities. A stronger threat comes from the continued recession and the union's dependence on 'check-off' for the collection of subscriptions: if there is no work, union members are not having their union dues deducted from their earnings. Membership has now dipped to just over 200,000 from a level of 240,000 in recent years; a Pounds 500,000 deficit last year could be repeated again this year. Plans for the restructuring of the union and the sale of property will be presented to the conference at the end of the month. The outstanding issue remains corruption and the long-awaited outcome of the Hands inquiry - Ucatt's equivalent to the National Union of Mineworkers' Lightman report. It now looks unlikely that ballot-rigging charges will be substantiated. However, Hands will probably make recommendations about the future conduct of elections and ways in which Ucatt's constitution should be altered. There could, for example, be a recommendation that branch balloting should be replaced by postal voting and that candidates should be allowed openly to campaign for election, instead of covertly, as often happens now. Whatever the findings, officials are hoping the inquiry will be concluded soon so that a clear line can be drawn under previous events before the union's relaunch. Amore difficult change for Mr Brumwell to implement will be a general cleaning up of the way business is conducted. For the first time at the conference officials will discuss a strategy for recruitment and be given clear targets. A package designed to attract self-employed building workers - who now account for more than 700,000 of a 1.3m workforce - will be drawn up. A new accountability will be spelled out: no longer will it be possible for officials to wander around the country without anyone knowing where they are. Relations with employers, which have frequently been too cosy, must be cleaned up, Mr Brumwell will say. As one insider put it: 'Officials will be told 'if you can eat and drink it (what's being offered by a contractor), fine; if you can spend it, it's not.'</p>

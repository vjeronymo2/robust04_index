The wholesale market, to be located in the Nanfang  Commercial  Center in the western part of the city, will cover a floor space  of 14,000 square meters, the size of the famous Shanghai number  one department store.    It is the first market of its kind in this China's largest  city.    Officials say that all foreign-funded enterprises from  Shanghai and other parts of the country can open a window at the  market. It is expected to create an environment for fair  competition between Chinese enterprises and foreign-funded  ventures.    A model of the market shows that automobiles, garments,  foodstuffs and household electronic appliances will be on sale  in one hall while samples and products made by famous  international ventures will be displayed in another hall for  order and wholesale.    So far, businessmen from Shanghai city, Guangdong, Jiangsu  and Zhejiang Provinces as well as from Hong Kong, Taiwan and  Japan have consulted with the market's organizers, asking for  reserving places, according to Yang Guoqiang, deputy manager of  the commercial center.    The Nanfang Commercial Center, which is expected to be  completed by 1995, will have a total floor space of 26,000  square meters. It is near major highways, the subway system, an  expressway and the Hongqiao International Airport.</p>

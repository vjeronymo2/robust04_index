In each party bloc new leaders  are gradually occupying leadership positions at the side of  others with more experience.    -- PSDB -- Leader Jose Serra appears in all important  negotiations, from discussions on the presidential succession to  talks on constitutional revision, thus consolidating the  prestige he earned when he participated in the Constituent  Congress. The figure who represents the party is Senate leader  Mario Covas (SP). Deputy Sergio Machado (CE) operates as a  bridge between Congress and Ceara's powerful party wing. When  economic questions appear, negotiations always include newcomer  (and alternate member) Jose Anibal (SP), who has direct access  to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the ability of  a veteran politician.    -- PPR -- The party's star is its president, Senator  Esperidiao Amin (SC [Santa Catarina]), but Senate PPR leader  Epitafio Cafeteira (MA [Maranhao]) is a rare case of a callous  politician who still has influence within the party. As a  blessing for the party bloc, the CPI multiplied the prestige of  Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PA [Para]). In the Chamber of  Deputies, new bloc leader Marcelino Guilherme Romano (SP) is the  voice of Mayor Paulo Maluf. At times, when moral values are on  the spot, the prestige of Deputy Adylson Motta, of Rio Grande do  Sul, increases. He is the champion of diligence, so much so that  he opens the doors of the plenum auditorium every day. The most  promising newcomer is Fetter Junior (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]),  who formulates the party's proposals for the constitutional  revision.    -- PFL -- Marco Maciel (PE), party bloc leader in the  Senate,  maintains his traditional influence in the party bloc and  participates in all important negotiations. In the Chamber of  Deputies, Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes showed great ability and is one  of those rare figures who can really speak for the party bloc.  Roberto Magalhaes and Gustavo Krause, both from Pernambuco and  newcomers to the Chamber of Deputies, have increased their  influence in the past few months, thanks to the CPI on  corruption in the case of Magalhaes, and the constitutional  revision in the case of Krause.    -- PMDB -- The collapse of [Orestes] Quercia's support group  split the party bloc. Several PMDB followers must be consulted  for any negotiation. Leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG [Minas Gerais])  speaks with the accent of an old MDB [former PMDB party name]  authentic wing member. He has to add his voice to the voices of  party President Luiz Henrique da Silveira (SC) and Deputy Odacir  Klein (RS) to be heard. Deputy Roberto Rollemberg (SP) inherited  Quercia's representation because he was an investigator -- and  not investigated -- by the CPI on the budget scandal. The rest  of the party follows regional leaders.    -- The left -- PT leader Jose Genoino (SP) and Paulo Delgado  (MG) form a supra-party group of the left that has the support  of Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Workers Party-Rio de  Janeiro]) and Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF). Besides their  personal affinities, they almost form a new political party in  Congress and work as a communication channels between the left  and pressure groups outside Congress. The CPI served to bring to  the fore a skillful politician from the PC do B [Communist Party  of Brazil] bloc, Deputy Sergio Miranda (MG), but created  problems for a well- known star: PT leader Aloizio Mercadante  (SP), who came out tarnished together with Congress's so-called  "low clergymen" [congressional leaders indicted by the CPI].</p>

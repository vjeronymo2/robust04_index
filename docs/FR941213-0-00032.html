			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address EPA's concerns, the State took commitments through the public hearing process on November 23, 1992 and submitted the commitments to EPA in a letter dated November 30, 1992, as additional tasks to be performed to correct the deficiencies in the Missoula and statewide SIP. Montana requested that EPA consider the August 20, 1991 submittal concurrent with its June 4, 1992 PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP submittal and the conditions outlined in the State's commitments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commitments related to the Missoula local regulations were as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Missoula shall add language in Chapter VIII of the Missoula regulations to include provisions for inspection of sources to ascertain compliance with the adopted emission control action for each emergency episode stage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Missoula shall review and revise the internal and external communication strategies contained in Missoula's emergency episode regulations (Subchapter 4) to ensure consistency with the state requirements (SIP Chapters 7 and 8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Missoula shall revise the Missoula permitting regulation to correct the deficiencies that EPA identified in James Scherer's December 4, 1991 letter by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> a. Replacing the terms ``new or altered source or stack'' and ``new or altered source'' with more definitive terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Adding the terms ``demolition'' and ``modifications'' to the definition of construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Eliminating the blanket exemption from permitting for emergency equipment installed at hospitals [Rule 1102(1)(h)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Eliminating the blanket exemption from permitting for equipment associated with the storage of agricultural products [1102(1)(f)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Replacing the term ``air pollution control capability'' contained in Rule 1103(1) with the term ``air pollution control equipment or techniques.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Changing the reference to the 1977 Federal Clean Air Act contained in Rule 1103 to the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Replacing the term ``expected production capacity'' contained in Rule 1105(1)(b)(ii) with the term ``maximum design production capacity.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Replacing the word ``or'' contained in Rule 1109, Sections (1), (2), and (3) with the word ``and.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (D) If suggestions are made by Montana for Missoula to revise their open burning regulations in accordance with amendments to Montana open burning regulations to ensure that a state open burning permit to burn creosote railroad ties cannot be issued for any location in Missoula County, Missoula shall complete the necessary revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Missoula shall revise Rule 1407 to make it consistent with the proposed amendments to Montana Rule 16.8.1407 regarding wood waste burners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Missoula shall revise the Missoula NSPS and NESHAP regulations to incorporate all federal requirements promulgated through July 1, 1992.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revisions to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations, which were submitted by the Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, fulfill four of the State's commitments (see A, B, C, and E above). However, EPA still has concerns with respect to the minor source operating permit regulations (see below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information submitted to Doug Skie, EPA, from Jeff Chaffee, MDHES, in a letter dated June 9, 1994 fulfills one more commitment (see D above). In this letter, the State indicated that there is no need for Missoula to revise its open burning regulations. The State revised its open burning regulations to prohibit the burning of creosote railroad ties (revisions adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences at its May 20, 1994 hearing), and the Missoula regulation already prohibits such burning. Therefore, the State does not believe that revisions to Missoula's open burning regulations are required at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

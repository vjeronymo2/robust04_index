			<p>BFN     [Text] In Gujarat, a 39-member Congress-I ministry led by  Mr. Chhabildas Mehta was sworn in this evening at Gandhinagar.  The governor, Dr. Saroop Singh, administered the oath of office  and secrecy to the ministers.    Our Ahmedabad correspondent reports that for the first time  the state has two deputy chief ministers. They are Mr. C.D.  Patel and Mr. Narhari Amin. There are 22 cabinet ministers and  17 ministers of state. There are altogether 12 new faces,  including four of cabinet rank. The new ministry has all the  members of the outgoing cabinet. Portfolios will be announced  later.</p>

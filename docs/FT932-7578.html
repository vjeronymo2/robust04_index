			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Gold There is nothing like a little speculative fever to seduce the punters. Gold touched Dollars 384 an ounce in New York this week before nerves and profit-taking set in. Since bullion has rallied from Dollars 325 an ounce in barely seven weeks some kind of setback was inevitable, but it seems premature to conclude that all the excitement is over. Certainly the price has been driven by futures and options trading. As Sir James Goldsmith has unloaded stakes in Newmont Mining he has had plenty of cash to plough back into options. Once the ball was rolling Sir James may have been able to take profits and withdraw some money from the market. He could then rely on options market makers rushing to cover their exposure, gold producers keen to unwind forward sales and mechanical computer buying programmes to keep things on the boil. Such speculative bubbles tend to burst rather nastily. Yet at least part of the recent rise may reflect the undervaluation of gold earlier in the year. Consumption - most notably in the far east - was almost twice world mined production last year. Only substantial sales from central banks kept the price depressed. They have mostly stepped back from the market in the recent rally, just as far eastern buyers have held back while the market is volatile. But unless large official sales resume, gold will probably hold above Dollars 350 an ounce.</p>

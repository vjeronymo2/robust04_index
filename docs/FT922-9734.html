			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Russia plans to make rouble fully convertible THE RUSSIAN government yes-terday outlined a bold timetable which, in theory, would allow the rouble to trade freely against other currencies this summer. Under the plan the rouble, would have a single floating exchange rate for all current account transactions from July. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, Russia's representative in talks with the International Monetary Fund, said that from August 1, the government intended to introduce what he described as a fixed rate. He hoped it would emerge at Rbs80 to the dollar, compared with its present rate of about Rbs140. However, the currency would be allowed to fluctuate within a wide band - 7.5 per cent up or down from that fixed central rate with the help of a proposed Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund from the west. The plan to make the rouble convertible is a vital part of integrating Russia into the market-based economic system of the industrialised world. A convertible rouble would expose Russian businesses to competitive forces from abroad and should encourage foreign investment in Russia's economy. The rouble, which was legal tender in the former Soviet Union, has not been fully convertible on world markets since the Russian revolution. Since the start of the year many banks and companies have been allowed to buy and sell the currency within the country at small-scale trading sessions organised by the Russian central bank. The stated goal of the Russian authorities is to make the rouble tradable on current account and to allow foreign investors in Russia to repatriate profits. Arrangements on capital account transactions, however, are still unclear. Western experts warned that it was probably too early to say exactly how, or when the stabilisation fund would be used. Several issues, as Russian officials admitted, have yet to be settled. These range from controlling the monetary policy of other republics which would be part of a rouble zone to liberalising the domestic price of oil. The issue of monetary policy control will be discussed at a meeting of central bank chairmen of former Soviet republics in mid-May. The government plans to abolish from July 1 remaining quotas and licences on all exports except energy, arms and areas such as textiles on which foreign countries have import restrictions. Mr Kagalovsky declined to set a date for liberalising the price of oil paid by domestic users. One western official said it could take three or four months for the stabilisation fund promised by western governments to be implemented once the rouble had been floated. This was because it would take more than a month for it to find a rate at which it could be stabilised. Reuters reports from Washington: US Federal Reserve governor Mr Wayne Angell said he was pessimistic that the rouble stabilisation fund to be established by western governments would work and said it could become a 'bottomless pit'. In a speech to the National Economists Club, Mr Angell said it was very difficult to stabilise one currency against other currencies without totally devoting monetary policy to that purpose.</p>

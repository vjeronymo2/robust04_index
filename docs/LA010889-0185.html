			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROCEEDING WITHOUT CAUTION WHEN IT RAINS  </P> <P> Erroneous headlines and comments in reports of vehicle accidents follow every  rainfall in Southern California -- and probably across the nation. The rains  are blamed for causing the accidents.  </P> <P> Sorry, but the direct causes of the accidents are the reckless drivers who fail  to adjust their driving habits to the adverse conditions that are created by  the rain.  </P> <P> Observing some of these irresponsible drivers here for more than 20 years, I  have seen them tailgate at the same distance when it rains, continue at the  same high rates of speed, perform unsafe lane changes, harbor the same  impatient attitudes, continue to drink and show little regard or respect for  others.  </P> <P> When headlines and comments blame the rains for the accidents, it lets the  reckless drivers "off the hook," when in fact headlines should be directed  towards these culprits and their insane way of operating a motor vehicle.  </P> <P> One other negative result of improper blaming is that it negates some of the  effort that is put forth by many people to try to cope with the unsafe drivers.  This includes police agencies that are overwhelmed, those who promote safety  through businesses, and public agencies such as the National Safety Council.  </P> <P> Having driven a car for more than 40 years -- and having been a safety  consultant for more than 17 years in which driver safety has been an integral  part of my occupational function -- it is quite apparent that attitudinal  changes are a definite necessity for many of the drivers who daily thumb their  noses at laws and other people through their killing habits.  </P> <P> The next time it rains, perhaps you will advise those reporters and headline  writers of their responsibilities in accurately stating the facts behind  accidents instead of using the catch-all "rain blamed for accidents" phrasing.  Driver irresponsibilities should be in the first paragraph for such stories.  </P> <P> JOSEPH D. PIERCE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

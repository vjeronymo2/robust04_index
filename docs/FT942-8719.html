			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: You don't have to be Australian but it helps - Andrew Jack finds prospects for financial staff in the UK are improving quickly - but not uniformly Wanted: Antipodean accountants for part-time assignments in a growing number of financially-related jobs in the south east ofEngland. Good salaries paid. In the crazy world of financial recruitment in London, Australian cost accountants and financial controllers from New Zealand are all the rage. Chartered accountants from Croydon are less in demand. After four years of gloom, prospects are brightening for the UK's accountants. But the light is not being spread evenly across the profession, and the pattern casts serious shadows for the future. The annual salary survey produced this week by Robert Half, one of the UK's largest recruiters of financial staff, suggests the worst effects of the economic downturn are definitely past. Mr Jeff Grout, managing director, says: 'Two or three years ago was about the bleakest job market ever for accountants. That has changed very quickly in the last nine months. It is very much the end of the recession.' In its place, he sees an 'almost alarming' increase in accountancy salaries of 2.91 per cent over the last year - with a peak of 3.1 per cent in the Thames Valley - though this is still a long way from 1988, when the average salary increase was 13 per cent. Some 26 per cent of companies questioned said they expected to hire accountants during the coming year, compared with 15 per cent a year ago. Only 13 per cent - or half last year's total - expected to make further job cuts. Yet demand for financial staff is not consistently spread. Much of it is for temporaries. Mr Denis Waxman, managing director of Hays Personnel Services, says they are cheaper to employ and more flexible. 'Clients have also been educated in their use,' he says. 'Before the recession they looked on them suspiciously as people who could not get full-time jobs. Now they see there are high calibre people doing temporary work.' The growth of temporaries has, in turn, led to a dominance within the sector (in London) of Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans. Mr Grout says they are popular because of their energy and ambition, reflecting their spirit as migrants. 'Boring people don't make the trip,' he says. Another important caveat to the recovery in the job market is the differential attractiveness of different qualifications. Formal or more senior qualifications may not always be so necessary. 'Small companies call us and ask for a chartered accountant because their auditor has suggested it,' says Mr Waxman. 'We say do you really need one when all you want is someone to do your bookkeeping?' He says that the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy has gained new ground with its restructured syllabus, aimed at accountants in the National Health Service and other restructured public sector organisations. However, among the different qualifications, management accountancy emerges supreme. 'The Cima qualification has come of age,' says Mr Grout. 'Chartered accountancy was top of the tree but for the majority of blue chip companies now there is a preference for a more well-rounded business training.' The trend is borne out by figures for student registrations at the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima). The numbers have risen nearly consistently over the last decade. There was a temporary drop from a peak of 11,180 in 1991 to 10,202 in the following year. But in 1993 it recovered to 10,731 and the indications are it will rise again this year. Mr Jake Claret, Cima's director of student and technical affairs, says: 'We are seeing a reflection of a product which is seen as favoured for the market in which it operates. Ours is a specialist syllabus for business. We are not training auditors. We are turning out individuals more comfortable looking forwards than backwards.' The prospects are not so bright for everyone. Figures released last month by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales shows total student entries were at their lowest level in 1992-93 for 20 years. From a record entry of 7,063 in 1988-89, the trend has been steadily downwards, slumping to 4,847 in 1991-92 and sinking still further to just 4,074 last year. With an appropriate lag for training, qualified accountants admitted also fell from 5,692 in 1992 to 4,476 in 1993. Given that student entries readily translate into membership subscription income on qualification three or four years later, such a decline poses a threat to the Institute - hardly what it needs just when it is reporting a Pounds 1.2m deficit in its latest accounts. Mr Phil Armitage, the Institute's director of education and training, stresses the decline does not reflect a lack of interest by students in becoming chartered accountants, but rather a lack of demand from firms. At the end of the 1980s, it was said that accountancy firms recruited 10 per cent of all UK graduates, and KPMG Peat Marwick alone hired 10 per cent of all accountancy recruits. The mood is now more sombre. Many senior partners say the trends of the 1980s will never be repeated. They argue that there will be a smaller, more selective intake in the future; that they are looking for more highly qualified, business-oriented students who will remain loyal. They want to be rid of those simply looking for a salary and free training while they defer a serious career decision. Certainly that is one of the prime justifications they have used for hikes in salaries which seem to defy all logic and laws of a market economy. Arthur Andersen has built a reputation for paying more than its rival 'Big Six' competitors, stressing to potential recruits that they will work a slightly longer week. But the traditional co-operation among the other firms broke down two years ago when Price Waterhouse, in mid recession, upped its London graduate salaries from Pounds 12,500 to Pounds 14,000 in a move reluctantly followed by its rivals. Most recently, Coopers &amp; Lybrand has done the same, offering its London recruits starting this autumn Pounds 17,000 a year. By beating its rivals to a high quote early in the recruitment season, it may gain better calibre people in the short-term. Other firms are also tweaking the figures, using a combination of bonuses on qualification and perks to make applications more attractive. Mr Peter Smith, the newly-elected chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that the number of students hired by his firm is rising again in line. It is a view shared by several of his fellow senior partners. 'The firms have been very short-sighted,' says Mr Waxman of Hays. 'They over-recruited in the good days and then cut back dramatically. I guarantee that in 18 months the partners will be going mad and accusing me of driving up the market.' Mr Grout says he expects the main losers as recruitment hots up to be the smaller and mid-size accountancy firms, which may have to increasingly rely on accounting technicians as their larger rivals snap up the better graduates. In general, it seems as though the next few months offer good news for accountants hunting their first jobs or considering a move; and a little more sober contemplation for those entering as a trainee. In the accountancy firms, business and the professional bodies, there needs to be more soul searching on the scope for revisions to training and recruitment in the future.</p>

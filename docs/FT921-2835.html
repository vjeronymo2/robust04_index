			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Appointments: Promotion at Norwich Union The ascendance of a younger generation of management at Norwich Union, the mutually-owned insurer, was signalled yesterday by the appointment of 38-year-old Philip Scott as general manager (finance). Scott, who will also become group actuary, is currently senior investment manager responsible for global securities. He joined Norwich in 1973, has worked within the group's life and pensions operations and has also had a spell abroad with Norwich's New Zealand subsidiary, the State Insurance Office. He replaces Hugh Scurfield, who has been with Norwich since 1959; he was appointed general manager and actuary in 1983 and has played a leading role in championing the interests of life policy-holders. He is currently president of the Institute of Actuaries and will coincidentally retire at the end of his term of office. Three new assistant general managers have also been appointed. David Williams takes over responsibility for general insurance, Geoff Loades takes on a new position as assistant general manager (customer services) and Patrick Smith assistant general manager (personal insurances). Miller flies out Bill Miller who, with his brother Eric founded Prestwick Holdings, the printed circuit-board manufacturer based at Ayr in Scotland, is stepping down from the chairmanship. He is succeeded by Hugh Laughland, a non-executive director of BTR and chairman of Stoddard Sekers, the carpet-makers. The Miller brothers set up Prestwick in 1969 and Bill Miller was involved in its management until 1990 when, in view of its disappointing performance since flotation in 1985, he brought in Wayne Osman as ceo and became non-executive chairman. Bill Miller and his wife still own about 13 per cent of Prest-wick's shares and overall the Miller family accounts for about 20 per cent of the equity. Miller is to pursue his other interests which include the chairmanship of PIK Ltd, a company set up to run Prest-wick airport which BAA is selling. Prestwick says Laughland, who was formerly joint ceo of BTR's European region, will be useful for his experience of international markets as the company expands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> Claus Gennrich in Bonn on 20 January: "The Course of Events in  Moscow Worries Officials in Bonn: The Lava Is Flowing"]    [Text] The Federal Government is trying to understand  events in Moscow as well as possible future developments.  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl still intends to talk with  President Yeltsin on the telephone this Friday [21 January] to  ask him about the new cabinet list and the future course of the  government. Meanwhile, it has been expected in Bonn, even  before the conversation, that Yeltsin will tell the chancellor  that he was in control of the situation and that the reforms  would continue. Kohl is expected to tell Yeltsin that he will  continue to support him and the reforms. Before that, Kohl had a  long telephone conversation with U.S. President Clinton that  ended with the two men agreeing that Kohl would ask Yeltsin  about developments triggered by the meeting the two presidents  held in Moscow; in a week, Kohl and Clinton will further  coordinate their position during the chancellor's visit to  Washington. In the Foreign Ministry and in the Chancellor's  Office, the question whether Finance Minister Fedorov would  remain in the government was interpreted as an indicator for the  future of the reform policy and the West's position toward  Russia. Diplomats in Bonn have, therefore, been following  alternating reports about Fedorov with great attention.    Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE:  "For the World Bank and the IMF, the most important financial  institutes for Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar, who has  since resigned, and Fedorov used to be the two  confidence-building personalities; they maintained the contact.  If both were to go, this would result in a considerable loss of  confidence for Moscow." If the changing reports on Fedorov were  to end with his resignation from the government, which was  unclear on Thursday, "then this would constitute a major  setback." Nevertheless, Kinkel said that as far as Germany is  concerned, "there is no alternative to the reform policy; it has  to be supported." Kinkel advised against "dramatizing warnings."  <H5>  Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin-Fedorov </H5>   Kinkel assumed that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin would try to  "strike a compromise." If Fedorov ultimately were to resign,  only Deputy Prime Minister Chubays, who is in charge of  privatization, would remain of the original hard core of  reformers in the government. Kinkel said the conclusion for  German foreign policy was that "the West must continue to help  Yeltsin, under the condition that the objectives of reform must  not be seriously threatened." As criteria for assessing  Moscow's reform policy, Kinkel mentioned "the fight against  inflation, the inclusion of the central bank into the policy of  monetary stability, the continued efforts for privatization, the  reduction of subsidies for state enterprises that are unable to  survive, and further steps toward the market economy accompanied  by the establishment of a social insurance system independent of  enterprises." These criteria are similar to the conditions  under which Fedorov would stay in office.    In Kinkel's view, the revolutionary process is not yet  concluded in Russia: "The lava is still flowing." The  developments have not yet become steady. The balance between  Yeltsin and now stronger Chernomyrdin, between the president and  parliament, and between the government and the state duma still  has to be achieved. Gaydar's resignation has already weakened  the government's reform punch. Chernomyrdin was obviously also  trying to force Fedorov into the background; yet Yeltsin knows  he needs the finance minister. Meanwhile, the positions of  Gaydar and Fedorov have been strengthened through their  parliamentary seats.    Sources in Bonn expect that the government will be able to  achieve "majorities on specific issues" in parliament, when  Gaydar's bloc cooperates with independent and "federative"  deputies in individual cases. However, visitors from Bonn in  Moscow, such as Hornhues, the deputy chairman of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag  group, have noticed an even increasing fragmentation in  Parliament. Gaydar's group does not "primarily" see itself as  the government party. In general, it has been noted in Bonn  that various politicians are even now guided in their behavior  by their prospects for the 1996 presidential and parliamentary  election. Chernomyrdin and Gaydar are probably rivals for the  succession to Yeltsin.    Some observers from Bonn have interpreted a movement of  disassociation from Yeltsin as an indication that changes may be  possible even before 1996. If Yeltsin were to resign for health  or other reasons, numerous politicians, public servants, and  military members from very differing directions would get ready  to take over. In this respect, Deputy Defense Minister Kronov  seems to be playing a significant role. He was the last Russian  officer to leave Afghan territory and he is said not to be too  distant from the views of nationalist Zhirinovskiy. Some  observers in Bonn seem to regard it as possible that the forces  that are standing behind Zhirinovskiy in military circles, and  certain services are planning to use their popular figurehead  only until they are able to implement their own ambitions and no  longer need the charlatan.    Kinkel does not indulge in such speculation, but obviously  does not rule out a development that follows the experience that  "the revolution devours its children." Stabilizing help by the  West was, therefore, all the more important, he said. More  difficult than the conditions in Russia is the situation in  Ukraine, Kinkel stressed, mentioning catchwords such as  Sevastopol, the domestic harbor of the Black Sea fleet,  dependency on Russian energy supplies, and nuclear arms. After  the Russian-Ukrainian agreement on the scrapping of nuclear  arms, which was signed in the presence of Bill Clinton, the last  of those issues seems to have been defused. However, the  economic situation was disastrous. In the FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE interview, Kinkel suggested that the European Union  [EU] follow Germany's proposal and devise a "program for the  economical use of energy." Since many relief programs remained  ineffective, the EU should make sure its aid is coordinated.  Kinkel said: "Russia and Ukraine should conclude a treaty on  neighborly relations, comparable to the one Germany signed with  Poland and the other Eastern countries."    Kinkel drew up a "program for the Baltics." The Baltics are  "highly sensitive for Russia." The Balts' nervousness is not  without reason. Yet, Kinkel stressed that he was also convinced  Russia would withdraw its forces. Nevertheless, for Russia, the  independence of the Baltic countries is a symbol for its decline  as an international power. Kinkel announced that in an early  March meeting in Bonn with the foreign ministers of Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania, he intends to discuss how the three  countries can be included in European cooperation "as partners  with equal rights." Kinkel described his initiative in the EU:  "At the European Council in December, the Brussels Commission  was given the mandate to conduct negotiations on a free trade  agreement; I am trying to extend this mandate to facilitate the  conclusion of a Europe agreement with each of the three Baltic  states that at least includes the prospects for EU accession."  The next EU Council of Foreign Ministers should discuss this  issue in February.  <H5>  Nervousness in Poland </H5>   Regarding the countries in East-Central Europe, Kinkel  noticed that nervousness is most marked in Poland, because of  Warsaw's unfulfilled wishes toward NATO and the EU. In her  talks in Bonn on Tuesday, former Polish Prime Minister Suchocka  expressed her disappointment about the West. The Partnership for  Peace did not offer any protection. Since NATO failed to agree  on an "agenda" for Polish membership in, say, 10 years, Poland's  acceptance into the alliance, including a necessary security  guarantee for this country, which is a neighbor to Russia. Mrs.  Suchocka predicted that the stronger and more dangerous Russia  would become the less NATO would be willing to accept Central-  East European countries as members out of fear of Moscow's  reactions. Russia would never become a democracy. The Poles  were also getting upset with the EU and its protectionism. The  mood was becoming anti-Western, Suchocka said.    In the interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Kinkel  described Poland's fears as not justified. The Europe agreement  with Poland will come into force on 1 February: "Poland is  being involved in many ways." Poland must understand, however,  that "the involvement of Russia in cooperation is in the  interest of the Central-East European countries." Kinkel said:  "There are two levels. We understand what is moving the peoples  and governments of the Central-East European countries; however,  together we must try to come to a rational assessment of the  situation." The accusation of selfish Western European  protectionism to the disadvantage of democracy in the East  cannot be substantiated. Kinkel warned the East Europeans  against turning their back to the West: "Remain sensible and do  not overreact!" Kinkel pointed out that the Europe agreement  with Hungary on free trade and political dialogue, including  "prospects for membership" would also become effective at the  beginning of next month. Similar agreements with Bulgaria,  Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic were signed in  Brussels last year. The ratification procedures have started;  interim agreements will be in force until they are concluded.  Negotiations between the European Union and Russia on a  partnership agreement have been interrupted as a result of the  government reshuffle in Moscow. A result should be achieved in  the course of the year. Negotiations with Ukraine, Belarus,  Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have started or are being prepared.  Kinkel concluded: "We are doing everything possible to  strengthen the network."</p>

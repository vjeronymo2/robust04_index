			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HE DOESN'T COME TO HIS DEFENSE  </P> <P> I am writing in reference to Jerry Crowe's article, "A Grand Opening," that  appeared on Nov. 27.  </P> <P> My name is Kent Taylor, and I was the fifth starter on that UCLA freshmen team.  I enjoyed the article tremendously but disagree with one point.  </P> <P> I believe I guarded Mike Warren on that night, because my butt was dragging and  he ran by me several times on the full-court press. If you will check with him,  I'm sure he will validate that.  </P> <P> KENT TAYLOR  </P> <P> Selma, Ala.  </P></p>

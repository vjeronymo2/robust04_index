			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'K-9' A SERVICEABLE OUTING FOR BELUSHI  </P> <P> "K-9" (selected theaters) is a buddy movie with a difference: one of the guys  is a dog. That's just fine because James Belushi and his handsome co-star, a  German shepherd named Jerry Lee (on screen and off), are as spiffy a team as  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Jerry Lee, named for Mr. Lewis, is a real  killer, too.  </P> <P> Cast as a member of the San Diego Police Department K-9 Corps, Jerry Lee can go  for the throat (and other vulnerable parts of the body) if you're one of the  bad guys. At other times, Jerry Lee is the complete charmer, albeit always  independent and unpredictable. He never cottons to the notion that Belushi's  Detective Tom Dooley is the senior partner of the team just because he is the  human.  </P> <P> Actually, Jerry Lee is just what Dooley needs. Dooley is a headstrong,  corner-cutting chance taker, the kind of cop forever in hot water and who has  always resisted working with a partner. (You've met the type a million times  before on the screen and on the tube; thankfully, Belushi is able to play  Dooley deftly for laughs.) In helping the detective go after a drug kingpin  (Kevin Tighe, gleefully nasty), Jerry Lee proves he is far more valuable to  Dooley than for his ability to sniff out narcotics.  </P> <P> In Steven Siegel and Scott Myers' serviceable rather than inspired script, the  plot is standard, even stale cops-and-robbers fantasy, a throwaway device  setting up the funny and touching relationship between Dooley and the German  shepherd. Jerry Lee may be an exceptionally bright animal, but his trainer Karl  Lewis Miller deserves much credit for making him seem so human. There is a  warm, robust, good-natured quality to Belushi that makes his Detective Dooley  easy to take. Mel Harris certainly is a good sport as Dooley's rich, elegant  lady who clearly adores Dooley for his love-making abilities rather than his  intellect. (She was, Dooley recalls, reading Celine on the beach at La Jolla  when he first noticed her.)  </P> <P> That the plot is never developed beyond the routine and that the jokes are not  all thigh-slappers, although there are a few, keeps "K-9" (PG-13 for some  violence and raunchiness) from being more than a minor effort. But as such,  it's enjoyable, thanks not only to its charismatic duo, but also to the skilled  comedy direction of Rod Daniel, whose strong sense of pacing is enhanced by  Miles Goodman's driving but not overpowering score.KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

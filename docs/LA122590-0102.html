			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SNAPPING UP THESE GIFTS SAVES LIVES  </P> <P> The parking lot was packed and crowds combed the aisles at 601 The City Drive  in Orange on Christmas Eve, searching for perfect presents.  </P> <P> The gifts they found won't fit in neat packages. And most won't sit still long  enough to be placed under the tree.  </P> <P> No matter. Lisa Coil of Yorba Linda still planned to put a big bow on the dog  that she and her friend, Michelle Loupe of Anaheim Hills, picked out for  another friend.  </P> <P> Coil chose the crossbred American Staffordshire-pit bull for Russell Long of  Mission Viejo because the mutt is scrawny and looked as if he needed a home.  </P> <P> "Russell said he wanted a dog that needs some help and some love," she said.  "This was the saddest-looking one."  </P> <P> Each year around Christmas, business picks up at the county animal shelter, as  people adopt pets for gifts, said Jack Edwards, director of animal control.  </P> <P> "It's been especially busy today," said Eric Stavenhagen, a kennel attendant.  </P> <P> Karen Velazquez looked for hours with her daughter, Ashley, 6, and a friend of  the family, Renee Barker, before finding the right dog for her husband.  </P> <P> "He wanted a shepherd, but this is close enough to a shepherd," she said,  leaning down to pat the head of a 4-year-old female elkhound. "She's so mellow,  and I won't have to go through potty training and everything. And besides, not  too many people want older dogs, so we're saving her life."  </P> <P> People generally want to adopt puppies and kittens for presents, Edwards said.  The last of those was adopted about a week ago.  </P> <P> The few kittens that came in early Christmas Eve were quickly snapped up,  unlike in the spring and summer, when many go unadopted.  </P> <P> "People were fighting over them this morning," kennel attendant Sharon  Linsmeier said.  </P> <P> Kirsi Leedes and Bob McCarthy of Newport Beach were among those disappointed by  the lack of kittens.  </P> <P> Leedes "really wanted a kitten for Christmas," McCarthy said as the couple eyed  a soft black kitten with a growing waiting list.  </P> <P> "I can't believe I'm getting a cat. I didn't used to like them," Leedes said.  </P> <P> After moving to Newport from Finland a year ago, Leedes said she began feeding  abandoned cats in the neighborhood and grew to like them. Since then, she has  taken in one cat, a Himalayan, and wanted a kitten to be its companion.  </P> <P> The Goldmans of Anaheim were also partly successful in their search for a  Christmas pet. "It just happens to be Christmas, and my husband wants a dog,"  Glenda Goldman said. "He's always had one, and we had one that died. So now  he's convinced me that I'm going to get him a dog for Christmas."  </P> <P> She, her husband and their two sons, Simon, 8, and David, 6, peered into cages,  tentatively petting wet noses and scratching ears as a chorus of high-pitched  yaps and lower barks and growls filled the air.  </P> <P> The family settled on Ellen, a Norwegian elkhound mix, but she is licensed and  must be held a week to see whether her owner claims her. If by Saturday the  owner has not picked her up, the Goldmans are in luck. Otherwise, they'll  choose another dog.  </P> <P> Although many of the animals desperately need homes, animal control officials  generally discourage people from adopting pets as presents.  </P> <P> "We've had some terrible experiences where a person has said they want a dog  earlier in the year, and then they receive it and they don't really want it,  and they end up bringing it back to the shelter," Edwards said.

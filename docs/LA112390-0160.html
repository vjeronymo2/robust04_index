			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DANGER SEEN IN TAN-LINKED ADS  </P> <P> Ads with sexy bronzed models should be required to carry health warnings that  tanning can cause skin cancer, medical specialists said today.  </P> <P> The advertising, fashion and marketing industries are irresponsibly promoting  tans, counteracting efforts to encourage Australians to reduce their  skin-cancer risk, the Australasian College of Dermatologists said.  </P> <P> "I believe that each of these pictures should in fact carry a warning, similar  to those found on cigarette packets: suntanning is a cancer hazard," Dr. Alan  Cooper, the college's honorary secretary, told a news conference.  </P> <P> "When I see parents with very young babies on beaches with no protection, I  think that is child abuse," he added.  </P> <P> Cooper called for a concerted effort to promote the image that "the pale  Australian is in, and the bronzed Aussie is out."  </P></p>

An  official, queried on the protest lodged Monday, pointed to a  weekend statement by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,  saying it indicated Singapore was unlikely to yield ground on  the issue. Lee had said that foreigners living in Singapore  would have to abide by local laws. "These laws are published,  they are transparent. Everyone knows about them," he said,  according to local news reports.    Michael Peter Fay, 18, was sentenced on Thursday to four  months jail, six strokes of the cane and fined 3,500 dollars  (2,200 US) for spray-painting cars, pelting them with eggs and  retaining stolen property. The court-ordered flogging drew  immediate criticism from a senior US diplomat here and the  American Chamber of Commerce, which said it was "shaken" by the  sentence.    The Singapore government is expected to issue a formal  statement responding to Clinton's announcement that Washington  had filed "a strong protest" over the affair. Clinton had said  that while he recognised that the Singapore authorities were  acting within their jurisdiction, he hoped the caning decision  would be reconsidered. "We recognize that they have a certain  right to enforce their own criminal laws. But we believe that  based on the facts and the treatment of other cases, similar  cases, that this punishment is extreme and we hope very much  that somehow it will be reconsidered," he said. [passage omitted]    Some analysts said Washington's protest may have been poorly  timed because Fay, a student at the American school here, is on  bail pending appeal to a higher court. The judicial process was  therefore still not completed, they said. Lee said Saturday that  Singaporeans had been ordered caned for similar offences and  that it would be absurd to have separate laws for locals and  Americans. There was no reason why "foreigners should be more  thin-skinned," he said.    Singapore's home affairs ministry said after the subordinate  court ruling that the same laws applied to Singaporeans and  foreigners. Of the 14 people, between the age of 18 and 21,  convicted for vandalism and ordered caned over the last five  years, 12 were Singaporeans, it said. A juvenile court will next  month sentence a 15-year-old Malaysian who pleaded guilty to two  counts of vandalism while a 16-year-old Hong Kong resident will  go on trial, also for vandalism, next week.</p>

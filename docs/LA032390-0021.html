			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A consulting firm that last month dismissed the feasibility of putting a major  commercial airport at Brown Field reported Thursday that a new facility there  might be possible if aircraft could occasionally approach over Mexico.  </P> <P> Dan Haney, senior manager for KPMG Peat Marwick, told a San Diego Assn. of  Governments panel that a two-runway airport on Otay Mesa could handle 200,000  takeoffs and landings yearly, or about the number of airliners accommodated at  Lindbergh Field last year.  </P> <P> The airport would have to be part of a multiple-airport configuration using  both an expanded Brown Field and Lindbergh to handle the region's air traffic,  Haney said.  </P> <P> In a March 12 letter distributed at Thursday's meeting, Haney told a Sandag  official that "we recently submitted a report indicating that two suggested  sites on (Otay) Mesa do not appear feasible because of airspace problems. We  hope that we did not convey the impression that there were not alternatives  that might prove attractive."  </P> <P> Haney proposed an airport consisting of a realigned 12,000-foot runway at Brown  Field parallel to Tijuana International Airport, and a 9,000-foot  northwest-to-southeast runway east of Brown Field.  </P> <P> The configuration would require aircraft landing from the southeast to approach  over Mexican airspace about 25% of the time, necessitating "a combined  U.S./Mexican air traffic control arrangement." Planes bound for Mexico and the  United States could alternate using the approach area, Haney said.  </P> <P> Last month, Haney's firm told Sandag that two proposed layouts for an Otay Mesa  airport are not possible because the nearby San Ysidro Mountains would force  much steeper than normal takeoffs and landings.  </P></p>

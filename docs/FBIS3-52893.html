			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "When Someone Else Foots the </F> Bill..."]    [Text] Speaking to the heads of the country's universities  and higher education institutions, Hojjat ol-Eslam  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that the government has acted very  strongly in the First and Second Five-Year Plans and described  as minimal the impact that the fluctuations in the world market  and the drop in oil prices have on the country's infrastructural  plans, adding that with the existence of efficient forces and  thanks to economizing in foreign exchange in implementing the  major development projects, we can continue to advance our  development without the help of foreign exchange income.    The day after these remarks, Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, who  heads the Plan and Budget Organization, said in an interview:  In order to free the country's economy from the recent  fluctuations and in view of the drop in the oil income that was  to finance infrastructural and development projects in the  Second Plan, efforts are being made to find new sources (!) of  investment and to increase the prices of services such as  electricity, oil products, telecommunications, gas, and so on,  and to meet in this way the financial needs for the  implementation of infrastructural projects (!).    The president's remarks that the reduction in oil prices  will  not have any impact on our economy and that the country's  development projects are not linked with our foreign exchange  incomes are surprising, because even the most naive people in  the country know that Iran is a single-product country that is  extremely dependent on oil. This is so crystal clear that no  facts and figures are necessary to prove it. In other words,  the president's remarks are a big riddle: How can development  projects be completed and infrastructural investments be made  without any foreign exchange income?    But fortunately the head of the Plan and Budget Organization  solved this riddle very quickly in his interview and clarified  where the money to be spent is to come from. Of course, Mr.  Rowghani-Zanjani did not clarify how new investments will be  acquired and what the nature of these investments will be; and  apparently there has been no mention of how investments from  abroad are to be acquired in the Second Plan either. This comes  at a time when the First Plan and the government's economic  reform policies have been frustrated basically because of the  failure to attract any foreign investment or foreign financial  resources. Thus, if we discount his reference to acquiring new  resources, we will see that the country's economic development  will be paid for from the people's pocket. In other words, the  gist of the remarks both by the president and by the head of the  Plan and Budget Organization is the old adage that it is easy to  be a big spender with other people's money.</p>

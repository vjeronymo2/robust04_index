			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It appears that differences between the Yemeni  president and his deputy have not been completely solved. The  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] yesterday issued a statement  broadcast over Aden radio protesting President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's order to annul Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas'  decision to appoint a new governor of the southern (?Abyan)  Governorate.    The YSP, which is led by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  said that al-'Attas' decision does not contravene the  constitution as long as it aims to prevent corruption in the  governorate.    The Yemeni presidency regarded the decision as a violation  of  both the constitution and the law because appointing governors  must be effected by joint decisions of the president and the  vice president.    It goes without saying that this issue is within the  differences which seem to be continuing between the northerners  and southerners, between the president and the vice president,  or between the two main political parties, the YSP and General  People's Congress.</p>

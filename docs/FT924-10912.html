			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Pinpoints of light - Market prospects MOST ALUMINIUM analysts believe that they can still see the light at the end of the demand tunnel that they first discerned in the early part of this year; but the tunnel itself is proving to be much longer than it appeared then, writes Richard Mooney. They generally agree, however, that the end of the economic recession, when it finally arrives, will bring a sharp rise in demand for aluminium, which responds more quickly than other base metals to improvements in industrial and consumer confidence. The aluminium market held up well during the early stages of the present economic down swing and in 1991 western world consumption (excluding eastern Germany) totalled a record 14.95m tonnes. The trend in the second half of that year was already downwards, however, and the consumption figure was only 0.3 per cent up from 1990, compared with an average growth rate of 1.4 per cent in the period from 1979 to 1991, according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals. Things appeared to be looking up in the first quarter of this year with US economic indicators assuming an encouraging aspect and European car sales showing signs of recovery. It seemed then that the economic prognostications circulating a year earlier were coming belatedly to fulfilment. 'Early in 1991,' said Billiton in the May 1992 edition of its Aluminium Update publication, 'the consensus was that the English-speaking economies would begin to recover in the second half of the year.' But it gradually became apparent that the recession in those economies was more widely-based and would be more protracted than was first feared. 'Also,' added Billiton, 'the extent of the slowdowns in Japan and Germany have been more severe than had been expected earlier.' The small rise in 1992 western world consumption of aluminium Billiton was projecting at that time - to 15.2m tonnes from 15.05m tonnes in 1991 (both figures including eastern Germany) - was mainly attributable to 'continued expansion of the major non-mature economies, particularly those of the Pacific basin'. The 1992 consumption projection was left unchanged, as was the forecast for 1993 of 16.1m tonnes, in Billiton's late September market report. But the mood of the authors had changed from cautious optimism to qualified pessimism. In May they had suggested that the US economy was experiencing 'a recovery, albeit a slow one'; but by September they were forced to conclude that 'the US economy continues to stagnate'. Meanwhile in Japan, the report said, 'things seem to be going from bad to worse' (Marubeni recently forecast that the country's aluminium consumption would fall by 8 per cent this year); and in Germany, according to the Bundesbank, 'the western German economy is slowing down and an upturn in the depressed east is still some way away'. A somewhat less gloomy view was expressed in July by Anthony Bird Associates, the specialist aluminium consultancy. While admitting that 'the economic outlook is still dogged by the very poor state of consumer and industrial confidence, especially in the once-resilient German and Japanese economies', Bird argued that 'most of the fundamentals are sound', citing low interest rates ('at least outside Europe'), low inflation and subdued oil prices. It found further encouragement in the fact that heavy consumer destocking did not seem to have been a feature of the aluminium market's weakness in the second quarter of 1992. Bird also noted that aluminium's competitive position remained very strong 'in almost every market' at current depressed prices. It forecast demand growth in 1993 of 6.5 per cent, a little stronger than that suggested in the Billiton reports, followed by 3.8 per cent in 1994 and 3.2 per cent in 1995. Billiton, in its September report, agreed that the prospects for aluminium demand were somewhat brighter for next year. 'We believe that a period of sustained recovery will be under way in the first half,' it said, 'and that this will result in a sharp rise in demand, following several years of below trend growth.' But it questioned how quickly this would translate into higher prices. 'It could well be 1994 before the aluminium industry enjoys the full benefits of economic recovery,' Billiton said. In the longer term consumption prospects inevitably depend to some extent on the response of the market to changes in the supply/demand balance.</p>

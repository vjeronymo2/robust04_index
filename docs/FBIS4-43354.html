			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 15 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty  Organization issued an invitation to Russia Wednesday [15 June]  for "immediate" discussions aimed at defining the terms of  military cooperation between the two sides, a NATO spokesman  said.    He said it was up to Russia to choose who should represent  it  at the talks, diplomats in Brussels or a delegation from Moscow,  and added that the alliance was awaiting a response from Moscow.    The invitation was issued following a weekly meeting of  ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member countries.    "The North Atlantic Council decided to invite Russia to  begin  talks in Brussels immediately," the spokesman said.    Russia and NATO sketched out last Friday the form their  post-Cold War security relationship would take after months of  maneuvering and confusion.    NATO said it was prepared to give Russia special leeway in  negotiating the terms of military cooperation that would fall  under the alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.    Twenty countries have already joined the programme, but  Russia had been delaying its entry while it fought for special  terms.</p>

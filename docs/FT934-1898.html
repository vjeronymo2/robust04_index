			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Borne up by a strong spread of activities / A look at BAe as it continues its search for European partnerships and Asian joint ventures British Aerospace is in the throes of wide-ranging discussions with other aircraft manufacturers to establish a series of new European partnerships for turbopropeller and regional jet aircraft modelled on the European Airbus large airliner manufacturing consortium. These partnerships would complement rather than conflict with the company's efforts to negotiate joint ventures in the turboprop and regional jet sectors with emerging Asian aerospace industries in Indonesia and Taiwan. Although in recent months BAe has appeared intent on refocusing its aerospace activities on its profitable defence operations and on its 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, insisted that the company wanted to maintain a 'strong spread' of commercial aerospace activities. 'We need a good mix of civil and military businesses to get the necessary volume throughput to remain a leading competitor,' he said. He argued that BAe's military aircraft business could not survive without the company's activities in Airbus and other commercial aircraft programmes which were providing work for BAe's military facilities. BAe has continued to lose money on its commercial aerospace activities with the biggest losses this year in its turbopropeller business which has now been regrouped at Prestwick in Scotland. In the first half of this year, the commercial aircraft operations made an operating loss of Pounds 81m compared with Pounds 286m. Turboprops accounted for about Pounds 60m of the loss. The Airbus activities also made a small loss, while the regional jet business operated close to break-even after the Pounds 1bn provision made in 1992. BAe now sees the longer term future of its turboprop and regional jet activities as part of a broader restructuring of the European commercial aerospace industry. The company would like to see strong European partnerships in both the turboprop and regional jet businesses in which it would hold a minority stake. For BAe, the most encouraging prospects appear to centre on a rationalisation of the European turboprop sector. BAe has been holding talks with Aerospatiale, its French Airbus partner, over possible collaboration in turboprops. Aerospatiale and BAe have also held separate talks with Casa, the Spanish Airbus partner. Discussions have also been held between BAe and Saab and the Canadian Bombardier group, which owns Shorts of Belfast and de Havilland, the turboprop manufacturer. 'For the first time, there really is a seriousness developing in these talks: I am confident something positive will happen,' said Mr Evans. BAe has signed an agreement with Indonesia to explore collaboration in the turboprop business. It believes it cannot turn its back on the emerging Asian aerospace industries but sees co-operation with countries like Indonesia focused on specific projects rather than on a broad front. In Europe Mr Evans sees an opportunity of integrating scattered manufacturing assets to rationalise the sector. In the regional jet sector, BAe has not altogether given up hope of a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace. But the protracted and now stalled negotiations have cast doubts on the much publicised venture. Meanwhile, BAe has decided to pursue its regional jet activities on its own while considering other collaborative options in the event of the Taiwan deal finally collapsing. BAe believes the most rational alternative would be co-operation with Fokker, the Dutch regional jet manufacturer taken over this year by Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group. BAe attempted to negotiate a partnership with Fokker three years ago. Although the talks broke down in part because of competing product lines, there is a compelling argument for the two companies to form the nucleus of a European regional jet consortium modelled on Airbus. Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz chairman, suggested he would welcome closer collaboration between Deutsche Aerospace and BAe on regional aircraft programmes. Mr Reuter said 'we are still meeting, we are still discussing'. But it is on Airbus that BAe is pinning its long-term hopes in the commercial sector. 'We've got an opportunity to turn Airbus in turnover terms into one of, if not the, biggest company in Europe by the end of the decade,' Mr Evans said. Airbus , however, was now facing a growing challenge from Boeing, its main US rival. 'Boeing has woken up late in the day to the threat of Airbus and is now working to reduce the cost of its products and its production cycle times.' Mr Evans believes Airbus has even bigger opportunities to reduce its costs than Boeing. 'If Boeing manages to cut its costs by 25 per cent we should be able to reduce Airbus costs by 40 per cent if we can harness efficiently all the assets.' The immediate issue was not transforming Airbus into a public limited company. 'A plc is no panacea, it's a catch phrase,' he argued. Instead, the big challenge was to give Airbus more control of the assets deployed in the airliner business by its four partners including BAe, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa. BAe has still not broken even on its investment in Airbus. However, Mr Evans expected the business to become more profitable as its volume of activity grew. 'But we can't sit back and ignore the new competitive pressures facing Airbus. We've got to find ways to move it forward. And I think we will in the end set up an Airbus aerostructures company which will be completely under Airbus control.' That could ultimately also be the way ahead for the troubled European turboprop and regional jet industries.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal buys control of Lanvin L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, has taken control of Lanvin, one of France's oldest fashion and perfume houses, by buying part of the stake owned by Orcofi, the luxury goods concern controlled by the Vuitton family. Orcofi, which has since 1989 shared the ownership of Lanvin with L'Oreal, agreed to sell a 16 per cent stake, reducing its own holding to 34 per cent. L'Oreal will control Lanvin with a 66 per cent majority holding. L'Oreal and Orcofi acquired Lanvin in 1989. They immediately embarked on an ambitious investment programme to relaunch the company, in the hope of revitalising its brand name in the then-buoyant up-market fashion and beauty business. However, the luxury goods market has since been depressed by the recession. Lanvin has incurred heavy losses, and is understood to have sustained net deficits of around FFr150m (Dollars 28.7m), including restructuring costs, in 1992 and 1993. Mr Michel Pietrini, the former Chanel executive who orchestrated the relaunch, left Lanvin last year to be replaced by Mr Loik Armand, a L'Oreal executive. The new management has since cut costs and restructured the business.</p>

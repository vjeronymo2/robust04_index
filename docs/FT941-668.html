			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: British Land Mr John Ritblat is making steady progress through the Pounds 1bn honey-pot that is the British Land-Quantum property fund. With around 40 per cent of the fund invested following yesterday's Pounds 128m acquisition from Royal Insurance, there is no immediate pressure to come up with the next deal. The snag is that so many institutional investors have rediscovered a taste for property since Quantum arrived on the scene last summer. Royal is a rare seller, having decided that its capital would be better invested in more liquid assets. While most life insurance and pension funds are net buyers, though, there are precious few bargains to be had. The price paid yesterday for the old Sterling Estates portfolio is hardly cheap. A yield of around 8.2 per cent demands a lot from the rag-bag of retail, office and industrial space. Even allowing for some modest increase in rents, British Land will have to bring all its management and trading skills to bear. It is a measure of the stock market's faith that British Land has avoided the worst of the correction suffered by others in the sector this year. While Land Securities has underperformed by 12 per cent since the turn of the year, for example, British Land has merely tracked the falling equity market. Still, British Land is being coy about where the 2m shares which comprise part of yesterday's purchase price will come from. If Quantum is reducing its stake, other shareholders would have reason to take notice.</p>

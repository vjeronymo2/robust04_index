			<p>BFN     [Text] Armscor's [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive general manager, Mr. Tielman de Waal, says the defense  industry will have to depend on exports if it is to contribute  effectively to the maintenance of key industries and  technologies in the country.    Speaking at a quality symposium in Pretoria, he said arms  exports worth 1,000 million rands could create employment for  about 25,000 people. Mr. de Waal said Armscor's present  effectiveness and the demands of the new generation customer  would have to be considered to penetrate the export market  effectively.</p>

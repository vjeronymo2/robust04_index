			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA TO RETAIN ITS CONTRACTOR TO BAR ADDITIONAL DELAYS  </P> <P> Under criticism for moving too slowly to clean up polluted ground water in the  San Gabriel Valley, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to  keep its current contractor on the project to avoid further delays.  </P> <P> Daniel W. McGovern, EPA regional administrator, announced in a letter to Rep.  Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) that the firm CH2M Hill, which has been working  on the project since 1983, will be retained.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley water officials had protested a proposal by the EPA to  assign the project to another contractor, saying that time would be lost while  a new contractor's employees reviewed studies and other work already done.  </P> <P> "I am happy to inform you that after careful consideration of the situation,  EPA has made a final decision to continue to use CH2M Hill on the San Gabriel  project," McGovern said.  </P> <P> But although CH2M Hill will remain on the job, McGovern also said in the letter  that a comprehensive cleanup plan, which the consulting firm has been drafting  for the EPA, will not be unveiled to the public in July as promised at a  congressional hearing.  </P> <P> Torres, chairman of the House small business subcommittee on environment and  labor, conducted a hearing in Baldwin Park four weeks ago to examine EPA's work  on the San Gabriel Valley ground-water problem. The EPA told Torres at the  hearing that it would present a comprehensive cleanup plan to the public in  July.  </P> <P> But McGovern said in his letter that the public announcement of the plan will  not come until the end of the year.  </P> <P> McGovern said the EPA will first consult with local and state agencies to  develop agreement on a strategy.  </P> <P> "It is important that EPA give these agencies a meaningful opportunity to  comment on and reach consensus on the overall planning for the San Gabriel  Valley project," McGovern told Torres. "EPA hopes to use its draft plan as a  vehicle for reaching consensus and develop a plan that has mutual ownership."  </P> <P> "After we have worked with other agencies to refine our strategy," he said, "we  expect to release the plan to the public by the end of the year."  </P> <P> He said the agency also will hold a number of community meetings this summer  and fall "to explain this complex problem and our proposed strategy to the  public and to invite their input into the process."  </P> <P> After reading the letter, Torres said he was concerned about the EPA's decision  to delay the public release of its comprehensive strategy.  </P> <P> But, he said, the letter "is about what I expected. At least we've got their  attention and their commitment to address the severity of the problem."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved Too Slowly  </P> <P> Torres said he plans to continue to examine the EPA's performance with  additional hearings in Washington. Torres has complained that the EPA has moved  too slowly on the San Gabriel Valley ground-water problem, which was discovered  nearly 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Torres said the retention of CH2M Hill should eliminate a potential delay in  the project. The congressman said he has no preference for CH2M Hill over any  other contractor, but was concerned about the time that could be lost on the  job by making a change.  </P> <P> CH2M Hill, a consulting firm based in Corvallis, Ore., is one of several  contractors employed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program for  cleaning up toxic waste. Because of contractual limits on the amount of work it  can assign CH2M Hill, the EPA had considered using another contractor in the  San Gabriel Valley so that CH2M Hill could devote its time to other Superfund  projects.  </P> <P> At the congressional hearing, Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the Upper  San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, testified that "changing  contractors in mid-project can only result in significant time delays as one  contractor phases out and another gears up to take over. Vast amounts of  specific site experience will be lost in the change, and large expenditures  will be needed to educate the new engineering contractor."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good News  </P> <P> Berlien said last week that the decision to retain CH2M Hill is good news. "I'm  happy to see it," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, Berlien said, he was not surprised that the EPA has retreated  from its promise to deliver a comprehensive cleanup plan by July. He said it is  normal practice for the EPA to consult with other agencies before presenting  major proposals to the public.  </P> <P> EPA officials said they believe it is especially important that a consensus be  developed in this case because the federal Superfund alone cannot bear the  entire burden of controlling ground-water pollution in the San Gabriel Valley.  The EPA has estimated that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars and  decades of work to bring the pollution under control.  </P> <P> About one-fourth of the water wells in the San Gabriel Valley are contaminated  with cancer-causing solvents. However, by digging new and deeper wells,  blending contaminated water with purer water and installing treatment systems,  water agencies have managed to continue delivering drinking water that meets  state and federal standards.  </P> <P> Much of the EPA's work in the San Gabriel Valley so far has been devoted to  charting the extent of the contamination. In addition, the EPA has built a  system to treat water from two polluted wells owned by the Richwood Mutual  Water Co. in El Monte and is planning a $5.5-million system to treat water from  four wells owned by Suburban Water Systems in the Whittier Narrows area.  Construction of the Suburban system is scheduled to begin in September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Next Major Project  </P> <P> The EPA's next major project is developing a system to stop the spread of  contaminants from the Main San Gabriel Basin, which serves 1 million people,  southward through Whittier Narrows to the Central Basin, whose wells also serve  1 million people.  </P> <P> The Whittier Narrows plan will be circulated to state and local agencies this  month and released for public comment in the fall.  </P> <P> The comprehensive plan will outline various water treatment projects that  should be undertaken in the San Gabriel Valley and establish priorities. EPA  officials have already said that the list will be headed by treatment systems  in Azusa and Baldwin Park, which have the area's highest concentrations of  contaminated ground water.  </P></p>

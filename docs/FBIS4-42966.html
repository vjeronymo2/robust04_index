			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is continuing his  bilateral contacts with foreign ministers who are currently in  Istanbul for the North Atlantic Cooperation Council meetings.  This morning, Cetin met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    In a joint statement issued with Christopher, Cetin said  that  bilateral relations, the Cyprus problem, the oil pipeline, and  issues such as the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict were discussed  during the meeting. [passage omitted]    In a statement he issued later, Cetin declared that the U.S.  House of Representatives decision to cut aid to Turkey is  unacceptable.    [Begin Cetin recording] I informed Christopher that linking  25 percent of aid to certain conditions is unacceptable to the  Turkish public and the Turkish Government and that the U.S.  Administration must use the necessary influence in the coming  days to rectify this. I also expressed Turkey's satisfaction  that the request concerning 10 [word indistinct] planes has been  referred to the U.S. Congress. Moreover, we discussed the need  for the U.S. Administration to continue its efforts for the  positive conclusion of this matter in Congress. [end recording]    Cetin explained that in principle, Christopher was positive  about the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline issue, and the work on  this subject will continue in the coming days. The conflict  between Azerbaijan and Armenia was also discussed during the  talks, Cetin reported, adding that it would be wrong to take the  issue to platforms other than the CSCE.    Cetin later met with Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki  Haavisto. Bilateral political and economic relations were  discussed during the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of Serbia  Slobodan Milosevic today received president of the Srpska  republic Radovan Karadzic. They discussed the latest situation  in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the attempts by  international mediators and envoys to normalize the situation.    After the meeting, Karadzic said, in a brief statement to  correspondents, that the international community is now most  concerned by our break of relations with the United Nations. "We  will see whether our supreme command will make any changes to  that decision tomorrow," Karadzic added.    The Srpska republic president confirmed that tomorrow he  will  meet with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special  envoy, and that he will inform him about the supreme command's  position, which determines whether there will be any contacts  with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] civilian section.    Karadzic also commented on the latest situation on the  Bosnian front. According to him, the first day of good weather,  which had enabled U.S. NATO planes to fly "was used by the  Muslim forces to try to chase us away from the right bank of the  Drina River. They launched a new offensive from the left bank,  accross the bridges, against our forces. They probably expected  support from U.S. planes," he added. As far as Doboj is  concerned it was permanently shelled, and there are losses among  civilians, Karadzic commented.    The Muslim offensive is now under way practically on all  fronts -- near Kupres, Srbobran, and Teslic. The strongest is  from Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo, to Ilijas. It is  an entirely Muslim offensive, Karadzic stressed. They pulled out  about 20,000 soldiers from Sarajevo. They were under an  obligation to keep these soldiers in Sarajevo, but they pulled  them out and deployed them on other fronts.    As for Tuzla Airport, cargo planes have been landing there  and delivering military equipment for days. "We warned them that  the airport was not open and that it would be opened exclusively  on the basis of our agreement with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev," Karadzic said.    Before this is agreed, the airport must not be used for  military purposes, but it must not be abused even after it is  opened. The airport can be used exclusively for humanitarian  purposes, the Srpska republic president stressed. "Two cargo  planes were preparing to land at Tuzla Airport today and we  warned them not to. I think this is better than shooting them  down."    Dwelling on the latest Russian proposals, conveyed to  President Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs by Russian envoy  Vitaliy Churkin, Karadzic confirmed that these proposals did  exist and that they could help bring about an overall peace, but  not a political solution at the same time. Only complete peace  could possibly lead to the speedy attainment of a political  solution. We will examine these proposals and we will see,  Karadzic said.    He urged a full cessation of hostilities throughout the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that he is against "a  partial cease-fire," because, as he said, "if they are attacking  us in Olovo we will attack them in all other areas." "We have  the right to conduct a defense and a counteroffensive in all  areas."    "We believe that an agreement on the cessation of  hostilities  ought to be concluded, but it should be understood that the  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are an act  of hostility, and if the hostilities cease, then the sanctions  should also be abolished," Karadzic concluded.</p>

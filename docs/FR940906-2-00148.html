			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is also need for technical assistance to regional projects on curriculum development for interpreters to serve deaf-blind individuals and on model methods of instruction for use in the training of interpreters. The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Be of national scope;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Concentrate on curriculum development for training interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind in order to improve the capabilities of regional projects;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Furnish technical assistance to the regional projects in training interpreters to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish cooperative relationships with the regional interpreter training projects to be funded by the Secretary in fiscal year 1995;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use collaborative training approaches, such as workshops and seminars, to address curriculum development, classroom training of interpreters, preparation of interpreter trainers (faculty development), and other activities that will increase the number of interpreters and the skills and knowledge of interpreters to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority 2_National Project to Address the Interpreting Needs of Culturally Diverse Communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A national project is needed that will provide technical assistance to interpreter training projects to improve the recruitment of interpreters who are minority group members and to improve the training of interpreters to better meet the special needs of minority individuals who are deaf or deaf-blind. This project would assist all other projects funded under this program in increasing their efforts in these areas and in better meeting the interpreting needs of different cultures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interpreter service needs of minority group individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing is an issue that has been raised nationally. An RSA-funded evaluation study reported that approximately 90 percent of graduates from the interpreter training programs around the country are White, while 4 percent are African-American and 5 percent are Hispanic. The National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf reported that, in a given year, of 2,057 interpreters certified by their registry, only 20 were non-White persons. A Health Interview Survey, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1990&hyph;91, reported that of the 20 million individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, 1.2 million are Afro-American and 900,000 are Hispanic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A national project is needed to concentrate on curriculum that will improve the skills of interpreters working with minority group members. Strategies for the recruitment of minority interpreters also need to be developed and made available to the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months.

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / The pulling power of Mexico: President Carlos Salinas visited the FT yesterday and gave a wide-ranging interview to Stephen Fidler THE first visit to Europe as head of state by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was a decisive moment in Mexican history. Discovering western Europe bound up in momentous events to the east, he worried that, in a world where there was increasing demand for scarce capital, Mexico would be shut out. A few months later, in early 1990, Mr Salinas announced a 180-degree turn in policy, declaring he would seek a free trade agreement with the US and Canada. In doing so, he tied Mexico's economic future ever more inextricably with that of its northern neighbour. Back in Europe now, more than two years later, Mr Salinas still worries about the scarcity of capital and the prospect that resources will be sucked into eastern and central Europe. 'The awareness of massive migration will mean that you (western Europeans) will channel more resources to central and eastern Europe, even though they don't seem to be very profitable,' he said in an interview in London yesterday. But these days he worries less. The prospects of a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) mean, he says, his country has attracted in three years the amount of foreign investment it was expecting in six. Some 60 per cent of foreign direct investment is coming from the US, but a substantial amount is coming from Europe, especially Germany and Britain. The Mexican finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe, notes that gross capital inflows last year to Mexico were Dollars 22bn, compared with the promised - but certainly not disbursed - Dollars 24bn of official help for the Soviet Union. As an illustration that foreign interest is continuing, Mexico's securities commission, on which Mr Aspe sits, will consider next week applications for 18 strategic alliances, including cross-shareholdings, of Mexican and foreign companies. The president remains resolutely upbeat about Nafta, despite the protracted nature of the negotiations. It is, he says, coming along well. His meeting nine days ago with President George Bush in California confirmed the commitment of the US administration to the accord. The chief trade negotiators of Mexico, Canada and the US are to meet on Saturday to attempt to start the final phase of negotiations. Mr Salinas says work is still needed in a number of sectors, including the automobile industry, textiles, agriculture, and energy. What will result, he says, is a pact compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) that will offer incentives to other countries in the region to pursue similar accords. Mexico, he insists, is not turning its back on Latin America by seeking Nafta. By the time Nafta is implemented, it will merely reinforce what are already strengthening economic relations with the US. Mr Salinas's economic priority remains the conquest of inflation. Mr Aspe confirmed yesterday an inflation forecast of 10 per cent for this year, sufficient to avoid a big loss of competitiveness for Mexican industry. (He expects Mexican productivity to increase 5 per cent this year - four percentage points greater than the US. A 3 per cent crawling devaluation of the peso will account for much of the rest of the differential with the US inflation rate of 3 per cent.) The economy, Mr Aspe said, continues to grow at double the rate of population increase, as it has in the last three years, which suggests continued faith in the forecast of 3-4 per cent growth this year. President Salinas remains sanguine about Mexico's growing current account deficit - forecast at Dollars 15bn or 5 per cent of GDP this year. He is dismissive, too, of the jitters in the country's financial markets over the last four weeks, caused in part by worries about the apparent hostility to Nafta expressed by Mr Ross Perot, until last week a prospective US presidential candidate. The worries, says Mr Salinas, were unfounded even before Mr Perot withdrew from the campaign. The latter, he says, had assured the Mexican president privately that he was not opposed to Nafta, although he could not say so in public. As to the current account deficit, Mr Aspe reiterated that it is a healthy sign for a developing economy, not a danger signal. It was, he said, a result of private sector activity and not caused by the government, which was running a budget surplus, before substantial privatisation receipts, of 1 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Privatisations were allowing the government to retire some domestic debt (now at the relatively low level of 13 per cent of GDP) and, with the money saved on servicing that debt, it has been able to expand spending on social programmes - essential to the success of its economic programme - by 70 per cent in three years. Exports expanded at 16.8 per cent in the first five months of the year, five times faster than the economy as a whole, while imports have been growing at 22 per cent. However, consumer goods imports have been expanding less rapidly - by about 12 per cent, said Mr Aspe - while intermediate goods imports have risen by 45 per cent. The one area where Mr Salinas is often accused of not being radical enough is in reforming Mexico's political system, which his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has dominated for 65 years. The president insists he is committed to further political reform, both of the PRI and of other parties, but there are clear limits. But is the PRI really prepared to contemplate alternation of power? Gubernatorial elections in the states of Chihuahua and Michoacan this month showed, says Mr Salinas, that the possibility of alternating governments already exists at a regional level after the victory of the right-wing National Action Party (PAN) in Chihuahua. On allegations that the PRI hugely outspent its opponents in Michoacan, Mr Salinas says a change is required to place legal limits on election spending: 'We will have to go towards reform in terms of putting ceilings on high spending and make election financing more transparent.' The Mexican president says his main task is to make sure the broad process of reform 'takes root in Mexican society and is part of the social consensus we have been building.' He knows this will take time, which is perhaps why he remains evasive on fundamental questions of political reform, such as possible change to the secretive system by which a president chooses his successor. 'It's too early to talk about that,' he says, aware that his six-year term will run until late-1994.</p>

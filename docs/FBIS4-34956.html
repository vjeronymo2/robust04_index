			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- U.S. Congressman Ronald V.  Dellums, from California, has expressed support for the mission  of the group "Freedom to Travel," which has defied U.S.  restrictions impeding U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba.    During a news conference today in this capital, Medea  Benjamin, the group spokesperson, read a letter from Delluns in  which he views as unconstitutional and senseless the limitations  on travel to Cuba.    The letter reads: "I greet with clear understanding those  who visit Cuba, and I reject the official White House policy. I  join you in the continuous legislative efforts made to lift this  historic Cold War foolishness, and I bid all of you success."    According to U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who visit Havana  without a special permit may be fined up to $250,000 or face  10-year prison sentences for violating the 1917 Trading With the  Enemy Law and the economic blockade imposed on Cuba more than  three decades ago.    Benjamin said the note, which she views as unusual from a  representative of the U.S. Congress, reached her two days after  the Treasury Department froze a $43,000-account established to  cover expenditures of the project.    The letter reads: Our prohibition policy toward Cuba harms  us, and it harms the island much more. The letter calls for a  strengthening of the ties of friendship and cooperation between  the two countries.    According to Benjamin, Delluns said the U.S. media welcomed  the recent lifting of the restrictions on travel to and trading  with Vietnam, and she called for the adoption of similar actions  regarding Cuba.    The letter reads: We are definitely engaged in a post-Cold  War struggle, and we support our old enemies now, as in the case  of Russia.    Delluns views the Freedom to Travel Movement's 90-mile trip  to Cuba as an act of courage. The trip, she said, is a  manifestation of the desire of the two nations (Cuban and the  United States) to establish communication and to learn from each  other.</p>

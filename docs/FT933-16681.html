			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / People: Eats at Henderson Dick Eats, who resigned as managing director of GT Unit Managers a year ago, has resurfaced at a similar job at its bigger rival Henderson Administration. He joins next week as managing director of the unit trust company, reporting to Paul Manduca, who is chairman of the retail division and deputy managing director of the group. Following Henderson's acquisition of Touche Remnant, group managing director Jeremy Edwards says he had had Graham Kane, from the Touche side, in mind for the job but the latter left for Morgan Grenfell. The group had earlier lost Henderson's Robin Berrill. Eats, 47, has gathered some twenty years' experience in the unit trust industry. He joined GT in 1985, initially as marketing director. Former GT colleagues say his departure was hastened because the requirements of the job had changed; the group perceived a need for someone with sales as well as marketing skills, the latter being Eats' forte. Edwards says the rationalisation of the two separate unit trust operations is well under way, with the process set to be completed, subject to unit holders' approval, by mid September, so that Eats' chief task will be 'to market these funds to a broad audience'.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: County Hall soft option Sir, County Hall has been sold to the Japanese for Pounds 60m. Further substantial sums will be expended converting it into a hotel, apartments and conference facilities. If the sale stands, overseas funds will be injected into Britain, employment will be created and the building and hospitality businesses will benefit. All, one might think, desirable ends in these difficult times. However, it is reported that if Labour forms the next government it will cancel the sale and install its planned 'slimline' Greater London Authority in County Hall. If the objective of creating a GLA is efficient, forward-looking government for London, why set it up in an antiquated, inefficient building requiring costly and time-consuming renovation? Such a course seems peculiar, bearing in mind the wide choice of high quality offices available in London. Presumably, this is an example of the soft-headed economic decision-making the country can look forward to if Labour prevails next Thursday. Christopher Burt, 92 Rue de l'Aqueduc, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

The spokesman made the remark when asked to comment on the  February 5 incident, in which an exploded shell in Sarajevo  wounded and killed hundreds of people.    Noting that the grave incident has shocked and enraged the  international community, he said "We strongly condemn this  atrocity", and that the fundamental way out in bringing the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end lies in political  solution.    "We appeal to the parties concerned in Bosnia-Herzegovina to  immediately stop all hostilities, and settle their differences  properly through earnest negotiations so as to lift the people  in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the scourge of war at an early date",  the spokesman said.</p>

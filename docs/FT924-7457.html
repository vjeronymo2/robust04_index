			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Pressure grows for lenders to pass on rate cut BRITAIN'S banks and building societies were under pressure last night from the government to help revive the economy by passing on the whole of last week's base rate cut to mortgage holders and small businesses. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would ask the Bank of England to examine allegations that banks were not fully passing on rate cuts to customers. He was speaking after pressing building societies to cut mortgage rates further at a meeting yesterday morning. The chancellor told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee yesterday he would also ask the chairmen of the clearing banks about their policy after the number of complaints about high bank interest rates had increased in recent weeks. Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night joined the effort designed to put pressure on the banks to reduce business lending rates by emphasising the 'huge' potential boost to industry these would provide. Speaking at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Major said the base rate cut would remove Pounds 1bn from industry's costs. But he added: 'Provided it is passed on to borrowers, to small businesses as well as large, as I trust it will be.' Barclays and National Westminster, the two largest lenders to small businesses, conceded that the margin between the base rate and the average lending rate they charge small businesses had risen over the past 18 months. The banks say the higher rates reflect the increased risk of lending in the recession. Lord Alexander, National Westminster Bank chairman, last night responded to the criticism. He said the bank had passed on to business customers the full benefits of the base rate cuts immediately, as it had said it would do last week. Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said building societies had to widen margins to respond to growing levels of bad debt in the housing market. Nevertheless, Mr Lamont's intervention is likely to renew strains between banks and the government over lending policy. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, criticised bank lending policy. He said the government should publish a table of rates charged by banks, and warn them that they could face an inquiry if they did not cut rates. The Halifax Building Society yesterday announced it was cutting its basic mortgage rate by 0.74 of a percentage point to 8.55 per cent. The new rate will take effect for its existing 1.8m borrowers from January 1. Whipping boys, Page 8 Letters, Page 19 Lex, Page 20</p>

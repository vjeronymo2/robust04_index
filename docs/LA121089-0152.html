			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ALUMNI, UZELAC UPSET BY NAVY LOSSES TO DIVISION 1-AA SCHOOLS  </P> <P> When Harry Dietz arrived at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium for the game  against James Madison on Oct. 28, the former Navy quarterback expected a  festive crowd, an exciting game and -- of course -- a Navy win.  </P> <P> He came to the game frustrated by six straight losing seasons. But it was  homecoming, which made the 24-20 loss by the Midshipmen to the Division I-AA  foe harder to swallow.  </P> <P> "I think the loss to James Madison was the lowest point of Navy football in the  history of the school," said Dietz, who played for Navy in 1960. "There's no  way the Naval Academy should lose to a James Madison or a Delaware.  </P> <P> "Those teams should play close games, but Navy shouldn't lose. Instead, these  teams dominate Navy."  </P> <P> It's been that kind of a season for the Midshipmen, a year that marked the  first sweep of Navy by I-AA opponents. Losses to Notre Dame, Pittsburgh and  Syracuse are to be expected, but dropping games to The Citadel (14-10), James  Madison (24-20) and Delaware (10-9) -- all I-AA opponents -- have put a damper  on a season that, in August, Coach Elliot Uzelac looked to with a lot of  promise.  </P> <P> But Navy's final game is not just a season closer for a losing team -- it's an  event. The Midshipmen (2-8) battle Army on Saturday and, with a sold-out crowd  at Giants Stadium and a national television audience looking on, Uzelac  possibly can rid himself of this season's many disappointments with a win over  the Cadets (6-4).  </P> <P> A loss would make it four straight to Army, something Navy hasn't done since it  dropped its fourth straight to the Cadets in the 1947 season.  </P> <P> "I told them (after the Delaware loss) it doesn't really matter what you do in  the season -- 8 and 2 or 2 and 8 -- when you're preparing for a game like  this," Uzelac said. "It's a new season, and it's like having three weeks in  preparation for the first game."  </P> <P> "For us to build for Army, it's like us starting over again," he added. "I told  them Delaware is behind them, the whole 1989 season is behind them. Now it's  only Army."  </P> <P> It would have been a lot easier for Uzelac going into the game 5-5. In those  three losses to the I-AA schools, the Midshipmen fumbled the ball inside the  10-yard line in each game -- the three losses were by a total of nine points.  </P> <P> "If you keep doing enough things wrong," Uzelac said, "if you don't make the  plays, the other team's confidence builds and you get socked. (Navy) is a  better team then the record indicates; I know they are."  </P> <P> Better in Uzelac's eyes, but Joe Bellino, the Navy halfback who won the Heisman  Trophy in 1960, said recent teams have lacked spark.  </P> <P> "I'm never disappointed when Navy loses to Air Force or Army," Bellino said.  "But it's frustrating to see us loss to teams like Delaware and James Madison,  which would normally be sure wins.  </P> <P> "Losing may be an indication of the intensity that hasn't been there the last  few years," he said. "When I was there, we used to win those games."  </P> <P> Before the start of the season, Uzelac said it was not unrealistic to have a  winning season, that it was conceivable the Midshipmen could be host in the  Liberty Bowl (which Air Force is doing, by winning the Commander-in-Chief's  Trophy) and that the team was within two years of being on equal ground with  Army and Air Force.  </P> <P> But, somewhere, those expectations bottomed out.  </P> <P> "I expected a lot before the year, but I felt we were not out of the woods  yet," Uzelac said. "I felt we would be a much better team. I did not expect  this.  </P> <P> "Some of my worst fears came true that the schedule did create some injuries.  At some key times, that hurt us. But we still have to play over those. We were  not good enough to do that. In my opinion, it's been a bad season."  </P> <P> After being blown out by Brigham Young (31-10), the Midshipmen lost at home,  14-10, to The Citadel -- the second straight year the Division I-AA school has  beaten Navy. They squeaked by North Carolina (12-10) in Chapel Hill, N.C.,  before losing two straight to Air Force (35-7) and Pittsburgh (31-14). The only  other win was also on the road against Boston College (27-24), a game that  appeared to turn the season around. But four straight losses followed to James  Madison (24-20), Notre Dame (41-0), Syracuse (38-17) and Delaware (10-9), when  kicker Frank Schenk missed a 28-yard field goal with time running out.  </P> <P> The 2-8 record is a far cry from where Uzelac said he would be at the end of  his third year when he took the Navy job in January 1987, replacing Gary  Tranquill, who was 3-8 in 1986.  </P> <P> "I felt strongly the very worst we should have been this year was 5-6," he  said. "I thought we would win 7 or 8 at the best, depending on how lucky we  were. But we also had some unanswered questions about our team."  </P> <P> Uzelac, who came to Navy in 1987 after spending four years as an assistant  under Bo Schembechler at Michigan, said he has not felt any pressure from  alumni or administration at any time this season.  </P> <P> "No one has said anything about that," Uzelac said. "The pressure I've felt has  been self-inflicted by me."  </P> <P> When asked whether there is any concern about the coaching situation, Jack  Lengyel, Navy's athletic director, replied, "We are very confident in our  coaching situation, and our main concern now is beating Army."  </P> <P> Uzelac said some changes will have to be made, and he hopes to address those  problems as soon as the season is completed.  </P></p>

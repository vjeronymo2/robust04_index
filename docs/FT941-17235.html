			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japan to allow share buybacks The Japanese government is next month expected to detail new rules allowing companies to buy their own shares, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. A plunge in Japanese share values in 1992 prompted the government to consider changes in the commercial code to reduce the extra supply of shares on the Tokyo market. The Tokyo stock market saw the number of shares surge during the late 1980s, as corporations raised funds through rights issues and equity-linked instruments. The government wants to make legal changes for implementation from next April.</p>

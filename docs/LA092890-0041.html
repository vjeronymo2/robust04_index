			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: O'TOTO: NO ECLECTIC WANNA-BE  </P> <P> More adventures in eclecticism: goat cheese flan with a smidge of grilled  Japanese eggplant; ravioli filled with a puree of butternut squash, fontina  cheese and nasturtium petals. This may be the stuff of California cuisine in  the '90s.  </P> <P> In the case of the newly opened O'toto -- the Zen-minimalist space was blessed  by a Buddhist monk -- and its chef, Jeanette Holley, the cultural mix-and-match  game mostly makes sense. Unlike most eclectic wanna-bes, Holley, who was raised  in Japan and Korea, seems to understand the Asian cuisines that influence much  of her food. She doesn't clutter up dishes with a lot of ingredients.  </P> <P> In her take on the classic Thai papaya salad, she uses fresh shrimp instead of  dried, and she tones down the chile. Her version is more a salad than a  drinking snack. At lunch, there's an interesting-sounding salad made with fried  chicken, black-eyed peas and hush puppies.  </P> <P> Not everything works -- O'toto is still very new. One brave choice that does:  simmered beef tongue with epazote black beans.  </P> <P>  O'toto, 7119 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 937-5435. Entree prices,  $7.95-$16.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political worries push Italian lira to record low Continuing political turmoil in Italy yesterday drove the lira to fresh lows on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith. The lira set a low of L1,047.90 against the D-Mark in European trading, but the market was unable to sustain this move. It recovered to close in London at L1,046. Aside from the lira, where analysts anyway reported more talk than action, it was a case of 'pre-Christmas' trading  - the euphemism for long lunches and little business. Insofar as traders were able to raise their heads from the Christmas pudding, there was little incentive to trade ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee in Washington. Expectations that the FOMC might sanction higher rates have receded recently, but not disappeared. Sterling traded in a very narrow range of about  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, and 0.3 cents against the dollar. The trade weighted index stayed at 80.4 all day. The pound closed at DM2.4571, from DM2.4561, and at Dollars 1.5613 from Dollars 1.5630. The dollar had a very quiet day ahead of the FOMC meeting, ending at DM1.5738, from DM1.5714, and Y100.155 from Y100.15. It finished in New York at DM1.5733 and Y100.13. The catalyst for further lira weakness was the heightened efforts from the Northern League, coalition partner of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, to topple the government in a no confidence vote later this week. There is now a widespread expectation that the lira will weaken to L1,050 before it recovers. Although politics is the current focus, failure to tackle structural problems in the budget, including rising debt servicing costs, also provide economic reasons for currency weakness. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, commented: 'Normally at this stage of a political crisis in Italy you might look for the currency to strengthen. People begin to emphasise positive elements of the new stage that is about to begin.' On this occasion, however, the problem lies in trying to assess the likely shape, and efficacy, of any future coalition, should the government fall. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said: 'It looks as if the foreign exchanges have fully discounted this political chaos . . . lira bears may find it better to travel than arrive as far as the confidence vote is concerned.' All eyes will be on the US Fed today. While some benign recent price data have allowed markets to relax, there is still room for the Fed to take a different view. This is based on evidence of strong credit growth, and buoyant retail and auto sales. Consumer credit outstanding rose by Dollars 11.6bn in October (up nearly 16 per cent, year on year) and has been rising without interruption for two years. Some observers have cited two other possible reasons why the Fed might stand firm: the possibility that further tightening could, in the wake of the Orange County episode, cause systemic municipal default; and that it might precipitate a stock market crash. These arguments are dismissed by Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, as 'far from compelling'. He said: 'It would be imprudent to alter policy in order to bolster unsustainable bond market positions.' He argued that the Fed might also welcome a stock market reversal that had a dampening effect on the recovery. Mr Cocker said the odds against a rate rise were probably 65:35. He added that the Fed was in a difficult position. Although there were few signs of inflation, economic growth was clearly buoyant. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, remarked: 'Given the November tightening in policy was the most aggressive since 1981, plus the short period since the last FOMC meet, the US authorities are likely to want more time to determine the effectiveness of the 250 basis-point tightening in rates so far this year.' Mr Cocker said the dollar had limited downside if rates did not rise. Given the prevailing positive sentiment, the market would simply reason that rates would be increased at the next FOMC meeting. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 550m shortage in its daily money market operations, mostly through late assistance.</p>

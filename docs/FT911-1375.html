			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Call for ban on tying in services to mortgages THE LAW Society has called on the government to impose a market-wide ban on the tying-in of financial services to residential property loans. The society says a ban would promote competition between financial institutions, which from next year will be able to provide conveyancing services to their borrowers, and protect consumers by offering them a choice in selecting the different ser-vices needed to buy or sell a house. The government proposes, under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, to allow the tying-in of services provided consumers are given written cautions. The society says this 'half-hearted approach' gives consumers no clear rights to buy their mortgage, insurance, estate agency and conveyancing services from separate providers at separately identified prices. The government's approach focuses on the timing and content of the written cautions. The society says that if this system is adopted, the warning notice should be given to to mortgage applicants with their application form and not after the application has been completed. Mr Walter Merricks, the society's head of communications, accused the government yesterday of shamefully abandoning the interests of consumers and giving in to pressure from the large lending institutions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A. Damovski: "Tranquilization of Coalition </F> Relations"]    [Text] An informal meeting was held three days ago [21  February] in response to a message from Djeladin Murati, PDP  [Party for Democratic Prosperity] president, to Prime Minister  Crvenkovski, in which he asked for an urgent government session  with the participation of the PDP ministerial group. The  meeting was attended by Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, Prime Minister  Branko Crvenkovski, Parliamentary Chairman Stojan Andov,  together with the parliamentary vice chairmen, [Interior]  Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, and Risto Ivanov, and the PDP  ministerial group. According to all the information available,  the misunderstandings in the government coalition were overcome  at this meeting.    Let us recall: In his letter to Prime Minister Crvenkovski,  Djeladin Murati said that he had learned that the authorities  had started a game of dishonest obstruction against the PDP  group so as to conceal its approach to the new group from the  other congress (Menduh Taci's group), and to hide the support  that it was giving to it. The aim was, Murati said in his  letter, to eliminate from political life and discredit Albanian  delegates and ministers in a perfidious way. Murati thought  that there were indications of Interior Ministry involvement,  and that if the facts were not examined, "it would be possible  to reexamine further activities within the institutions of the  system."    Amazingly soon after that, on the next working day, the  requested meeting was held and it was concluded that the PDP  would remain within the institutions of the system. As an  introduction to this conclusion, the visit of the Macedonian  state delegation to Albania was mentioned, and, understandably,  the alleged forcing of the split within the PDP.    As we know, minister-coordinator Bekir Zuta was a member of  the Macedonian delegation that made a recent official visit to  Tirana, and the Albanian side demanded his exclusion from the  discussions with Albanian President Sali Berisha. The PDP  leadership interpreted that as a kind of a shift in policy  toward their party.    The second subject discussed at the meeting was the opinion  expressed by the PDP about forcing Taci's position via the state  media (Taci's interview for Macedonian Television and AFP in  Albanian, the reports on the main newscast about the interview,  reports of telephone calls with Taci on the main newscast of  Macedonian Television, and the contribution of other journalists  to the party's division).    The PDP group also brought up the problem of granting  citizenship, as well as the great reservations demonstrated by  the Macedonian leadership concerning the behavior of the  Albanian Embassy in Macedonia, even going so far as to be  directly involved in supporting Menduh Taci's faction....    Nonetheless, a certain agreement was reached. There are no  more threats to abandon the coalition, the PDP is no longer so  upset, and an image is being projected among its membership that  their group is being consistent in its efforts to realize their  policy goals.</p>

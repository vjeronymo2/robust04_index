			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Observer: Bondage So how do these canny US hedge funds, which have been increasingly recognised as a powerful force in the world's financial markets, devise their trading strategies? Well, from the current US edition of Penthouse for starters. One fund has seized on the magazine's interview with Gennifer Flowers, the one-time cabaret singer who has been alleging that she had a 12-year affair with US presidential candidate Bill Clinton. The funds' traders wanted to know what view they should take of the US bond market in the event of a Clinton win. So they sent off to a professional psychoanalyst the 16-page article, during the course of which Flowers goes into fulsome detail about her alleged relationship. It was returned with the seminal conclusion that the Democratic candidate likes to be pushed around. And what does that mean for financial markets? A sell for bonds and good news for the stock market, of course.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Tories redraw post-election plans for BR sell-off HEAVILY revised plans for the privatisation of British Rail are likely to be published soon after the general election in the event of a Conservative victory. The plans, which have been agreed by ministers, represent a defeat for the approach favoured by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary. But details are unlikely to appear in the Conservative party manifesto for fear that they could lose more votes than they win. Instead, the manifesto will focus on the shorter-term objective of ending BR's statutory monopoly on railway services and encouraging the private sector to run trains in competition with BR. Since Mr Rifkind first announced plans to end BR's statutory monopoly several private-sector operators, such as Virgin Group, Orient-Express Hotels, Stagecoach Holdings and National Power, have expressed strong interest in running their own passenger or freight trains. The manifesto will stress that opening BR's tracks to these operators will bring an increase in the number of trains running on BR because existing services, including subsidised ones, will continue. A white paper preparing for privatisation was to have appeared by the end of last year but was held up by ministerial differences over the best way to proceed. The centrepiece of Mr Rifkind's much-leaked plan was a speedy sale of the profitable InterCity and Railfreight sectors complete with tracks and trains. Other ministers - notably Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary - argued that if companies operating trains also owned the tracks they would inevitably try to inhibit competition from other entrants. Mr Lilley and his allies have successfully argued that all BR's tracks should be put into the ownership of a single central body which will open them up to BR or any private-sector companies wanting to run trains on them. BR's four operating divisions - InterCity, Railfreight, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways - will then be sold to the private sector without their tracks as each becomes profitable. The four divisions' profits will be boosted by stripping out unprofitable but socially necessary services and putting them out to tender, with franchises going to whichever private operators require the smallest subsidy to operate them. Fair play between former BR operating divisions and new private-sector competitors will be supervised by a regulatory authority such as those already operating in the other former nationalised industries. Delaying publication of the plans until after the general election will avoid any embarrassing climbdown by Mr Rifkind, who faces a tough electoral battle to retain his marginal Edinburgh Pentlands seat. If he is re-elected, awkwardness could be avoided if he was given a new post in a cabinet reshuffle.</p>

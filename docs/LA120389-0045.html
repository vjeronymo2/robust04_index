			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN OF FETAL TISSUE EXPERIMENTATION NOT POSSIBLE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  </P> <P> Michael Schrage's opposition to fetal experimentation and the eventual  development of a market for fetal tissue to be used for medical purposes  ("Fetal Tissue Research Without a Transplant Marketplace," Nov. 9) does not  make sense. He does not advance any reason for restricting these activities  other than that he finds them personally distasteful, an argument that should  carry no weight whatsoever in a free country. Does he also propose to forbid  corneal and kidney transplants? Or does he believe that these are different in  some way? If so, he does not divulge his reasoning.  </P> <P> But these questions are moot in any case, because the federal government lacks  the power to do what he proposes. There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution  that would authorize such restrictions on the activities of our citizens, as  they would clearly fall outside the scope of the police power of the state,  having no relationship to the protection of life or property. In fact, they  would be destructive of both: the fetal tissue, and the lives of those who  would be denied the medical treatments using it.  </P> <P> The government can no more forbid the development of a market for fetal tissue,  because some -- even a majority -- find it distasteful, than it can for  automobiles, despite the desirability of promoting mass transit. Moreover, such  a ban would be unenforceable. The government could not implement such a ban  within the United States, let alone worldwide. If fetal tissue becomes a  desirable commodity, then it will be available -- one has only to look at the  multibillion-dollar market for anabolic steroids, most manufactured outside  this country, to understand this.  </P> <P> In short, not only would a ban on fetal experimentation and commercial  application be unconstitutional -- it would be futile.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY A.

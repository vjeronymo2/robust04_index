			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Lonrho and Bock; it's best to wait and see - The Bottom Line IF THERE has been one thing learnt by Lonrho shareholders over the years, it is never to be surprised. But this week's news that chief executive Tiny Rowland - who has, effectively, run the company for 31 years - was selling his stake to a German financier must have raised a few eyebrows. As one UK institutional shareholder explained: 'We do not approve of the deal with Dieter Bock. But . . . we have been in the dark about what is happening at Lonrho for some time.' Shareholders would love to get their hands on the financial information  - not in the public domain - that Bock's adviser, Morgan Grenfell, extracted from Lonrho. As a result, he is to underwrite half the 200m shares in the 3-for-10 rights issue at 85p a share; take up the rights of chief executive Tiny Rowland; and buy half Rowland's 15 per cent stake at 115p a share. Earlier this year, a number of shareholders asked for meetings with Lonrho after it unexpectedly reduced 1991's final dividend by 3p to 5p - the first cut in a decade. According to two institutional shareholders, there were 'frank exchanges.' In the end, it was agreed that Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, then Lonrho's joint broker, would act as a conduit between the company and shareholders. That arrangement broke down when Phillips &amp; Drew found it was equally in the dark. This happened when Lonrho, without prior warning, sold a one-third stake in the UK-based Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177.5m to the Libyan government. Phillips &amp; Drew resigned, leaving Societe Generale Strauss Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, to act alone. So, in order to make up their minds about the latest deal with Bock, shareholders have only the letter sent to them by Rowland. Having digested the contents, they indicated yesterday that they could not understand how the shares were worth 85p, let alone 115p. The shares closed last night 3p down at 72p. A major concern is the rise in net debt to Pounds 947m. Almost Pounds 100m of the borrowings were accounted-for by exchange adjustments to foreign currency borrowings due to the fall of sterling and motor trade operations. But there was also a significant increase in capital expenditure and it is understood this has continued to rise. Lonrho's decision to negotiate an early end to VAG, its Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operations in the UK, is good news for the balance sheet. The German car-maker, which had planned to take control of the business when the existing contract expires at the end of 1993, is paying Lonrho Pounds 124m to take it back early. This could save Lonrho around Pounds 15m in interest payments. It is bad news for the profit and loss account, though. Lonrho estimates that pre-tax profits for the year ended September 30 have fallen from Pounds 205m to Pounds 79m. Without VAG, which made profits of Pounds 25.6m, group profits (after the reduction of interest payments) could fall by another Pounds 10m. All of this means that an even bigger percentage of Lonrho's pre-tax profits will be generated from Africa. Last year, its operations there accounted for more than 70 per cent of the pre-tax profits. But, as one shareholder asked: 'What on earth does Bock know about the African operations?' Not much, according to one of Bock's advisers. Small shareholders should follow the lead of Lonrho's institutions and stay well clear of the rights. Bock has made clear that he will not be letting anyone know his game plan until after the rights issue closes on January 15. Investors may as well hold on to their shares until then to see if he has anything up his sleeve.</p>

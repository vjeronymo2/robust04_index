			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINES IDENTIFY VICTIM OF DESERT COPTER CRASH;  </P> <P> MILITARY: INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT, WHICH  OCCURRED ON A ROUTINE TRAINING FLIGHT.  </P> <P> A Tustin-based Marine Corps staff sergeant killed in a helicopter crash about  15 miles southeast of the Salton Sea during a routine training mission was  identified Sunday as a veteran crew chief who had received numerous  decorations.  </P> <P> Staff Sgt. James R. Andrews, 31, of Los Angeles was killed Saturday when the  CH-53D Sea Stallion he was riding in crashed in a remote part of the rugged  Imperial County desert, said Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, a spokesman for the  Tustin base.  </P> <P> Andrews, an expert trouble-shooter for the two-engine troop carrier, was not  part of the helicopter's five-man crew, but was riding as a passenger, Merrill  said.  </P> <P> Initially, the Marine Corps had reported that the five crew members were  injured in the crash that destroyed the helicopter. But Merrill said that after  examination at the El Centro Naval Air Station, crew members were found to be  shaken, but unhurt.  </P> <P> The uninjured crew members were flown four hours later to the Tustin facility,  where they were interviewed by crash investigators.  </P> <P> Officials identified the crewmen as: Capt. C.E. O'Connor, the pilot; 1st Lt.  M.A. Lowe, the co-pilot; Staff Sgt. D.G. Arriola, the crew chief, and Lance  Cpls. D.C. Cobor and R.M. Waggy.  </P> <P> "They are already home and with their loved ones," Merrill said.  </P> <P> Marine crash investigators were still unable Sunday to determine the exact  cause of the crash. Merrill said the crash site near Superstition Mountain, a  craggy peak of bare rock between the Salton Sea and El Centro, has been  cordoned off while investigators gathered evidence.  </P> <P> "Knowing the exact circumstances is all part of the investigation, including  why one person died and why five others weren't even hurt," Merrill said.  </P> <P> Merrill said Marine Corps officials were making funeral arrangements with  Andrews' wife, Nyla. A memorial service for the decorated 14-year-veteran was  to be scheduled for later in the week.  </P> <P> Andrews, who joined the Marine Corps in December, 1976, earned 10 medals,  including four Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, a Navy Unit Citation, a  Humanitarian Service Award and a Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, which is  awarded to Marines who are involved in military action, according to his  service record.  </P> <P> Merrill did not know if Andrews' medals were awarded for combat duty.  </P> <P> "He has seen more than the average Marine," Merrill said. "There are only so  many (Marines) that are involved in units that get those types of awards."  </P> <P> The helicopter was en route to its base in Tustin when it experienced  mechanical problems and finally crashed about 2 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> The chopper, attached to the Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363, Marine  Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, was left at the scene while  investigators pored over the debris for clues.  </P> <P> "It was a definite crash, not just a hard landing," Merrill said.  </P> <P> The crash was the 19th involving a Sea Stallion helicopter since 1980. More  than 80 servicemen have been killed in CH-53D accidents since 1984.  </P> <P> In Westmorland, a tiny settlement near the crash site, 73-year-old Chuck Havens  stared out the window of his dusty filling station and pointed toward  Superstition Mountain, explaining how the sky is often dotted with the  high-flying helicopters that do maneuvers in the unpopulated desert of Imperial  County.  </P> <P> "They go in that direction, over there," Havens said, squinting into the  afternoon sun.  </P> <P> He and other longtime Westmorland residents were not surprised to learn about  the crash. They remembered another military helicopter crash that occurred in  the area about a year ago.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG RADAR STATION BEING DISMANTLED  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has begun to dismantle its long-disputed Krasnoyarsk radar  station in a bid to clear the way for a strategic arms treaty, U.S. and Soviet  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President Bush in a letter last  September that the Soviet Union would take down the station in Siberia without  conditions. On Oct. 23, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze conceded  that the radar station, which is 30 stories high, was "a clear violation" of  the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.  </P> <P> A U.S. source said that only in recent days was there evidence that the process  of dismantling the radar had actually begun.  </P></p>

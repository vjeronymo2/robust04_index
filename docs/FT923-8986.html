			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson meets expectations with fall to Pounds 21.3m KLEINWORT Benson Group, the City merchant bank, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m in the six months to June 30, down from Pounds 24.7m in the first half of last year. Provisions for liabilities and charges were Pounds 21m against Pounds 22m at the end of last year. Specific banking provisions for the period were Pounds 15m compared to Pounds 29m in the same period a year ago. Net banking provisions were Pounds 2m, down from Pounds 19m. The provisions include Pounds 5.3m against a future fall in the costs of office space which will have to be let at a lower rent. The group balance sheet has grown to Pounds 9.99bn, up from Pounds 9.95bn at the end of last year. Share capital is unchanged at Pounds 32m. Mr David Peake, chairman, said that the results represented a substantial improvement in the performance of the financing division. He said that the bank was pleased with the lower level of provisioning. City stockbroker analysts said that the result was in line with expectations. 'They are a reasonably steady set of results compared to some that Kleinwort has produced in the last few years,' one analyst said. Kleinwort's loan book has fallen from Pounds 2.31bn at the end of last year to Pounds 2.15bn. The bank says the reduction has come entirely in corporate lending. Corporate finance, equities, and investment management were all unfavourably affected by poor market conditions. Merchant banking made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18m, down from Pounds 23.4m a year ago, while investment and private banking made Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 13.4m). Equities were said to have made a reasonable return on capital, but to have been below last year's levels. There was a retained profit of Pounds 7.2m, against Pounds 9.2m last time, and earnings per share slipped from 12.66p to 10.81p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 5.3p.</p>

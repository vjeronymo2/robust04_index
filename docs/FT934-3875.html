			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Mellon Bank buys fund manager Mellon Bank yesterday announced the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.2bn) takeover of Dreyfus, one of the US's largest mutual fund groups, marking the first large move by a bank into the booming funds business. Mr Frank Cahouet, chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based bank, predicted that the deal would provide a model for future convergence between the banking and mutual fund industries in the US. At present, banks account for only 8 per cent of mutual funds, though this figure will rise to 12 per cent if yesterday's deal is completed. The transaction is likely to intensify official concerns about the expansion of banks into investment management. Congress has expressed unease with growing bank sales of mutual funds, fearing that bank customers may not understand the investments they are buying or realise that the federal guarantee that applies to bank deposits does not extend to mutual funds. In an apparent attempt to play down such concerns, Mr Cahouet said the deal would add to the 'strength and diversity of the financial system'. Dreyfus was the sixth largest mutual funds group with Dollars 76.7bn under management at the end of October, down from Dollars 80bn a year before, according to the Investment Companies Institute. The company's historically strong position in short-term money market funds, at a time when investors have been shifting into longer-term equity and bond funds, account for its lack of growth. The all-share deal would dilute Mellon's earnings next year by around 9 per cent, accounting for a Dollars 4 3/8 fall in its share price yesterday morning, to Dollars 53. Both Mellon and Dreyfus predicted that revenues would grow faster after the deal. Mellon, with 1.1m customers, will sell Dreyfus investments, while Dreyfus expects to sell Mellon products such as credit cards and mortgages to its 900,000 customers. Earlier talks stalled over Dreyfus' concerns about the cultural effects of being taken over by a bank. These concerns seem to have been overcome as Dreyfus will continue to operate as an independent company within the Mellon group. Mellon embarked on acquisitions to increase its fee income after heavy losses in the 1980s. Mutual advantage, Page 25</p>

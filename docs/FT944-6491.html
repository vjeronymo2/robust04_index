			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: US investors use foreign voting rights US institutional shareholders are increasingly exercising their voting rights at non-US companies in which they have a stake, according to a new survey. Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), an organisation which monitors shareholder activity, said US institutional investors now vote at 71 per cent of all foreign companies in which they own a stake, compared with just 24 per cent in 1991. The survey was conducted among the 40 or 50 institutional investors who have more than Dollars 250bn under management. Ms Corinna Arnold, deputy director in charge of Global Shareholder Services at IRRC, said she believed the client base was fairly representative of US institutional investors, although IRRC clients are likely to be more concerned with corporate governance matters than other share-holders. During the summer, the US Department of Labor confirmed that US Erisa funds  -corporate pension schemes covered by US pensions legislation - have the same fiduciary duty to vote on matters at non-domestic companies, unless the costs of voting are prohibitive, as at US companies in which they have invested. US public sector pension schemes, among the largest such schemes, are not covered by the Erisa legislation but have taken their voting responsibilities seriously. Ms Maryellen Andersen, director of investor and corporate relations at the State of Connecticut Retirement and Trust Funds, said that in 1993, the scheme voted at 1,395 of the 2,300 foreign companies in which it holds a stake. Ms Andersen said the scheme has been able to vote in most markets because of the willingness of its custodian banks to help with the paperwork. 'We found the most effective way to ensure voting was to put pressure on the custodian,' she said. Ms Andersen said US pension schemes hold a relatively small stake in foreign markets, but they are making an impact on local boards of directors. 'They want our money. We have made it clear that we are interested in investing but we are also interested in voting. We don't really want to do one without the other,' she said.</p>

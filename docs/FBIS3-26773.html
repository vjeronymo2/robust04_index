It has been learned that army  authorities are currently evaluating the various aspects of the  system.    An official from the Chungshan Science Institute said the  newly developed multi-barrel rocket system for army artillery  resembles the current Kung-4 Rocket. It has been designed with  reference to the MLR system [MLRS] of the United States Army,  but built to meet the needs of the ROC. It has the capability  to inflict heavy casualties on an invading fleet and on any  enemy personnel who try to launch an offensive as they approach  shore.    The 12-barrel rocket launcher can be hooked up with radar,  computers, and a firing control vehicle to automatically  determine various firing positions and directions within a range  of 45 kilometers. It has a firing angle which covers from zero  to 60 degrees and a direction range of plus or minus 120  degrees, specifications which are superior to the MLRS range of  110 degrees which is used by the U.S. military. When fitted  with MK30 or MK40 rocket missile warheads, the unit is capable  of powerful penetration and inflicting heavy casualties.    A researcher from the institute said the aerial mine-laying  system had the advantage of being equipped with an automatic  control, and can carry out mine-laying operations with great  speed over a large area. According to on-the-spot testing  results, each sortie could cover an area up to 3,000 square  feet; and the anti-tank mine, which explodes within 30 seconds  of falling to the ground, can cause casualties to enemy tank  personnel within three meters of the mine, and pierce through  the six-inch base and caterpillar tracks of an armored car. The  system could, therefore, be effectively used to delay an enemy's  landing and advance, thereby serving as an anti-landing  operations weapon.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / National Power plans buy-back National Power, the UK electricity generating company, is set to soak up more than Pounds 500m of the government's forthcoming Pounds 2.5bn offer of the power company's shares through a buy-back plan announced yesterday. Through the purchase of up to 102.5m shares, National Power aims to use its enormous cash resources to boost earnings per share. It should also improve demand for the government share offer. PowerGen, its listed competitor, said it was considering a similar move, following recent buy-backs on the stock market. The UK government is due to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in both PowerGen and National Power in February. The National Power share buy-back would represent around 21 per cent of the government offer, and up to 8 per cent of its issued shares. The buy-back will come from the 295m shares that the Treasury had ear-marked for international institutions, but the international tranche should still amount to close to Pounds 1bn. National Power said the deal would result in an increase of between 3 and 4 per cent in its earnings per share, and that its dividend would be similarly increased. It plans to reduce its dividend cover, to allow further dividend increases. The company also announced a new Pounds 500m revolving credit facility, and unveiled significant board changes, including the appointment of Mr Keith Henry as chief executive. Its share price rose 7p to 511p yesterday, helped by the announcement of a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits before exceptional items to Pounds 241m, and a 16 per cent increase in dividends. PowerGen, which bought back 0.6 per cent of its shares earlier this year, said: 'We have had discussions with the Treasury. We are considering the possibility of further share buy-backs, but we are keeping all our options open.' Some institutions complained the share buy-back would be handled via the government offer, rather than through the stock market. Tax-exempt shareholders, such as pension fund managers, could claim a tax credit from the Inland Revenue if they sold their shares to the company through a buy-back scheme. By purchasing its shares from the Treasury, National Power has removed that opportunity. The purchase by National Power is subject to a clawback of up to 19.2m shares by the government, depending on demand from international institutions and the 'discretion' of the Treasury. National Power will pay the same price as international institutions, with a discount for paying up immediately, rather than in three instalments. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 21; People, Page 13</p>

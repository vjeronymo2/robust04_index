			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus delivered one  of the main addresses at today's World Economic Forum session in  Davos. Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports:    [Halousek] [Passage omitted] Addressing the working group on  the issues concerning the admission of new members to European  institutions, the Czech prime minister stressed that the future  status of Europe in the world does not depend so much on the  existence and activities of multilateral European institutions  as on the quality and structure of the political, social, and  economic systems in individual countries. In this context  Vaclav Klaus spoke in favor of abandoning bureaucratic measures  and unnecessary state interventions. He said that it is  necessary to build a Europe of citizens and not a Europe of  politicians. The Czech Republic, as well as all other Central  European countries, has always considered itself to be a part of  Europe and, thus, would not like to be deprived of advantages  ensuing from membership in European institutions. I firmly  believe, continued Vaclav Klaus, that my country has crossed  already the Rubicon between the two totally different political,  social, and economic systems, and that it is ready to take  further steps toward a reasonable European integration.  However, by this term I do not mean a total integration.    The Czech Republic does not want to be always the recipient  and it is prepared to offer something. According to Vaclav  Klaus, we are aware of the fact that we have to solve our  problems ourselves and we do not expect Europe to solve them for  us. [passage omitted]</p>

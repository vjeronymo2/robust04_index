			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: 'Bio-piracy' costs Third World Dollars 5.4bn a year 'Bio-piracy' is cheating developing countries and their indigenous peoples of Dollars 5.4bn a year, a UN-commissioned report*, published yesterday, claimed. This is the amount they would be entitled to in royalty payments if multinational food and drug companies paid for their plant varieties and local knowledge. The report puts the value of Third World plant species to the pharmaceutical industry alone at more than Dollars 30bn a year It says that while more than 90 per cent of the earth's remaining biological diversity is located in Africa, Asia and South America, indigenous communities receive no reward for the material and local knowledge taken from them. This inequity is exacerbated by growing use of patents granting exclusive protection to companies and researchers in industrialised countries for material and knowledge coming from the developing world. Citing the example of patented seed varieties derived from varieties bred by farmers, the report says 'indigenous farmers are finding themselves paying for the end product of their own genius'. The report, by Ottawa-based Rural Advancement Foundation International (Rafi) for the UN Development Programme, urges changes to rules governing ownership of biological materials and knowledge about them. Ms Sarah Timpson of UNDP says the UN body has begun consulting indigenous peoples' organisations on strategies to preserve traditional knowledge and prevent exploitation. The report cites more than 100 examples of developing country contributions to agriculture, food processing and pharmaceutical development in the rich nations. They include Bayer's synthetic aspirin, the most widely used drug in the world, which is derived from a traditional Arab medicinal plant, Spiraea; steroid hormones made by Syntex derived from barbasco roots from Mexico; and a streptomycin-based antibiotic isolated from Argentinian soil which Mitsubishi has patented as an additive for animal feeds. Admitting that piracy by developing countries of chemical and pharmaceutical patents may cost the industrialised world as much as Dollars 2.7bn a year, Rafi says this is far outweighed by the amount the Third World would be owed if it received just 2 per cent in royalties for global seed industry sales of Dollars 15bn, and 20 per cent for pharmaceutical products derived from indigenous plants. * Conserving indigenous knowledge: Integrating two systems of innovation.

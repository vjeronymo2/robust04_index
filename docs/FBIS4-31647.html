			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Mikuljanac: "Vojislav Seselj -- `Milosevic </F> Wants To Remove Karadzic'"]    [Text] The unification of the Srpska republic and the  republic of Serbian Krajina with Yugoslavia is not in Slobodan  Milosevic's interest as that would mean having 1.5 million  voters out of whom not even 100,000 would vote for him, Vojislav  Seselj, chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, said at a news  conference yesterday.    Seselj claims that Milosevic had constructed a plan  (supported by the West) for a four-month truce in Bosnia, so  that he could organize elections during that time and, with the  help of the State Security Service, secure Karadzic's defeat at  them. However, when it became clear to him that Karadzic cannot  be defeated at elections "even with tricks," Milosevic decided  in favor of a one-month truce and uninstitutional methods in  order to replace Karadzic, Seselj said.    The Radicals have nevertheless said that they support any  kind of truce, even a one-month one, although, according to  them, one should insist on a permanent cease-fire and a  separation at the achieved front lines.    Seselj sees the recent statement by [FRY President] Zoran  Lilic at the recent Trade Union meeting in Belgrade as proof  that a showdown between Milosevic and Karadzic is in the offing.  "With that statement, Lilic has weakened the Serbs' negotiating  positions in Geneva, so now he should be careful lest he  experience [Dobrica] Cosic's fate, as he has also been violating  the Constitution," Seselj said and added that "there is  absolutely no doubt that Lilic is in fact Milosevic's  mouthpiece."    Yesterday, the Radicals also distributed to journalists  photocopies of ("top secret") orders on handing over weapons  belonging to the Yugoslav People's Army's to the former Bosnian  Territorial Defense. According to these documents (and Seselj  claims that he has many more such papers), in September of 1991,  Generals Nikola Uzelac and Zivan Mircetic approved of several  hundred pieces of infantry weapons and the appropriate quantity  of ammunition being given over to territorial defense commands  in Bosanska Krupa, Cazin, and Velika Kladusa. Seselj claims  that these documents prove a direct involvement of the League of  Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia in arming the Muslims just  before the war broke out.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tokyo seats on offer at bargain price Smith New Court and Paribas Capital Markets International are front runners to buy seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at a knock-down price. It is expected that the two seats will change hands officially early next year. The seats for sale are those of Prudential Securities (Japan), the Tokyo arm of US-based Prudential Securities, and that of Kidder Peabody International. The US-based parent companies of the vendors have faced financial difficulties recently and are in the process of retrenchment. A seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last changed hands at Y1.1bn (Pounds 7m) when County NatWest sold its right, and it is expected that the buyers will pay less than Y1bn. All prospective buyers must be vetted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The prospective purchasers have both said they are interested in expanding their Japanese equities businesses. UK and US investors have been recently placing money in Japanese equities in expectation that economic activity there will soon pick up. Also, Tokyo Stock Exchange rules greatly disadvantage non-members which buy and sell shares on behalf of customers. Non-members must execute business through members, surrendering about 25 per cent of the commission they receive. SNC and Paribas will immediately see a rise in revenues if their bids to become members succeed. In late October, Smith New Court, which has held a branch licence in Tokyo since 1989, announced it was eager to purchase a seat on the Exchange. However, the Exchange had made clear that it did not intend to expand the number of seats beyond the existing 124. It could buy a seat only if an existing owner wished to surrender membership. Of those securities firms which own seats, 24 are non-Japanese, and of these, five are British.</p>

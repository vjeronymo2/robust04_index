			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Painting pinups on airplane nose cones is back in vogue at Castle Air Force  Base in California where a KC-135 Stratotanker sports a 1940s-era calendar  pinup in a midriff blouse and miniskirt rippling in the breeze. Castle Air  Force Base officials said the painting is designed to instill pride in the  crews that fly and maintain Strategic Air Command aircraft. A sketch of a  knight with a sword and shield mounted on a horse has already been approved for  decorating the nose of another Stratotanker. Plane art originated during World  War I when aircraft first assumed a major role in warfare, and reached its  zenith during World War II. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

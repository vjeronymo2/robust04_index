The military delegation  headed by General Pinochet arrived from Great Britain aboard a  British Airways plane at 1000 this morning.    During his visit to Europe, the Army commander visited  several weapons manufacturing companies. During these visits, he  had to face demonstrations opposing his visit. In our country,  some congressmen criticized him for using resources for a trip  of this nature.    Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma expects to receive a  report from Gen. Pinochet on his European trip.    [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] I will meet with Gen.  Pinochet  as soon as possible so he will have an opportunity to submit a  report.    [Unidentified reporter] What about the reactions of  officials  of the Czech and Netherlands Governments, and in other countries  he visited? What do you think of those reactions?    [Perez Yoma] We believe the trip was completely normal with  no setbacks whatsoever. There were some explainable journalistic  reactions that did not affect the trip whatsoever. I think the  trip was absolutely normal.    [Reporter] Isn't the government affected by reactions of the  Czech interior and defense ministers who said that...    [Perez Yoma, interrupting] I have no official report on  those  reactions. Therefore, I cannot answer your question.    [Reporter] The Czech interior minister said that it was a  mistake to grant a visa to Gen. Pinochet.    [Perez Yoma] I am unaware of such a statement. (end  recording]</p>

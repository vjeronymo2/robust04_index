			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C lifts net assets to Pounds 1.56bn - Successful investments during the year included emerging markets Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, founded 125 years ago and now the largest UK investment trust, increased its net assets by 31 per cent in 1993, from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 1.56bn. On a per share basis the rise was from 225.5p to 296.1p. The trust's share price advanced by 40 per cent over the period, compared with a 23 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Its performance was 2 per cent better than the average general investment trust over the year. A final dividend of 2.37p brings the total to 3.52p (3.35p), the 23rd consecutive increase. F&amp;C adopted a cautious approach to the enhanced scrip dividends paid by some companies last year, out of concern that distributing the proceeds could endanger its tax status. Scrip dividends were therefore excluded from the F&amp;C pay-out, but income from other sources, including bonds, was enough to offset this. Investment successes of the year included UK stock selection, emerging markets, and a policy of switching debt out of sterling into yen. Less successful was the fund's exposure to Japan, US growth stocks and pharmaceuticals. Mr John Sclater, chairman, said that progress at the same rate, which has almost doubled the trust's assets over three years, was unlikely. But he predicted a 'generally benign climate' for future equity investment. Assets at the year-end were distributed between the UK (44 per cent), North America (22 per cent), Europe (13.5 per cent), Japan (9.7 per cent), the Far East (7.5 per cent) and elsewhere (2.8 per cent). 'Prospects for revenue are better than they were a year ago,' said Mr Sclater. 'Dividends are rising in the UK and elsewhere and borrowing costs are low.' F&amp;C was the first trust to introduce a savings scheme 10 years ago, allowing small investors to invest a fixed amount a month. This factor has contributed to the increasing proportion of the trust's shares held by individuals - 46 per cent at the end of 1993, compared with 39 per cent at end-1992. F&amp;C had 74,911 shareholders at the end of 1993, a 32 per cent increase. Steady demand from the savings scheme also helped to narrow the discount to net asset value to about 1 per cent. The trust is planning a 1-for-1 scrip issue to bring the share price down from its current level of about Pounds 2.90 and to increase marketability.</p>

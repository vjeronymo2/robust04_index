			<p>BFN     [Text] Two 15-year-old Arab girls from Wadi al-Jawz tried  to stab policemen at the Western Wall plaza in Jerusalem, but  the policemen overcame them. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky  reports that the two apparently managed to enter the plaza armed  with knives despite the metal detector placed at the entrance.    Earlier, a knife-wielding youngster was arrested in East  Jerusalem as he approached a Border Police unit. Our  correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that when interrogated the  youngster he said he sought arrest because of a family feud.    A girl bearing a knife was arrested near the Cave of the  Patriarchs when she tried to stab a border policeman.    A large demonstration was staged this afternoon in Hebron to  protest the ongoing closure of the mosque at the Cave of the  Patriarchs. The security forces were forced to use tear gas,  and four demonstrators were injured when they inhaled it.</p>

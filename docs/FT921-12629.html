			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / International Company News: Packer sells 51% stake in Valassis MR KERRY PACKER, the Australian media entrepreneur, has stepped up his worldwide asset sell-off with the flotation of 51 per cent of Valassis Communications, his successful US-based advertising company. The flotation, seeking to raise between USDollars 442m and USDollars 508m, has intensified speculation that Mr Packer is raising cash ahead of a big overseas investment. In November last year, Mr Packer unexpectedly withdrew from Tourang, the international consortium that won the bid for Fairfax, Australia's second-largest newspaper publisher. Tourang, led by Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher, offered ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.05bn) for the Fairfax assets. The Valassis flotation follows closely the public offering of 51 per cent of Australian Consolidated Press, Mr Packer's magazine publishing business, which is expected to yield about ADollars 800m to his privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings. A filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission said 22.1m Valassis shares would be sold at between USDollars 20 and USDollars 23 a share. The flotation is underwritten by Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney Harris Upham. Mr Packer bought Valassis in December 1986, reportedly for ADollars 600m. Over the last 18 months, Mr Packer has raised ADollars 1.6bn from sales of assets including shares in the Australian National Industries, the Nine Network and six other large investments.</p>

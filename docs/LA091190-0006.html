			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RESISTANCE TO GAY COPS'  </P> <P> Chief Daryl F. Gates should be applauded for his stand on LAPD's recruitment  policies. Granted, gays and lesbians are people, too, and it's not that I  harbor any ill feelings toward them; it's their lifestyle that bothers me.  </P> <P> A police officer is someone who must be beyond the whims of society. He/she has  to be a professional, someone who when called upon will do what is right.  He/she wears a uniform that carries with it a certain amount of respect,  authority and influence. That influence can be used to enhance another person's  life or mislead it.  </P> <P> Phillips mentioned that Mitch Grobeson left the force because his life was  threatened. I sympathize with and at the same time give him credit for at least  attempting to become something he is not, a policeman.  </P> <P> It must be recognized that if LAPD openly recruit gays, they are saying to the  men and women, boys and girls of this city as well as the world that the gay  lifestyle is OK and perfectly acceptable. Is it?  </P> <P> DONALD W. LAWRENCE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

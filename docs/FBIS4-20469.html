			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Yunhe: ``Hainan Hi-Tech Gets `Fuzzy'''] </F>   [Text] Haikou -- A tripartite-invested venture was set up  yesterday to produce the newest wave in electronics, a device  that cuts the amount of power needed to run appliances.    With registered capital of $150 million, the Hainan-Aptronix  Electronic Company was founded by US-based Aptronix Asia-Pacific  Electronic Company, Hainan Seg International Trust and  Investment Corporation, and Hainan-based Hua Xing International  Leasing Company.    The Sino-American venture will use the world's latest  hi-tech  advances -- the ``fuzzy control technology'' -- to help improve  the automatic capacity of household electrical appliances, such  as washing machines, air-conditioners and cameras.    Yan Weiming, an official of the State Technology Supervision  Administration, said a washing machine can cut power consumption  by 2.6 per cent an hour with the fuzzy hi-tech.    The venture has spent $6 million to introduce two product  lines from the United States to manufacture the device, which is  expected to make household appliance factories more competitive.    It is the first factory to produce the fuzzy control device  in China.    The company is expected to start production at the end of  this year, and has a designed annual capacity of 5 million fuzzy  control devices in 1995 for the domestic markets.</p>

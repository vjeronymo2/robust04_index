			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours" Newscast] </F>   [Text] Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, Bishops Conference  president, has issued an official communique on behalf of the  Catholic Church regarding the confrontation between bishops and  the Prosecutor General's Office. Monsignor Rubiano sent a  letter to Government Minister Fabio Villegas and Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff today to clarify the conduct of  certain bishops in Apartado and San Gil.    This communique has been issued at a time when the  prosecutor  general has questioned recent contacts between several bishops  in various regions of the country with subversive groups,  particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the  National Liberation Army. The church has assumed a position,  and the government, specifically the prosecutor general and the  attorney general, another. Here is Raul Gutierrez with a report:    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] In his letter to Villegas,  Monsignor Rubiano asks him to indicate before the Bishops  Permanent Committee how the bishops' conduct has interfered with  the peace process or the justice system.    [Rubiano] Bishops do not collaborate with guerrillas; what  we  try to do is accomplish a mission, namely, to make room so that  Constitutional Article 22 is complied with.    [Gutierrez] In his letter to Prosecutor General de Greiff,  Monsignor Rubiano asks him to draw a line to separate pastoral  duties from politics. Meanwhile, Manizales Bishop Monsignor  Jose de Jesus Pimento said de Greiff was too hasty.    [Pimento] It was all a mistake by Prosecutor de Greiff, who  has expressed his political view. The bishop he has mentioned  has engaged in pastoral talks. He works in a very difficult  area and has talked with the guerrillas to urge them to change  their attitude.    [Gutierrez] The Government Minister will meet with the  bishops during the week of 7 March. [end recording]</p>

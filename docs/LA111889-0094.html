			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAVES SIGN ESASKY FOR 3 YEARS  </P> <P> Nick Esasky on Friday signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Braves, a  team that had wanted him for years.  </P> <P> "He's going to be a great addition to our ballclub and our rise to the top,"  said Bobby Cox, Atlanta vice president and general manager.  </P> <P> "It was a decision that was long coming," said Esasky, a first baseman who  lives with his wife and three children in Marietta, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta.  </P> <P> "I know there was talk for many years of me coming here. It never seemed to  work out. I'm totally excited about coming here and playing."  </P> <P> Esasky became one of the top prizes among this year's free agents after batting  .277 with 30 home runs and 108 runs batted in for the Boston Red Sox last  season.  </P> <P> His contract is believed to be worth $5.6 million plus incentives over the  three years -- a $600,000 signing bonus and salaries of $1.15 million next  season, $1.9 million in 1991 and $1.95 million in 1992. Each season he would  get a bonus of $50,000 for playing 140 games or having 562 plate appearances,  and another $50,000 for playing 150 games or 625 plate appearances.  </P> <P> "The Braves overwhelmed him with their offer," Boston General Manager Lou  Gorman said.  </P></p>

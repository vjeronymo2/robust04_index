			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Russia, the only European superpower outside the  European Union [EU], agrees to Hungary's future membership in  the EU. This was declared by Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin at a news conference held in Budapest a few hours  after Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky handed over  Hungary's application for EU membership in Athens on Friday [1  April].    [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into  Hungarian translation] We support Hungary's submission today of  its application to join the EU. Russia is also preparing to do  this. We hope a decision on this will be made this year, first  on the political level and then in the economy as well. Of  course, this will take a considerable period of time. We do not  have illusions because we assess the situation realistically.  We expect that when Hungary is a member of the EU, it will  support Russia's membership application. [end recording]    At the news conference, which followed two days of  negotiations in Budapest between the Hungarian and Russian prime  ministers, other issues of integration and security policy were  also discussed. A British journalist asked about Hungary's  intention to join NATO.    [Begin Chernomyrdin recording, in Russian fading into  Hungarian translation] It is a matter for Hungary, the Hungarian  Government, and the Hungarian people to decide whether or not to  join NATO. We may express our view on it, we may offer  philosophical theories about it, but it is still a matter for  the Hungarian people. [end recording]    It was also said at the news conference that Russia could  pay  back some of its debts to Hungary through arms deliveries.  Chernomyrdin did not rule this out. Even more, he offered joint  arms production, the possibility for Hungarian firms and  entrepreneurs to participate in the privatization of Russian  weapon manufacturing plants and to acquire share ownership in  these plants as a form of [Russian] debt repayment. [passage  omitted]    The main focus of the prime ministerial negotiations was the  economy. Russia will repay its debt, which amounts to about  $800 million, within three years through deliveries, services,  and handing over Russian assets into the ownership of Hungarian  entrepreneurs. Meanwhile Russia will pay interest on the  existing debt. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by Christophe Turowski; place and date not given: "Poland Wants  Its Voice To Be Heard"]    [Text] [Turowski] President Walesa appears disappointed by  the reluctance of Western countries to commit themselves to a  system that would guarantee security in Central and East Europe.  Do you feel the same?    [Olechowski] Current events will determine Poland's position  within the continent's future political configuration. First,  we need to define what our role is to be within NATO and the  European security system. We also need to take into account the  state of relations between the Western world and Moscow. Poland  cannot forget that Russia is its largest and most powerful  neighbor. We therefore want our voice to be heard and taken  seriously.    [Turowski] Is there not a risk that this Polish voice may be  stifled by Russia's, which the West appears more willing to  listen to?    [Olechowski] Seen from Warsaw, the priority for European  powers, including Russia, must be to establish a reliable and  strong European security system. Our position is therefore that  existing institutions must be expanded and that Poland must be  allowed to join such institutions as soon as possible. We  believe they are the only guarantee of peace there is. However,  Russia has so far remained wary of NATO, which makes for  excessively rigid policies. Still, Warsaw and Moscow have now  established good cooperative relations from both a bilateral and  a regional standpoint.    [Turowski] The strategy of the United States has been  visibly  pro-Russian. Does that worry you?    [Olechowski] The United States has been doing everything in  its power to incite Russia to embrace the rules of democracy and  market economy. President Clinton's attitude is quite  understandable. However, I would definitely worry should the  Americans seek a strategic alliance with Russia. In the current  context, such a move would be highly premature.    [Turowski] Poland was the first country to formally  recognize the new Ukrainian state. How do you explain the  special relationship that has since developed between the two  nations?    [Olechowski] Poland is delighted with Kiev's rising  political profile on the international scene. At first,  Ukrainian independence created much uncertainty in the West.  Today, the United States and Russia have initiated a political  dialogue with Ukraine. Washington and Moscow have given  assurances that are tantamount to a commitment to preserve  Ukraine's independence and security. It would be desirable that  the headquarters of an existing international institution be  moved to Kiev in order to further anchor Ukraine to Europe.    [Turowski] Does this alliance between Poland and Ukraine not  stem from an anti-Russian feeling?    [Olechowski] By definition, this cooperation between our two  countries, both of which have an equal aspiration for liberty  and democracy, cannot be a threat to anyone. Nowadays, Poland  has many more neighbors than four years ago, and we have signed  friendship treaties with all of them. For the first time in a  region that was racked by fratricidal wars for centuries, all  nations have recovered their independence. Consequently, there  is a need to create good neighborly relations, a basic  requirement for security in Europe.    [Turowski] Moscow made its considerable clout felt on the  occasion of the settlement negotiated in Sarajevo by the United  Nations. How do you view this change of tack?    [Olechowski] This is an unqualified success for Russian  diplomacy. As for Poland, we have always supported European  initiatives meant to put an end to the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia. And our participation is commensurate to our means:  UN forces in Bosnia include a Polish military contingent. This  tragedy is also a warning, reminding us that similar conflicts  could happen just about anywhere in Europe. This is a lesson we  cannot afford not to learn if we intend to prepare for the  future. And this is why Poland is so adamant about human and  minority rights, and also why it supports the Balladur [French  prime minister] plan for conflict prevention in Europe.    [Turowski] Two years ago, in your capacity as finance  minister, you voiced some bitterness with respect to  French-Polish relations. What is your point of view today as  foreign minister?    [Olechowski] You could say that France and Germany have been  our mentors within the European Union. The periodic meetings  between the three countries' foreign ministers are the best  testimony to this. Furthermore, these meetings are now  supplemented by meetings between the defense ministers. Should  France and Germany succeed in integrating Poland in the WEU  [Western European Union], that would be proof that their efforts  were effective.    [Turowski] And yet French companies seem strangely absent  from Poland...    [Olechowski] While French companies are absent from Poland  today, they will regret it tomorrow. Indeed, whatever the  COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade] may think,  Poland is no longer a risk-prone country. Those who invest now  can be assured of very healthy returns.</p>

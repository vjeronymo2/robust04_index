			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Search for wealth in the waste: Bronwen Maddox assesses the economic case for the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant The fierce debate about whether the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria should get the go-ahead moves a step further towards resolution today, with the end of a two-month public consultation. One of the tasks of the consultation is to weigh up whether there is an economic case for the plant. Responses have poured in from both sides of the debate, and officials at the UK Department of the Environment's damp-stained 1970s tower block in Westminster must now weigh up the arguments. A final decision on the plant's fate is expected later this year. Meanwhile, British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, waits to find if its 10-year project, which has consumed Pounds 2.8bn, has a future. The plant is designed to take used fuel rods from nuclear power stations and separate out the reusable plutonium and uranium, leaving a smaller amount of unusable radioactive waste. Its engineers are now testing the plant with small amounts of uranium to ensure that the gleaming steel pipes and the tiers of computer screens are ready to start immediately if the government grants a licence. The decision about whether to approve the plant is one of the most controversial industrial decisions facing the government. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, has already taken the government to court, though it failed to block testing of the plant. BNF, which has no other source of long-term business, has said Britain's international reputation for nuclear expertise will be irrevocably damaged if the plant is abandoned. The government has said that it is 'minded' to give the go-ahead on the basis of an earlier public consultation this year, which concluded that there were no environmental or health risks. But the attorney-general said in May it also had to consider the economic case for the plant, as well as the issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons capability. If the plant makes a loss, taxpayers will foot the bill. If Thorp saddles UK nuclear power companies with higher costs than other methods of disposing of fuel rods, electricity consumers will pay. Assessment of the economic case, however, is far from easy. At the heart of the debate is BNF's claim that, if the plant is abandoned, the UK will lose at least Pounds 950m in profits over the first 10 years of the plant's life. The UK might also have to pay back some of the Pounds 1bn-odd of foreign customers' money used to build the plant. BNF's claim takes account of the revenue that would be lost if Thorp were abandoned, the savings from not having to run the plant or decommission it at the end of its life, and the expense of building alternative stores for the fuel. Thorp's critics have attacked the Pounds 950m figure - which has not been audited by the government - on several grounds. The revenue from Thorp, they say, will not be as high as BNF predicts. Although Thorp has Pounds 9bn of contracted orders for its first decade, critics question whether customers will honour the contracts. The reason for doubt is that reprocessing now looks more expensive than other methods of treating used nuclear fuel, such as 'dry storage' - storing the fuel for years without separating its components before a final decision about how to dispose of it. Greenpeace argues that reprocessing is about twice as expensive as dry storage, based on figures from Scottish Nuclear Fuels and the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee. A second reason for questioning the Pounds 950m figure is that customers, mainly German and Japanese power utilities, may prove reluctant to take back the uranium, plutonium and radioactive waste produced by reprocessing. Their contracts require them to take it back, but public opinion at home may be hostile to the radioactive shipments. Mr William Walker of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University has argued that, because this may dissuade customers from sending fuel to Thorp, the plant is unlikely to run at full capacity. A third line of criticism is that the plant's costs could be higher than budgeted, and that customers, even though it is stipulated in their contracts, may refuse to pay the increased costs. BNF has responded to all these points by arguing that its profits are protected by the customer contracts. Under tough penalty clauses, customers are obliged to absorb extra costs, and would have to compensate BNF entirely if they wanted to cancel their contracts, it says. These claims and counterclaims, which have been set out in reams of reports from BNF and its critics throughout the year, are impossible to prove at present. Partly, the answers lie hidden in the details of the customer contracts, which BNF and its shareholder, the Department of Trade and Industry, have refused to disclose on grounds of customer confidentiality. But they are also dependent on future political pressures in Japan and Germany, and on how their current debates about nuclear power progress. The UK government's relations with those countries is also vital: would it choose to enforce every clause of the contracts, at risk of offending its trading partners? In spite of these obstacles, the government will have to make a judgment soon on whether Thorp will be profitable for Britain. A short answer is yes, probably. The main customers have recently and publicly pledged their support, and an early attempt to break the contracts seems unlikely. There are, though, reasons to find BNF's projections too optimistic, because of the uncertainty of customers' behaviour a decade from now. Officials in the Treasury and DoE share the conclusion that there is an economic case for the plant, although it is perhaps not as strong as BNF suggests. DTI officials express more confidence that BNF's projections are sound. If the plant is likely to be profitable, giving the go-ahead would be acceptable to the Treasury. However, that does not mean it is economically the best solution for the UK or for Thorp's customers. The UK might make more money from abandoning Thorp but offering to keep customers' fuel in dry storage, Greenpeace has suggested in its response to the public consultation. Although this is regarded by BNF as a near-unthinkable option, it has been considered briefly by the government. Early this year, in confidential discussions organised by a cabinet committee, Treasury officials questioned whether it might be mutually advantageous for the UK and for Thorp's customers to abandon the plant if all parties were released from penalty clauses in their contracts. Customers would gain from being able to choose cheaper options such as dry storage of fuel. The UK would gain if it could charge them for running that storage. Officials christened this scenario the 'win-win' option. They also noted that Britain and Thorp's customers might be caught in a 'prisoner's dilemma': a branch of economics called 'game theory' describes the way that each party, acting in self-interest, reaches a worse economic outcome than they would if they were able to collude. Dry storage might offer the way out. But the 'win-win' option was put aside by the cabinet committee in subsequent discussions. It would be too difficult and time-consuming to raise the question with Thorp's customers, officials decided, and the outcome would be hard to predict. Britain might be forced by Thorp's customers to pay penalties itself if it suggested it did not want to go ahead with the plant. If the government's response to the public consultation sticks to a narrow brief, it will simply weigh up whether the plant will make a profit or whether it will pose any risk of saddling the taxpayer with losses. But the government now has another chance to examine, before the button is pressed, whether Thorp is really the best and most profitable way forward for Britain to dispose of nuclear waste.</p>

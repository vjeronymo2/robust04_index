			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: An authentic taste of Cantonese food - Hong Kong Street Food HONG KONG remains one of the most exciting and dynamic cities in the world, as well as the home of world class Chinese cuisine. It manages to maintain the great traditions, blending old and new, east and west. However, if you are nostalgic for the authentic taste of good Cantonese food, as it was before Hong Kong became an international economic power, then you want to visit what the Cantonese call dai pai dong - which literally means big sign street food stalls. These are the old-fashioned food stalls that proffer treats from snacks to full meals, to a hungry but very busy clientele. Hong Kong's street food vendors sell their specialities out of stainless steel stalls, usually set on wheels. Most of them use a propane gas or charcoal burning stove, so that food is always piping hot. I have enjoyed savoury pork dishes stir-fried with fresh seasonal vegetables; I have vivid memories of succulent fresh prawns, slices of fresh fish; soft, freshly-made rice noodles, soothing congees, even crispy roast duck. However, if you want to see these dai pai dongs, you had better hurry. In the past, they dotted the landscape of Hong Kong and Kowloon. They were part of the street ambience with their fragrant aromas wafting through the narrow streets and alleys. Today the food vendors are being moved from the street and settled indoors. They are increasingly congregated together in concrete, sterile market complexes, losing much of their charm. Why is this happening? Masses of people crowded together, exorbitant real estate prices, commodity distribution imperatives, economics of scale, the need for efficient use of space, the obliteration of local and neighbourhood facilities are just some of the reasons. In Hong Kong, space is at such a premium that it must be strictly rationed in order to be fully utilised. Street food stalls are inevitably being congregated, ordered and rationalised to obtain maximum efficiency of both productivity and land use. There are other reasons for this reorganisation. One of them concerns health and food hygiene. In spite of the fact that food served up in these street stalls is always fresh and hot, the ability of the authorities to supervise the thousands of such outlets is sorely tested, the fear of unhealthy conditions in Hong Kong's subtropical climate is always present. Congregating the food stalls will improve both official supervision and hygiene. This has never been a major concern for me as the food served was always cooked in a very hot wok and I felt that anything which would survive the heat of the wok probably deserves to live anyway. As Hong Kong hurtles toward its union with the mainland, the atmosphere of change is increasingly charged with hope and anxiety. It is my impression that the continued popularity of the dai pai dong is related to needs generated by these emotions. People seek to anchor their lives in those traditional forms and experiences that, at least in retrospect, have served them well in the past. Hong Kong and Kowloon were known the world over for their sidewalk restaurants each with a few chairs and tables, each purveying its own specialties. The constant hustle and bustle around them, from early morning until very late in the balmy evenings, imparted a vitality to street life and are missed by many in Hong Kong. Rampant nostalgia plays a part in all this but economics and sociology are primary. Masses of Hong Kong people are relatively better off than they were 20 years ago. They have disposable income and are taking more time to savour the fruits of their labour. They eat out more often and in general have more leisure time. Thus, they can take time to eat in proper restaurants, rather than on the local street corner. Alas, it is part of modernisation and I am afraid it may go the way of Singapore. Some of Hong Kong's most successful restaurateurs began their careers as street food hawkers. There is no better proving ground for one's inventiveness, market awareness and appreciation of what makes the customers coming back. However, I still make the rounds to my favourite dai pai dongs. These include those in the neighbourhood of Mongkok in Kowloon; on Soy Street, appropriately enough, in Wanchai around the market; near Kai Tak Airport and in Yaumatei. Explore the area at the back of the Peninsula Hotel and the Star Ferry Terminal, places familiar to every tourist, and near the central market off Graham Street on Hong Kong island. Les Halles in Paris, Covent Garden in London, the pushcarts of Hester Street are all gone, rationalised out of existence. The street food stalls of Hong Kong and Kowloon are following them. However, I believe that regardless of what happens when the colony is reunited with China, and in spite of the rationalisation now taking place, one will still be able to experience the joys of Hong Kong street foods in some way.</p>

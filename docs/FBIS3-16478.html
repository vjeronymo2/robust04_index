			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn has been officially invited to attend the congress of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which opens on 2  April in Moscow. This has been confirmed by LDPR leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in response to an inquiry from a  correspondent for the journal EKHO PLANETY [ECHO OF THE PLANET].  "We have invited anybody with whom we maintain relations --  people from Iraq, Serbia, North Korea, South Korea, and other  countries. We have friends everywhere," he said.    The sensational news that the president of Taiwan had also  been invited to the congress and might turn up has not so far  been confirmed.    However, it has been reported from Paris that the first  deputy leader of the French National Front will definitely come  to Moscow for the LDPR congress. The head of the extreme  right-wing German People's Union, Gerhard Frey, also intends to  take part in it.</p>

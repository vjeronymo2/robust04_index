			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Occidental reaps tax benefits of restructuring OCCIDENTAL Petroleum has begun to reap the tax benefits of a Dollars 2.2bn restructuring charge taken after the death last December of Dr Armand Hammer, who presided over the Los Angeles-based energy and chemicals group for more than half a century. Net first-quarter earnings were Dollars 136m or 45 cents a share, up from Dollars 108m (37 cents a share) a year earlier. The latest figure, however, includes a Dollars 53m tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards created by last year's restructuring. These carryforwards, which totalled Dollars 1.7bn last December, can be set against taxes on operating income and capital gains. They are recorded as an extraordinary item. Mr Ray Irani, who took over as chairman when Dr Hammer died, has taken the scalpel to Occidental with the aim of concentrating on the core businesses of oil, gas and chemicals. He has put several of Dr Hammer's pet projects on the block, and laid off 1,000 employees. He signalled a break from the past by moving the annual meeting from Dr Hammer's birthday on May 20 to a date 10 days earlier. Oil and gas earnings in the first quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 122m, reflecting higher oil prices and production, higher international natural gas volumes and improved domestic gas liquids prices. On the other hand, earnings from chemicals dipped by 25 per cent to Dollars 139m, as a result, among other things, of higher feedstock prices and lower farm products volumes. Amoco Corp lifted its first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 803m or Dollars 1.60 a share from Dollars 466m, or 91 cents a share a year earlier, due largely to a benefit from a change in accounting for income taxes. Excluding this benefit, earnings of the Chicago-based energy producer rose 6 per cent to Dollars 492m. Refining and marketing income rose to Dollars 214m from Dollars 129m, due to wider refining margins. On the other hand, earnings from exploration and production fell steeply, both in the US and internationally. The drop was due to lower natural gas prices, a fall in domestic crude oil output and higher exploration expenses. Olin, the Connecticut-based chemicals and special metals producer, took an Dollars 80m charge in the first quarter as part of a restructuring. Other measures include a 10 per cent cut in the salaried workforce and the sale of several businesses. These include industrial phosphates, electronic chemical and inter-connect operations, and some small chemical and metal product lines. As a result Olin suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 59m (Dollars 2.20 a share), against earnings of Dollars 32m (Dollars 1.60 a share) a year earlier.</p>

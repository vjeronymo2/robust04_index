			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY PANEL OPPOSES DE ANZA COVE BILL  </P> <P> The Rules Committee of the San Diego City Council voted unanimously Wednesday  to oppose a bill proposed by state Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) that would  allow the city to grant a 63-year lease to the De Anza Group of Beverly Hills  to build a $425-million tourist resort around De Anza Cove in Mission Bay.  </P> <P> Craven's bill is necessary for such a facility to be constructed because the  cove is designated public tideland. But, as Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor  Maureen O'Connor, pointed out, council opposition hurts the bill -- because it  becomes San Diego's position on the matter -- "even though it can still go  forward in Sacramento."  </P> <P> The De Anza Group, which operates a mobile home park and campground on the  property earmarked for development, had expressed interest in building hotels,  shops, public bicycle and jogging paths, a 13-acre botanical garden and an  improved golf course as part of its complex.  </P> <P> The De Anza Group now holds leases with the city for the park and campground  and must have them renegotiated for another 50 years, to the year 2053, for  construction of the resort to occur. Such an extension would require the  concurrence of the Legislature, which, in the early 1980s, placed restrictions  on the length of the leases, resulting in Craven's proposed bill.  </P> <P> Craven was unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

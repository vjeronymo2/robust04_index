			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The proposal of the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS) Executive Council that the government  should return to churches certain property which serves their  mission and goals, at the same time saying that no further "law  of a restitution nature" will be adopted, is basically opposed  by none of the remaining three coalition parties.    Jaroslav Orel, spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union-  Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), told CTK today that he  considered the proposal to be a fundamental and positive change  in the ODS's stand on the issue. He said the ODS had approached  the principle ``to return all the property which was illegally  confiscated and those to whom it is offered should "wisely  choose which property they are to claim." [quotation marks as  received]    The KDU-CSL is interested in ending restitution, which would  be a clear signal from the coalition to the whole country that  it will always defend the inviolability of private property.  The KDU-CSL rules out any financial compensation, which would  burden taxpayers, and believes that the rights of the people who  obtained their property in good faith should not be put in  question while ending restitution.    Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party (KDS) Ivan Pilip  told CTK that although the KDS supported the ODS's proposal it  believes that "the entire problem could by no means be solved in  such a way." He said that only property which belongs to the  state could be returned through a government decision and that  the economic position of the Church in society could hardly be  settled without a law.    The Civic Democratic Alliance believes that extraordinary  property transfers should be ended as soon as possible, which is  a pre-condition for the necessary stabilization of ownership  relations and for an agreement on a definitive stop to  restitution. Representatives of the coalition parties will deal  with restitution issues on Tuesday [10 May].</p>

This CCD camera production line is a  joint venture between the Huanan plant, a subsidiary of the  Armaments Industry Corporation, and Hong Kong's Xianda [7359  6671] Science &amp; Technology Ltd. Annual single-shift  production  capacity for this late-80s-level all-automatic SMT (surface  mount technology) production line is 50,000. Since the line's  initial operation on 28 March 1992, almost 6,000 B&amp;W and  color  CCD cameras have been manufactured and sold at home and abroad;  newly added value has totaled almost 10 million yuan and the  2,400-odd exported CCD cameras have earned US$430,000 in foreign  exchange.</p>

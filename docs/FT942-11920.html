			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Taiwan deputies shout out about overseas votes About 40 opposition deputies yesterday stormed out of a session of Taiwan's National Assembly after leaping onto their seats, screaming and unfurling protest banners as President Lee Teng-hui began an address, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'Long live Taiwanese. Oppose overseas Chinese voting for the president,' deputies in the main opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) chanted as the assembly convened a three-month session to debate constitutional reforms. 'Look clearly Mr President,' a DPP assemblyman screamed as he and colleagues held up banners reading: 'Giving overseas Chinese the right to vote for the president is like luring a wolf into one's home.' Under a political reform package proposed by the ruling Nationalist party, ethnic Chinese living outside Taiwan and China will have the right to vote for the island's president. DPP deputies oppose the proposal, arguing many of the overseas Chinese do not pay taxes and have dual citizenship. 'The loyalty of overseas Chinese to Taiwan is questionable,' one DPP assemblyman said. According to government statistics, there are about 34m overseas Chinese worldwide. Taiwanese authorities are still studying how many would be eligible for absentee balloting. The package needs the approval of the 314-member assembly, dominated by the Nationalists who hold 247 seats. Mr Lee appeared indifferent to the walkout and screaming, and continued with his speech. 'We cannot cut ourselves off from society and amend the constitution without basis . . . We must gradually revise concepts, laws and systems which are out of keeping with the times,' he told the session. Outside the assembly chambers, DPP deputies shouted insults at deputies appointed to represent overseas Chinese. Earlier, a group of DPP assemblymen charged the podium, jumped onto the chairman's table and ripped away microphones to protest the presence of plainclothesmen in the chambers, delaying the start of the session. The reform package also calls for the introduction of direct presidential elections by popular vote - an issue which had previously divided the Nationalists.</p>

Need for agency action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OSHA believes that current logging methods and the inherent dangers posed by work in the woods, such as those caused by inclement weather, uneven terrain and isolation from health care facilities, present significant hazards to employees engaged in logging operations across the nation, regardless of the type logging being conducted or the end use of the wood. The presentation of data in the preceding section further demonstrate the level of risk to which all loggers are exposed. Nevertheless, the existing OSHA safety standard for pulpwood logging (29 CFR 1910.266) specifically addresses only one segment of the logging industry_logging operations whose forest product ends up as pulp. Although OSHA does not know precisely the breakdown of employment and occupational injuries between pulpwood and other logging operations, the data and other information available to OSHA indicate that similar hazards exist in both sectors of the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preceding section has shown that the logging industry remains a high risk industry, regardless of the end use of the forest product. In particular, the data show:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Employees engaged in logging operations have a substantially higher risk of injury and death than workers in many other industries, including other high hazard industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If they are injured, loggers are more likely to be hospitalized and lose workdays compared to employees in most other industries, as evidenced by the very high lost-workday incidence rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. When loggers are injured, their injuries are much more severe and result in longer hospitalizations and more lost time per employee than do the injuries of employees in most other industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Loggers also have a much higher incidence of fatalities than employees in other industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

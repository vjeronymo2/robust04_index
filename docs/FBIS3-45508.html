			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and </F> Economic Cooperation by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) from  the "Minister's Hotline" column; place and date not given: "On  the End-of-Year Trade Deficit--an Interview With Wu Yi, Minister  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation"]    [Text] Editor's note: The "Minister's Hotline"  column has run for nearly one year, and it concludes with this  interview. During the past year or so, we have received many  letters from our readers and have invited 19 ministerial leading  cadres to give their views on some flash-point economic issues  which the readers have raised. We would like to take this  opportunity to express our sincere thanks to the leaders and  vast numbers of readers who have shown their concerns for and  have supported this column. Although this column has ended, we  still welcome our readers to write to us and raise questions.  We will continue to answer them in various forms.    [Gong Wen] According to the figures provided by customs, a  trade deficit has appeared in China's imports and exports this  year, something has rarely happened in recent years. From  January to November, the total volume of import and export trade  was $164.2 billion, of which exports totaled $78.25 billion and  imports totaled $85.95 billion, an increase of 6.2 and 27.8  percent respectively over the same period last year. The export  growth rate was 21.6 percentage points lower than the rate of  import growth, with a deficit of $7.7 billion on our side.  Would you, Minister Wu, please tell us about the main reasons  for this deficit?    [Wu Yi] In my opinion, there are three main reasons: First,  increasing demand in the domestic market. China's national  economy grew by 12.8 percent last year, and the trend of rapid  development has been maintained this year. It is estimated that  this year's growth rate will reach 13 percent. This has brought  about increases in domestic demand; in particularly, we have  seen a rapid increase in demand for the means of production.  The shortage of commodities for bulk exports has been a rare  phenomenon in the past many years. Negative growth has been  registered since the beginning of this year in the exports of  ordinary commodities, which are important sources of state  foreign exchange earnings. From January to November, the growth  rate of these exports decreased by 0.6 percent over the same  period of last year (calculated in terms of comparable items).    Second, the role of the market has become much broader.  China has made an important policy decision about the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure and has  given full play to the basic roles of the market in the  allocation of resources under state macroeconomic regulation and  control. At present, because price control has been relaxed  further, the prices of approximately 90 percent of industrial  consumer goods, 70 percent of the ex-factory prices of capital  goods, and 85 percent of the procurement prices of agricultural  products are decided by the market. Because of the weak prices  in the international market and the shortage of commodity  resources in the domestic market, prices have been rising to a  certain extent, and the law of value has been playing a major  role. For this reason, a decrease in the export of domestic  commodities has appeared again. Because China has further  relaxed control over imports, foreign commodities are entering  the Chinese market at a considerably high growth rate. Last  year's import volume increased by 26.4 percent compared with the  previous year, and, from January to November this year, it  continued to increase by 27.8 percent compared with the same  period of last year. This fully shows that China is a large  market with great potential. China's market is open.    Moreover, because of the increase in foreign exchange swap  prices, the shortage of funds, and insufficient transportation  facilities, foreign trade departments are working under dual  pressures from commodity providers and foreign buyers. The  former are trying to increase prices, while the latter are  seeking to force prices down. In addition, as the enterprises  engaging in foreign economic cooperation and trade are in the  period of changing operational mechanism, with the insufficient  macroeconomic regulation and control measures and incomplete  implementation of the export policies and measures, the foreign  trade and export business have been directly affected. These  reasons are also behind the deficit.    [Gong] It has been learned that deficits have appeared in  bilateral trade between China and some countries this year. For  example, the trade deficit with Japan reached $5.48 billion in  the first 10 months of the year, making up 77.3 percent of the  total deficit in China's foreign trade during the same period.  Would you please tell us how you view this problem and what  measures should be adopted to resolve the problem?    [Wu] In my opinion, it is difficult to avoid having a  deficit  in bilateral trade. The issue is that both sides should take a  positive and pragmatic attitude and adopt flexible methods to  solve the problem so that it does not become an obstacle to the  development of bilateral economic and trade relations and so  that the deficit may not be used as a pretext for exerting  pressure on the other side. China's basic foreign trade policy  is to ensure equality and mutual benefit and maintain a basic  balance between imports and exports. At present, in the face of  the unsatisfactory export situation, we will adopt a method of  expanding exports rather than reducing imports to achieve the  basic balance. We export so that we can import the advanced  technologies and equipment needed by our modernization drive and  those materials that are in short supply in our domestic market.  It is estimated that our import volume will reach $450 billion  over the next five years.    As everyone knows, approximately 80 percent of China's  foreign exchange comes from foreign trade and exports. If the  deficit situation caused by slow export is not improved, China's  foreign exchange earnings will certainly decrease, and its  import trade will also be affected. Therefore, only on the  basis of continuous and rapid growth of exports and by  increasing foreign exchange earnings can the current trend of  high-rate import growth be preserved. We hope that our trading  partners will increase their imports of Chinese commodities so  that bilateral trade can develop harmoniously. At the same  time, we also hope that our trade partners with whom there is  the problem of imbalanced trade will resolve the trade deficit  issue on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that the  trade deficit does not affect the development of bilateral trade  and economic relations.    [Gong] May we ask Minister Wu to predict the situation of  China's import and export trade next year?    [Wu] We are resolving the trade deficit issue primarily  through expanding exports. Therefore, we will concentrate our  energy next year on work in the following fields of export trade.    First, to intensify reform of the structure of foreign trade  and economic cooperation. Beginning in 1994, a system of  "unification of foreign exchange rates" will be adopted, and a  unified foreign exchange settlement system will be implemented  in all enterprises engaging in foreign trade business and the  export trade. At the same time, a unitary and well-managed  floating exchange rate system for the renminbi based on market  supply and demand will be established, and the task for foreign  trade enterprises to turn their foreign exchange earnings over  to the state with or without compensation will be abolished, so  that an environment of fair competition can be created for the  enterprises. Under effective macroeconomic regulation and  control, control over the operation of import and export  commodities will be further relaxed (currently approximately  2,000 productive enterprises and 100 scientific research  institutes have already been granted independent import and  export powers). Legislative work will be strengthened so that  the cohesion of foreign trade policy and a good operational  order can be maintained.    Second, to enhance the enterprises' sense of earning foreign  exchange through export and to correctly handle the relations  between mainly developing a business and the development of a  diversified economy, between foreign exchange earned through  export and economic returns, and between independent operation  and conscientiously maintaining the operational order. All  departments in charge should give the green light to the  enterprises for expanding exports and provide them with  high-quality service.    Third, to make great efforts to open up new fields and  increase exports while consolidating and developing existing  markets. At present, China has already established economic and  trade relations with more than 220 countries and regions. An  initial pluralized market pattern has formed. We still have to  make greater efforts, however, especially in striving for an  early return to the status of a GATT signatory state and in  creating conditions for expanding exports.    Moreover, in order to "win by quality," we must continue to  "fight against sham commodities" next year. We must cooperate  with the scientific research, production, commodity inspection,  and customs departments and rely on science and technology,  policy, and management to greatly increase the quality of our  export commodities. In border and regional trade, those  practices that harm the prestige of China's export commodities  and enterprises should be severely punished according to the law.    Judging from China's foreign trade development in the first  11 months of this year, it is estimated that the total export  volume for the entire year will exceed $92 billion, and the  total import volume will reach more than $100 billion.  Calculated on the basis that the growth rate of import and  export trade is a bit higher than that of the national economy,  the total volume of China's foreign trade and the import and  export volume will reach $200 billion, which will mean a new and  higher stage, of which imports and exports will each reach $100  billion. In foreign trade and import and export activities,  there will possibly be less restrictive factors next year than  there were this year. The growth in foreign trade, especially  the increase in the state's foreign exchange earnings, and the  increase of the state's ability in international payment will be  conducive to the comprehensive development of China's foreign  trade and economic cooperation.    But what merits our attention is that the growth rate for  our  export trade next year has been set at 8.7 percent, which is  lower than the GNP's growth rate--9 percent. That is why I have  said that we must make continuous efforts and strive to make the  growth rate of export trade same as or a bit higher than GNP  growth rate.    [Gong] Some people have asked even though a deficit has  appeared in China's foreign trade, the number of antidumping  complaints against China's export goods has nevertheless  continued to increase. What on earth has actually happened?  Will this affect China's export trade?    [Wu] At present, some countries are faced with economic  depression, stagnation in domestic industrial production, and a  situation in which imports can hardly be controlled by the  original tariff barriers. This, compounded with a lack of  understanding about China's socialist market economic structure,  has led these countries to adopt some discriminatory measures  against Chinese products and regard the antidumping measure as a  way to prevent foreign commodities from entering their domestic  markets. We do not like to see this phenomenon. Some countries  still regard our country as a country with a planned economy  which still practices the old method of substitute states. This  is unwarranted today.    We are in favor of promoting exports in accordance with  standard international trade practices. China is a developing  country. It does not have the economic strength necessary to  dump its commodities overseas. Because of the relatively cheap  labor and low production costs in our country, the prices of our  export commodities are relatively low. We hope that the  governments and industrial and commercial circles of the  relevant countries will take a realistic attitude toward the  selling prices of China's export commodities.</p>

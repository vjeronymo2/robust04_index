			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group While most empire builders in the media sector have long since collapsed under the combined weight of debt and recession, Blenheim still wears its imperial crown. Yesterday's 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was ahead of even the City's best expectations. Borrowing remains moderate and cash flow is positive, thanks to the enviable practice of taking clients' money up to a year in advance. If only advertising agencies enjoyed such favourable terms of trade. But while expenditure on exhibitions is holding up better than advertising or public relations, Blenheim looks far from recession-proof. Profits in the UK have been flat for three years. With the French and German economies poised to take a steep downward lurch, Blenheim will have to muster all its management skills if the giddy rate of earnings growth is to be maintained. True, its continental European exhibitions tend to be market-leaders rather than the hodge-podge of smaller events in the UK. Even a small fall in revenue from exhibitors, though, will make a serious dent in margins. Overheads were cut again this year, but there is now little fat left on the corporate body. With cash and contracts already in the bag for next year, growth looks secure in the near term. What happens in 1994 and after is less certain. The market may take some comfort from the fact that the chairman and other directors retain a substantial stake in the business. Even so, a prospective price earnings ratio of 15 times next year's forecast earnings leaves plenty of scope for disappointment.</p>

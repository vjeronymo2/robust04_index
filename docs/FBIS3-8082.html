Last night Muslim forces based in a number of Bihac suburbs  launched artillery attacks on Serb positions killing one Serb  soldier and wounding four others in Barakovac [a village near  Bihac], a SRNA [Serb news agency] correspondent has reported,  quoting a communique issued by the command of the 2d Krajina  Corps of the Srpska republic army.    Members of the 5th Corps of the Muslim Army loyal to Alija  Izetbegovic based in Zalozje, Carkici, Cekrlije, and Vinica have  continuously been attacking Serb fighters' positions. Muslim  units have been launching the fiercest attacks against Serb  positions in Barakovac above Bihac. Fighters of the 2d Krajina  Corps have successfully repelled all attacks.    Due to their failures on the battlefield, the Muslim  authorities of Bihac district tried to stage-manage another  Markale [Sarajevo market place massacre in February] in Bihac  for consumption by the foreign media. Muslim information media  in Bihac said last night that a Serb artillery round killed 12  civilians. This news was denied today by the command of the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] French battalion stationed in  Caralici near Cazin, saying that the Serbs did not carry out any  attacks at all yesterday.    In addition, Muslim authorities in Bihac yesterday banned  all  humanitarian convoys bound for the western part of the Srpska  republic from passing through the Cazin area. As a result,  humanitarian aid will in the future travel through the territory  of the republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia], a journey that is  several hundred kilometers longer.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: It's not theatre, sir, it's an opera - Director Richard Eyre is making his debut at Covent Garden next Friday My late and much lamented near-namesake, Ronald Eyre, used to say that directing opera was like inflating a plastic elephant. Before I started to direct my first opera I thought I knew what he meant, and I thought I agreed with him. I once did a show with Ken Campbell which did indeed require the inflation of a plastic elephant; it was tossed out into the auditorium at the end of the show and bounced about by the audience above their heads. It was a brief gesture, which required a disproportionate amount of effort on the part of the elephant's minder, Mavis. She started mid-morning repairing the small tears from the previous night's exertions with a bicycle repair outfit. She then plugged the beast into an aircompressor and waited patiently for the plastic pachyderm to achieve its majestic, fully inflated form, only to see it deflate, devoid of dignity, during its nightly appearance - a process, at least for Ron, remarkably similar to directing an opera. I have always had powerful prejudices against opera. Stuck for a conversational diversion, I once asked Princess Margaret - a noted (or notorious) balletomane - if she liked opera: 'Can't stand it. A lot of frightfully boring people standing still and yelling.' Blunt perhaps, but not a universe away from my own feelings at the time. Being marinated in the art of theatre, and nourished by an aesthetic of 'truthfulness' - however relative, and however pretentious - I was unsympathetic until recently to a medium which transparently is not concerned with holding the mirror up to nature. Opera seemed to me to depend on the audience's acceptance of an elaborate conceit. The motor of 'music theatre' is music rather than theatre, and the making of music seemed to me to have little in common with the making of theatre. Music does not have to have a point; that is its point, the music. With good music, as Auden says, you have only to listen to it, and be grateful. Theatre, on the other hand, prospers, or labours, under the despotism of logic: it maintains a stubborn dependence on plot, which in many operas delights in its obscurity and revels in its resistance to common sense. And if its plots often appear absurd, its passions often seem either histrionic or bathetic. I was uneasy about an entertainment which employed so many people to achieve its effects, and could be as unwieldy as an aircraft carrier. I was uneasy too (and remain so) about the cost, swollen not only by the numbers involved, but the need to submit to fees dictated by the international market. And to be honest, I have been put off opera not so much by the activity itself, as by the personality of some of its propagandists - the fans, the enthusiasts who criticise and catalogue every performance with the joyless pedantry of armchair cricketers poring over their Wisdens. However, I've become a convert. It is still unlikely that you will find me in future years in the Crush Bar extolling the virtues of Otto Schweppes' Leporello, castigating Helga Haagen Dazs' Marschallin, and minutely examining the flaws in Guido Gamforalaf's Ring, but I have lost my heart to at least half a dozen works, not all of them by Mozart or Verdi. I have come to accept that opera is a world like any other; like the theatre, opera has its own partiality, its own criteria, its own forms of truth and of excellence, no less exacting, and no less rare than in the theatre. I have recognised that I have earned Matisse's rebuke to the woman who complained that an arm in a painting of his was out of proportion to the body: 'It's not an arm, madam, it's a picture.' Opera is its own thing and it is as fruitless to blame it for not being like theatre as it is to blame theatre for not being film, or a melon for not being an orange. My conversion has occurred through the sorcery of Sir George Solti, who, after a flirtation with me over Falstaff in Salzburg, lured me into directing La Traviata at Covent Garden: 'I have never conducted Traviata, you have never produced it: together we will make our first Traviata.' I have not regretted it, and I will never tire of watching him at work with the orchestra and singers - punching the air, on his toes like a boxing trainer, singing and shouting like a muezzin. 'Play this forte,' he crowed to the 'cellos, 'Break your wrists and break my heart.' I enjoy as much our minutely detailed discussions about the meaning or value of a note, a word, a gesture; it is an obvious and extraordinary pleasure to work with a great conductor, but it is as rare and as important to work with a great collaborator. 'It's too early to jubilate about this enterprise,' Solti has said to me. I can jubilate privately that my prejudices against opera have been cast off and my worst expectations have been defied: instead of a soprano the size of a Wessex saddleback, I work with one who has a large and beautiful voice and a waist the size of a teapot, the tenor has a modest ego and a voice as unforced as a mountain stream, the chorus are cooperative and inventive, and rehearsals have been free of operatic (or theatrical) tantrums. In one sense Ron was right: there is something of the elephant about opera - an awesomely large, sometimes cumbersome, and sometimes heart-stoppingly beautiful animal. But there is far too much poetry about it to be rendered in plastic, and directing it does not seem like pumping up an inflatable, however much huffing and puffing it involves. It is much more unpredictable than that: like getting an elephant to dance on a tightrope. Oh yes, and sing too.</p>

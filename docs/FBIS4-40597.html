			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikolayev and Pavel Vasilyev: "Why Viktor </F> Chernomyrdin Is Heading Abroad"]    [Text]A Commission in the United States    Ridding ourselves as rapidly as possible of Cold War relics  in the sphere of Russian-American business cooperation -- both  sides have been working on a solution to this highly important  task in recent years. The working trip to the United States by  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 21-23 June could be the next step  along this road. On this occasion the government head is acting  in the role of co-chairman of the Russian-American  Intergovernmental Commission for Economic and Technological  Cooperation. He will participate in its third session, to be  held at Washington's Jackson Place Conference Center.    According to advance information from reliable sources, in  contrast with the two previous sessions this meeting will not  only embrace a wider range of questions but will also proceed  without previously prepared draft decisions on the issues under  discussion: These will be hammered out in the course of debate  and reached through consensus. So the experts will have to  sweat it out a little and put in some solid work. The sides'  efforts will be concentrated in six committees: space, energy,  defense sector conversion, the development of business  cooperation, ecology, and science and technology.    The forthcoming business meeting, as we can see, promises to  be highly interesting and productive. Its results will be  expressed not so much in the specific value of prospective deals  as in the content of the talks: the thrust lies in developing  an all-round Russian-American partnership and establishing a  balance of interests in various spheres.    In this sense the Committee for Business Cooperation headed  by Ministers Oleg Davydov and Ronald Brown is of vital  significance. Its field of vision embraces reciprocal access to  the two countries' markets and customs, taxation, and  export-import policy. We, of course, are interested in securing  recognition -- which we already have from the EU -- of Russia's  status as a country with a transitional economy. The American  side wants to break into the Russian market. At the same time  it is noted that our products are more competitive than  America's, as they cost less owing to cheap labor.    It is planned to sign a number of agreements. But it is  still too early to talk about them. Nevertheless, experts  preparing the working documents believe that it could prove  possible, for example, to sign a treaty on the construction of  an international space station (the United States is prepared to  allocate $400 million for the first two stages of the project).    The upcoming three days of talks will be complex because  eventual agreement will depend not only on the degree of mutual  understanding between the Russian and American administrations.  Here, indeed, in the experts' view, very few difficulties arise.  However, finance for the programs lies in the hands of Congress:  Its viewpoint on Russian-American cooperation differs somewhat  from that of Bill Clinton's team. Our premier, as is obvious  from the preliminary program for the trip, does have a chance to  meet with the U.S. congressmen, to talk to America's business  community about the projects under preparation, and to harness  their support in favor of plans to deepen the bilateral  partnership.    It looks as though Viktor Chernomyrdin's U.S. visit will be  packed with meetings with business people and invitations from  top companies and corporations. The program's details are still  being finalized but even now, on the eve of the trip, it is  quite clear that some tricky work and a packed and hectic  schedule await the Russian premier.  <H5>  ...And a Congress in Italy </H5>   On his way to the United States Viktor Chernomyrdin will  stop  off in Italy to address participants in the 19th International  Gas Congress, to be held 20-23 June in Milan.    The largest delegation at this forum will probably be from  Russia. Apart from Viktor Chernomyrdin himself, Rem Vyakhirev,  president of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint Stock Company, is also  expected to deliver a speech. The conference participants have  a special interest in Russia because Russia supplies the bulk of  Europe's gas. It is characteristic that the conference  participants include representatives not only from countries  producing gas but from those consuming it too.    It is not ruled out that while in Milan the Russian premier  could meet with his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi.</p>

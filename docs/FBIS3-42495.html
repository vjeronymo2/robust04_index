			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Gladkevich: "The Housing Problem in the </F> Armed Forces--a Political Problem"]    [Text] "It is one step from hope to despair. And it has  already been taken...." Unfortunately, this is precisely the  tone of most of the letters coming to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA from  servicemen, officers in the reserves, and retired officers  without apartments. The hopes raised by the edicts of the  president of the Russian Federation "On Measures To Strengthen  the Social Protection of Service Members and Persons Discharged  From Military Service" (February 1992) and "On Additional  Measures for the Financing and Acquisition of Housing for  Service Members" (July 1992) and by the law of the Russian  Federation "On the Status of Service Members" (January 1993)  were first replaced, in their words, by depression caused by the  obvious unwillingness of local authorities to pay back to  military people their debts for housing and the decline in the  rate and volume of construction and then by despair.    "For many years, our families have not had roofs over their  heads," lieutenant colonels Brestel and Teselkin, captains Popov  and Khramtsov, Senior Warrant Officer Kryuchkov, and others  (altogether 36 signatures) from Kaliningrad Oblast write to the  editor's office. They counted on the law on status but in July  of last year Colonel General Valeriy Mironov, deputy minister of  defense, signed a directive that permits the dismissal of  officers without housing from the ranks of the armed forces. And  this is despite the fact that the law prohibits the dismissal of  service members who have served 10 years or longer without  providing housing for them and the members of their families.    In a similar situation were Lieutenant Colonel of the  Reserves Valeriy Semushkin (Gvardeysk in Kaliningrad Oblast),  who was discharged to the reserves in violation of the law  without being provided with an apartment, and majors Belichko  and Ivanov (Kemerovo), who were discharged to the reserves under  the same circumstances.    Alas, here it is not a matter of the "ill will" of the  military department. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation was itself a hostage of our imperfect legislation and  lack of a normal practice for the execution of the laws. Let us  turn to the content of the law "On the Status of Service  Members." Article 22 of the law does indeed prohibit the  discharge of service members to the reserves and retirement  without the provision of housing. But this same law states  (Article 15) that "citizens discharged from military  service...are provided with living premies by the agencies of  local self-administration in accordance with the established  norms within three months at the latest...." Does not the  presence of this article in the law infer that...officers and  warrant officers without housing will nevertheless be discharged  from service?    The readers of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA noticed this total  discrepancy  a long time ago. In their letters, they justifiably note that  even today, a year after the passage of the law "On the Status  of Service Members," the articles that constitute the so-called  housing block do not actually work. And Lt. Col. of the Reserves  Andrey Molostov from Orel has good reason to think: "If tomorrow  the editor's office receives a report that even one officer or  warrant officer discharged from military service received an  apartment within three months, then I am certain that it will be  published in the pages of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA under the heading  `Sensation'...."    As for the directive signed by the deputy minister of  defense, it does indeed contradict the law. And this was  confirmed in the Main Directorate of the General Procurator's  Office of the Russian Federation in its supervision of the  execution of the laws in the military forces of the Russian  Federation, officially protesting it on 8 December of last year.  On 30 December, the minister of defense of the Russian  Federation revoked it.    Overall, of course, the problem of eliminating the lack of  housing in the army is a matter of distribution. If only there  were something to distribute.    Here are some figures. In 1993, it was planned to construct  and acquire 82,000 apartments for military people through all  sources of financing. And of course the plan for 1993 and the  state program for 1993-1995 for the provision of service members  and persons discharged from military service and their family  members with housing did not completely resolve the problem,  although they did at least make it possible to stop the dramatic  worsening of the housing situation in the army and to reduce the  number of officers on the waiting list to a little more than  100,000 by the end of 1995. The only condition that they were  required to observe was the performance of obligations by all  sides. But practically from the very beginning of the  realization of the state program, the Ministry of Finance put it  on strict rations with respect to financing. In the first seven  months of 1993, for example, the Ministry of Finance was  supposed to finance capital construction amounting to almost 500  billion rubles [R] under the program. But actually only R298  billion were allocated for these purposes. The credits to the  Ministry of Defense for housing construction were allocated  without the appropriate indexing, which essentially paralyzed  the work of the building organizations.    And most often the explanation was extremely simple: they  said that the state did not have enough money for everything and  that it was necessary to be patient.... "But how long can one  wait?" write the wives of servicemen of an aviation squadron  withdrawn from the territory of Latvia to Saransk (Mordovia) in  1992. "How long can our families stay in hotels and children's  sanitary camps? We live in extremely crowded conditions, in  housing not suitable for family life and without basic  amenities. At the time when the unit was being pulled out of  Latvia, we were promised that housing would be built quickly at  the new station. In May of last year, the air force command for  Moscow District issued specific information, saying that those  on the waiting list would receive the first few dozen apartments  by May 1993. Alas, we did not receive anything and essentially  there is no construction under way--there are no funds. But to  live in a hotel they demand the timely payment of several tens  of thousands of rubles. Where can we get this money, if our  husbands are not paid on time? And there is nothing with which  to feed our children...."    But this is not all. Many local administrations essentially  did not pay their debts to service personnel for housing and  were openly scornful of the directives of the president of  Russia. And this is despite the fact that in Moscow, Tver,  Murmansk, and several other oblasts they were able, despite  difficulties, to settle accounts with military people.... Last  year the military people failed to receive more than 10,000  square meters of housing space that was supposed to be built  with funds from the federal budget.    And the prospects are by no means favorable for 1994 either.  A decision by the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation  specified that this year the construction of housing for  military people will be financed at the level of last year. In  the context of the state program with a planned increase of  11,000 square meters for 1994, this sounds either like an  admission of the unsoundness of the control figures incorporated  in it or as disdain for them. In both cases, we are actually  dealing with the failure of the program.    In the opinion of readers, the problem of the provision of  housing to persons discharged from military service has gone  over to a second or possibly even lower category. No one is  carrying out the enforceable acts providing for the allocation  of housing for the resettlement from military posts of persons  who have lost their ties with the armed forces. In the military  districts and fleets, they are more concerned about improving  the living conditions of regular service personnel. "And this is  very painful and insulting," reserve officers and warrant  officers from the town of Gremikha (Northern Fleet) write to the  editor's office, "we served on ships and in units of the fleet  for many years and some of us lived all of our lives here, in  this town with difficult climatic conditions. And now, when our  health resources are just about exhausted, it turns out that  there is no place for us in regions with a more favorable  climate and with medical facilities more oriented toward people  of our age.... Out of 35 reserve officers and warrant officers,  only 5 people received the expected housing last year. It may be  that they will allocate abundant housing to the fleet but will  it reach us here in Gremikha?"    Whether or not Gremikha gets housing, this is a question for  the command of the Northern Fleet. But of course there is no  abundance either in the Northern Fleet or in other fleets and  districts. Everywhere they are on starvation rations with  respect to housing....    Judging by the mail to the editor's office, those without  apartments have long since quit believing that there is no money  for the construction of housing. "They can come up with hundreds  of millions of dollars for the building of a parliamentary  center, but is this the most acute problem in Russia?" asks  Stepan Ugolnikov from Saratov. And he draws this conclusion:  there is money but there is no order, there are laws but there  is no respect for them, and there are responsible persons but  they are not taking their responsibility very seriously. And one  can find solutions but one must make a genuine search for them.    By the way, the editor's office of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has  received many proposals on this in its mail. The most  constructive of them essentially amount to the following: if  there is a particular legislative base, there needs to be a  mechanism for the realization of the laws, a mechanism based on  the strictest responsibility of officials, administrative heads,  managers of ministries and departments, and members of the  cabinet of ministers for the execution of the laws. The tasks  defined by the programs that constitute state policy with  respect to the armed forces must be resolved whatever the  difficulties may be....    To a certain extent, the constructiveness of these proposals  is relative. This, in a manner of speaking, is the  constructiveness of the object of state policy, the human being  who does not bring about a solution but expects one.  Nevertheless.... Some readers are proposing the allocation of  long-term loans at a favorable rate of interest (and possibly no  interest at all) to military personnel without housing and to  those who have been discharged from military service for the  construction of housing, the transfer of all the funds from  varous sources of financing to a single customer for housing  (the Ministry of Defense), and so on. But Vladimir Sergeyevich  Katin, to whom, as he writes, it is painful to see the disorder  of Russian military personnel, is proposing to the government  and Ministry of Defense that they pay closer attention to the  so-called unfinished construction: "At the central farmstead of  the joint stock company "Velikopolye" (Smolensk Oblast), there  are 10 unfinished two-apartment cottages, which the sovkhoz  began to build for its workers in 1989-1990 but did not  complete. They should have finished building them on a shared  basis with "Velikopolye" and you would have seen that several  families of military people would have had a roof over their  heads...." But whatever might have been heard, it appears that  all of this is nothing new for those who are obligated by their  official position to solve the problem of overcoming the lack of  housing in the army. They know all of this or at least should  know it....    Today it is already obvious that the resolution of the  housing problem in the armed forces is not so much a social and  economic task as it is a political one. Russia is a state in the  process of reform and this process has just begun to get under  way seriously. In such a situation, sensible politicians are  doing everything they can to strengthen the institutions of  power (and the armed forces are one of them). To allow the army  or in any case a large detachment of people who comprise it to  continue along the path of disappointment in the current  authority, along the path leading from hope to despair, is at  least imprudent. After all, the palette of human moods is not  limited to despair....</p>

The visitors denounced the continuation of the blockade as a  crime, since Iraq has fulfilled its obligations toward the  so-called United Nations. They also condemned the crimes caused  by the blockade, such as the death of children and old people  due to shortage of food and medicine.    The members expressed their admiration for Iraq's mighty  resources, which have contributed to the rebuilding of what was  destroyed by the evil aggressors. They noted that these  resources are not just for Iraq, but for the entire Arab nation,  which the enemies seek to undermine.    Dr. Ahmad 'Aziz, director general of the Libyan Cultural  Affairs Department, said: The resources we have seen in Iraq  confirm the nation's vitality and ability for sacrifice and  creativity. Had the Arab countries been given the opportunity  to solidly unite together, they would have become a great  nation, contributing to the building of human civilization and  asserting its place among world nations, thus realizing its  ambitions and will.    Dr. 'Aziz added that the blockades imposed on Iraq and Libya  show that the imperialist states do not want the Arab nation and  the Arab people, whether in Libya or Iraq, to assert their Arab  identity. They want to suppress the Arab nation's aspiration for  unity and power, he said.    Regarding the prospects for cultural cooperation between the  two fraternal countries, Dr. 'Aziz said that cultural activity  in Iraq is as good and distinctive as it is in the Libyan  Jamahiriyah. Holding Libyan cultural functions in Iraq such as  these, he added, will mark a new beginning, God willing, for  further interaction in the cultural and media fields between the  two fraternal countries.

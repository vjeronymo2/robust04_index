			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KATELLA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MILLIKAN EDGES WESTERN TO WIN TITLE  </P> <P> For three quarters of the Katella High School basketball tournament  championship game Friday night, Western held a slight edge over Long Beach  Millikan, not just in points but in intensity and smarts.  </P> <P> But with the fourth quarter, Western's fizz faded while Millikan, the  tournament's defending champion, took over for a 67-66 victory.  </P> <P> Not that it wasn't hard-fought.  </P> <P> Millikan entered the fourth quarter trailing, 49-47, but after tying the game  at 60 and then going on a 7-0 run with just over a minute remaining.  </P> <P> Western threatened again, though. Robbie Shelton scored on a baseline drive,  Cory Manliguis scored off a steal by Thomas Barraza and Sam Sabbara sank both  ends of a one-and-one to cut Western's deficit to 67-66 with 21 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> Western had one last chance when Millikan's Dario Del Cid missed a free throw  with 10 seconds left. Shelton grabbed the rebound and drove the length of the  court, but his layup was smothered by Millikan.  </P> <P> "We played just a little bit harder, I think," Millikan Coach Bill Odell said.  "We went to small (players) in the fourth quarter. . . .  </P> <P> "I think that the quickness is what made a difference. But the kids just kept  coming at them."  </P> <P> Although Western outscored Millikan, 15-11, in the first quarter, Millikan  chipped at Western's lead gradually, and trailed, 36-33, at the half.  </P> <P> Sabbara, who missed his first four shots in the game, scored 24 points --  including four three-pointers -- to lead Western (8-3).  </P> <P> Shelton scored 16 and Barraza had 15 for Western.  </P> <P> Millikan (12-3) was led by Ibn Suburi Maddred with 18 points. Pat Thacker added  14 and Dante Powell had 11 to help the Rams.  </P> <P> In the third-place game:  </P> <P> Bell 35, Servite 34 -- Servite trailed, 34-26, going into the fourth quarter,  but fell just short of the victory.  </P> <P> Bell took a 15-8 lead after the first quarter, and Servite cut its deficit to  25-18 at halftime.  </P> <P> Steve Marusich, a 6-foot-7 senior, led Servite with 13 points.  </P> <P> Sal Serrano and Alex Del Hierro each scored 10 points for Bell.  </P> <P> In the consolation championship:  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 66, Katella 49 -- Paul Preuss scored a game-high 20 points to  lead Rancho Alamitos and Richard Pearce added 12 for the Vaqueros.  </P> <P> Brian Franklin led Katella with 14 points, Paul Schroeder had 11 and Lee Baca  had 10.  </P></p>

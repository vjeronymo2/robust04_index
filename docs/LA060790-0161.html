			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTAKER HAS OPERATING LOSS; INTEREST COSTS CITED  </P> <P> Whittaker Corp. on Wednesday reported a $3.3-million loss from continuing  operations for its fiscal second quarter on sales of $51.2 million.  </P> <P> In the same period of last year, Whittaker posted income from continuing  operations of $3.3 million on sales of $45.5 million.  </P> <P> Whittaker recorded a $2.1-million loss from discontinued operations during the  second quarter, which ended April 30, contrasted with a profit of $4.3 million  in that category during the year-ago quarter.  </P> <P> A company press release blamed the downturn primarily on sharply higher  interest expenses because of debt incurred in its 1989 recapitalization, which  involved buying back stock and selling some parts of the business. The Los  Angeles-based company now focuses on two areas: aerospace and biotechnology.  </P> <P> Because of an $80.5-million gain from the sale of discontinued operations,  Whittaker reported net income for the second quarter of $75.1 million. Net  income was $12.6 million in the same period last year.  </P> <P> Whittaker also announced that it has replaced a $432.5-million bank line of  credit with a $140-million credit facility. Whittaker took a $7-million pretax  writeoff in the second quarter of unamortized costs from the old loan.  Whittaker is reducing its debt faster than the company had planned, a spokesman  said.  </P></p>

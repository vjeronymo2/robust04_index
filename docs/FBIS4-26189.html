			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] According to a mainland-based source, the three  defendants in the Chientao [Qiandao] Lake case may be executed  by shooting on 20 June.    After hearing the news, Hsu Hui-yu, secretary general of the  Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] replied helplessly: The case  may end up this way -- with no definite answers. Hsu Hui-yu  said: The issues concerning the Chientao Lake case will not be  resolved through hastily shooting and executing the three  defendants, but through investigating and clarifying the truth  of the case and on paying compensation for losses. Hsu Hui-yu  believed: Resolving these issues is more realistic than holding  routine or high-level talks. The mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] has written three  letters to the SEF within two or three days, proposing to hold,  at an early date, a second set of Ku- Wang [Ku Chenfu-Wang  Taohan (Gu Zhenfu-Wang Daohan]) talks, a second set of  Chiao-Tang [Chiao Jenhe-Tang Shupei (Jiao Renhe-Tang Shubei])  talks, and a fifth round of routine consultations.    Hsu Hui-yu indicated: According to SEF-ARATS agreements on  contacts and talks, it is necessary for both sides to hold  talks. However, the problem at present is the agenda. We cannot  simply say hello, rush through the meetings, and bid one another  goodbye.    Hsu Hui-yu indicated: On the one hand, the mainland wants to  hold talks with Taiwan. On the other, it has not responded to  the issues of settling the aftermath of the Chientao Lake case.  We really find it hard to understand this situation.    Recently, the ARATS has successively facsimiled three  letters  to the SEF, urging high-level SEF-ARATS talks. Commenting on  the situation, SEF officials indicated: The aftermath of the  Chientao Lake case has yet to be resolved. The mainland should  at least express its sincerity in settling these issues before  the SEF and the ARATS can properly hold follow-up consultations  and high-level talks.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (13): Taking a longer view - Andrew Baxter finds that performances vary but the overall picture for the sector is good / The engineering industry FOR UK-based engineering companies exporting to world markets, the ability to make good, competitively priced products seems to be half the battle. On top of that comes perseverance and the ability to take a long-term view. The nine general engineering companies in the Top 100 cover products ranging from ropes to pumps and food manufacturing equipment, with household names such as APV, Weir and Vosper Thornycroft rubbing shoulders with less-well known companies such as Northern Ireland-based FG Wilson Engineering. Compared with their exports in 1991, the companies' performance varied quite widely last year, with advances leading declines by six to three. But overall they managed to boost exports by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 1.348bn. This is a creditable performance given the depressed state of many world markets for engineered products. The biggest exporter is Vickers, producer of tanks, Rolls-Royce cars, bearings and medical equipment. It lifted total exports by 35.1 per cent last year to Pounds 250.4m, according to the top 100 figures. But the biggest rise in exports was notched up by a foreign company, German-owned Robert Bosch. The vehicle components group more than doubled its exports from Pounds 45.8m in 1991 to Pounds 93.5m last year. The achievement is a direct result of Bosch' decision to manufacture compact alternators at a plant at Miskin, South Glamorgan. Production began only in January 1991 and it is projected that the factory will reach full output by the mid-1990s. The factory was always intended to be Bosch' single European source of supply for compact alternators, which are lighter and more powerful than conventional units. Almost all last year's exports went to continental Europe, but the factory is also selling to vehicle manufacturers in Japan. In the post-cold war era of defence cuts, another creditable export achievement was recorded at Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based naval shipbuilder. Exports rose by 46.9 per cent to Pounds 147.3m, with performance boosted by two substantial orders from the Royal Navy of Oman, for two corvettes, and the Qatar Navy for four fast strike craft. Martin Jay, group managing director, says that the order book is standing at a record level of Pounds 700m, of which about 95 per cent is accounted for by the company's exports. But he stresses that last year's successes were no flash in the pan: 'During the last 30 years we have exported to 30 navies around the world. We have the great benefit of selling to existing satisfied customers.' He expresses confidence about winning further export orders. 'We are certainly very buoyant,' he adds. FG Wilson, meanwhile, raised its exports by 43.3 per cent to Pounds 117.4m. The company produces diesel electric generating sets used in applications such as stand-by power for hospitals or shopping centres, and did particularly well last year in the Middle East and Australasia. Last month it won the Electrical Review's export award, sponsored by GEC Alsthom, in recognition of export sales which have grown by an average 39 per cent a year since 1987. Apart from having a product that is now recognised worldwide, the privately-owned company's export expansion has also been helped by being patient. Its US subsidiary took two years to break even, and its French distributor has yet to make a profit, but Wilson considers its presence in France to be 'absolutely critical' to its growth plans, according to the award citation. The company has also made agreements with a number of companies which export its gensets, including Ingersoll-Rand, Massey Ferguson and Caterpillar, to penetrate new export markets. The privately-owned FG Wilson employs 1,000 people, with 700 workers in Larne. The company recently moved into an old GEC factory there, consolidating manufacturing which used to take place at five separate facilities.  ---------------------------------------------              ENGINEERING INDUSTRY  --------------------------------------------- Rank   Engineering       Exports     % chng. 1992   companies            1992     on '91  --------------------------------------------- 50     Vickers            250.4       35.1 57     Alcatel Alsthom    226.0        5.1 67     IMI                169.0       -4.5 75     Vosper             147.3       46.9 80     Weir Group         125.6      108.0 83     FG Wilson        117.4       43.3 85     Ingersoll-Rand     113.0      -14.8 90     Simon Eng.         105.8      -11.6 98     Robert Bosch        93.5      104.1  --------------------------------------------- Total                   1,348.0       15.6  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Intel Intel is getting into the habit of releasing results which unsettle the equity market. Yesterday's fall in the shares following the release of full-year figures was as great as the correction which greeted the third-quarter results in October. Slightly lower than anticipated earnings - despite an unexpected financing gain related to a new plant in Ireland - was the immediate cause. But it is a measure of the high expectations of Intel's growth prospects that even minor disappointments can cause such an upset. The immediate question is whether Intel can sell enough of its new Pentium microprocessors to justify the costs sunk into research and manufacturing. The company's comment yesterday that shipments are running to schedule is comforting. With capital spending running at Dollars 2bn a year, though, Pentium chips need to take around 15 per cent of the world personal computer market this year if Intel is to make a decent return on that investment. Competition in the past generation of chips from AMD make it all the more important for Intel to drive the market forward, particularly with IBM likely to enter the market before too long. While Intel's shares have outperformed the US market by 80 per cent over the last 18 months, the long term challengers to its market dominance are only starting to gather momentum.</p>

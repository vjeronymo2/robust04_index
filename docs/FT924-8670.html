			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Leading Article: CBI obfuscation THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has, in recent weeks, shown a willingness to speak out. But by lecturing the government rather than its members, it merely continues the traditional British practice of blaming others for industry's own shortcomings. 'Making it in Britain', a report from the CBI's National Manufacturing Council, is a typically worthy and woolly document. It rightly argues that the British manufacturing base is too small and inefficient. But the overwhelming impression created by the report is that government action is both the primary cause and cure for industry's weakness. The priorities for industry, listed in the report, are frustratingly vague: industry must 'establish a clear sense of strategic direction' and 'develop greater consumer focus in every facet of business'. It is the government that must act now by cutting corporation tax, lowering interest rates and freezing public sector pay. Yet the document has a gaping hole. It contains almost no discussion of either pay or profits, variables which industrialists influence directly. The depressing fact is that the productivity gains of the 1980s were consumed rather than invested, something the CBI report omits to mention. Between 1980 and 1990, real wages rose by 18 per cent in the US, 29 per cent in west Germany, 31 per cent in France and 42 per cent in the UK. That is why UK profitability and investment remain low by international standards. British industrialists and trade unionists pay themselves too much, a reality they squirm to avoid. Ford UK is typical. Since the recession began, its workers have received two pay increases: more than 12 per cent in the first year and 5 per cent in the second, years in which inflation averaged 6.8 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Little wonder profits are squeezed. But it is not Ford's personnel managers and union negotiators who will lose their jobs. The UK economy badly needs a strong employers' organisation with the courage to tell its members and their employees that they should put profits and investment before increases in wages and executive salaries. It needs leaders who are prepared to say that pay settlements are still twice as high as they should be if the competitiveness gains from sterling's devaluation are not to be lost. This is a message the CBI, along with the government and the Labour party, finds it impossible or impolitic to articulate.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERPRETING 2ND AMENDMENT: RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP  </P> <P> None of the NRA members who complained about The Times' courageous "22 Cowardly  Acts" editorial (Sept. 17) gave any valid reason for objecting to a 15-day  waiting period for the delivery of any firearm. Don't they plan their hunting  trips far enough in advance to order the newest weapon in time?  </P> <P> They make a big point about "criminals" getting them regardless -- but the San  Ysidro and the Stockton (schoolyard) mass murders, with a total of 26 people  dead and 30 wounded, were committed by psychopaths. We law-abiding gun-fearing  citizens want guns kept out of the hands of mentally-deranged random killers  who can walk into a gun shop and buy one right now.  </P> <P> If the law-abiding NRA members want to form a militia and have a right to bear  arms, fine, but remember that when the Second Amendment was written, there was  no viable army, there was no National Guard, there weren't any state, county  and city police departments. It's the "well-regulated militia" that they  conveniently forget about when quoting their favorite part of the Second  Amendment.  </P> <P> Ninety-one percent of Americans favor a waiting period for gun purchases  (Times, Dec. 21, 1988). Politicians take notice that there are more of us than  of the high-pressure gun lobby and its deep-pocket NRA supporters.  </P> <P> HERB HERR  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

Their appeal to Yeltsin says that unlike Belarus, Ukraine  and  Uzbekistan and other republics of the former Soviet Union,  Russia has acquired steady reformists such Yegor Gaydar,  Anatoliy Chubays and Boris Fedorov due to your personal  involvement. The DRM is now puzzled over Yeltsin's support to  the upholders of the idea of "squeezing" members of the  reformist wing out of the government to please "red" monopoly  directors with Viktor Chernomyrdin in charge. DRM leaders accuse  Yeltsin of backing up what is in essence is a new "Soviet  government".    Participants in the meeting reminded Yeltsin of his verbal  commitment to "the policy of radical reforms" he had expressed  at a recent news conference during U.S. president Bill Clinton's  visit to Moscow. However, they said, Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin announcing the make up of a new cabinet "made it  clear the pattern of reforms would be corrected".    DRM has warned Yeltsin of intending to put up resistance to  the new economic policy leading to the winding up of reforms.    The appeal ends with a question to the President: "What is  your own policy, Boris Nikolayevich?"</p>

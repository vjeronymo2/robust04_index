			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Socialist Party "On the </F> Attitude Toward the Ruling LDDP" issued on 26 March 1994 in  Vilnius]    [Text] People's disillusionment with the destructive  policy of the right-wing radicals was responsible for the  victory of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] in the  Seimas [parliament] elections. Moreover, the social democratic  principles in the party program also influenced this victory.    Assuming power, the LDDP managed to slightly normalize the  political situation in the country and partially halt the  dangerous confrontation among political forces.    Unfortunately, due to its inherent faults (an eclectic  theoretical approach, the lack of political will, the infinite  syndrome of remorse, and so on), the ruling party failed to  introduce essential changes in Lithuania's situation or offer  more serious resistance to the destructive right-wing forces.    Pressured by these right-wing forces, the LDDP Seimas  majority adopted a number of extremely equivocal decisions: On  the undifferentiated litas' exchange rate, on joining NATO, and  on free arms trade.    It is already obvious today, however, that LDDP actions have  become more dynamic. Work of law enforcement institutions has  been strengthened. More attention and money are being devoted  to the resolution of social problems. LDDP's foreign policy has  become more active and constructive.    If these tendencies prevail in future LDDP activities, the  Lithuanian socialists will support the moves of the ruling  party. Such positive actions really help overcome the crisis in  Lithuania, prevent political instability, and serve the  interests of the entire population. The Socialist Party  sincerely admits this.    We are determined to point out the government's mistakes in  a  good-natured manner in the future as well. In contrast with the  absolute majority of the right parties, however, we respect the  constitutional right of the LDDP to govern Lithuania until the  next Seimas elections.    [Signed] Lithuanian Socialist Party Council    [Dated] 26 March 1994, Vilnius.</p>

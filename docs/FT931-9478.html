			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais slips into red with FFr1.3bn net loss CIMENTS Francais, the troubled French cement group hit last autumn by a scandal over off-balance sheet dealings, has fallen into the red with a net loss of FFr1.3bn (Dollars 238m) for 1992. The losses, which are mainly due to the exceptional deficit of FFr1bn made by unauthorised transactions, are worse than expected. Less than a week ago Ciments Francais estimated the level of last year's losses at FFr1bn. Ciments Francais yesterday disclosed that it had been forced by the Spanish stock market authorities to make a Pta4.11bn (Dollars 35.9m) partial bid for Cementos Molins, the Spanish cement company embroiled in this autumn's scandal. The partial bid follows the discovery that, in the course of the illegal dealings, Ciments Francais, a minority shareholder in Cementos Molins with an authorised 25.3 per cent holding, had raised its stake further which took it above the maximum level permitted under Spanish law. The French group has agreed to the Spanish authorities' request to bid for a further 10 per cent of Cementos Molins at a price of Pta3,700 a share. Ciments Francais has sold the other shareholdings amassed in its off-balance sheet dealings. The partial bid for Cementos Molins was the final stage of Ciments' restructuring after the scandal which triggered the resignation of Mr Pierre Conso as chairman. However, the FFr1bn exceptional losses on the unauthorised investments took a heavy toll on Ciments Francais last year. The group which, like other building material manufacturers, has been badly affected by the downturn in the European construction industry, saw turnover fall to FFr14.9bn in 1992 from FFr16.45bn in 1991. The group said that FFr574m of the FFr1.55bn fall in sales was due to the decline in trading, FFr672m to disposals and FFr300m to currency factors.</p>

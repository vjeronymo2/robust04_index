			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Heavyweight Riddick Bowe remained undefeated, stopping former World Boxing  Council champion Pinklon Thomas on an eighth-round technical knockout at  Washington.  </P> <P> It was the 17th knockout for Bowe (19-0), who battered Thomas through most of  the scheduled 10-rounder until the 32-year-old fighter could not answer the  bell for the ninth round.  </P> <P> The victory is expected to earn Bowe a bout against Bert Cooper on the  undercard of the Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield title fight Oct. 25.  </P> <P> "It was a learning experience and Pinklon brought the best out in me," Bowe  said. "Some say he's washed up, a has-been. But he brought out the best in me.  I don't care what any of you guys say."  </P> <P> In the sixth round, Thomas was staggered but wouldn't fall as Bowe weakened him  with a series of quick combinations. Bowe swung freely for Thomas' head in the  last three rounds as many in the crowd shouted for referee Sylvester Stevens to  stop the fight.  </P> <P> Thomas shook his head at Stevens after stumbling back to his corner after the  eighth, finally ending the fight.  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (3): Getting paid is a high priority / Profile of an entrepreneur LIKE MANY budding entrepreneurs in eastern Europe, Mr Ljubomir Gibinsky, the brains behind Prime Investment Trust Holding, one of Bulgaria's fastest growing private banking and invest- ment groups, made his first million as a money changer, write Anthony Robinson and Virginia Marsh. Last year the group's banks, newspapers, consulting services, tourism and money changing activities reported a turnover of Lv25bn (about Dollars 1bn), according to the former philosophy and political science lecturer from Plovdiv, Bulgaria's ancient second city. For four years the portly, pale-faced capitalist with a goatee beard and long, manicured nails has hardly had a day off. Indeed, he has not left Bulgaria. Last month he picked up a new passport in order to accompany Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister, to Moscow on a trade mission designed to revive trade and settle Moscow's outstanding debt. 'Business in eastern Europe is all about assuring payment,' comments Mr Gibinsky who, like many Bulgarian intell- ectuals, spent years studying in Russia, in his case at Moscow State university. The high priority he attaches to getting paid also applies at home where collecting overdue payments on behalf of indebted state companies and other clients forms a substantial part of his business. 'Bulgarian companies are being strangled by debt. We help to keep them afloat and advise them on privatisation,' he says. Among his clients is one of Bulgaria's biggest steel and engineering companies whose management has been approached by foreign companies such as ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power engin- eering group, Mannesmann of Germany and Kobe of Japan, which, he believes, want to buy the company in order to close it down. 'If we can keep this company afloat for two years it could become the best machine building factory in the Balkans. It can make castings of up to 80 tonnes, but is only working at 20 per cent capacity. If we allow it to be strangled by debt now, it will go under,' he believes. 'I'm not a nationalist but we have to protect our future and the jobs of thousands of Bulgarians are at stake,' he adds. Mr Gibinsky sees his function as that of a home-grown merchant banker, helping to rationalise the Bulgarian economy. To many ordinary Bulgarians, crushed by rising prices and unemployment, he and his four partners - a doctor, a physicist, an economist and a driver - reflect the unlikely background of Bulgaria's budding entrepreneurial class. With their silver Mercedes and smart suits they now look to many Bulgarians like the capitalist sharks they were warned about in their socialist schooldays. Mr Gibinsky lives in a house opposite Sofia jail. 'People used to say that I now live opposite the jail, but in a few years time I'll be living opposite my house,' he says with a rueful shrug of his shoulders at the enduring conservatism of his compatriots and the suspicion which accompanies new wealth.</p>

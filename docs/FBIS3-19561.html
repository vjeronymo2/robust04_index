			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marios Ploritis: "Concerns and Shameless </F> Actions: The Embargo's Double-Edged Sword"]    [Excerpts] The embargo decided by the government 11 days  ago is a strange coin. Strange and poisonous.    On the one side of the coin, the embargo seems to be the  result of need, the "ultimate measure" or "countermeasure"  against [Kiro] Gligorov's [president of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence and provocative  stance.    "Ultimate," of course, since we lost all the battles on  account of our own aimlessness and silliness. The problem now is  whether the "ultimate measure" may become the "ultimate  punishment" for us. Let us review this, going against the  current of enthusiasm generated by the government's decision.    It is commonplace to say that such measures are only  justified if they are not proved "nonultimate," that is, if they  lead to the fruitful untying of the Gordian knot and not to  worse entanglements (and we are not talking of "war," of course,  an eventuality that even the most paranoid among us cannot  grasp). In other words, how effective and how painless for us is  the embargo?    1. The effectiveness of the economic embargo against a given  country is always doubtful when it is applied solely by one  country, as vital as the "door" of the country imposing the  embargo may be for the other party. The embargoed country will  seek an outlet from other neighboring countries willing to help  as long as their interests are not affected. This is all the  more true in the case of FYROM, which can be resupplied, not  only through the Bulgarian city of Pirgos and the Albanian city  of Dhyrrakhion, but also from other rich and sympathetic  countries. [passage omitted]    2. The Greek measures are aimed at bending Gligorov's  intransigence. However, it is not improbable that our action  will increase it and shape it, because Gligorov, who is viewed  by the "international community" as "wronged" and "persecuted,"  will be proclaimed the "martyr of the Balkans," whom Athens'  Neros are throwing into a lion's den of hunger and asphyxiation.  Like the Christians thrown into the Roman arenas, Mr Gligorov  will have every reason to persist in his "faith," encouraged by  the applause of his philanthropic extollers. [passage omitted]    Thus the "countermeasures" may become "antimeasures," a  boomerang for the "measure-takers" and a "golden opportunity"  for the real troublemakers in the Balkans.    The other side of the coin depicts the bottomless  shamelessness of the "important" others. [passage omitted]  Foreign ministers, foreign diplomats, and the foreign media  "bad-mouth" Greece because:    I. "The embargo will destabilize the Balkans." This is  repeated by those who, through their hasty recognition of the  Yugoslav republics, blew up Balkan stability and caused the  terrible civil conflagration for "shameful goals." (They even  admit it themselves in more lucid moments). It could be said  that their "post-facto knowledge" would somehow bring them back  to reality, but of course, it is not in their interest to do  so...    2. "The Greek embargo is an overreaction. It is unjustified  and especially harsh." However, was their own embargo against  Serbia any less harsh? Was it dictated by humaneness or by naked  partiality against one of the adversaries, declared "the only  guilty party, the only barbarian, the only killer of innocent  people"? [passage omitted]    As for the allegation that only thanks to the embargo  against  the Serbs and the specter of NATO intervention were some peace  avenues opened up in the former Yugoslavia, it justifies the  Greek embargo, whose goal is the solution of the FYROM impasse  without the bloodshed of their own "measures."    3. "FYROM's isolation violates Community solidarity." Here,  shamelessness becomes audacity, since today's advocates of  Community unity repeatedly and massively ignored the much touted  "solidarity" by recognizing the FYROM statelet--which does not  belong to the Community--thus showing total disregard for a  Community partner. In addition, this was done without even  taking the trouble to inform this partner of the recognition,  and now they blame us because we did not previously inform them  of our "measures!"    4. "The embargo violates international and Community law,"  and other such tearful arguments. This has already been answered  by the Greek Government and reliable international experts. It  is useless to repeat what has already been said. Naturally,  concern about "international law" is at least shameful on the  part of those guilty of innumerable violations, invasions,  embargoes, and killings all over the world in disregard of laws,  rules, and regulations, as long as their economic and strategic  interests were served. [passage omitted] As it is, shameless  profit is the "real meat" of their humanitarian concerns: their  own political, economic, and strategic goals, the movement of  their products (which the Greek embargo prevents) and the  disarray in their plans to create protectorates in the former  Yugoslavia.    Having spoken of a coin in the beginning, these, then, are  the great counterfeiters who "go hunting with saintly pretexts,  but hide shameful purposes in their souls." Their souls, meaning  their pockets....</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank casts shadow over German paper GERMAN government bonds fell back yesterday as market participants speculated that the Bundesbank could move to tighten monetary conditions at next week's regular bi-weekly council meeting. In the cash bond market, the 8 per cent Unity bond maturing January 2002 closed at 100.16, from 100.28 on Wednesday, for a yield of 7.96 per cent. On the London international financial futures exchange, the September bund contract closed at 88.05, from 88.09 at the opening. Volume was heavy at nearly 60,000 contracts. Most analysts said the authorities were unlikely to raise interest rates across the economy. However, it is possible that the central bank will tighten money market conditions. For example, some traders suggested that the Bundesbank could limit the amount borrowed by banks at the Lombard rate - at 9.75 per cent, the emergency funding rate for financial institutions. Alternatively, the Bundesbank could nudge the Lombard rate higher but stop short of raising the discount rate. In the past, the authorities have presented such action as a purely technical move, because overnight call money is trading too close to the Lombard rate. Yesterday, overnight money was trading at 9.61 per cent. THE ITALIAN government bond market was volatile yesterday as traders took positions ahead of meetings today at which ministers will try to reach agreement on budgetary cuts. On the Liffe, the September bond futures closed at 95.69, little changed from the opening level, but slid to 95.33 during the day. In the cash market, the 10-year benchmark fixed rate government bond also closed little changed at 95.20. The government is committed to cutting L30,000bn from this year's budget in order to hit a deficit target of L128,000bn. Treasury officials denied rumours that the government is considering raising withholding tax by half a point to 13 per cent, but analysts said that some tax increases were likely. LONGER-dated UK gilts recovered some of their composure yesterday, shaking off some of the effects of sterling's slide this week and rumours yesterday that the next move in German interest rates might be up rather than down. Shorter-dated bonds edged up only slightly, reflecting the greatest unease. The 10 per cent bonds due 1994 advanced by  1/16 percentage point, to 101 3/8 . Longer-dated issues, however, performed more strongly, with the 9 per cent gilts due 2011 gaining  3/8 of a point to 101 3/32 , a yield of 8.77 per cent. AFTER early weakness related to the digestion of the Dollars 9.77bn in new seven-year notes sold on Wednesday, US Treasury prices recovered to stand firmer late yesterday on short-covering by dealers. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104, yielding 7.592 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up 1/32 at 101 3/16 , yielding 4.348 per cent. Although the seven-year auction went relatively well, dealers had to sell securities at the shorter end of the maturity range to make way for the new issue. Sentiment was also not helped by a 4,000 fall in weekly state unemployment insurance claims, although the decline was in line with market expectations. Treasuries consequently spent the morning in negative territory. Prices turned around later in the day, however, when buyers came in at the lower levels and dealers covered their short positions. JAPANESE government bonds closed in Tokyo little changed from Wednesday's levels following a late rally. The benchmark No 129 issue closed on a yield of 5.18 per cent, from 5.2 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENJOYING THE TRAIL THAT WAS A RAIL IN BERMUDA  </P> <P> During the 1930s and '40s, passengers on the Bermuda Railway were treated to  breathtaking views of palmetto-fringed shores, picturesque hamlets and a  profusion of subtropical plants and flowers.  </P> <P> The train is long gone, but the Bermudan government in 1984 converted the rails  to trails. The result is the Bermuda Railway Trail, a 22-mile footpath that  offers travelers an intimate look at the island.  </P> <P> The Bermuda Railway did not have an easy time getting on track. By the time it  opened in 1931, it already had two dubious achievements to its name: It was the  most costly railway line ever built (more than 1 million), and its rate of  construction -- 2 1/23 miles per year -- the slowest ever achieved.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the railway was a distinct improvement over the muddy roads and  horse-drawn carriages. The line and rolling stock deteriorated after World War  II, and the government sold it -- lock, stock and locomotive -- to British  Guiana, now Guyana.  </P> <P> Now, the former railway line is a wonderful walk. The grade, as you might  expect, is easy. Oleander and hibiscus hedges line the trail, which at times  gives walkers the feeling that they're stepping down a garden path.  </P> <P> Countless subtropical flowers perfume the salt air. The islanders are extremely  polite, helpful and particularly friendly to anyone exploring their island on  foot. All of Bermuda -- cities, sights and beaches -- is within reach of the  Railway Trail.  </P> <P> Although the serious hiker could walk the whole 22-mile trail -- plus numerous  side trails and byways -- in two days, sampling the path a few miles a day is  the better way to go.  </P> <P> Spend mornings walking to some of the island's scattered sights: the Aquarium,  Botanical Garden, Royal Navy Dockyard, Lover's Lake Nature Preserve, plus the  towns of Hamilton, Somerset and St. George. Use the warm afternoons to sunbathe  or sightsee.  </P> <P> Pick up a copy of "The Bermuda Railway Trail Guide" at the Bermuda Department  of Tourism Office in the capital city of Hamilton. This brochure divides the  trail into seven sections and has some excellent maps and descriptions.  </P> <P> Also helping you get on the trail is the island's excellent bus service. Buses  are frequent and (usually) on time. Passengers always say "thank you" to the  driver when disembarking. Almost every part of the Bermuda Railway Trail is  within a short walk of a bus stop.  </P> <P> The trail visits -- or travels near -- virtually every park and preserve on the  island. You'll walk through small groves of native Bermuda cedar and fiddleneck  woodland, as well as stands of allspice trees and Surinam cherry.  </P> <P> Anyone with an interest in subtropical botany will be delighted with a visit to  the Bermuda Botanical Garden, which features a palm garden, hibiscus garden,  fern collection and an aviary.  </P> <P> The Bermuda Railway Trail is also a walk into the island's history. You'll  visit St. George, the second English town to be established in the New World  (Jamestown, Va., was the first).  </P> <P> Another sight is Somerset Bridge, the smallest drawbridge in the world. Just 32  inches wide, this hand-operated relic from 1620 still opens to allow the  passage of a sailboat's mast. Just offshore from the trail is Gibbet Island,  where witches once were burned at the stake.  </P> <P> Intersecting the Bermuda Railway Trail are numerous dirt roads that the  islanders call Tribe Roads. Tribe Road 2 goes to Gibbs Hill Light House, Tribe  Road 4A to Elbow Beach. Other tribe roads lead to other adventures.  </P> <P> Bermuda Railway Trail never wanders too far from food and drink. You can stop  at the local grocery stores and buy items for a picnic, drop by an ice cream  parlor or lunch at a seafood restaurant on conk fritters, fried abalone or fish  with a ginger cream sauce. Wash it down with a British beer or fruity tropical  concoction.  </P> <P> Of course, to really get into the spirit of walking Bermuda, men should pay a  visit to one of the fine clothiers in downtown Hamilton. Proper length for  Bermuda shorts, which usually come in rather plain colors, is two to four  inches above the knee.  </P> <P> Local gentlemen wear them with knee socks, ties and jackets. Official Bermuda  "short season" for the police force is May to November, but many men wear them  year-round.  </P> <P> Winter, for the dedicated walker anyway, might be a good time to hit the  Railway Trail. Bermuda, about 600 miles east of North Carolina, is not a  tropical island. It has hot summers, but only mild winters, when the water can  be cold enough to keep people out. If getting a perfect tan is not your primary  reason for visiting Bermuda, winter is a nice time to go.  </P> <P> Bermuda Rendezvous Time, as they call it on the island, runs from mid-November  to the end of March. Many special events are scheduled during the off-season.  For the budget- conscious traveler, visiting at this time can result in  substantial savings on accommodations. (Bermuda can be a very expensive  island.)  </P> <P> Hiking across Bermuda is definitely not for everyone, thank heaven. But for the  adventurous, the bucolic Bermuda Railway Trail is a great experience.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hiking / Bermuda Railway Trail  </P> <P> Where: Bermuda Island, about 600 miles east of North Carolina.  </P> <P> Length: 22 miles one way.  </P> <P> Terrain: Subtropical island beaches and bluffs.  </P> <P> Highlights: Island history, flora, famous pink-sand beaches.  </P> <P> Degree of Diffculty: Easy.  </P> <P> Precautions: Protection from sun.  </P> <P> For more information: Contact the Bermuda Department of Tourism, 310 Madison  Ave., Suite 201, New York 10017, (800) 223-6106.  </P></p>

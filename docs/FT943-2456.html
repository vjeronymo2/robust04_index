			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canada loosens telephone regulations Cable-TV operators and other newcomers will be free to enter Canada's local telephone market in competition with existing provincial monopolies, under a landmark ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The knife will cut both ways, however, as the CRTC has also cleared the way for the powerful telephone companies, led by Bell Canada, to enter other telecommunications markets, either as carriers or content providers. Although the CRTC has yet to consider whether to award broadcast licences to the phone companies, it will allow them to take part in projects using fast-evolving, video-on-demand technology. The CRTC said in a 165-page report, which was based on six weeks of public hearings, that it intends to place greater reliance on market forces. It concluded that in an era when telecommunications services are limited 'only by the rate of diffusion of new technology, access to capital and the imagination of users . . . it is important . . . that regulation encourage, rather than impede, the provision of efficient, innovative and affordable services.' To make local phone services more attractive to new entrants, the CRTC has agreed to allow the established phone companies to raise their local rates by CDollars 2 a month each year for the next three years. However, revenues generated by these increases must be used to lower long-distance prices, especially for small businesses and private users. The companies at present use a large proportion of long-distance revenues to subsidise local rates but their ability to continue doing so has been limited by competition in the long-distance market, which was opened to new entrants in 1992. The CRTC will further ease regulatory barriers by replacing the existing rate-of-return criteria for phone charges with a system of price caps.</p>

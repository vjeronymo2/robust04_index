Lt Rawi's comment followed a report from a government MP  early last month that Saudi Arabia would offer 60,000 jobs to  Thai workers.    At about the same time, Saudi Arabian Charge d'Affaires  Mohamed Said Khoja said Thai workers were welcome to apply for  visas to go to his country.    Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers since  relations soured some four years ago following the murder of  three Saudi embassy staffers and a businessman in Bangkok as  well as the theft of jewels from the Saudi royal palace.    According to Lt Rawi, no clear-cut policy on Thai workers  has  emerged from Riyadh, where two separate ministries--Home Affairs  and Labour-- deal with questions of visas and work permits.    Lt Rawi also noted that wages in Saudi Arabia had dropped  significantly, with workers from India, Pakistan and the  Philippines being paid only half the amount that Thai workers  used to earn.</p>

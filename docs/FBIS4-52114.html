			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia welcomes the recent historic PLO-Israeli  peace accord signed between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. Foreign Minister Datuk  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the accord was heading in the right  direction for the creation of the State of Palestine. He said  Malaysia had pledged to assist 'Arafat's Palestine Liberation  Organization to recapture the lands from the Israelis. Malaysia  also congratulated President Mubarak for his special role in  bringing about the peaceful settlement in Gaza and Jericho.  Under the agreement, Israel will pull out most of its troops  from Gaza and Jericho [words indistinct]. It is the first  withdrawal from the occupied lands it captured in 1967. The  current agreement is the second of the protracted peace  agreements between the PLO and Israel, both having signed the  treaty on the self-rule.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'STEPPING OUT' TAPS INTO NEW ROUTINES  </P> <P> "No, dear -- your other left foot!" yells Mavis (Susan Barnes) as she leads her  middle-aged tapsters through a routine in "Stepping Out" at the Pasadena  Playhouse. You'll love Mavis. You may not quite know what to do with the play.  </P> <P> Like his characters, playwright Richard Harris understands the general effect  that is wanted, but has trouble putting it all together. He can be funny and he  can be serious; but he can't be both things at the same time. This makes for a  lumpy evening.  </P> <P> The general idea is to tell us about the people who take Mavis' once-a-week  adult-education tap class -- seven women and one man. The man (Don Amendolia)  is terribly shy, but so are the women, underneath. Will they be able to rise to  the occasion when Mavis tries to turn them into a tap company for a charity  show?  </P> <P> Act I presents the situation as a bit of a cartoon, a North London equivalent  of Robert Harling's Deep South beauty-shop comedy, "Steel Magnolias," a big hit  for the Playhouse last year. We get to know Mavis and her klutzy gang, and  decide that they are good sorts, really, even the tidier-than-thou Vera (Sybil  Lines). The effect is, however, a bit bland. One kept wishing the time were  1942, so that Harris could bring in an air raid.  </P> <P> Act II delivers a whole crate-full of dramatic interest. (It arrives at about  the same time as the hats for the amateur show.) Somebody has ratted on  somebody's husband; somebody's stepdaughter may be having an affair with her  stepfather; somebody's plaster cast may hide a slashed wrist; somebody is  pregnant. Suddenly the play is full of questions, which one rather expects will  be dealt with.  </P> <P> Instead, we cut to the finale, where we find out that our friends did  eventually learn to manage a cane and a hat at the same time. Sunday night's  Playhouse audience cheerfully took this as sufficient evidence that each of the  characters had also achieved a major personal breakthrough -- certainly that's  the gist of Roland Young's smiling choreography.  </P> <P> But all we really know is that Mavis has finally drilled a routine into their  heads. Where the new self-esteem comes from and how deep it goes, isn't dealt  with. A healthy chunk of the play is simply missing, either because Harris  never wrote it, or because somebody induced him to cut it before it got to the  West End and Broadway. Those who attend "Stepping Out" will have to take a good  deal on faith.  </P> <P> The performers prove themselves all the way, however. Sandy Duncan was to have  played Mavis, the dance teacher. Duncan is a joyous performer, but you wonder  if she would have done as well as Susan Barnes in conveying the strain of  running a class like this -- the exasperation that a talented artist feels in  the face of people who don't have a clue as to what it's about, yet who have to  be cossetted if one wants to keep eating.  </P> <P> Barnes has a fine scene when she can't keep the lid down any longer. There's  also a wonderful quiet moment when she puts on an old Artie Shaw tape and  dances by herself in the dark, just for the pleasure of it. It's a much deeper  moment than the finale.  </P> <P> Amendolia directed the show, and also gives a beautiful performance as the  bashful Geoffrey, a man who is almost not there. Without belaboring the point,  Amendolia suggests why he is not there. Deborah May is less successful at  showing us what is beneath the leggy Maxine's wisecracks about her teen-age  son, but then it's tough role: Harris doesn't seem to know Maxine very well  himself.  </P> <P> Lines is fun as the compulsive Vera, a natural enemy to such free souls as  Sheryl Sciro's Sylvia and Gwen Shepherd's Rose -- but you know what they say  about the Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady. Janet Eilber perhaps overdoes the  fears of the terrorized Andy, another tough call. Victoria Boothby is spot-on  as the crosspatch pianist, Mrs. Fraser. In sum, Mavis' gang are a likable bunch  of clumsies and we're pleased for them when they finally learn not to look at  the floor, but the final scorecard on "Stepping Out" reads: Dance 10, Plot 3.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 5 and 9 p.m. and Sundays at 2  and 7 p.m. Closes July 16.

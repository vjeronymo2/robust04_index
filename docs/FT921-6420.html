			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Merlin in financial reconstruction Results for the six months to December 31 at Merlin International Properties, whose shares were suspended last April, showed a sharp reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 2.69m. Losses per share were halved, from 31.2p to 15.2p. Merlin, which is now trading profitably, is to be financially reconstructed in order to gain and demonstrate stability, a prerequisite for the reinstatement of its share quotation. A new holding company, Merlin International Holdings, is to be formed; it will offer to exchange its shares for existing MIP shares on the basis of one MIH new ordinary for each MIP share and two MIH ordinary for each MIP preference. MIH shares are to be listed, replacing the present MIP listing. In addition, the company will offer existing and certain new shareholders the right to subscribe for up to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.3m net) of new ordinary shares at a price to be determined by the company's brokers.</p>

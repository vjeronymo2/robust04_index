			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MEPC assets rise misses mark - Short-term prospects for portfolio difficult to judge Shares fell across the property sector as MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, disappointed analysts with a lower than expected rise in net assets per share. Over the year, nav increased 14 per cent from 416p to 473p - analysts were expecting between 490p and 500p. Pre-tax profits grew 37 per cent from Pounds 81m to Pounds 111m, including Pounds 10m from the sale of properties and the use of provisions. Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said MEPC's UK properties had increased in value by 9 per cent during the 12 months to September 30. Analysts had forecast an increase of between 13 and 14 per cent. Mr Tuckey added that most of the valuation gains had come in the first half, since when values had been flat. Lord Blakenham, chairman, commented: 'The short to medium term prospects for our UK portfolio are not easy to judge. Rental increases for prime properties are on the cards, but there is still considerable over-rented property around.' Net income from properties rose to Pounds 234m (Pounds 213m). After administrative expenses of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13m), operating profits were Pounds 221.6m (Pounds 199.6m). Finance costs increased from Pounds 119.2m to Pounds 123.6m, reflecting higher interest charges. Interest capitalised amounted to Pounds 10.1m, down from Pounds 13m. Some Pounds 446m was spent on acquisitions, including the purchase of two shopping centres in the US, a shopping centre and office buildings in Australia, shopping centres in Derby and Belfast and a portfolio of office and industrial premises in the west midlands. The Northridge Fashion Centre, which suffered damage during the Los Angeles earthquake in January, is expected to reopen next summer. MEPC has received insurance proceeds of Pounds 13m and said the cash effect of the earthquake would not be material. Gearing at the year end was 62 per cent. Mr James Beveridge, finance director, said that gearing could rise to 75 per cent if suitable acquisition opportunities were identified. Earnings increased from 15.5p to 20.1p. The final dividend of 14.75p makes an unchanged total of 20p. COMMENT MEPC yesterday added to the cloud of gloom which has hung over the property sector in recent months. While profits were in line with expectations, it is clear that property values have risen by less than anticipated and that the outlook for further growth is uncertain. The main comfort for MEPC is that after yesterday's 4 per cent fall from 403p to 385p, the share price now reflects this uncertainty. On a secure yield of 6.5 per cent and a 25 per cent discount to prospective net assets per share, the downside for the shares is limited.</p>

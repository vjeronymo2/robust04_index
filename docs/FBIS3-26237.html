			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kent Chen] </F>   [Text] The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will set up a  multi-billion dollar payment system for interbank settlements  linking all of its branches as part of efforts to boost the role  of the mainland central bank. The giant network will be a big  step in the modernisation of China's banking system, which will  see sweeping changes this year, featuring the transformation of  state-owned banks into commercial banks and the establishment of  policy-oriented banks.    The first phase of the modernisation has received a loan  from  the World Bank and the bidding documents for the system are  expected to be released in about three weeks. About 30 major  international computer manufacturers are expected to take part  in the bidding, which will open opportunities for more business  in China's financial sector. The selection will be held in two  stages, with the winning bid picked at the end of this year.  The winner of the contract will be responsible for supplying  the equipment, developing a software system and building a  communications network.    Colin Shun, deputy general manager of Beijing Chibo  Information Engineering, a joint venture between CL Computers  China/Hong Kong, the People's Bank and five other Chinese banks,  said a lot of inquiries had been received in the past six  months. "We believe all major international computer  manufacturers will bid for the contract," he said.    The joint venture was set up to develop a modern financial  system for banks in China, and is charged with the  responsibility of compiling the bidding documents of the first  phase of the payment system. Mr Shun said the World Bank loan  was sufficient for the pilot project, and the Government had  committed to cover the additional expenses incurred.    The whole project involves the design, development and  installation of a nationwide computer-cum-communications system  to process the bulk of funds transfers in China. This will  upgrade the country's payment system to the standard of the  Fedwire and ACH systems in the United States and CHAPS in  Britain. "Such a system is indispensable in the current drive  for economic reforms in China. It would allow transfer of funds  within the country to be done in the shortest possible time," Mr  Shun said.    "Before an automatic payment system is introduced into the  banking sector for the transfer of funds, the flow of money has  to be made using telegraph, mail or telephone. This is not  reliable nor efficient," he said. "The Chinese payment system,  to be called the Chinese National Financial Network, is a huge  undertaking in the eyes of both the Chinese and foreign  financial sectors," he added.    China believes it will take 10 more years to link up all  2,500 branches of the People's Bank in the country. Although  the current organisation of the bank might be revamped as it  transforms into a true central bank, the proposed network is  based on the existing structure of the bank. "The objective is  to put all the PBOC branches under the umbrella of the payment  system as soon as possible," said Mr Shun.    Other mainland banks might link up with the PBOC network,  but  that is outside the scope of the current project. He said it  was unlikely that China's payment system could simply copy the  existing systems in the West and Japan. "China's banking system  is different, so the Chinese network has to be established from  scratch." he said.    It is still not known how China will finance the rest of the  project after the first phase is completed in two to three  years. CL Computers, as adviser in the project, is not allowed  to bid for the contract to avoid conflict of interest.    Alphonso Fung, executive director of CL Computers, said the  company took a long-term view of the China market. "By playing  an important role in the computerisation of the banking sector  in China, it will help sell our products in future. This is a  long-term investment," he said.</p>

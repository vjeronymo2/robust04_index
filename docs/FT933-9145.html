			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Observer: Monkey business Whatever else you do, don't shoot the monkeys. This is the lesson of a diplomatic incident in Malaysia after the US and its allies cracked down on a band of monkeys which had been disrupting US embassy garden parties. The US diplomat, charged with restraining the invaders, had counter-attacked, first with catapults, and then sprays, but to no avail. The situation started to turn really ugly when the monkeys began chasing the hapless envoy round his own garden. Finally the local wildlife officers had to be called in and very soon there were 19 dead monkeys. The local media, which tends to mirror the generally anti-US views of Malaysian prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, was incensed by the escalation in hostilities. Why, thundered an editorial in one local paper, had the wildlife officers allowed themselves to be cajoled into doing the dirty work of foreigners? The monkeys were playful, amorous creatures. It was barbaric to shoot them. The paper suggested that the foreigners, rather than the monkeys, should be rounded up and shot. The US ambassador is said to be swinging from the trees in rage over the whole incident.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  has promised that freedom of opinion, of information, of  communication, and the freedom of the press as explicitly  contained in the Constitution "will not be touched within this  reform" which is being promoted by the government.    He cracked down on "some monopolies" within the media,  saying  that their presence "is not in line with democracy or freedom."    The chief of state made these remarks during an address on  14  April at the industrial complex of the city of Pilar, Buenos  Aires Province, where he dedicated the new printing works of the  Agrupacion de Diarios del Interior S.A.    Menem recalled the policy that the government has  implemented  since it came to power to deregulate the media that is in the  hands of the state, and to achieve "an atmosphere of freedom so  that the community can quickly receive basically sound and true  information."    He said: "Regrettably, some old monopolies still exist. I  hope that as we advance in this transformation process these  monopolies will adjust to the reality of the country, continent,  and the World."    Menem maintained that "freedom of the press is a dogma  within  the framework of judicial order that is contained in the  national and provincial Constitutions."    He then lamented that the people of the interior "are  outshined by the Federal Capital because only events that occur  exclusively in the Federal Capital are published, but at times  as a consideration there will be some piece of news on events in  the interior; if it is bad news, all the better."    "We want federalism to become a reality within the sphere of  information and communication, and this is something that we are  still lacking," he added.    He acknowledged that "there are other deficiencies," such as  newsprint, although he believes that "there will be no lack of  opportunities to acquire manufacturing plants" for this raw  material "with this type of grouping and with enough capital."    Menem also defended the fact that "the media -- newspapers  and magazines -- must have the possibility of purchasing on  equal conditions paper for their publications."    "This is one of the basic facts of freedom of the press. If  the media in the interior have to purchase raw material at a  higher price in order to go to press, this is evidently a  violation of freedom of the press and communication."    He demanded "clear rules of the game if we want to reaffirm  this life style that we Argentines have chosen: Democracy and  freedom, and the dissemination of this freedom through the  media."</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WHOLESALE PRICES DIP 0.1% IN NOVEMBER;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE THIRD DROP IN FIVE MONTHS FUELS HOPES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE  WILL MOVE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES.  </P> <P> Prices of finished goods at the wholesale level fell 0.1% in November, the  third decline in five months, the Labor Department reported Friday. The report  provided more evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing dramatically and fueled  hopes that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates.  </P> <P> A sharp 3.3% drop in energy prices, following two consecutive months of higher  gasoline and fuel oil costs, more than offset a 0.8% upward move in food prices  last month, the department said.  </P> <P> Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile than other  wholesale goods, the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level was 0.2% in  November and has averaged 4.2% over the past 12 months.  </P> <P> November's figures normally would be taken as a welcome sign that wholesale  inflation has settled down to a manageable level after spurting to an annual  rate of 9.4% during the first five months of the year.  </P> <P> But analysts instead saw the report as yet another sign that the  goods-producing sector of the American economy has slumped into virtual  recession.  </P> <P> "On the price side, this is good news. It suggests inflation is coming down a  little," said Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in  New York. "But the reason is that the economy is weakening. We are getting the  bitter with the sweet here."  </P> <P> Straszheim noted that prices of industrial goods, such as primary metals and  raw cotton, fell by a full percentage point or more in November after declining  in the previous two months. Overall crude materials, excluding foodstuffs and  fuels, were down 2.3%.  </P> <P> Although the figures indicate that the rate of inflation for finished goods is  likely to remain low, they also signal that industrial demand is sluggish and  production is likely to slump.  </P> <P> As if to underscore that point, the Federal Reserve Board said in a separate  report Friday that industrial production, which declined 0.6% in October in the  wake of the Bay Area Quake and the Boeing aircraft strike, increased an anemic  0.1% in November.  </P> <P> The troubled auto industry continued to decline, with auto and truck assembly  running at an annual rate of 6.2 million, down 500,000 units for the month. But  durable goods production rebounded 0.5%, after declines of 1.8% in October and  0.7% in September.  </P> <P> The Fed also reported that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines  and utilities dipped 0.1 percentage point to 82.7% in November, the lowest rate  since April, 1988. Capacity utilization fell 0.6 point in October and has  dropped steadily from a 10-year high of 84.3% last December and January.  </P> <P> "There's no inflation out there now," said Donald Ratajczak, a specialist on  price movements at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "The Fed has been tight  most of the year and has done a good job knocking down commodity-based  inflation. Now they should declare victory and back off."  </P> <P> Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the producer price index stood  at 114.8 in November, unchanged from the previous month. That means a  hypothetical market basket of wholesale finished goods cost $114.80 last month,  up from $109.80 a year ago and $100 in 1982, the base year.  </P></p>

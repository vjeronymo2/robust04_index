			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / New curriculum is postponed THE introduction of a new national curriculum for technology in England and Wales has been postponed for a year, after a report by the National Curriculum Council said it needed more time to reduce the overload on pupils and teachers. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced that the curriculum would not be introduced until September 1995, for children up to the age of 14, and September 1996 for 15 and 16-year-olds. He also confirmed that there would be no statutory testing of technology for 14-year-olds next summer. The tests held this year were widely boycotted by teachers' unions. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the NCC, said the changes would aim to 'reduce overload, enhance clarity, make the subject even more manageable, and re-examine the place of information technology'. The NCC received nearly 3,000 responses to the consultation document. Four out of five respondents said the proposals did not reduce the demands on pupils.</p>

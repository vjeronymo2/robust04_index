			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Classic way to cut driving costs - Finance Come the summer and out come cars which are usually kept lovingly polished in the garage and away from the rain. Vintage Jaguars, classic Alfa Romeos and peak condition Jensens are as much a part of the traffic in the summer as newer Toyotas and Fords, except that their drivers look as if they are enjoying themselves more. If you are waiting for August 1 to buy your new M registered car, think again. Classic cars are not only beautiful; they also offer a rare combination of luxury while saving their drivers money. Like property and fine art, classic cars were another of those 1980s 'overvalued' assets. Prices have fallen, which is good news for someone considering buying one now. One advantage is that, through careful choice, a classic car could cut your company car tax bill. The new system of company car tax which came into effect in April, is based on the list price of the car. Employees pay tax on 35 per cent of the manufacturer's list price of the car when new, plus the price of any accessories and value added tax. One concession is that the list price is reduced by one-third for company cars which are four or more years old at the end of the tax year. Forget classic cars which are worth more than Pounds 15,000 (and which are over 15 years old) - they will be taxed on their open market value. However, Maurice Parry-Wingfield of accountant Touche Ross points out that if the car is worth less than Pounds 15,000 and is over four years old, the benefit will be taxed according to the original car price and then reduced by one-third because of the car's age: 'For less than Pounds 15,000 there are many commendable vehicles available. Who would balk at, say, a 1978 Mercedes 350SL convertible which has a list price of a relatively paltry Pounds 12,500 and a value in the region of Pounds 13,500?' he says. A higher-rate taxpayer choosing this car would pay Pounds 1,167 in tax, less than half the amount they would have to pay - Pounds 2,492 - on a Mazda MX5 1.8i S, which has an original list price of Pounds 17,800. Although the Merc's running costs may be higher than for a new car, Parry-Wingfield points out that one of the biggest costs when running a car is depreciation and, since the depreciation on the Mazda is likely to outstrip that on the Mercedes, the saving should offset any increase in running costs. Even if you are not choosing a company car but want to buy one for your private use, a classic car still retains an important advantage, in terms of lower insurance premiums, over other cars. Some motor insurers are prepared to charge lower rates as long as the car is old (usually over 15 years) and not driven too frequently. The most common mileage band is for a maximum of 3,000 miles a year, although some policies allow up 6,000 miles. There are a number of specialist insurers and brokers, including Norwich Union which has a Collectors' Vehicles policy (0603 622200); John Scott and partners (0252 725555), KGM Motor Policies (081 530 7351); Hall &amp; Clarke (081 908 5611) and Bain Clarkson (0384 455011).</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT BACKS RULING AGAINST PLAY BAN  </P> <P> Ruling in a San Diego case sparked by a racially charged play, the U.S. Supreme  Court on Monday let stand a decision that college officials do not have the  authority to censor plays to be performed on campus.  </P> <P> Leaving intact a California court ruling, the Supreme Court refused to hear an  appeal by San Diego Community College District officials who contended that  they, not instructors or students, have final control over plays, publications  and other "expressive activities" on campus.  </P> <P> The court's refusal to hear the case suggests that college administrators do  not have the same broad powers the justices granted high school officials -- in  a case decided two years ago -- to limit freedom of speech in school-sponsored  activities.  </P> <P> The high court's action Monday also signaled a victory not only for the college  instructor and student who brought the suit, but for anyone with an interest in  freedom of speech, said an ACLU lawyer who helped bring the case.  </P> <P> "I think the principle involved -- that First Amendment issues were at the  heart of what happened -- has been established and, more importantly, that a  very resounding defense of the First Amendment for college students, and  academic freedom for college instructors, has been affirmed," ACLU attorney  Betty Wheeler said.  </P> <P> The case arose in 1986 when Alan DiBona, then a San Diego community college  instructor, chose the play "Split Second" for his drama students to perform.  The plot revolves around the shooting of a white suspect by a black policeman  in New York City and the racial tensions that result.  </P> <P> DiBona, who now lives in Seattle, planned to have the play performed at the  Educational Cultural Complex in Southeast San Diego, a branch of the community  colleges. Students auditioning for the play were to receive course credit.  </P> <P> At the time, racial tensions in San Diego were high over the case of Sagon  Penn, a young black man who was twice acquitted in the shooting of two white  San Diego police officers and a Latino woman who was riding in the officers'  squad car.  </P> <P> After hearing of the play, several local ministers complained to Robert  Matthews, who was then president of the Education Cultural Complex. Matthews  now heads another college branch, the Continuing Education Centers.  </P> <P> After examining the play, Matthews concluded that its language was  "inappropriate" and its plot "not very uplifting." Then, saying the class  lacked adequate enrollment, he ordered DiBona to cancel the production.  </P> <P> "I don't even think the First Amendment should have been an issue there,"  Matthews said Monday. "The issue as I'm looking at it was simply the procedures  of the school. We had the right to close the class if we didn't have the  numbers necessary to keep class in operation. There was never any class, as far  as we're concerned."  </P> <P> DiBona and one of his students, Scott Gundlach, filed the lawsuit against  Matthews and James Hardison, then the dean of arts and sciences, contending  that they had violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.  Hardison is now dean of another college branch, the Midway Center.  </P> <P> Initially, San Diego Superior Court Judge Arthur Jones ruled for the college  administrators, saying DiBona and Gundlach did not have legal standing to bring  the suit.  </P> <P> But last May, the 4th District Court of Appeal, on a 2-1 vote, reversed that  decision and revived the suit.  </P> <P> The appeals court said it was aware of "no authority which would allow a  college or university to censor" class materials selected by the instructor  "because they contain 'indecent' language or deal with 'offensive' topics."  </P> <P> Community college students, many of whom are adults, have full First Amendments  rights, the court said.  </P> <P> The college appealed, relying on the 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that  granted a high school principal, not the student editors, final control over  what appears in the school newspaper.  </P> <P> The First Amendment rights of high school students are not the same as those of  adults, the U.S. Supreme Court said in that decision, adding that school  officials legally control the curriculum.  </P> <P> Officials of the San Diego Community College District said the logic of that  decision should apply also to colleges and universities.  </P> <P> On July 25, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the college's appeal,  and, on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court did the same.  </P> <P> Wheeler, the ACLU attorney, said the Supreme Court action could bring about the  end of the case because DiBona and Gundlach "have, to a large extent, achieved  what they set out to achieve," which was an affirmation of their constitutional  rights. Neither the instructor nor the student sought monetary damages, she  said.  </P> <P> Under the 4th District Court's opinion, which still stands, the college retains  the right to go to trial on the case. But Matthews said he had no burning  desire for a trial.  </P> <P> "There's nothing I want to happen," he said. The case "can continue on if  others so desire, or it can stop where it is if others so desire. I don't care  at this particular point."  </P> <P> Donal M. Hill, the deputy county counsel who handled the case for the college,  could not be reached Monday for comment. Neither could DiBona nor Gundlach.  </P></p>

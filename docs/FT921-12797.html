			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (36): Massive interest over five years - The Business Expansion Scheme / The Budget is likely to see the end of buy-back schemes, which may seem too generous a tax-break for the benefits they deliver, and are not a suitable home for all your savings STAND BY for a clearance sale by Business Expansion Scheme companies in the run-up to the budget. Schemes that seek to assure a fixed return after five years are expected to be abolished. In many ways, it is surprising that the government allowed them to start in the first place; yet such a move would also be a shame. For these schemes have finally won support for the BES from the mainstream intermediaries and accountants who control most of the UK's investment business. Previously, it had seemed too speculative for small investors. At first, the BES may not seem to have much to do with mainstream personal finance. It was set up in 1981 as the Business Start-up Scheme, to stimulate investment in high-risk small companies - and many early BSS companies indeed lived up to the 'high-risk' label. Since then, it has regularly been altered. In 1988, the scheme was opened to investment in 'assured tenancy' rental accommodation, to help the private rental sector. The housing side of the BES now predominates  - the maximum size for a BES tenancy company is Pounds 5m, but for trading companies the limit is only Pounds 750,000. The broad outlines for private investors are as follows. You can invest up to Pounds 40,000 in companies which qualify for investments under the BES. You then submit a BES3 form (sent to you by the company) to the Inland Revenue. The total value of your investment is then deducted from your total taxable income. Thus, if you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount you invested. So you ultimately part with only Pounds 24,000 to invest Pounds 40,000. You may lose this relief if you do not hold on to your BES shares for at least five years; otherwise, provided you can sell the shares, you should make a substantial profit. However, making a clean exit from the company has proved difficult for many of the trading companies which have now finished their five years, and this, combined with the speculative nature of the investment, has deterred investors. The new concept of covenanted buy-back companies attempts to ensure an exit route, and also a specific yield. BES sponsors go to providers of low-cost rental housing - usually colleges or housing associations - and offer to buy them some property. In return, the association or college must covenant to buy back the property, for a fixed price, when the five-year BES term has elapsed. The fixed price will typically be around 35 per cent or 40 per cent higher than the price paid initially. now. This provides the covenanting housing providers with reasonably cheap finance, and they have the use of the housing stock for five years. But they are 'taking a punt' on house price inflation. If they cannot afford the covenanted price after five years, they are legally obliged to borrow to meet it. This would have the unfortunate effect of using substantial tax relief from the Treasury to force worthy organisations into debt. However, the odds are that the covenanting bodies will do well out of the deals. The only risk for investors comes if they go out of business altogether. The exit route would then be much less secure, as, in most cases, there is no third-party guarantor. These schemes are not entitled to describle themselves as 'guaranteed', despite some early marketing claims. However, one scheme launched in September - IM Assured Growth - had a guarantee from the Bank of America. It was quickly oversubscribed. This type of scheme seems likely to spread. If you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, and have money to put away for five years, these schemes may deserve attention. Interest rates after tax-relief are massive. For example, Johnson Fry's Seventh Super Growth offers the equivalent of 16.5 per cent annually, roughly double what you might hope to get from a five-year guaranteed income bond. The problem with the 'buy-back' schemes is that they seem far too generous a tax-break for the actual benefits they deliver. The latest edition of the Investor's Chronicle Beginners' Guide to Investment described the practice as 'arbitraging the taxman'. Certainly, the schemes are far removed from the original principle of encouraging investors to take risks. However, Stephen Bantoft, BES analyst of the Allenbridge Group, points out that they offer the security of a long-term owner, and should therefore do more to encourage lasting housing provision for the needy. Schemes aiming to sell to a private owner in five years might provide only a brief interlude of private rental housing, and are of less help to the country's current housing crisis. The other main class of BES company is the 'predator'. These do not have the secured exit route, but aim to profit to the full from the current depressed residential property market. Thus they buy now, let the houses to private tenants for five years, and then sell, hoping to make a profit. There could be problems with exit routes. Otherwise, the strength of the investment depends on your reading of the residential property market. The central problem is that the BES is an inappropriate vehicle for housing subsidies. If the upper limit for investments in trading companies were raised, things might be different. Several operators are looking at ways to extend the 'buy-back' principle to trading companies. For example, the BES might be used to finance individual supermarkets or petrol stations for larger chains, who would buy them after five years. This would be an interesting development, returning the scheme to its original intentions, but in a form which might allow average small investors to benefit. It also effectively circumvents the Pounds 750,000 limit. For the time being, tread carefully, but keep an eye open for opportunities. The view of David Harris, of accountants Chantrey Vellacott, is typical: 'I'm fairly positive with regard to the so-called guaranteed schemes. If you are prepared to accept that there's a limited risk, it's definitely something you should consider as part of a broader portfolio. But it would be lunacy to take everything out of the Halifax tomorrow and put it in a BES residential scheme.'</p>

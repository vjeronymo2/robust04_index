			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Prudential pension sales suffer UK sales of life and pensions policies by Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, fell in the first nine months of this year, with a 30 per cent fall in sales of single premium individual pensions. Figure for Prudential's new business published yesterday, showed generally subdued sales of regular and single premium products, but sales of the more flexible products introduced by Prudential in the summer were more encouraging. This is the first time Prudential has released new business figures on a quarterly basis. Individual pension sales were particularly depressed, reflecting public concern about the standards of selling in the sector.  This was sparked by a report late last year suggesting that nine out of 10 cases where an investor was transferring a lump sum into a personal plan did not meet regulators' standards. Concern is likely to be intensified after a regulator's report earlier this week suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people may have been wrongly advised to take personal pensions and leave, or not to join, their employers' schemes. Sales of annual premium individual pensions fell 6 per cent to Pounds 88m, while single premium pension sales fell 30 per cent to Pounds 211m, during the nine months. Within that total, pension transfer sales dived to Pounds 151m from Pounds 286m. The division of the insurance and savings elements of a conventional life insurance product - into Prudence Family Cover and the Prudence Savings Account - appeared to be paying off. The savings account attracted some Pounds 13m of annual premiums and some Pounds 72m in single premiums. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said UK sales were 'holding up well in a problematic market'. He noted advances in Pacific operations. New business in Hong Kong and Singapore rose with higher sales of regular and single premium products. Cost of a quick sell, Page 22</p>

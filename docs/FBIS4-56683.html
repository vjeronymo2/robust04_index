			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 5 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Government's  decision to sign a cooperation agreement with Cuba has been  endorsed by the leaders of the governing Coalition of Parties  For Democracy. Members of the rightist opposition voiced  skepticism.    Yesterday, 4 May, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  Serrano confirmed the government's plan to sign a cooperation  agreement with Cuba though he reiterated that an eventual  resumption of diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government is  not on the list of subjects that the Chilean Government will  assess in the short term.    Today, Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona said his  party "enthusiastically supports" the tightening of friendship  and cooperation ties with the Cuban people.    Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Gutenberg  Martinez  asserted his party is in favor of cooperating with Cuba "from a  solidarity viewpoint in view of the difficulties the Cuban  people are enduring," adding that cooperation "should be granted  without imposing any conditions." Martinez also upheld the end  of the U.S. economic embargo on the island because, in his  opinion, this might encourage the Cuban authorities to implement  a greater economic and political domestic opening. Martinez  will preside over a PDC delegation that will travel to Cuba this  month.    Chilean Communist Party leader Carlos Toro asked Eduardo  Frei's government for the immediate normalization of diplomatic  relations with Cuba while Radical Party President Senator  Anselmo Sule commented that there is a certain degree of  cooperation with Cuba.    Sule mentioned a $10 million credit the Chile State Bank  recently granted the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of  Chilean foodstuff and added that Chile can cooperate with Cuba  "in several aspects." Sule said that among the incentives are  the activities that some Chilean companies are developing in  Cuba, the extension of export credits to that country, and the  promotion of social development actions on the island.    The rightist Democratic Independent Union (UDI), voiced its  agreement with the establishment of a cooperation program "that  does not encourage the perpetuation of the current Cuban  regime." UDI Senator Beltran Urenda, member of the Senate's  Foreign Commission, believes any aid for Cuba "should seek a  change in the Cuba Government, a democratic opening." He said  "any support" that may help Fidel Castro's regime to remain in  power "is dangerous."</p>

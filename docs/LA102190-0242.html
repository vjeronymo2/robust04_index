			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURE FRAMES REGAIN FAVOR AS DECORATIONS  </P> <P> The collectibles you move in with may contribute as much to the decor as the  paint, wallpaper, rugs and drapes. Pictures, boxes or objets d'art may capture  the eye first and determine a room's character.  </P> <P> Frames evoking classic styles like Victorian ceramics, Parisian silver or  sculptured Italian or Russian designs in a variety of metals that have been  burnished, painted or mirrored are offered by Dakin Terragrafics.  </P> <P> "Not only have picture frames regained their elegance, evoking a time when  photos of family members were a novelty and placed in intricately crafted  silver casings, they have recently inspired a veritable explosion of new  designs and materials," says Joseph E. Walsmith, the firm's president.  </P> <P> Fabric styles that are similar to English chintz designs, by I Was Framed,  cover picture frames and are available with matching boxes for jewelry, hats,  cosmetics, dishes and other collectibles, as well as tissue dispensers,  wastebaskets, albums, notebooks, music boxes and similar items. Most of the  designs are florals, but the line also includes moires in pink or black.  </P> <P> Gallery and Art Nouveau styles, including a number of architecturally inspired  frames based on the work of Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, are  offered through the Exposures catalogue.  </P> <P> Also available are archival storage and display systems for incurable  collectors of photos and oddments, including glass-covered cases and  museum-style tables in which to display favorite baubles. For information or  catalogues, call (800) 222-4947.  </P> <P> From Diane von Furstenberg come frames, desk accessories and paper tableware in  bold animal prints. Her Nairobi collection features abstracts of leopard, tiger  and zebra patterns on picture frames, address books, journals, albums, letter  holders, stationery, paper plates, napkins and invitations.  </P></p>

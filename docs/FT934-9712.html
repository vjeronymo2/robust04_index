			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bespak savaged Health products manufacturer Bespak suffered a savage investor rerating after issuing a warning that profits would be sharply lower than in the previous period. The company, which makes aerosol valve systems, plastic moulding and micropumps, said profits for the first half of the year would be about half the year-earlier figure and it expected full-year results to be lower than the previous period. Bespak said a fall in the business of US Surgical, its largest US customer, and uncertainty among other health care customers pulled down the group's results. Also, sales in dollar terms in the US fell in the first half of the year. The shares plunged 155 to 318p. In the year to April, Bespak made Pounds 11.5m, a jump of 66 per cent from the previous year. The first investment trusts giving access to the Lloyd's insurance market to be quoted on the stock exchange began trading yesterday. Hiscox Select closed at 110p, a 10p premium to the subscription price. However, the new HCG Lloyds trust ended the day only a penny above its subscription price, at 101p. Several bank stocks were sold down after Hoare Govett, the securities house, reiterated its unenthusiastic view. Hoare underlined a neutral stance on National Westminster, which fell 8 to 539p, Royal Bank of Scotland, 11 cheaper at 349p, and Lloyds, down 7 1/2 at 555 1/2 p Standard Chartered, in contrast, was steady at 1028p after news that the bank was planning a simultaneous secondary listing of its shares in Hong Kong and Singapore, possibly within six months. Shell Transport saw its share price rise in a depressed market as investors hoped for encouraging third-quarter results on Thursday. Buyers were motivated by good figures from British Petroleum, which last week announced a big rise in third-quarter figures. Shell improved 5 to 720p, while BP recovered from profit-taking seen at the end of last week and closed 1 1/2 firmer at 352p. BP Oil, a unit of the BP group, said it was evaluating several options for its refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, including its sale. Pharmaceutical groups SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo were weaker after the former announced that it was launching a price war in the US. It said it was cutting the price of Tagamet, its ulcer treatment, by offering a Dollars 10 rebate. The price cuts could affect sales of Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment Zantac. SmithKline slipped 13 1/2 to 395 1/2 p and Glaxo was 2 lower at 653p, the latter's shares held up by a positive annual meeting. Glaxo's chairman Sir Paul Girolami told shareholders that results and sales were on target so far this year. Drugs concern Wellcome dropped 25 to 677p after Nomura changed its recommendation to sell from hold. The shares were also dragged down by general weakness in the sector. Stores shares were mostly resilient, with several moves into positive territory by the sector leaders. Hoare Govett was yesterday pointing out the recent weakness in the sector as overdone and its belief that, the Budget notwithstanding, retailers are likely to benefit from good Christmas sales. Dixons put on 3 at 280p, with one broker said to be recommending the stock following the recent visit to PC World in South Wales. MFI slipped a half-penny to 140 1/2 p amid presentations to clients. Elsewhere, Boots added 2 at 506p, Kingfisher a penny at 640p, Lloyds Chemist 5 at 272p, Sears 2 at 115p and Marks and Spencer 2 at 398p. Among food issues, Booker weakened 5 to 390p, with weekend press reports on the threat of Norwegian salmon farming said to be partly to blame. Reports of litigation in the banana business hit Geest, the shares ending 19 off at 342p. Leisure stocks largely underperformed against the rest of the market as last week's good run came to an abrupt halt. Only Forte found good support, advancing 4 to 219p, although turnover was a weak 1.2m. Manchester United was another bright spot, advancing 19 to 567p on positive weekend press comment. Ladbroke shed 3 to 174p as turnover hit a bumper 15m in late trading. Granada, 9 off at 466p, suffered profit-taking after excitement in the broadcasting sector on Friday. Thorn EMI slid 13 to 929p as the company attempted to defuse the controversy surrounding its Rent-A-Centre US business. After Friday's heavy fall following a trading statement and analysts visit, Guinness recovered 4 to 412p. The power generators performed well in a mainly weak session for utilities as investors drew comfort from what is expected to be a bumper dividend increase when National Power reports results on Thursday. Its shares climbed 6 1/2 to 411 1/2 p. PowerGen rose 6 to 465p and Scottish Power 4 1/2 to 401 1/2 p. Recs and water stocks remained under a cloud following last week's Ofwat report which underlined the tougher regulatory environment for the two sectors. Electronic component distributor Abacus came to the market at 140p and closed a good opening session 13 higher at 153p. TT Group gained 4 1/2 at 330 1/2 p on hopes that it would benefit from any expansion by Sega in South Wales. Siebe advanced strongly as it announced the acquisition of a controls company in Germany. Engineering analysts added that the recent rights issue had been well received. Kleinwort Benson was also said to be positive on the stock. The old shares closed 6 forward at 566p and the nil-paid 8 up at 84p. Motor components group Lucas ended a penny firmer at 176p. Dealers said there was a growing belief that Mr George Simpson, deputy chief executive of British Aerospace, would accept the post of chief executive of Lucas. Shares in Wardle Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment manufacturer, dropped 17 to 431p after the company announced that profits from its cash pile had been eaten into by the steady reduction in UK base rates over the past year. Wardle was also unenthusiastic about future prospects. It said it was difficult to see how there could be any improvement in economic conditions in the UK when the company's main overseas market, continental Europe, was in such disarray and any improvements in results would be in spite of market conditions rather than because of them.</p>

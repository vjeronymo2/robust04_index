			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BLOOD DEFECT LINK TO PARKINSON'S  </P> <P> Scientists say they have detected a blood cell defect in people with  Parkinson's disease, a link that could help identify victims before symptoms  appear. Such timely identification, they say, could open the door for earlier  treatment of the disease that afflicts 400,000 Americans.  </P> <P> The findings, published in the Annals of Neurology, are the product of  federally funded research at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.  </P> <P> Parkinson's is a neurological condition characterized by gradually worsening  tremors, muscle rigidity and weakness -- symptoms blamed on the disappearance  of key brain cells.  </P> <P> The scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme deficiency inside  blood cells of Parkinson's patients, suggesting the disease affects more than  just the brain cells it kills.  </P></p>

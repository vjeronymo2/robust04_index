			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Early summer sales lift retail figures A SHARP rise in retail sales volumes last month has supported indications of a broadly based recovery. The upturn was helped by an early start to the summer sales and a rebound from May's poor figures for clothing, which were caused by wet weather. Seasonally adjusted retail volumes rose 1.3 per cent in June to register a 3.9 per cent increase from June last year, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. In the second quarter of the year sales volumes were 0.5 per cent higher than in the first quarter, with shops selling food and household goods doing particularly well. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, said retailing had seen a 'sustained recovery' in the first half of the year. Although retailers were encouraged, they remained concerned 'at the lack of solid consumer confidence'. The consortium said uncertainty in the housing market continued to hold back purchases of furniture and carpets, while sales of televisions, hi-fi units and video machines were low. Sales of healthcare and do-it-yourself products were relatively buoyant. The figures provide little evidence of any spurt in shopping activity, which accounts for about a quarter of gross domestic product. In the second quarter retail volumes were up 3.1 per cent from the corresponding period last year, after a year-on-year rise of 3.4 per cent in the first quarter. Between the fourth quarter of last year and the January to March period sales volumes rose 1.7 per cent. In the first half of this year sales volumes rose 2.3 per cent from the second half of last year, after a 1 per cent increase between the first and second halves of 1992. Sales of most categories of retail goods appear to have been helped by heavy dis-counting, largely in big stores. Not allowing for seasonal variations and on a value basis, average weekly shop sales in June are estimated by the CSO to be Pounds 2.74bn, only marginally up on the Pounds 2.72bn in May and just below the Pounds 2.75bn in April. The figure for June was 6 per cent up from June last year. Volumes of clothing and footwear sold rose 8.9 per cent in June - a freak result triggered by unusually low sales the previous month. Volumes of food and household goods rose 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent on the same basis. Compared with the second quarter of last year sales volumes in the latest three months were up 2.9 per cent for food retailers. The comparable figures for shops selling household goods and clothes and shoes were 8.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. Retailers selling a mixture of food and non-edible products saw sales volumes increase 4 per cent in the second quarter compared with 12 months earlier.</p>

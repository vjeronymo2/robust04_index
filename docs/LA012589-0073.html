			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> COFFEE PLUNGES AS MARKET ANTICIPATES BRAZILIAN GLUT  </P> <P> Coffee futures prices fell drastically Tuesday on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa  Exchange in New York.  </P> <P> The March contract dropped 634 points, or 6.34 cents, during the trading  session.  </P> <P> "It was a blood bath," said Bert Ruiz, a broker in New York with Balfour  Maclaine Corp. "The decline was due to the anticipation of a greater  availability of coffee from Brazil. The market will be flooded with Brazilian  coffee, due to the government's economic austerity plan introduced last week."  </P> <P> Because of new warehouse fees, Brazilian coffee exporters have had to unload  their coffee onto the world market, Ruiz said.  </P> <P> Futures prices have been rising since early December but have leveled off since  a March contract high of $1.66.90 on Jan. 3.  </P> <P> Coffee settled 5.70 cents to 6.34 cents lower, with the contract for delivery  in March at $1.3451.  </P> <P> Futures prices of soybeans and corn climbed higher while wheat prices sank at  the close on the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Soybeans advanced more than 11 cents for the March spot contract.  </P> <P> "A rumor that the Russians bought 600,000 tons of soy pellets from Brazil or  the United States supported the beans, and corn went along for the ride," said  Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wheat Prices Slump  </P> <P> Weighing on wheat prices were a forecast of rain in the Great Plains growing  area and talk that Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton K. Yeutter "isn't  too keen on export bonuses," Lespinasse said.  </P> <P> At the close, wheat was 4.25 cents to 7 cents lower, with the contract for  delivery in March at $4.37.75 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3.25 cents higher,  with March at $2.72.25 a bushel; oats were 0.75 cent to 2 cents lower, with  March at $2.3525 a bushel, and soybeans were 5.25 cents to 12 cents higher,  with March at $7.675 a bushel.  </P> <P> Futures prices of livestock and meat finished mixed to mostly lower after  drifting higher most of the day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> The market dipped in anticipation of an Agriculture Department cold storage  report showing record inventories of frozen pork bellies, said Chuck Levitt,  livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.  </P> <P> While the report -- released after the closing bell -- had 113.3 million pork  bellies on hand Dec. 31, the largest number ever for that date, it was still 7  million less than expected, Levitt said.  </P> <P> Live cattle prices, supported by packer demand, were mixed, he said.  </P> <P> Live cattle settled 0.27 cent lower to 0.30 cent higher, with the contract for  delivery in February at 72.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.17 cent lower  to 0.30 cent higher, with January at 83.55 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.20  cent lower to 0.10 cent higher, with February at 43.12 cents a pound, and  frozen pork bellies were 0.55 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with February at  39.15 cents a pound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precious Metals Drop  </P> <P> Gold and silver prices tumbled on the Commodity Exchange in New York.  </P> <P> Gold settled $1.80 to $2.90 lower, with the contract for delivery in January at  $406.30 an ounce; silver was 6.4 cents to 7.1 cents lower, with January at  $6.13 an ounce.  </P></p>

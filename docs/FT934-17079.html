			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Markets: Will the jolly Green Giant earn his corn? - London FORGET the rest of the news. Grand Metropolitan has been hogging the headlines this week. A carefully orchestrated public relations blitz has had the drinks, food and retailing group making announcements almost daily since the appointment at the end of last week of George Bull as chief executive. It is an unfortunate name, conjuring up bulls at gates or bulls in china shops. But shareholders might hope it is an omen for the shares which, a glance at the chart will show, have been on a bear tack for some time. Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, must have waved a red rag at his new chief executive over the weekend setting off a week of hyperactivity. On Monday morning Bull sorted out the 'jolly' Green Giant vegetable business, where the ho-ho-hoes have been distinctly lacking, and the Pearle Vision opticians business, which with hindsight was not a great buy. With a few other bits and pieces, the restructuring has brought a Pounds 175m provision with it. By Wednesday, Bull had sold the Chef &amp; Brewer chain of 1,654 pubs, reaping Pounds 830m according to GrandMet - Scottish &amp; Newcastle which is buying the pubs says it is paying Pounds 622m - and bought Glen Ellen wines in the US. On Thursday he bought a half share in a Scottish distiller valued at Pounds 84m. So perhaps GrandMet is getting to grips with its problems and pursuing its strategy of becoming an international branded business in food, drinks and retailing. The share price has moved the right way over the week, after falling 14 1/2 p on the day Bull's appointment was announced to 393p. It closed the week at 416p. The financing of S &amp; N's purchase of the pubs was partly through a Pounds 405m one-for-four rights issue, but also involved Morgan Grenfell, a blue-blooded merchant bank, becoming a sizeable pub landlord - prompting a vision of sober-suited bankers rolling up their sleeves, pulling pints, and calling 'time, gentlemen, please'. Rights issues have been another theme of the week, with Costain calling for Pounds 84m - more than its own market value - through a hefty five-for-four issue to repair a balance sheet tottering under the weight of debt. Meanwhile, Takare asked for Pounds 68m through a two-for-five issue so that it could speed up its expansion in the nursing home sector. Adwest, the automotive components group, asked shareholders for Pounds 22.2m to pay for acquisitions which it has yet to tie up. Rolls Royce's recent Pounds 307m rights issue was 87 per cent taken up this week, and the balance quickly sold. Takare chairman, Keith Bradshaw, may have given the game away saying that while the company did not need a rights issue, his advisers, SG Warburg, had rung him and suggested now would be a good time to have one. The fees involved in Takare's issue alone run to around Pounds 1 3/4 m, which explains why merchant banks' shares have been some of the strongest performers this year. Clearly there is good demand for new equity at present. The sale of a 54.8 per cent stake in Mirror Group Newspapers was achieved apparently painlessly at a price of 170p. It raised Pounds 373m gross - or Pounds 358m, after Pounds 15m of expenses - more fees -for the City. Mercury Asset Management emerged on Friday as a buyer of a 16.3 per cent stake, taking its share in the supposedly left-of-centre newspaper to over 20 per cent. While the flood of rights issues shows no sign of abating, the stream of flotations is also continuing. Flotations have raised far less money this year than rights issues. According to Stock Exchange figures, in the first half of the year new companies joining the market raised Pounds 1.78bn, with the average newcomer to the market taking Pounds 28m, while rights issues collected Pounds 7.08bn. One must wonder about the quality of some of the smaller companies coming to market. However, none has matched for oddity one business seeking Pounds 300,000 of start up capital under the Business Expansion Scheme - Small Room Media. It plans to develop a new method for advertisers to reach an audience - through public conveniences. You can imagine the poster. 'Now wash your hands with Imperial Leather'. As the prospectus says, it is a great way to target advertising to gender. This week some larger names joined the list of forthcoming floats, adding to the likes of Allders, the department store and duty free retailer, which is expected to be worth Pounds 150m. Coming soon will be Gartmore, the fund management group, likely to be valued at up to Pounds 300m, and DFS Furniture, a retailer of furniture, whose executive chairman Graham Kirkham hopes to raise Pounds 100m by selling half the shares he and his family own exclusively. In spite of the calls on investors money, the end of the third quarter, and of the stockmarket account, the Footsie has shown continued resilience this week, rising 34.1 points to 3039.3. Talk of interest rate cuts early in the week is probably premature. The Conservative Party has surely broken free from the knee jerk of cutting rates every time it has a conference. The first November budget has been weighing on the market's mind though. If a rate cut is to come it may be used to mitigate the inflationary effects of raising more tax from VAT, a prospect which now seems certain. With the oil price firming on the new OPEC production limiting deal, inflation is set to pick up sharply in the coming months. That must be bad news for bonds, especially if it means we are close to the bottom of the interest rate cycle. But that need not be so bad for equities. As recession turns to recovery, corporate earnings will rise and the usual pattern in the markets is for equities to run ahead of bonds. The great bull market is not dead yet.</p>

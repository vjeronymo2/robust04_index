			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zofran boost for Glaxo AFTER feeling the wrath of American investors on Friday, Glaxo returned to favour yesterday as encouraging weekend press comment in the US restored the reputation of the group's leading drug, Zantac. In fact, it was Glaxo's new drug Zofran which took centre stage yesterday as UK approval  - the first in the world  - was received for the post-operative anti-nausea product. Analysts estimate that Zofran could generate sales of around Pounds 400m a year by 1995. Glaxo was also boosted by a series of institutional meetings in London arranged by Canadian group Biochem Pharma, which is developing an anti-Aids drug on behalf of the UK company. The new drug, 3TC, is seen as a potential market threat to Wellcome, which declined 8 to 1058p. Glaxo surged ahead 31 to 751p in busy turnover of 4.5m. SmithKline Beecham rose in sympathy with Glaxo to end 15 stronger at 870p. Expected approval by the US Food and Drugs Administration of Fisons' Opticrom facility failed to materialise, the drugs group merely announcing that the inspection had been completed. The shares receded 11 to 379p. Williams weak Conglomerate Williams Holdings lost more than 4 per cent of its equity value as the market responded to suggestions that the company may launch a white knight bid for Dowty Group, the aerospace concern currently under attack from TI Group. The shares tumbled 15 to 329p on turnover of 3.1m, with the market particularly concerned about the cash underwriting in the event of a bid from Williams. Mr Matthew Sutherland at County NatWest said: 'I would not rule out the fact that Williams may be looking to do a white knight deal with Dowty. But it is unlikely that they will make an acquisition that will dilute earnings.' Shares in leading retailers failed to respond favourably to yesterday's  1/2 point cut in bank base rates, the Bank of England's endorsement of lower rates having been widely forecast. Trading in Sears was fairly active, at 6m shares, and the stock dipped 4 to 101p ahead of tomorrow's results. Turnover in other leading stores was not heavy, although the recent disappointment at retail sales performance tended to push prices lower. WH Smith 'A' slipped 6 to 476p, while Boots gave up 7 to 465p and Dixons 7 to 249p. Ratners eased a penny to 20 1/2 p on lower turnover of 4.4m shares as bid speculation faded. Technical factors tended to weaken Tesco, on completion of the buying in of shares for its employee profit sharing scheme. BZW's recent advice to switch into J. Sainsbury also weighed on Tesco, as well as adverse comment from Credit Lyonnais Laing about the sector's policy on property valuations. Tesco shed 4 to 274p. Shoprite, whose shares were valued at under 400p a month ago, climbed a further 33 to 504p, following recent visits from securities houses. The shares have risen on optimism about a proposed store opening programme. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was the day's second most busiest stock with 30m traded, the shares easing  1/2 to 22 3/4 p. US and continental European buyers were most evident on expectations of a recovery in advertising revenue. Turnover in PowerGen was a hefty 4.1m shares, with the price falling 6 to 228p, and National Power lost 5 to 221p on trade of 2.1m shares, amid reports that overseas investors were selling shares in the power generators. Scottish generating companies were steady, however, responding to a positive note from Smith New Court. The Electricity Package gave up Pounds 15 to Pounds 3178, Friday's rumour that MEPC had let the remainder of its Alban Gate office block continued to lift the shares, in a generally positive property sector. MEPC, which touched 369p, was finally 3 up at 361p. British Fittings plunged 48 to 105p after the building group announced losses, trading difficulties and the need for a new chairman. Broker Hoare Govett decided that Thorn EMI was undervalued, citing the potential for expansion in the music market, and in particular new music formats such as Digital Compact Cassette. The shares rose 6 to 857p. Lehman Brothers' downgrading of Allied-Lyons continued to weigh on the drinks and food giant, pushing the shares 9 lower to 630p. Speculation about a possible takeover bid has also faded of late. BAT Industries, which reports first-quarter figures today, was wanted, the shares advancing 14 to 781p as turnover rose to 2.8m on speculation that profits may be higher than anticipated. P &amp; O moved ahead 10 to 515p after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith said the company has 'an undemanding multiple for a recovery play and an attractive yield'. Motor components manufacturer BSG International closed 1 1/2 firmer at 64p after Smith New Court and Panmure Gordon successfully placed the 29.7 per cent stake held by Sir Ron Brierley with institutions. The majority of the 60m-share holding, which was bought by the brokers at 61 1/2 p, was placed at 62p, while a block of 13.5m was placed in ex-dividend form at 59 1/2 p.

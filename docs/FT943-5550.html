			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / France revives Nato link For the first time in 28 years France is to attend a meeting of Nato defence ministers, reflecting further rapprochement by Paris towards the military activities of the Atlantic alliance. But French officials stressed yesterday that Mr Francois Leotard, France's defence minister, would go to the September 29-30 meeting in Spain because it was an informal gathering, in contrast to the twice-yearly formal sessions of Nato defence ministers. Since 1966 when it quit Nato's integrated military command, France has been represented only at alliance summits or meetings of foreign ministers that constitute Nato's political wing. The meeting in Seville will be the second such informal gathering of Nato defence ministers, following a similar meeting in Germany last autumn that Mr Leotard did not attend. At the intervening Nato summit last January France said it would in future send its defence minister to meetings that had an agenda of special interest to Paris, such as Nato peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. 'The Seville agenda suits us,' a French official said. It includes Bosnia, the Mediterranean, including Algeria, and reform of the alliance. In its defence white paper earlier this year, France ruled out rejoining Nato's integrated military command. But, reciprocating President Bill Clinton's more relaxed, even encouraging, attitude towards European defence efforts, France's position towards Nato is still clearly evolving. Earlier this week Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, called on his European Union partners to join France in drafting a white paper to define EU security interests and how these could be protected 'in conjunction with Nato'. The nomination of a successor to the late Manfred Worner as Nato secretary-general may also be discussed at Seville. French officials say that 'by definition' Paris is not fielding a candidate, but has told the UK that it could support a British contender for the job. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, has indicated he wants to stay in national politics, but Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has apparently not foreclosed the option.</p>

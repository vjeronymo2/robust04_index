The  chilling assessment comes from two high-ranking Beijing-based  European diplomats who have sent alarming reports to their  governments following the secret fact-finding mission.    One of the envoys, an ambassador, writes in his report:  ``North Korea has, in our opinion, the full capacity to enrich  natural uranium and graphite of North Korean origin and has  built several kilo-sized bombs. We established as well that  testing sites exist.''    The diplomats had top-level discussions and were met by Kim  Chong-il, the 51-year-old heir-apparent to ``great Leader'' Kim  Il-song. They expressed to him their concern about the danger  North Korea's nuclear weapons programme poses for world peace.    The North Koreans prompted speculation that they were  acquiring a nuclear capability last March when they withdrew  from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused further  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Two meetings between North Korean and American officials last  month failed to alter the situation. It was then that U.S.  President Bill Clinton warned Pyongyang it would not ``be  allowed to develop a nuclear bomb'' and urged them to ``crawl  back off the ledge.''    In recent weeks, the Central Intelligence Agency said North  Korea might have enough weapons-grade plutonium for ``one or  two'' bombs...but that assessment seems well short of the mark,  according to the European envoys.    During their visit, they concluded that North Korea, which  originally received help from Soviet nuclear scientists, had  perfected the complicated ignition devices needed to explode an  atomic bomb. They were also certain the Koreans had adapted  short- range Scud-B Soviet missiles for use as launch vehicles.  They are producing a Korean version of the improved Scud-C,  which they have named Nodong-1.    The Nodong-1 has been tested over 650 kilometres but can  deliver conventional or atomic bombs over 1,000  kilometres--meaning most major South Korea and Japanese cities  would be just 10 minutes away.    North Korea has now around 120 Nodong-1 rockets, some of  which have been secretly exported to Iran. There are secret  testing and weapons development programmes between Iran and  North Korea. American military sources believe that Iran has  provided nuclear technology that North Korea has been unable to  acquire elsewhere.    The Koreans have also acquired mobile launching vehicles,  according to sources. The Nodong-1 are transported on the  chassis of IVECO heavy duty trucks made by Fiat in Italy. The  Salzburg-based Austrian company Palfinger Ag, which makes  special cranes designed for trucks, has imported crane equipment  for this purpose. The cranes can lift the remodelled Scuds on  the trucks and move them in seconds from horizontal transport  into vertical launching positions.    The mobile launching vehicles are difficult to track by spy  satellites and therefore difficult to destroy by aircraft or  cruise missiles--as the allies found when chasing Iraqi Scuds  during the Gulf War. It is believed 30 trucks have been fitted  out as mobile launching pads.    A Beijing-based military attache said yesterday: ``There is  ample evidence of the nuclear programme of North Korea coming  from U.S. intelligence. The only question is whether North  Korea has managed to change the original crude structure into a  bomb and if it can be carried by a rocket. But even that  doesn't matter. North Korea can drop the bomb by plane or  deliver it by boat if it wants.''    North Korea has also tested the reliability and  predictability of the ignition and explosion devices of their  bombs. The secret crater-like test site is on the banks of the  Kuryong River--very close to Korea's main nuclear research  facility at Yongbyon.    North Korea has imported from Europe extensive  high-explosive  testing material and neutron initiator materials, such as  polonium 210 and tritium, sources said.    The device tested was, according to these experts, the most  important evidence that nuclear bombs have been produced. North  Korea, like Iraq, has escaped the export monitoring of special  testing and diagnostic equipment and the necessary high speed  electronic components. It has yet to perform a full-scale  nuclear test, but because of sophisticated detection equipment  employed by the West, it would not be practical for reasons of  secrecy.    However, heat output measurements of North Korea's nuclear  reactor have given some estimates of the amount of plutonium  they have produced--believed to be enough for at least half a  dozen bombs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 04, BNS - Latvian Budget Minister Janis  Platais presented the parliament's Social and Labor Affairs'  Committee Tuesday [4 January] with extra information on the 1994  budget draft.    The explanations are needed because of the highly  complicated  structure of the budget plan, Platais said. In addition, the  representation of some spendings in state and local budgets has  changed, he added.    Platais downplayed criticism, voiced Monday by MP [member of  parliament] Ludmila Kuprijanova, that the government failed to  budget for the social sphere.    The increased pensions are not reflected in the state budget  because the government ties the increase of pensions with the  increase of wages in 1994, and the subsequent raise of social  tax payments, Platais said.    The government also does not intend to cut maternity  allowances, as suggested by Kuprijanova, said Platais, but  parents of minor children will have choose between an allowance  or an income tax waiver.    The budget plan should be pushed through the parliament soon  to start funding the projected reforms, the minister concluded.</p>

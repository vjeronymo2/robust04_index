			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dh. P. Dhimas from Washington] </F>   [Text] Speaking to ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Stephen Oxman, assistant  secretary of state for European affairs, tried to play down the  impression created last week from the statement made by U.S.  State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry that Greek  accusations for "systematic" pursuits against the Greek minority  by the Albanian Government are "unfounded."    According to Oxman, McCurry's statement, which led to two  successive demarches to the State Department, was  misinterpreted. He said: "The remarks were taken out of  context." [previous seven words published in English]    Actually, the more conclusive State Department statement  notes: "Although it does not seem that the Albanian Government's  policy is to suppress the Greek minority," concerns are being  expressed about the situation that prevails on educational  issues and other isolated incidents.    Oxman, however, believes the state of human rights in  Albania  is an issue "that must be examined very seriously." As he told  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the U.S. Government "is in contact with the  Albanian Government about the issues that Greece has raised."  He said: "These issues must be examined seriously." It must  be noted that according to Oxman, international human rights  organizations made the evaluation that "they do not see any  systematic violations" of the Greek minority's rights, thus  indirectly justifying the U.S. position on this specific point.    Oxman referred to two basic problems of the Greek minority,  "the teaching of the Greek language outside the minority zones  and the return of the church's property." Commenting on these  issues, the U.S. official said Washington has taken relevant  steps, conveying the Greek concerns to the Albanian authorities.    The U.S. official said he "hopes" the two countries will  overcome their bilateral problems and continue their "course,"  which was "cut off after the 10 April incident" with the murder  of Albanian soldiers and the arrest of Greek Albanians, to  improve their relations.    Obviously, the United States is aware of the violations of  the Greek minority's human rights, but based on the evidence  available does not consider them as "systematic and the basis of  an official policy." According to reports, the United States  has asked the Greek side, other factors, and organizations, for  additional information to reinforce the Greek claims.</p>

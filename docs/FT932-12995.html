			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Joblessness 'will peak at 3.1m' UNEMPLOYMENT is set to rise by another 210,000 and will peak at around 3.15m by March next year, National Westminster Bank predicted yesterday. Interest rates may also be cut by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent in the summer - but the government will have to backtrack and increase rates to perhaps 7 per cent by next summer, said Mr David Kern, the bank's chief economist. In spite of the fall over the past two months, unemployment will continue to grow.</p>

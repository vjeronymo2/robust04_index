			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Parliamentary News Roundup"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] Theo  Sambuaga, vice chairman of House Commission I [in charge of  foreign affairs, defense, security, and information] considers  the Chinese Government's statement on the labor case in Medan  too excessive. According to Sambuaga, from the United  Development Faction, the Chinese Government's statement was  improper in the context of friendly relations between the two  countries.    [Sambuaga] The statement can affect good relations between  the two countries because it can be interpreted as an act of  interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. It is important  that such an official statement be made cautiously because it  may incite or contribute to undesirable racial conflicts in  Indonesia. Certainly, the Chinese Government and other  governments know that Indonesia has consistently handled various  problems through swift legal approaches and has never  discriminated against its citizens on the basis of ethnicity,  religion, or least of all race. The government has consistently  upheld it's principles in resolving all problems, not just what  happened in Medan with all its excesses. There have been no  problems. What happened in Medan stemmed from irresponsible  acts, and legal action will definitely be taken against the  culprits.    [Correspondent] In this regard, Theo Sambuaga urged the  Department of Foreign Affairs to brief the Chinese ambassador on  the incident so the Chinese Government will not make a wrong  judgment of the events in Indonesia.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRATE!;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY'S FIRST 100 YEARS;  </P> <P> THE IRVINE EXPERIMENT;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY AND UCI: A MARRIAGE NOT EXACTLY MADE IN HEAVEN  </P> <P> Shortly after an eminent educator named James March was recruited in 1964 from  Carnegie Tech to become UC Irvine's first dean of social sciences, he  celebrated his first Fourth of July in Orange County as was his custom: He flew  the American flag in front of his house.  </P> <P> I had dropped by to see him that morning and told him: "If you fly that flag,  everybody around here is going to assume you're against the United Nations, in  favor of impeaching Earl Warren and think that the fluoridation of public water  supplies is a Commie plot."  </P> <P> He didn't believe me and left it flying. The next day, a neighborhood committee  of members of the John Birch Society called on him to ask if he wanted to join  the local chapter.  </P> <P> This is but one of dozens of similar incidents that greeted the impressive --  and startled -- corps of educators who were recruited to help launch UCI's  vision of itself as the "Harvard of the West."  </P> <P> Orange County and UCI weren't exactly a marriage made in heaven. A lot of  unsuspecting educators who were regarded as moderates or even conservatives in  their previous lives found when they arrived here that they were instantly  suspect as left-wingers.  </P> <P> So were the students. A 1967 resolution of the board of governors of the United  Republicans of California asserted that "a deliberate effort is being made to  admit only liberally oriented students to Irvine."  </P> <P> I remember a newly hired English professor, who had left a prestigious job at  an Eastern university, coming into my office at UCI waving a copy of The Times.  He had just read the account of a speech by Dennis Carpenter, then vice  chairman of the Republican State Central Committee (later a state senator from  Orange County), who said -- among other things -- that he would like to see a  UCI "program of recruitment that would hire young, shaven, all-American types  to teach the kids something instead of trying to influence them politically."  </P> <P> This new professor was middle-aged, bearded and politically liberal. He was  also one of the best in his field. I remember the panic in his eyes that  morning as he faced the cold reality that he had sold his home in the East. His  name escapes me because he didn't stay the route, as so many of us did.  </P> <P> I joined UCI in 1966 as a lecturer in the English department and spent 21 years  teaching there. From close up, it strikes me that in its brief life, UCI has  already gone through five rather distinct stages: euphoria, disillusionment,  activism, apathy and technocracy. I have a feeling the latter is going to be  around for a long, long time.  </P> <P> The euphoric stage lasted until about a year after UCI accepted its first  students. Those were the years when we all went out and watched the campus  literally grow out of the brown hills of the Irvine Ranch.  </P> <P> It was an exciting time, a whole new element of great promise introduced into  what had been for so many years an agrarian society. And at the same time the  buildings were going up, human resources were being recruited to write on a  brand-new academic slate -- a challenging prospect that seduced some potent  academicians into coming to this new and unproved school.  </P> <P> UCI and Orange County were able to cohabit briefly in a superficial sort of  harmony. The good citizens were mildly upset over the irreverent selection of  an anteater as a mascot, but things were relatively calm until the San  Francisco Mime Troupe arrived on campus for a performance in the spring of  1966.  </P> <P> Then, quicker than you could say "criminal communist conspiracy," the  UCI-Orange County honeymoon was over -- and disillusionment set in. The Mime  Troupe's performance was called "Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel," and UCI  instantly was accused by the political right in Orange County of providing a  platform for a passel of subversives.  </P> <P> This was Chancellor Dan Aldrich's baptism of fire, and he simply refused to  cave in to the pressures on him to cancel the Mime Troupe performance. It also  established Aldrich in the years to come as possibly the only administrator in  the UC system who could have maintained bridges between the Orange County  community and the UCI student body  </P> <P> during the activism of the 1960s and early '70s. He refused to allow the  Neanderthals on either end of the political spectrum to polarize the community  and the campus to a point beyond repair.  </P> <P> The Mime Troupe performed, and Orange County was outraged -- albeit typically  most of the outrage came from people who hadn't seen the show.  </P> <P> During the activist years that followed -- when campuses all over the nation  were in ferment -- UCI functioned, uneasily and occasionally violently, under  the steady-as-you-go hand of Aldrich. Speakers who were barred from other  campuses -- including representatives of both the hard right and the hard left  -- spoke at UCI.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Orange County Coordinating Republican Assembly passed a  resolution calling for Aldrich's ouster because he "supported, permitted and  protected activities of left-wing organizations on the UCI campus." As perhaps  a harbinger of 1988, the American Civil Liberties Union was cited as a  "left-wing organization."  </P> <P> Those of us on the UCI faculty were catching it from two directions during the  activist period: the Orange County political reactionaries who were riding  high, and some of the more excessive of the activist students on campus. It  wasn't very well understood then -- nor is it now -- that radical students had  more trouble with liberals on the faculty who didn't see themselves as  revolutionaries than with the conservatives with whom they could shout and rail  and call names and then go away mutually satisfied.I remember a good many  sessions in my campus office in which I told radical students from my classes  that they were narcissists who were a hell of a lot more interested in the  choreography of action than in producing real social change. But whatever their  motivation -- and there were plenty whose zeal was strictly high-minded -- they  were exciting and did help accomplish some important social changes: the  rejection of Lyndon Johnson, the 18-year-old vote, the ultimate cashiering of  the Vietnam war, for starters. Contrasted with the present pale lot, I enjoyed  them.  </P> <P> They probably look better in retrospect than they did at the time, because the  students who followed them swung almost to the opposite end of the spectrum. At  least the narcissism of the activists was directed toward social change; with  this new group, the major -- sometimes the total -- concern was with individual  well-being. I allowed students to select their own writing topics, and almost  overnight, the topics changed from the environment and civil rights and social  reform to investments, jobs and how-I-found-God.  </P> <P> Signs of the change were all over the campus. I knew we were in trouble when  there was a massive resurgence of fraternities and sororities -- heretofore  moribund -- at UCI in the mid-1970s. Instead of demonstrating against  Watergate, UCI students built the world's largest ice cream sundae (4,584  pounds of ice cream) in the plaza that a few years earlier housed political  rallies. Shortly afterward, when a call came from the few surviving activists  for a demonstration against the on-campus sale of Coors Beer (for its alleged  racist personnel policies), four people showed up -- and the apathetic period  was in full swing.  </P> <P> State politicians helped it along. Govs. Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown (whose  father had been so instrumental in building the superb UC system) squeezed the  university economically, and UCI began to lose some of its finest faculty.  Plans to make UCI the equal of UCLA and Berkeley were jettisoned. The Harvard  of the West became a dim memory.  </P> <P> That was probably UCI's most difficult stage, although it seemed to please the  local citizens. We weren't rocking many boats. Several of my activist students  came back to visit during this period, and as a result, I wrote a nostalgic  essay for Harper's called "Apathy on the Campus." It produced an avalanche of  letters -- mostly angry -- from students all over the country. One -- not  untypical -- called me "an over-age liberal living vicariously through  recollections of his students' burning banks." So much for the apathetic  period.  </P> <P> Somewhere in the early 1980s, Orange County's high-technology industries, which  had been flirting for years with UCI, decided to escalate the relationship into  a full-time affair, and UCI hasn't been the same since. Nor is it likely to be  for some years to come.  </P> <P> Dan Aldrich, who had a warm relationship with local industry but never climbed  into bed with it, retired. Jack Peltason, who had been around at the beginning  of UCI, returned to lead this campus to new and unexpected heights with  enormous infusions of corporate money and private gifts and grants, based in  large part on UCI's potential contributions to high technology.  </P> <P> I was winding down at UCI when all of this started to happen, and I watched it  almost as if I were outside the whole operation. Enrollment went up  dramatically, and classrooms were overcrowded. It was impossible to walk  anywhere on campus without stumbling over construction equipment. New money  made it possible to lure faculty stars away from other campuses.  </P> <P> But somehow it all -- at least to me -- had the impersonal feeling of an  aircraft factory that had just landed a big contract and knew its future was  secure for a long time to come. The rough edges of intellectual ferment were  missing.  </P> <P> Today, it seems to me, UCI is in close consonance with the community in which  it has finally settled comfortably. There are still some occasional academic  high jinks that unsettle the community, but instead of being front and center,  they are lost in the much larger picture of burgeoning technocracy.  </P> <P> If all of this is mildly distressing to an "over-age liberal," blame it on age  and the times -- and a student body that seems to me mostly inert to social  issues.  </P> <P> When I asked students in two of my classes what they were feeling after our  invasion of Grenada in 1983, about half of them didn't even know the invasion  had taken place. I guess that's when I first realized I should be thinking  about retirement. I don't expect to be around to watch it when -- and if -- the  pendulum starts to swing back.  </P></p>

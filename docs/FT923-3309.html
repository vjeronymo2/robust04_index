			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Not a happy koala LONDON ZOO has more lives than a cat. A few weeks ago it was in such deep trouble that it was going to kill all the animals and turn them into dog food; or fire them off to Mars to launch a new world; or sell them at Christie's; or set the dumb things free - there are 27m, if you count all the insects - in their ancestral homes and habitats. Now they have been reprieved. The zoo is to stay in business. It believes it can survive - thanks, in part, to a larger numbers of visitors in recent times and to campaigns and gifts, including Pounds 1m from my friend and your friend, the Emir of Kuwait. Sir John Chapple, president of the Zoological Society of London, is as delirious as a wombat, and has been quoted as describing the reprieve as 'more than a stay of execution. We have not qualified our decision. The zoo can remain open because of the great efforts of our staff, our friends and the society's fellows.' I was puzzled by that remark. What about the animals? What about their efforts and heroics? So round to the zoo I went. First I spoke to a rhino. Was it true, I asked, that the creatures' lives had been saved by a miraculous marketing effort and an influx of funds, or was there more to it? 'They've certainly pulled the stops out,' said the rhino grudgingly, 'but without us they'd be nothing. In the last two years they've tried every management fad on us that you could put a name to. Quality circles. Team briefings. Flexi-working and annualised hours. Multi-disciplinary project teams. Project charters. Cross-functional integration. Vendor networks. Partnership sourcing. Price corridors. Parallel importing.' 'Parallel importing?' 'It's something to do with bananas.' 'They haven't been cutting your food down?' 'Certainly not,' said the rhino. 'In fact, they've increased it, in acknowledgement of our workload. I conduct more team briefings than you've had hot dinners. We work flexi-time in the rhino house. Our annualised hours are murder. I'm head of the mammalian task force. We cross-functionalise with reptiles and birds - the fish aren't interested, nor are the insects, they're still enjoying communism: they say it works for them - and are starting to vendor network, if you'll pardon my use of the verb form. The saving of London Zoo may have been influenced by your friend and my friend, the Emir of Kuwait, and by the boys and girls in marketing, but the weightiest burden has been shouldered by the animals.' Next I spoke to a zebra. I explained who I was. 'That's a coincidence,' said the zebra. 'I run our media studies group. I am planning to invite you to be a guest speaker - the man who has the last word in the FT every week.' 'What does your group study?' 'The media, stupid. Specifically, how the London media have used every weapon at their disposal - cheque-book journalism, electronic eavesdropping, telephoto cameras, fabricated quotes - to distort and uglify the story of the animals' gallant fight for survival. At one point I thought we were goners. The media's power is horrendous. The checks and balances are inadequate. 'Let me quote from the latest issue of The Journalist's Handbook, which runs a quarterly guide to what is permissible under the Press Complaints Commission's code of practice. It says: 'A national daily newspaper carried a story headlined There are no virgins in Essex. The story was based on their having received no replies to their request for virgins living in Essex to telephone them. Verdict: no breach of the code.' 'You can see what we're up against. In spite of this week's 'reprieve,' we're only a tenth of a pfennig off our absolute floor.' 'Who else should I talk to?' 'Try that koala.' I asked the koala what he thought of the battle to save London Zoo, and of the deliverance of the creatures. The koala said: 'Get stuffed, you rotten pom. I'm under contract to the tabloids.' 'You don't sound very happy.' I offered him a gum leaf. 'Of course I'm not, you bludger. In times of currency turmoil, do you know what constitutes the soundest mode of exchange in international finance? Better than gold or plutonium? It's koalas, you burrowing skink. In exchange for the Emir's Pounds 1m, they're sending me to Kuwait.'</p>

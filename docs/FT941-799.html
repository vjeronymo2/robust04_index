			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Yeltsin signs lease on Baikonur Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement yesterday giving Moscow a 20-year lease on the Baikonur cosmodrome, the space launchpad that became part of the republic of Kazakhstan when the Soviet Union split up two years ago. The agreement, signed in Moscow with the Kazakhstan president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, represented a settlement of what had become among the most contentious issues separating Russia and the central Asian republic. Moscow had sought up to a 99-year lease on the prestigious Baikonur, the 600-sq-mile site from which Russia has launched all its manned flights since Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space in 1961. But Kazakhstan sought a shorter commitment because it wants to operate the site itself once it is technically and economically capable. The deal includes a clause allowing the lease to be extended by 10 years.</p>

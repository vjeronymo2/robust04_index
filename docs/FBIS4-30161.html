			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["War Hysterics Carried Into Extremes" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam called together "directors of non-economic ministries  and agencies of the `government'" at "Chongwadae" on June 20 and  told them that "strength must be built up, if peace is to be  maintained," according to a radio report from Seoul.    On the same day, the traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the  "Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea, showed up at a puppet  army unit in the frontline area and cried "the alert posture  must not be slackened a moment". And he let loose a bellicose  blast, driveling "if a war broke out again, I will fight on the  front even as a private second class."    This fully shows that the war hysterics of the Kim Yong-sam  group has been carried into extremes. It is now running about  like a headless fly to provoke a new war, taking issue with the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North.    The outpouring of the traitor Kim Yong-sam fully revealed  his  criminal intrigue to contain the North with armed forces in  reliance on outside forces. And the traitor Kim Chong-pil's  outcry that "he would fight on the front" is a harebrained folly  of a special-class bellicose element who has gone off into war  hysterics, itching to provoke a war against the North.    The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique are precipitating their  own destruction by persistently resorting to the criminal moves  to do harm to the fellow countrymen and plunge the nation into a  holocaust of a nuclear war in league with outside forces,  peddling the "doctrine of inevitability of sanctions against the  North".</p>

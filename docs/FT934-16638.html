			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Futures volume jumps on Chicago exchanges VOLUME at Chicago's two big futures exchanges surged in September. Chicago Board of Trade volume hit 16.4m contracts in September, up 34 per cent from a year ago. Volume for the first nine months of the year was 131.2m, a 15 per cent increase from a year ago. Although some analysts expected turnover in CBoT's Treasury bond futures to fall after a US Treasury decision to issue fewer long bonds, September T-bond futures volume jumped 25 per cent to 7.4m and T-bond options by 60.5 per cent to 2.5m. At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, exchange-wide volume hit 13.8m contracts in September, the second-busiest month on record and a 20.4 per cent increase from a year ago. For the first nine months, CME volume was up 11.2 per cent at 110.5m contracts. Eurodollar futures and options volume scored a record in September, at 7.8m contracts. Eurodollar options volume advanced 29 per cent over last year, and Eurodollar futures 34.8 per cent. Exchange officials attributed the robust activity to institutional swaps traders who lay off risks from over-the-counter transactions on the exchanges.</p>

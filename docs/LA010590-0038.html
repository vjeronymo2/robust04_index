			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL UPSETS SIMI VALLEY ON LATE GOAL  </P> <P> Daniel Morris scored from 10 yards out with two minutes remaining to give Royal  High a 3-2 upset victory over previously undefeated Simi Valley on Thursday  night in a Marmonte League boys' soccer match.  </P> <P> One minute after Morris scored on a penalty kick to give Royal a 1-0 lead in  the second half, Daniel Anderson fouled Simi Valley striker Kenny Greninger,  setting up a Pioneer penalty kick.  </P> <P> Greninger took the shot, but Royal goalkeeper Steven Hambly dived to his right  and deflected it. Marc Cargnel gathered the rebound and fired from 12 yards.  Hambly, barely off the ground after Greninger's shot, dived to his left and  made the block.  </P> <P> "After I saved it (the first time), I saw where it was going," Hambly said. "I  knew it was coming, but I didn't know where it was going. I just reacted."  </P> <P> Simi Valley (15-1, 1-1 in league play), ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section  4-A Division, tied the score, 1-1, on Cargnel's head shot from 10 yards out at  the 24-minute mark.  </P> <P> Matt Brinkman found the lower left corner of the net on a penalty kick to give  the Highlanders (11-2-1, 1-0) a 2-1 lead with 11 minutes to play.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, Cargnel had scored what appeared to be the equalizing  goal, but the score was negated because the Pioneers were offsides.  </P> <P> With five minutes remaining, Simi Valley striker Brian Weaver's penalty kick to  the upper left corner tied the score, 2-2.  </P> <P> Royal's victory avenged a 4-1 defeat to the Pioneers last month in the  championship match of the Simi Valley tournament.  </P> <P> "It's a local derby," Royal Coach Peter Schraml said. "It's emotional. The  Valley pride is at stake."  </P> <P> Simi Valley, however, was without the services of All-American midfielder Craig  Hampton, who is playing with a U. S. national soccer team on the East Coast  until Monday.  </P> <P> But Simi Valley Coach Andy Silva said that the Pioneers' loss could not be  attributed to Hampton's absence.  </P> <P> "We miss him on the field, obviously, but we're not going to say that we lost  because he wasn't here. It just wasn't meant to be today at all."  </P></p>

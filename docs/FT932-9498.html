			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Berlusconi expected to float publishing unit MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, is today expected to announce the flotation of the Silvio Berlusconi Editore publishing operation in an attempt to raise cash for his Fininvest holding company. Precise terms of the deal remain unclear, amid some uncertainty as to whether Fininvest will float SBE independently, or as part of a more complex transaction involving its majority-owned Mondadori publishing operation, which is listed on the stock market. The signs are the deal will take place through a reverse takeover of Mondadori by SBE, combined with a share swap for Mondadori shareholders into SBE. That will be followed by a placing of up to 49 per cent of SBE's stock. Terms of the transaction will be announced after a SBE board meeting and extraordinary shareholders' meeting today. It marks a turnabout for Mr Berlusconi, who has not hidden his distaste for having outside investors. However, the need to raise cash for Fininvest has increased as acquisition-led expansion has been halted and debts have mounted. SBE publishes Italy's best-selling magazine, TV Sorrisi e Canzoni, and has recently launched Noi, a new mass-market weekly. The company, which also has substantial commercial printing activities, made net profits of L29.7bn (Dollars 19.4m) on sales of L320bn last year. Mondadori is Italy's biggest publisher, with a range of book and magazine interests.</p>

Current statistics, however, do  not always reflect precisely the real state of affairs, do not  provide the ability to separate the accidental from a pattern.  General trends acquire shape only from a distance, and without  the knowledge of these trends, it is hard to forecast further  changes in the political situation in Ukraine in 1994. It is  from this angle that we would like to analyze the dynamics of  public opinion regarding power structures, parties, and  politicians of Ukraine from January to December of 1993, because  the trends revealed in the course of research represent more  than historic value today.  <H5>  I.

Over the entire year, in the environment of deepening  economic crisis, the level of confidence in major institutions  of state authority in Ukraine--the president, the Supreme  Council, and the government--steadily declined. Only the  confidence in the president rose temporarily in September (after  he took charge of the government), but not for long. For all  practical purposes already in the first half of the year the  level of Ukrainian citizens' confidence in the president, the  government, and the Supreme Council dropped so low that a  referendum on confidence in them would indeed be superfluous.    2. It would be naive to think, however, that new  parliamentary and presidential elections would drastically  change for the better the problem of confidence in power  structures. First, on the local level the degree of confidence  in the executive and representative authority is even lower than  in the center, and also continues to drop. Which means that a  reform of authority will not be accomplished in these elections.    Second, research shows that each subsequent government at  the  time it is elected starts off with a lower credit of confidence  than the preceding one. The same will be true with respect to  the new parliament and president. In order to raise this level  of confidence, a change for the better in the economic situation  is needed, which is even less likely in 1994.  <H3>  II. Political Parties: Their Number Keeps Increasing, And  They Are Still As Far Removed From the People As Before </H3>   The number of political parties almost doubled over the  course of 1993, to more than 30, but their popularity among the  populace remained extremely low. As a year before, half of the  populace did not trust any of the parties. The adoption of a  majority-based election law exacerbated even more the crisis of  the multiparty system in Ukraine and the split of the populace  along political and party lines. Thus, a vicious circle has  formed: Without multiparty elections, parties will remain  discussion clubs, but without a politically structured society,  multiparty elections will turn into (as happened in Russia) a  dangerous game with unpredictable consequences.    That is why it is very difficult to analyze the trends in  the  changing popularity of parties in 1993. And although the  popularity of the parties of national-democratic orientation  (Rukh, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican  Party) lately increased and they are faring much better than  both left-wing parties (the Communist Party of Ukraine, the  Socialist Party of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Labor Party) and  the parties of liberal-social-democratic orientation,  nevertheless, even on the threshold of new elections this does  not tell us much.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dynamics of Electoral Preferences

|  |Academy of Sciences and Democratic Initiative center)                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      First, a majority-based system will be used in the  elections;  in this arrangement, a candidate's personal  popularity--especially in villages and small towns--means more  than his party affiliation.    Second, a considerable number of supporters of the  Democratic  Party and the Greens Party represents more likely a positive  response to the ideas of democratism and protection of the  environment (that is, a party's pretty name) than to a  particular party with its particular leaders.    Third, the process of forming political blocs has begun,  which may change substantially the political situation on the  threshold of the elections. For instance, a December poll of  Kievans conducted by the Ukraine Sociology Service [as rendered]  showed that the creation of the Kuchma-Grinev Inter-regional  Bloc of Reforms [MBR] by itself already has changed  substantially Kievans' electoral attitudes. While a month ago  Kievans preferred Rukh (10 percent), the DemPU (4 percent), New  Ukraine (4 percent), the KPU and SPU (4 percent), in December 17  percent intended to vote for the MBR (or, to be precise, for  Kuchma and Grinev), 15 percent--for Rukh, 6 percent--for the KPU  and SPU, and 6 percent--for the DemPU.    Still, it is clear that given our patriarchal-authoritarian  mentality, it is political leaders rather than blocs and parties  that will determine the results of parliamentary and  presidential elections.  <H5>  Dynamics of Political Leaders' Ratings: No Surprises </H5>   There were no substantive changes with respect to the  popularity of the leading figures on the political Olympus of  the Ukrainian leadership in 1993.    The main trend of the year is the struggle for the top spot  in popularity ratings between Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma.  Having burst into the Ukrainian political elite at the end of  1992, Leonid Kuchma quickly became not only one of the top five  leaders in terms of popularity, but also surpassed the  indisputable leader of the 1991-1992 seasons--the president--in  the spring. And although the Kuchma government eventually  achieved nothing with respect to reform and stabilization of the  economy, this did not hurt Leonid Danylovych's image. As  research shows, the prime minister's lead in June-July 1993  became a real threat. Having "swallowed" Leonid Kuchma, the  president regained leadership in September, but the former prime  minister's latest steps show that he has not yet exhausted his  potential. Quite likely, the competition for the president's job  in the summer will center on these two figures. Right now there  is little likelihood that Ivan Plyushch, Vyacheslav Chornovil,  Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, and Igor Yukhnovskyy, let alone Vladimir  Grinev, Kostyantyn Morozov, and other politicians, will be able  to get in. As 1993 showed, ratings do not change very quickly,  and therefore even with the remaining half a year it is almost  impossible even for these politicians to pull enough percentage  points away from Kravchuk or Kuchma. If the MBR nominates as its  presidential candidate Grinev instead of Kuchma, it would be  naive to hope that the former prime minister will be able to  convince his supporters to vote for the former deputy  speaker--most likely his electorate will swing to Kravchuk,  Plyushch, and other representatives of the "power party."

Even the share of  those who named him as the politician of the year has not  changed, although in terms of ratings the president more than  once lost the lead to the prime minister. We, of course,  congratulate both Leonid Makarovych and all of us on the  occasion. Because in the environment of continuing economic  collapse, hyperinflation, and impoverishment of the citizens,  few politicians in the world could hope for such support. Either  we have a different political mentality, or there are just too  few politicians known to the people....    It is enough to look at the top eight politicians of the  year  to confirm that they are all familiar faces. The only difference  perhaps is that former Prime Minister Vitold Fokin has  disappeared into oblivion, and the only discovery of the year  was--by now also former--Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk,  who placed sixth in the poll. The year of 1994 is not only a  Year of Blue Dog--it is also a year of parliamentary and  presidential elections. And most likely we will be electing new  leaders from the old deck.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |For Whom Will the Citizens of Ukraine Vote in the Presidential Elections (in |  |%)                                                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Potential candidate      |January 1993             |December 1993            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Leonid Kravchuk          |15.3                     |16.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Leonid Kuchma            |5.8                      |16.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vyacheslav Chornovil     |7.0                      |9.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Grinev          |2.8                      |4.8                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ivan Plyushch            |1.0                      |3.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Igor Yukhnovskyy         |1.7                      |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Levko Lukyanenko         |1.5                      |2.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Data of sociological surveys conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the |  |Ukrainian Academy of Sciences [January] and Sotsis-Gallup joint enterprise [-|  |December].)                                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

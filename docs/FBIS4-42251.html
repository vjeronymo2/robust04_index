			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ake Ekdahl report: "Growing Numbers Hesitant About the EU"] </F>   [Excerpt] The Swedish people's attitude to European Union  [EU] membership remains stable but is characterized by a  wait-and-see approach. The yes side has been weakened a little  in the course of the spring. The number of undecided has  increased. The no side remains unchanged. The "don't know"  group has increased notably among Social Democratic voters.    This is what emerges from DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's opinion poll  carried out in the last week of May when it is compared with the  results in April and February.     -  The yes side today has 31  percent against 34 percent in April and 35 percent in February.  The whole series of figures since May 1992 is as follows: 39,  35, 31, 29, 35, 34, 31.    -  The no side has 42 percent -- unchanged  for the last three polls. The whole series: 38, 43, 45, 45,  42, 42, 42.    -  Undecided voters or voters who do not intend to vote  today total 27 percent, an increase of 3 percent since April and  of 4 percent since February. The whole series: 23, 23, 24, 26,  23, 24, 27.     The yes side's upward trend last winter has come to an end.  Asked how the EU referendum will turn out in November, a  majority of voters generally reply that they believe that the  outcome will be a majority for yes. This is interpreted to mean  that the yes side has a chance of gaining many supporters in the  large group of the undecided. Today more than one voter in four  has no firm view on the EU question.    Nonsocialist voters who are opponents of the EU are still  hesitant about showing their true colors, because the no side is  seen as a left-wing scheme.    Socialist voters who are supporters of the EU are  vacillating  because the yes side is still seen as a right-wing idea.    The percentage of those who are certain about the decision  they have reached is large and growing on the no side. Today 65  percent are completely certain about their "no" choice, against  57 percent earlier this spring. [passage omitted]</p>

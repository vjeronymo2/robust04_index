			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Legal Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> On May 16, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled against the Postal Service in the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Postal Service  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and enjoined it from offering International Customized Mail (ICM) service. ICM was a new service in which the Postal Service negotiated service features and rates with qualifying customers that entered into service agreements. To qualify for ICM service, a customer had to be capable of annually tendering to the Postal Service at least 1 million pounds of international mail or paying at least $2 million in international postage, and of tendering all of its mail to the Postal Service at one location. ICM enabled the Postal Service to provide customer-specific service offerings at rates that reflected the specific costs incurred in providing the service. Rates and services in any ICM service agreement were available to any customer qualifying for the service that sent mail with similar characteristics and that undertook the same preparation and work-sharing specified in the service agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The District Court first held that UPS, as a competitor of the Postal Service, had standing to challenge ICM service even though it did not allege that ICM rates were predatory. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates violated section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Act), 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), because ICM agreements were with individual mailers and section 403(b)(2) limits the Postal Service to providing services and establishing rates for categories of mail and mailers consisting of more than one mailer. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates were unduly discriminatory because a mailer had to be capable of posting 1 million pounds of mail or paying $2 million annually in postage to be eligible for the service, but did not have to tender those minimum volumes to the Postal Service to receive ICM service. Under those circumstances, the Court concluded, different mailers could be paying different rates for similar mail and mail services. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates inequitably apportioned the costs of postal services because smaller mailers that could meet the minimum capabilities requirements did not have access to ICM rates even if they mailed similar quantities of mail. Finally, the District Court concluded that ICM rates were illegal because under section 407 of the Act, 39 U.S.C. 407, the Postal Service had to obtain the consent of the President to establish international rates, and the Postal Service had not obtained Presidential consent for ICM rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service is appealing the District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and is confident that it will prevail on appeal. Notwithstanding the appeal, however, the Postal Service recognizes that it is obligated to comply with the terms of the District Court's injunction as long as it is in effect, and that IPCS may be challenged under the same legal theories that UPS used to challenge ICM service. Consequently, when designing IPCS, the Postal Service avoided those features of ICM service that the District Court found to be inconsistent with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, IPCS will be available, under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates, to any customer that can meet the qualifying criteria. All customers that use IPCS to mail packages to a particular country will receive the same delivery services. Further, all IPCS customers will pay the same base rates and will be able to take advantage of the same volume discounts. Thus, all customers using IPCS to Japan, even those that eventually mail 500,000 or more packages during a 12-month period, will pay the same rates for their first 100,000 packages. Similarly, all customers will pay the same rates for their next 150,000 packages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the volume-based qualifying criteria will be based on the actual number of packages that the customer will tender, not on the customer's potential volume. In selecting 25,000 packages per 12 months per country as the qualifying threshold, the Postal Service struck a balance between its desire to provide the service to as many customers as practicable and its need to be able to recover the costs associated with providing the service, including the costs of establishing the necessary information system linkages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the foregoing, the implementation of IPCS is fully consistent not only with the provisions of the Act that govern international rates and services, but also with the District Court's decision in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> V. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accordingly, the Postal Service hereby adopts IPCS to Japan, on an interim basis, at the rates set forth in the schedule above. Although 39 U.S.C. 407 does not require advance notice and opportunity for submission of comments, and the Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments concerning the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> International postal service, Foreign relations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Postal Service adopts the following amendments to the International Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations.

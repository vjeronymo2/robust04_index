			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Substantial increase to ADollars 76m at ICI Australia ICI Australia, the quoted Australian company in which Imperial Chemical Industries holds a majority interest, reported a sharp increase to ADollars 76.4m (Pounds 36.7m) in profits after tax for the six months to end-March. The outcome compared with ADollars 48.4m last time, struck before abnormal items of ADollars 10.6m. There were no abnormal charges in the latest set of figures. ICI attributed the upturn to a 7 per cent volume increase, control of costs and a reduction in interest charges, down from ADollars 19m to ADollars 13.9m. In divisional terms, the chemicals business saw trading profits little changed at ADollars 49m (ADollars 50m), with demand healthy but caustic soda prices depressed. The plastics division incurred a reduced loss of ADollars 6m (ADollars 12m) as it continued to struggle against low world prices. Trading profits from fertilisers and crop-care rose from ADollars 8m to ADollars 15m, while the consumer and effect products division contributed ADollars 76m (ADollars 55m). ICI added that 'while prices generally seem likely to remain low and competition keen, result for the full year should satisfactorily exceed 1993 if the improved business climate is maintained'. The interim dividend goes up from 7 cents to 11 cents. The company also revealed that a decision is likely to be reached this week on whether to proceed with the construction of a ADollars 200m-plus ethane pipeline, linking South Australia's Cooper Basin with ICI's ethylene plant at Botany Bay. ICI said that negotiations over terms for the supply from the South Australian gasfields were at a critical stage and that the timing necessitated a decision this week, although an announcement might not be made immediately.</p>

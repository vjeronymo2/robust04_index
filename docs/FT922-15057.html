			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Canaletto campaign The National Gallery's successful campaign to acquire Holbein's 'Portrait of a lady with a pet squirrel' has diverted attention from the Tate Gallery's attempt to retain Canaletto's 'The Old Horse Guards, London' from possible export, writes Antony Thorncroft. The Harris Estate had put the painting for sale at Christies' on April 15. The Tate is keen to acquire this important work, painted in 1749, a year before the Old Horse Guards was demolished. Unfortunately, the National Heritage Fund stumped up Pounds 3.5m for the Holbein and can credibly plead poverty. The Canaletto would cost at least Pounds 3m, but negotiations continue and could still end in success.</p>

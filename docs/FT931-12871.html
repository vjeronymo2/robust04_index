			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Technology: Falling victim to its own success - Germany's recycling scheme is under attack from both industry and environmentalists For millions of conscientious Germans, rubbish is not just something to be thrown away these days. It is looked at closely first. If the packaging has a green dot, it goes into a special yellow bin and not into the usual black container. Printed on 80 per cent of all packages sold in Germany - including wine bottles, food wrappings, cans and cartons - the green dot (der grune Punkt) has become the most visible sign of the ambitious German scheme which aims to sort, collect and recycle the bulk of household waste. But one and a half years after its birth, the green dot system has come under attack. Concerned that the fast-growing scheme is fostering a monopoly, the Federal Cartel Office recently opened an investigation against Duales System Deutschland, the nationwide rubbish collecting enterprise which operates the green dot system. Moreover, an increasing number of environmentalists claim the system is only a fig-leaf used by industry to avoid costly environmental investment. Launched in mid-1990 by 600 German industrial groups, DSD was set up after parliament adopted a ground-breaking law which raised hackles in the packaging industry in Germany and the rest of western Europe. The law effectively coerces manufacturers into recovering and re-using the ever increasing quantities of packaging waste, and has been considered by the EC as a possible blueprint for a European packaging directive. Meanwhile, member countries are trying similar systems. Last September, France set up an 'eco-emballage' scheme which requires municipalities to collect packaging products already marked for sorting. So far, the scheme is in its infancy, with little sign of the French picking up the habit of sorting their own rubbish. Arthur D Little, the US management consultancy group, is devising a DSD-type organisation for the more orderly-minded Austrians. The German law says manufacturers must ensure that, by July 1 1995, 80 per cent of all packaging is collected and that 80 per cent of this amount is recycled. There is a phase-in period: since January 1 1993, 60 per cent of glass packaging, 40 per cent of tin-plate packaging and 30 per cent of aluminium, cardboard, paper and plastic packaging has had to be collected. The law obliged Lander (states) to choose, by January 1 1993, a nationwide waste collection and recycling system. Most Lander have chosen DSD, which is now required to extend its operations from house-to-house collection into the small business sector. Set up to operate in 95 per cent of German cities and districts - not all affected households have yellow bins yet - DSD has attracted the attention of the Berlin-based cartel office with its planned expansion. 'We cannot ignore the law, but we must decide the limits within which DSD should be allowed to operate,' says Jurgen Kiecker, the cartel office spokesman. DSD regards the cartel office's move as unjustified. 'The law forces us to have a nationwide network and therefore operate as a monopoly,' replies spokeswoman Ines Siegles. 'And the Lander are now calling on us to organise the collection of packaging in the business sector. This is an extra burden for us, as it means developing a new collection infrastructure for industrial packaging.' Furthermore, she argues, DSD is a non-profit organisation. The system itself is based on the 'polluter pays' approach. For DSD and the packaging industry, that means the end-user. Consumers pay an average of two pfennigs on products bearing the green dot. The money is used to cover the expenses of DSD, which collects and sorts the waste before handing it over to recycling companies. Set up by industries to ensure that waste gets recycled as prescribed by the law, DSD does not make a profit or sell the waste. But small recycling enterprises, which depend on DSD to supply the collected waste, have been complaining to the cartel office. They claim DSD prevents competition in the recycling industry. DSD has a network of waste disposal contractors across the country. Run on the grounds that it is more cost efficient, the network is fostering a concentration in the waste industry. 'We cannot say now if the recycling industry will also become monopolistic as a result of DSD activities. But pressure is likely to grow on legislators to ensure this is not the case,' says Frank Annighofer, German-based head of Arthur D Little's European environmental department. Those members of the recycling industry which do business with DSD defend themselves against the complaints of their competitors. They say that the large investments needed to make recycling profitable for some products, such as plastics, justify expansion. But the capacity of the recycling industry remains below the targets set by the ambitious law. Recycling industries which were well-developed before its adoption, such as those for glass and paper, have been able to cope with the increased quantities of collected waste. Today, some 44 per cent of the feedstock into the German paper industry is waste paper. A similar percentage applies to glass products. For more complicated industrial products, however, where recycling is less profitable, reprocessing facilities are lacking. According to Annighofer, plastic is recycled 'for political reasons'. Scientifically, so little raw material is recovered that it makes more sense not to recycle plastic products. The waste industry estimates that it will need to invest about DM7bn (Pounds 2.8bn) to build up an efficient infrastructure for all forms of waste disposal. The law offers a solution to the under-capacity of the recycling industry, however. Classifying waste as raw material, it allows for it to be exported. About 30 per cent of the 350,000 tonnes of plastic products to be collected in 1993 by DSD (out of an estimated 1m tonnes of plastics used each year in Germany) will be exported to foreign countries, including France, Belgium, Switzerland and China. The export of German waste has led to a series of international controversies. To ward off accusations of illegal dumping, DSD has pushed for the investigation of waste disposal contractors. The independent German Technical Inspection Agency (TuV) is now charged with verifying the sorting and recycling plants in Germany and abroad. It submits regular reports to DSD on incoming and outgoing materials. But some environmentalists claim that inspection is not enough to ensure viable ecological processes are carried out. They say that waste exported to developing countries is not being recycled but dumped or incinerated instead. 'The law offers a neat way of circumventing the Basle Convention limiting the export of waste,' says Michael Braungart of the Hamburg-based Environment Protection Encouragement Agency, a private institute. 'It also takes incentives away from industry to invest in recycling its products at home.' But industrialists say such problems will be solved in time. 'Every law opens up 1,000 questions for each waste disposal company and manufacturer,' says Norbert Bohm, a director of TK Umweltdienste, the DSD waste disposal contractor for Bonn. 'It takes know-how and large capital investment, which cannot be acquired overnight.' Clearly, incentives for recyclers will increase as more waste is collected. The venture's success will also depend on the public's response. Other European households could soon be treated to the sight of 'Hugo the bin' and 'Egon the sack', two comic characters used on German children's television to publicise the green dot.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR OVER BIBLE SCHOLARS ON SECOND COMING OF CHRIST  </P> <P> The Jesus Seminar scholars are fulfilling Bible prophecy they decry when they  proclaim that Jesus did not say He would return. The Bible says, " . . . In the  last days mockers will come with their mocking . . . saying, 'Where is the  promise of His coming?' For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues  just as it was from the beginning of creation" (II Peter 3:3,4).  </P> <P> The scoffers of the academe must establish their biblical credibility by  explaining who Jesus was. In John 14:28, Jesus said to his disciples and to the  multitudes who would believe in him throughout the ages, "I said unto you, I go  away, and come again unto you." If he does not return, then he is a liar and  the entire Christian faith is based upon a falsehood. The truth of the second  coming dominates the New Testament; it is mentioned 318 times, more often than  any other fundamental doctrine.  </P> <P> These academicians may be wise in other subjects, but they should not be called  biblical scholars, since they would have to cut out a major portion of their  Bibles. They would not be left with a shred of evidence for their premise. We  are grateful to Beutner for warning us that most major universities and  seminaries agree with the findings. It should urge open-minded people to search  the Scriptures for themselves -- before it is too late.  </P> <P> CAROLE C. CARLSON  </P> <P> Solvang  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY HOSTS APPRECIATE PRESENTS THAT HAVE PRESENCE ABOUT THEM  </P> <P> Some guests may tremble at the prospect of picking just the right holiday  offering for that sophisticated host. But one recent visitor to the home of  Colin Cowie, a Westside party designer and caterer extraordinaire, was not  intimidated.  </P> <P> "I know you told me that you love the apple tart from Michel Richard," the  guest told Cowie, proffering the treat at his host's front door, "but I must  apologize -- the maid took a big bite out of it."  </P> <P> Cowie, who was charmed by the flawed tart, tells the story to emphasize that,  at holiday parties, it's your presence, not your gift, that counts.  </P> <P> "The whole idea is to get together, not to wait in anticipation to see what  people are going to bring you," he said.  </P> <P> Given that assurance -- and the equally comforting advice from prime  party-goers and etiquette sages that, in most cases, it's fine to show up  empty-handed -- it still holds that an invitation to dinner during the holidays  will leave most people groping at the last minute for the proper token to tote.  </P> <P> The age-old instinct -- to bring wine or flowers -- has come under scrutiny in  recent years.  </P> <P> Charlotte Ford, author of an etiquette book and a manners column for McCall's  Magazine, said guests should never take flowers to a dinner party, although it  is acceptable to send them later. Why? Because if presented with such a gift,  "the hostess has to leave her guests and run and find a vase."  </P> <P> Ford's is not the final word on this issue, as some other knowledgeable folk  still prefer flowers to other gifts.  </P> <P> Charlie Scheips, whose holiday schedule sends him scrambling for a gift as many  as five nights a week, says flowers make an evening of food and conversation  less ephemeral.  </P> <P> "The next day, you're gone, but the flowers still are there," said Scheips,  organizer of Art L. A. '89, an international art fair at the Convention Center  Dec. 7-11.  </P> <P> As for wine, still one of the most popular dinner gifts, many in the know now  urge against this offering because it may undercut or befuddle the host who  already has the beverage selected for the evening.  </P> <P> Here, too, the naysayers are not going unchallenged. Ford, for instance, says  it's fine to take wine, just don't expect the host to uncork it that evening.  That way no one has to worry about the selection clashing with the meal.  </P> <P> If the function is formal, it's better not to take a gift at all but to send  something before or after the event.  </P> <P> Cowie's favorite pre-party gift is a box of Teusche Champagne truffles flown in  from Europe once a week and available for $18-$72 at the Teuscher store in  Beverly Hills. He calls the chocolates the best in the world.  </P> <P> "If I have the time to do it, I make a basket and put in Christmas mince pies  and almonds," Cowie said.  </P> <P> But, if he's rushed, Cowie might go with a tin of Williams-Sonoma Scottish  shortbread (about $10), tied with a red or green ribbon. Party-goers en route  to dinner engagements also breeze by the Williams-Sonoma stores around town for  mustards, olive oils and Fini vinegar ($9 a bottle).  </P> <P> Another Cowie suggestion is the popular champagne and caviar gift baskets from  Wally's Liquor Store in West Los Angeles. They run anywhere from $50 to more  than $500.  </P> <P> But what is most endearing to hosts these days is not the guest who drops $500  on caviar but one who bakes a bundt cake, glazes walnuts, or hand paints an  ornament.  </P> <P> "In 1989, time is of the essence and what really is very special is if someone  has taken time on a gift," Cowie said.  </P> <P> Sandra Ausman, chief of protocol for Los Angeles County, agreed, adding that  the most cherished party offering these days is anything homemade.  </P> <P> A good source of do-it-yourself ideas is Martha Stewart's new Christmas  cookbook, she said. An item from Stewart's book Ausman recommends is the  pomander, a scented orange made to be hung in closets or hallways during the  holidays. You take an orange, stud it with cloves (adding the cloves is hard on  the thumbs, Ausman said) then hang it up to dry and later roll it in cinnamon  and other spices.  </P> <P> Another inexpensive gift from Stewart's book is potpourri. Ausman said she  saved all the flower petals from her daughter's wedding this year and now has  lots of dried petals to stuff in potpourri pouches along with spices and  scents.  </P> <P> Joan Weiss, who attends many social functions in her dual roles as director of  special events at the Music Center and president of the board of directors of  the Downtown Women's Center, said a sure-fire gift is wrapping paper designed  by artists. Some recipients find the paper so beautiful that they can't bear to  use it as wrapping, she said.  </P></p>

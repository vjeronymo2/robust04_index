			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / FT Guide to the Week MONDAY Euro-election results Governments and voters throughout Europe digest the results of the weekend elections for the 567-member European parliament and the referendum on EU membership in Austria. The big question now for the Strasbourg political groupings is whether the parliament's increased powers can be translated into positive action - to improve parliamentary supervision of the Commission and Council of Ministers, and to increase the cohesiveness of legislation affecting the 269m-strong EU electorate.

If found guilty, Mr Naqvi would be returned to Abu Dhabi but only after standing trial in the US and serving any sentence received there. EU foreign ministers conclude a two-day meeting in Luxembourg to prepare for the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25.

Meantime, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine is due in Luxembourg today to sign an accord with the EU promising closer economic and political ties. Ukraine will be the first ex-Soviet state to form an official relationship with the EU. The accord opens the door for Ukraine to join the European free trade area as early as 1998. Royal Ascot starts today with the St James's Palace Stakes, which promises to be the highlight of the meeting. The racing continues until Friday, with Ladies Day on Thursday.

Bosnia: Senior officials from the 'contact' group, comprising the US, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, are expected to meet in London today to discuss moves towards a broad political settlement in the former Yugoslavia.

Berlusconi in Bonn: Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi meets Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn in his first top level European diplomatic meeting since assuming office a month ago.

The pro-EU leaderships of the three are expected to prevail, but not without agonised debate.

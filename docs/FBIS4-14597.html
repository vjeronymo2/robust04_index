			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Fadeyev report under "World Hot Spots -- </F> Yugoslavia" rubric: "First Turks, then Germans..."]    [Text] Belgrade -- In the "Yugoslavia" hotel, where the  headquarters of the UN peacekeeping forces is billeted, I met a  major from a West European country, whom I had met on a number  of trips, and heard something unexpected:    "Naturally, this is not my business, but you have 'set  yourselves up' again; by agreeing to send 400 Russian 'blue  helmets' to Bosnia, you have given the Muslims a gift which they  have long been dreaming about. The Turks will immediately  arrive in Sarajevo in response...."    The very next day, Muslim leader A. Izetbegovic protested to  all and sundry against the arrival of the Russian "blue  helmets," who, in his opinion, cannot be neutral, since they are  the Serbs' allies. And then he asked the question: "If Russia  has arrived in Sarajevo, why can Turkey not do the same thing?"    And so, in violation of the unwritten UN principle not to  send military subunits from neighboring countries or former  occupaniers to Bosnia, its secretary general has given the Turks  permission for this. First it was a question of 200 servicemen.  Then it was reported: Ankara is sending 2,700 men.    The reaction of Belgrade and the Balkan countries was not  long coming. Here are just a few headlines: "Janissaries  Again," "Turkey -- Threat to Peace," "Return of the Ottoman  Empire."    The Turkish foreign minister commented as follows on the UN  decision to allow Turkish troops to be part of the "blue  helmets": "This is a triumph for Turkish policy."    The Bosnian Serbs, Belgrade, Athens, and Sofia do not think  so. Their opinion is unanimous: Turkey was an occupier for many  years, and it is not at all appropriate for it to be involved in  peacekeeping actions in Bosnia since it is a prejudiced force.    By and large it is impossible to get rid of the idea that on  every occasion, as if deliberately, the West and the United  States think up "solutions" with one aim alone -- to add fuel to  the smoldering fire.    And what about Moscow? The Greek newspaper TA NEA, which is  close to government circles, writes that only Russia could  hinder the dispatch of Turkish troops. However, its UN  representative, Vorontsov, has stated that the Russian  Government is in agreement with the Turkish proposal....    Naive Athens observers: Moscow has already congratulated  Athens on its peacekeeping contribution, and, for the purposes  of balance, is sending another 300 servicemen to Bosnia who  include representatives of Muslim nationalities.    Speaking at a parliamentary sitting, the leader of the  Bosnian Muslims, touching on the UN decision to involve Turkey  in its operations, stated in particular: "The conditions for a  major war are thus being created." If the Turks arrive, he  said, then the armed forces of Yugoslavia, as a member of the  United Nations, will enter the Serb Republic.    The UN Security Council has adopted the following decision:  The city of Mostar, which the Croats and the Muslims can in no  way divide up between themselves, will be under the control of  the European Union in the next two years. To accomplish this  its leaders have instructed...Germany. And one of the fathers  of the city of Bremen has been appointed Governor of Mostar. He  will bring with him his own administrative officials and police.</p>

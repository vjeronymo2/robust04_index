			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats amid worries on outlook SHARE PRICES lost ground in small-lot selling by investment trusts, and the Nikkei average closed below the psychologically important 16,500 level for the first time since November 17 last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index closed down 201.87 at 16,336.81, a 1 per cent decline on the week. The index rose to the day's high of 16,540.88 in the morning session and fell to a low of 16,333.81 before the close at anxiety about a possible collapse in share prices next month. Volume fell to 180m shares from 199m. Declines led advances by 656 to 216 with 202 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.96 to 1,256.70, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.10 to 1,025.62. Caution has been mounting among market participants regarding a 'February crash' due to liquidation of specified money trusts by corporations ahead of March book closing, margin selling and arbitrage trading. Comments by Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, who yesterday ruled out the need for imminent stock market support measures, also unnerved market participants. Sentiment was further depressed after Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren - the Federation of Economic Organisations - announced that a stock purchasing company, proposed by some economists, was unnecessary. Retail issues held by Shuwa, the stock and property speculator, continued to fall after Thursday's reports that the company was looking to sell its holdings. Isetan fell Y120 to Y1,860 and Matsuzakaya lost Y61 to Y959. Ito-Yokado, a supermarket chain, which last year held negotiations to buy Isetan shares from Shuwa, lost Y100 to Y3,400. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, fell Y12 to Y348 on profit-taking by dealers. Pioneer Electronic fell Y150 to Y2,370 on reports that the research division of Nikko Securities had lowered its earnings projection. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 120.59 to 17,891.38, down 0.9 per cent on the week, in volume of 30.9m shares. Roundup In the Pacific Rim, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul were closed for the Lunar Year long weekend holiday. SINGAPORE moved ahead at the end of the half-day session, lifting the Straits Times Industrial index 2.91 to 1,596.78, 1.5 per cent down on the week. Volume was limited to 28.19m shares. Many investors and brokers had left for the weekend holiday. Acma was the most actively traded issue gaining 4 cents to SDollars 2.69. Fraser &amp; Neave was steady at SDollars 11.40 as it proposed a five- for-25 rights issue which will accompany a bond with warrants issue of SDollars 100m to help finance an expansion. MANILA climbed for the third day, fuelled by speculation about oil drilling tests in the Malampaya well off south-western Palawan island. The composite index rose 10.23 to 1,341.47 for a three-day increase of 58.47 and 2.1 per cent higher on the week. AUSTRALIAN shares turned higher, taking heart from Mr Kerry Packer's decision to roll over his Westpac Banking January call options to April calls. Westpac added 30 cents to ADollars 2.91, having traded as high as ADollars 3.00. The All Ordinaries index benefited, closing up 3.9 at 1523.0, virtually unchanged on the week. Other banks moved higher with ANZ 2 cents up at ADollars 3.04 in turnover of 2.26m shares, and CBS rose 5 cents to ADollars 5.90. NAB slid 3 cents to ADollars 7.49. Pioneer, with its exposure to Westpac, rose 10 cents to ADollars 2.30. News Corp was strong throughout the session, closing 20 cents higher at ADollars 29.20. Fairfax ended steady at ADollars .63 after its forecast increased profits for 1992-93. NEW ZEALAND was generally firmer but trading was light in the absence of foreign investors. The NZSE-40 index gained 3.06 to 1498.43.</p>

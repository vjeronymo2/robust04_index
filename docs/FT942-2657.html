			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Procedo chief held as Balsam scandal spreads The scope of the alleged fraud surrounding Balsam, a German sports-floorings manufacturer, widened yesterday with the arrest of the chief executive of Procedo, the largest factoring company in Germany and the largest creditor to the Bielfeld-based Balsam. The arrest of Mr Dieter Klindworth follows that of the entire four-man board at Balsam last week. It took place after BfG Bank, the biggest creditor to Balsam and Procedo, filed suit with Wiesbaden-based state prosecutors alleging that Procedo was an active party to the fraud, rather than a victim. The latest arrest came on the day that creditor banks met in Wiesbaden to formulate their response to what is developing into one of Germany's largest post-war fraud scandals. Bankers are owed DM1.74bn (Pounds 696m) by Procedo and face a further DM300m to DM400m in losses arising from transactions undertaken by Balsam in the derivatives markets. These are believed to have a gross value of up to DM14bn, dwarfing Balsam turnover of DM460m last year. Bankers were told yesterday that the fraud had been in place for up to 10 years before it was discovered this month. According to the head of the Frankfurt branch of a UK bank, 'it was the perfect scam', at the heart of which were faked applications for finance from the Procedo factoring company which conducted two-thirds of its business with Balsam. Under a conventional factoring arrangement, the factoring company advances cash to its client against the security of unpaid invoices. It then takes a commission for the service and assumes responsibility for collecting the clients' receivables. Bankers were told yesterday that Balsam obtained finance from Procedo on the basis of grossly inflated or fictitious contracts with overseas customers. They heard, for example, that the true value of UK contracts factored by Procedo was just Pounds 250,000, compared to Pounds 76m in Procedo's books. Most of the contracts relate to the US, where Balsam had a business building sports arenas for schools and local authorities. Many of the contracts against which finance was raised allegedly did not exist but Procedo advanced the cash on the basis of 'comfort letters' purporting to be from the St Louis office of the Arthur Andersen accountancy firm. These letters were forged and Andersen has said it did not know about the letters - which date back to 1984 - until June this year. The representatives of the 50 banks owed money by Procedo are believed to have expressed anger yesterday that Allgemeine Kreditversicherung, the Mainz-based insurance company which owns 50 per cent of Procedo, is not willing to advance cash to rescue the factoring company. AKV is itself 50 per cent owned by Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company, and Munich Re, its reinsurance associate.</p>

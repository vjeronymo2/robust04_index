			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE shadow of BT3 and the first day of the new trading account had a calming effect on stock index futures, although the September FT-SE 100 contract managed to push through its recent resistance level, Christine Buckley writes. Dealers are also maintaining some caution ahead of Thursday's Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty. Additionally they were stymied by a starvation diet of economic data. The contract opened at 2,842 and dipped shortly afterwards to the day's low of 2,838. Then it began to find its feet and commenced a steady climb to a high for the session of 2,863, which was reached about 10am. Volume was modest at 6,359 contracts. The future was a healthy 8 1/2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which is estimated at 4 points. A trader was surprised at how little the market made of the September contract breaching its resistance level which has settled at 2,850 in recent sessions, but put it down to hesitation in the absence of economic statistics. Volume was poor in traded options, with the total number of lots, at 19,211, registering a fall of more than 7,000 from Friday's figure. Not surprisingly, BT proved to be the most active of the stock options, on 2,959 lots transacted. The Euro FT-SE 100 option performed well at 3,090 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option just ahead at 3,246 lots.</p>

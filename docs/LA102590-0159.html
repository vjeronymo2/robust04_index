			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CONSERVATIONISTS ENDORSE UMBERG  </P> <P> The California League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club endorsed  Assembly candidate Tom Umberg on Wednesday, accusing his opponent, incumbent  Curt Pringle, of having one of the Legislature's worst voting records on  environmental issues.  </P> <P> "Curt Pringle is on the bottom rung of legislators," said Doug Linney,  political director for the 30,000-member, San-Francisco-based league.  </P> <P> "Anybody can look at Curt Pringle's voting record and tell he is not for the  environment."  </P> <P> At a press conference, Linney distributed a 1989 list of environmental-related  legislation that Pringle opposed. Linney said Pringle voted "correctly" 29% of  the time on legislation backed by environmentalists, contrasted with the  Assembly's average score of 70%. According to the list, Pringle opposed  legislation that called for cities to implement plastic recycling plans and  that required tougher penalties against toxic polluters.  </P> <P> Pringle defended his voting record in an interview Wednesday and shrugged off  the list of recommended legislation backed by the league and the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to side with the ultra-liberal groups," Pringle said. "My votes  reflect environmental sensibility."  </P> <P> Linney and Dan Hayes, a member of the Sierra Club's political committee, said  the two groups also backed Umberg for his support of Proposition 128, the broad  environmental initiative known as Big Green. Pringle opposes the proposal. LILY  ENG  </P></p>

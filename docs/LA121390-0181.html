			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 MEN KIDNAPED, 1 KILLED ON REMOTE MALIBU ROAD  </P> <P> Two men drinking in a Santa Ana bar were kidnaped, robbed and taken to a remote  Malibu canyon road, where one was fatally shot execution-style and the other  escaped unharmed by bolting into the brush, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police on Wednesday identified the shooting victim as Augustine Mejia Lucero,  25, of Santa Ana. He died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head,  apparently by a handgun fired at close range, Santa Ana Police spokeswoman  Maureen Haacker said.  </P> <P> The motive for the slaying was "apparently robbery, since the victims were  robbed of their belongings while they were in the car," Haacker said.  </P> <P> Police declined to disclose other details, including the name of the surviving  kidnap victim and the name of the bar, because they said it could jeopardize  the investigation. Police have no suspects, Haacker said.  </P> <P> The abduction occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday, when Lucero and a companion  were taken from a bar in the area of 5th Street and Harbor Boulevard and forced  into a red car by two armed men, Haacker said.  </P> <P> After driving the victims around for more than three hours, the kidnapers took  them to Decker Road about a quarter-mile north of Pacific Coast Highway, and  made them get out of the car and kneel by the side of the road, Pitkin said.  </P> <P> After Lucero was shot, his companion became terrified and bolted into the  brush, said Sgt. Tom Pitkin, watch commander for the Malibu station of the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is assisting in the investigation.  </P> <P> "It was an execution," Pitkin said. ". . . When the survivor saw them execute  his friend, he just bailed and headed down the hill."  </P> <P> The survivor, who apparently eluded his captors for about four hours in the  dense brush, was described as a Salvadoran national between the ages of 25 and  30. Decker Road, in the area where the man made his escape, is one of the  steepest and most remote roads in the Malibu area, Pitkin said.  </P> <P> The survivor waited until daylight Monday and then flagged down a passing  motorist, Pitkin said.  </P> <P> Since the shooting, county sheriff's deputies and Santa Ana police have  uncovered few clues they say they can discuss publicly, and many questions they  haven't been able to answer.  </P> <P> "We are perplexed as to why the suspects would drive all that way," Haacker  said. "There are a number of things we are trying to find out."  </P> <P> Another police official, who asked not to be named, also questioned why the  kidnapers drove their victims around for several hours.  </P> <P> "This begs the question: If they were just going to rob them, why drive all  that way?" asked one officer, who asked not to be identified. "And why kill  them over a robbery? I would suspect they were looking for more than just what  these (victims) had on them."  </P> <P> Police have not said what type of gun was used. They said the only clue left at  the scene was a pair of surgical gloves, apparently used to prevent  fingerprints from being left.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for  Environmental Security, by Lada Lyashenko; date, place not  given: "Nature Does Not Forgive Carelessness"]    [Text] [Lyashenko] Aleksey Vladimirovich, you have  frequently said that it is impossible for any country to have a  future if it does not protect the environment. Will the new  decree [On Russian Government Action Plan for Environmental  Protection for 1994-1995] help our environment?    [Yablokov] Undoubtedly. This decree is the first step in  carrying out the not unknown Edict of the President dated 4  February of this year, which instructed the government to  elaborate a specific plan of action for the protection of the  environment for 1994-1995 and present a concept for its  consistent development by 1 October. The plan of action has  been elaborated by the Ministry for the Protection of the  Environment together with the Ministry of the Economy, which is  very important. For the first time, we are not setting the  environment against the economy, but bringing them together.  This step signifies the beginning of a new state policy in the  sphere of the protection of the environment. After all, policy  is when people who adopt decisions look far into the future.  The shortcoming of today's politicians is that they most often  adopt decisions for today. And after all, the environment is a  matter of the future.    [Lyashenko] What basic guidlines for the protection of the  environment have been elaborated in the government's plan of  action?    [Yablokov] Primarily international cooperation. We need to  determine how Russia fits into global ecological problems, such  as the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, and the protection of  the oceans. Equally important are regional problems -- Lake  Baykal, the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, and the Volga. After  all, this is not just a matter of individual regions. The  health of the population, which is deteriorating disastrously,  is a special sphere. Despite the fact that the Ministry for the  Protection of the Environment assures us that the situation is  improving, there are grounds for concern. In 1993 alone, the  average lifespan fell by three years. A boy born this year has  no chance of even reaching pension age, since average life  expectancy for men by that time will be 59. And after all, our  health depends on the environment by approximately 30 percent.    The new decree is also important because all the federal  programs and legislative acts named in it have been coordinated  with the relevant State Duma committees.    [Lyashenko] Will it not turn out that we will once again put  off ecological problems till later and our good intentions will  be left hanging in mid-air?    [Yablokov] Unless we organize constant pressure on the  government, and in the mass media too, then nothing will be  done. Remember how it all began: The explosion of the  ecological movement occurred in 1987-1989, then people forgot  about it, and the economic confusion began. Today we have gone  back to the original positions, because the burden of the  environmental load is so heavy that the country may stumble and  there may simply be no economic development. A very great deal  in the implementation of the outlined program depends on the  regions. After all, the government cannot operate by giving  orders any more, like it used to in the past. And indeed this  would not work economically: A large part of the money is in  the localities.    [Lyashenko] Are you satisfied with the normative base of the  decree?    [Yablokov] On the whole, yes. There are just a few sections  of wording that do not suit me. For example, the law on waste  from production and consumption. This concept is too broad. I  think that we need a law on particularly dangerous waste. That  kind of wording is more precise.</p>

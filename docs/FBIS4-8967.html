			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CS.I."-signed interview with Agricultural Minister Janos </F> Szabo, chairman of the United Smallholders Party; place and date  not given: "Our Program Is Based on Four Years of Achievements"]    [Text] In our series, we publish interviews with heads of  parties who presented national lists. It is clearly an  electoral advantage that the United Smallholders' Party [EKGP]  accepted a coalition role in the past four years -- as pointed  out by Janos Szabo, agricultural minister and EKGP chairman. We  asked Janos Szabo about coalition desires, the split among the  smallholders, and agricultural matters.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As a village party, what does the EKGP  suggest to solve the current crisis in the agricultural sector?    [Szabo] Everyone is trying to effect a brainwash! If the  crisis is a radical and revolutionary change, then this is what  is really taking place: the biggest transition in land ownership  in our 1,100 year history! Despite all our problems and the  international recession, a decreasing domestic market, the loss  of our eastern markets, drought, and a chronic shortage of  capital, 1994 will be the year of growth in agricultural  reserves. The economy has priority in the EKGP program. This  program is based on four years of hard work and outstanding  achievements. The Group of 36 in the parliament played a major  role in all this, because this faction fulfilled the majority of  the party's program.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If you were to become part of the new  government, what would be your first measure to benefit  villagers?    [Szabo] We would guarantee greater state support for the  agricultural sector; we would export quality products to the  West; we would urge a reasonable tax reduction; and we would let  the owners get a bit richer. It is an open wound in the  agricultural sector that, of 1.1 million part-owners of  business, only 300 are completely involved in the business; this  situation requires an urgent solution.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does the fact that the Group of 36 and later  the EKGP participated in the coalition represent an advantage or  a disadvantage?    [Szabo] During transitional periods, the time required for  the maturation of a politician is rather short. But one wears  out quickly, both morally and politically, and the coalition  wears out quickly also. The change involves traumatic elements.  It is possible that, according to some voters, playing a role  in the coalition represents a disadvantage.... But one should  not be shortsighted! In spite of all the transitional  difficulties, the last four years have made real history! We  instituted private property and the framework of a  constitutional state; despite all the difficulties, there is  stability in Hungary and, therefore, it makes no difference what  the professional pessimists say. Those who are affected by  compensation, land ownership, and the assignment of lands --  some 4-5 million voters -- should realize that the government  has compensated them. We started six months ago, and we  succeeded in presenting 14 territorial lists and 56 candidates.  It is clearly an advantage for the Group of 36 and the EKGP to  be part of the coalition.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With which parties would you happily form a  coalition and under what conditions? Would you demand a certain  ministry?    [Szabo] We would gladly form a coalition with the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP] if we make it into the parliament, but we do not  exclude any other party, with the exception of the Workers Party  and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. A good agreement is  the basis of correct coalition relations contacts! This  agreement should include proportional party decisionmaking in  accordance with said party's power as represented in parliament.  Larger parties should not have greater decisionmaking rights in  the parliament; smaller parties should not have smaller rights.  We do not have a list of ministerial demands, but our party  clearly prefers the Agricultural Ministry.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The smallholders are divided: there are  four parties on the political palette. You repeatedly declared  that Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders'  Party [FKGP], is the obstacle hindering union.    [Szabo] The only difference between the programs of the  various smallholders parties -- the FKGP, the Historical  Smallholders' Party, the Compromise Smallholders' Party, and the  EKGP -- is the way they go about doing things, but there is no  difference regarding the essence of their programs. In the  villages, simple people and smallholders-oriented voters are not  divided, and there is a basic demand for a single large party to  represent the small landowners in politics. Nor is there any  particular importance attached to which party was in the  coalition and which party was not. We should be united, and the  EKGP is doing everything in its power to achieve this unity.  Jozsef Torgyan is an obstacle! He should step aside and leave  the road, so that unity can emerge.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 3 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata and his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu agreed Sunday  that China has a vital role in resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hata and Han  commended the U.N. Security Council for leading China to back  its statement urging North Korea to accept unimpeded inspections  of its nuclear facilities, the officials said.    The foreign ministers gave "positive appraisal" to the  statement adopted unanimously on Thursday by the 15 member  states of the U.N. Security Council, they said. The statement  of Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France was  adopted after the United States dropped its bid to have the  Security Council adopt a binding resolution.    It urged North Korea to allow International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspectors to complete an uncontrolled check of  its nuclear facilities, while expressing concern that an IAEA  team was barred from inspecting a radiochemical laboratory  earlier this month.    After the Security Council members agreed to comply with  Chinese demands to eliminate any language about sanctions,  China, North Korea's traditional ally, agreed to endorse the  mildly-worded, nonbinding statement.    The two foreign ministers confirmed their intention to  monitor how the North will respond to the Security Council's  demand to have it accept unhampered inspections within a month,  the officials said.    Han will hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on  Monday before flying back to Seoul from a three-country trip to  help solve the nuclear proliferation issue, they said. Before  flying to Tokyo, Han sought cooperation from both the U.S. and  China.</p>

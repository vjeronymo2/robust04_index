			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "est": "UN Human Rights Commissioner Visits </F> Vienna"]    [Text] Vienna -- Austria agrees with new UN High  Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso, who demands that  the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission hold a special  meeting on Rwanda soon. The high commissioner, who was appointed  at the beginning of April and had protested against the  "genocide" there when he visited Rwanda last week, came to  Vienna on Monday [16 May] on his first official visit abroad.    Foreign Minister Alois Mock promised the 62 year old  diplomat  from Ecuador Austria's full support, since the protection of  human rights is "an important part of our foreign policy" and  the "high commissioner is, casually speaking, a product of last  year's UN Human Rights Conference in Vienna."    Asked by DER STANDARD how he plans to react to human rights  violations, Ayala Lasso said he wants to "take a new path of  seeking dialogue" with the governments concerned. If this does  not help, there is still the traditional way of "pointing out  and condemning violations and publicizing them."</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Cognac sales decline 12.3% THE BRITISH drank less cognac but more wine last year. Cognac sales fell 12.3 per cent to 11.6m bottles, according to the Cognac Information Centre, but Britain remained the leading European market, ahead of Germany and France. Britain's wine consumption - up from 3.7 litres to nearly 13 litres a head since 1970 - is growing faster than in any other European country. About 577m litres of wine, worth more than Pounds 4bn, was consumed last year, says a report from Mintel, the market researcher.</p>

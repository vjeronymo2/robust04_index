			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bayer sees 20% reduction in profits to DM2.2bn Bayer, the leading German chemicals group, expects profits to fall by about 20 per cent this year to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3m) and remain unchanged in 1994, according to Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman. However, the company appears likely to hold its dividend, unlike its main domestic competitors, Hoechst and BASF, Mr Schneider hinted yesterday. Cost-cutting measures and strong growth in north America and Asia Pacific were slowing the profits decline as the year had advanced, Mr Schneider said in a review of the first nine months of the current year. The trend had continued into October, he added. Restructuring and workforce cuts had generated savings of about DM750m so far this year. European sales had slumped 11 per cent, but similar proportional increases in Asia Pacific and the US had limited the decline in turnover to just 2.3 per cent. Pre-tax earnings in the review period were 19 per cent lower at DM1.8bn. Mr Schneider attributed Bayer's relatively good figures - Hoechst and BASF recently reported nine-month falls of 40 and 44 per cent respectively, and hinted at dividend cuts - to the group's successful healthcare business. These operations lifted sales 5 per cent in the review period to DM7bn in spite of a DM100m fall in domestic turnover attributed to health service reforms. Sales of Ciprobay and Adalat, the top-selling drugs, are expected to total about DM4bn this year. Signalling further expansion in healthcare, Mr Schneider said the group was close to a deal which would give it an entry into the US market for generic pharmaceuticals - drugs on which patents have expired, and which are increasingly favoured because of their lower cost. Bayer had looked at five or six US companies, including Copley, the subject of an offer from Hoechst.</p>

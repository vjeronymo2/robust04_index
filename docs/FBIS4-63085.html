			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 20 May TASS -- The leaders of Tajikistan's  security agencies have categorically rejected allegations about  mass unrest and political ultimatums presented to the Tajik  leadership by residents of the Gissar border region. Colonel  Nikolay Madzhar, the chief of the Tajik Interior Ministry's  public order directorate, told ITAR-TASS that the social and  politic situation in the region remained stable and under full  control.    The colonel admitted that a few small scale meetings had  been  actually held in the district administrative centre of Gissar,  at which demands were voiced to put an end to criminal outrage  in the district and ensure personal security of its inhabitants.    The meetings were provoked by a tragic incident which had  occurred in Gissar on 5 May, in which eight people were killed  in a bloody clash between two armed and uncontrolled groups.  But the incident was not political in character.    According to the colonel, Tajikistan's Interior Minister  Yakub Salimov arrived on the scene on the same day and the  security forces detained more than ten instigators of the clash.  The investigation is controlled by the minister and the  Republic's chief prosecutor in person.    Colonel Madzhar said Tajikistan's leader Emomali Rakhmonov  met representatives of the relatives of the people who were  killed in a clash and assured them that the guilty militants  would be punished exemplarily.    The colonel said certain political forces in the Republic  and  the Gissar region have been trying to use the Gissar incident to  reach their own selfish ends.    Tajikistan's Security Minister Major-General Saydamir  Zukhurov said the situation in the Gissar district was no source  of alarm, because "political confrontation in that district is a  fruit of sick imagination of the forces which are against peace  and stability in the Republic and are not averse to using any  methods to attain their own objectives."</p>

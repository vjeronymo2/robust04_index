			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA unheadlined report under the "Visit" </F> rubric]    [Text] Responding to a question from a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent, Russian Federation Culture Minister Mikhail  Shvydkoy stated that "according to Culture Ministry  information," the Russian president had set off for talks with  Chancellor Kohl bringing along none of the books and other  valuable objects in the so-called restitution category, or in  other words, those taken to the USSR from the territory of  Germany during the war and during the early post-war years.  Hence the rumors about Boris Yeltsin's making a gift to the  German side of the world-famous rarity -- the Gutenberg Bible --  are just rumors. But, alternative sources report, books from  the Gotha Library may still be delivered to Germany toward the  visit's end.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 16 (CTK) -- The visit by a mission  of representatives of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment  Corporation (OPIC) will be an important catalyst for American  investment here, Premier Jozef Moravcik said on Slovak Radio  today. Slovakia needs the help of foreign investors because it  lacks sufficient resources of its own to revive the economy,  Moravcik said after meeting with the mission, headed by OPIC  Vice President Christopher Finn and made up of 25 business  leaders.    U.S. investment in Slovakia remains low, said Moravcik,  noting that the government would like individual countries to  have adequate shares. He added that Slovakia was mainly  interested in investment in the manufacturing sector. U.S.  investors have expressed interest mainly in the energy industry,  production of goods important for environmental protection, and  tourism, Moravcik noted.    Moravcik said Slovakia offered good conditions for  investment, though some changes to the legal system are needed,  as is the creation of a stable political situation. OPIC is an  independent U.S. Government agency focused on supporting  economic growth in countries with developing market economies by  stimulating private U.S. investment activities.</p>

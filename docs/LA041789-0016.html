			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAIL ALTERNATIVES  </P> <P> Los Angeles County chief probation officer Barry Nidorf's excellent column  ("Practical Alternatives to Jail's Fast Shuffle," Op-Ed Page, March 20) points  up a most effective (yet underused) approach for combatting the crime and  substance abuse problems that have made our city streets a battlefield. Jail  and prison time alone, in part because these institutions are overcrowded, are  only useful for incapacitating most offenders for brief periods of time. As  Nidorf points out "house arrest," "work sentencing," and "work furlough"  programs should be better funded to develop methodologies for nonviolent  offenders who can be rehabilitated. By placing more tractable convicted  criminal in close surveillance, community programs will leave more room in our  jails and prisons for those dangerous offenders who need to be incapacitated.  </P> <P> I would add a further dimension to Nidorf's important recommendations. Vigorous  law enforcement and imprisonment are only partial and temporary solutions to  the problem. Recent research reveals that around 70% of criminals arrested  commit drug-related crimes. For many of these offenders, some form of mandatory  drug addiction rehabilitation should be made part of their "community  sentence." In particular, there are a number of excellent therapeutic community  programs for treating substance abusers now available in Los Angeles County,  including Delancey Street, Phoenix House, and several at hospitals.  </P> <P> These programs, if properly funded through our outstanding Los Angeles County  Probation Department, could become part of a comprehensive community approach  that could help solve our overall homicide, gang, and addiction crime problems.  </P> <P> LEWIS YABLONSKY, Ph.D  </P> <P> Professor of Criminology  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge  </P></p>

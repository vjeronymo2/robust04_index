Latvia will continue its path to the full integration into  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization because it is the only  organization capable of extending security guarantees in the  conditions of foreign jeopardy, Berzins said.    NATO extension rests with NATO itself, Berzins noted.    Berzins is deputy head of the majority Latvia's Way faction  and member of the parliament's Foreign Affairs' Committee.</p>

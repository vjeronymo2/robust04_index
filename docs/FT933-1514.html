			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: JVC, Hitachi underline audio-visual downturn THE TROUBLES afflicting Japanese makers of audio-visual products were underlined yesterday by a profits downgrade from JVC and an announcement from Hitachi that it was closing its German video-recorder (VCR) factory. JVC, which developed the international video tape standard, said the prolonged recession in the market and the yen's appreciation had forced a revision of its profits forecast for the year ending March 1994. It expects a pre-tax loss of Y25bn (Dollars 235.2m) for this year, rather than breaking even as it had expected in May. Sales are forecast at Y505bn, or 6 per cent below the Y540bn predicted earlier. On a consolidated basis, pre-tax losses are forecast at Y31bn rather than Y800m, on sales of Y700bn, down from its previous forecast of Y780bn. JVC said it hoped to return to profit even if sales remained at the Y500bn level. The company is reducing its staff by 2,000 by 1995, through natural wastage and by not renewing contracts with part-time workers, moving its headquarters from Tokyo to Yokohama, and strengthening its sales force. About 400 employees at headquarters and factories are being transferred to sales. Meanwhile, Hitachi's consumer electronics operations in Germany became the latest victim of Europe's sluggish audio-visual market, as the company announced it was closing its VCR manufacturing facility there. The company said the strength of the D-Mark and weak European demand for audio-visual products had forced it to close the plant. Production has declined to 13,000 units a month this year from a monthly peak of 45,000 units in 1989. Last year Hitachi made a Y42.6bn loss in its consumer products division, which followed a Y14.6bn loss the previous year. It also closed its VCR plant in the US, where it had been manufacturing 100,000 units annually, and moved production for the US market to Malaysia. Hitachi plans to meet European demand for VCRs from its plants in the UK and, if necessary, Malaysia. But 'the pie is shrinking', the company said, adding that the situation in the market remained extremely difficult.</p>

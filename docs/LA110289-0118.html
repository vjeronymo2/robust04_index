			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERALD EXAMINER WILL HALT PUBLISHING TODAY;  </P> <P> NEWSPAPERS: 118 YEARS OF PUBLICATION IN LOS ANGELES ENDS WITH DEMISE OF HEARST  DAILY. HEAVY FINANCIAL LOSSES FORCED THE DECISION.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, strapped with declining circulation and  shrinking revenues, announced Wednesday that it will cease publication as of  today, closing out a 118-year history that provided Los Angeles with some of  its richest journalistic lore.  </P> <P> Robert J. Danzig, Hearst vice president and general manager of the company's  newspapers, stood on a desk Wednesday in the Herald's newsroom and broke the  news in a brief statement to the assembled staff.  </P> <P> "It is with great regret that we have made this decision," Danzig said. "It has  been a losing business but a winning newspaper."  </P> <P> He said afterward that the decision to close the paper had been made at noon.  It came after a much-publicized yearlong search for a buyer by the New  York-based Hearst Corp. The Herald was expected to lose $18.7 million this  year, but is now losing as much as $2 million a month, according to sources  familiar with the paper's books.  </P> <P> The Herald's circulation as of Sept. 30 was 232,437, down from 721,026 after  the merger of the morning Examiner and the afternoon Herald-Express created the  Herald Examiner in 1962.  </P> <P> The closing leaves Los Angeles only one downtown-based general interest daily  newspaper.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times executives said they might pick up at most 50,000 Herald  readers, and other local papers stand to gain some circulation. Nearly 90,000  of the Herald's readers already buy another newspaper.  </P> <P> Staff members were stunned by Danzig's announcement, even though for months  many of them, alert to the dire possibilities, had been searching for work  elsewhere. Many cried and embraced. Others simply walked around talking to each  other, trying to take in the enormity of what they had just heard.  </P> <P> Their reaction spoke to the esprit de corps that permeated the news staff in  the end.  </P> <P> "Obviously, everybody saw it coming," said Herald Deputy City Editor Lennie  LaGuire. "Most of us had come to terms with the fact that it was going to close  sometime soon. But I was kind of hoping it would last past the first of the  year, that we could keep going with some of the stories we were working on."  </P> <P> She added, tearfully: "I just can't believe it feels like this, to close like  an insurance office. It really feels like a death in the family."  </P> <P> "It's like everybody got punched in the stomach," said reporter Ellis Conklin.  "Everybody's having a hard time breathing."  </P> <P> Reporter Alina Tugend was intently taking notes during a speech by former  President Jimmy Carter at the Biltmore when a consultant coordinating public  relations for the event pulled her aside. He had to tell her the Herald's plug  had been pulled.  </P> <P> "Alina just said, 'OK, thanks,' and left abruptly, very upset," said the  consultant, David H. Novak.  </P> <P> About 2 p.m., an hour after the announcement, an assistant sports editor  telephoned hockey writer Rick Sadowski at a hotel in Boston, where he was on  assignment to cover a game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Boston Bruins.  </P> <P> Sadowski, a 10-year Herald veteran, had planned to fly to Hartford on Saturday  and Buffalo on Sunday with the Kings. "But I just called the airport and made  arrangements to come home," he said. "There's no reason to cover those games  now."  </P> <P> Like many employees, Sadowski worried about the financial fallout.  </P> <P> "We just bought a house in September," he said.  </P> <P> Many Herald employees had clung to the belief that a financial angel would come  to the rescue. Tycoons like Marvin Davis, Kirk Kerkorian and Malcolm Forbes  were rumored as possible buyers -- "everybody but Donald Trump," one  advertising man said. Others speculated that Japanese investors would take  over.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Did Our Job'  </P> <P> Jeryl Parade, an assistant manager in classified advertising, was one of  several Herald workers upset with Hearst corporate management. Market studies,  Parade said, showed that the Herald provided a special advertising niche,  especially in automotive and job recruitment ads. "Tomorrow we'll have our Auto  '90 Preview -- our biggest preview of cars ever. And our classifieds have  grown," Parade said. "We did our job here."  </P> <P> As required by a new federal law governing plant shutdowns, employees will be  paid and will receive benefits for the next 60 days. An outplacement agency has  been retained to help employees find new jobs.  </P> <P> The paper is the descendant of Hearst's Examiner, founded 86 years ago, the  morning Herald, started 112 years ago, and the Los Angeles Express, which began  publishing 118 years ago.  </P> <P> In its heyday, the Examiner scored scoops on everything from the "Black Dahlia"  murder case to the explosion of the first H-bomb. The afternoon Herald Express  under Hearst was the largest afternoon paper west of Chicago. The Herald  Express also had the first woman city editor in Agness (Aggie) Underwood in  1937.  </P> <P> Herbert H. Krauch started at the Herald as an office boy in 1912. The first  week he was there, City Editor Jack Campbell got into an argument over a story  with reporter Peter Dunn.  </P> <P> "Jack Campbell floored Peter Dunn with one punch," Krauch, now 93, recalled  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Krauch had been studying civil engineering, but "after I saw the fistfight, I  thought newspaper work was so exciting, I decided to become a newspaper man."  </P> <P> He rose through the ranks, serving as editor of the paper from 1952 to 1962. He  was in charge of combining the Herald-Express and the Examiner.  </P> <P> "I had to let go about 265 editorial people from the Examiner, a lot of them  friends of mine," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, he noticed a big safe in the Examiner office. He asked what  was in it and was told, "Nothing now, but we used to keep $25,000 in the safe,  because Mr. Hearst would call at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning asking for 100  or 200 bucks."  </P> <P> Expressions of regret about the closing came from politicians and community  leaders, and they shared a common theme: Any reduction in newspaper competition  is a loss for readers.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles will be poorer for it," said City Council President John Ferraro.  "The Herald Examiner has been a strong voice in our city and its reporting of  events will certainly be missed."  </P> <P> "It's one more blow against freedom of the press," said County Supervisor  Kenneth Hahn. "We need as many newspapers as possible to tell the public about  government at the local level."  </P> <P> "The closing of the Herald Examiner limits the choices for Los Angeles  readers," said Mayor Tom Bradley in a statement issued by his press secretary.  </P> <P> Referring to The Times and the San Fernando Valley-based Daily News, he added,  "I sincerely hope the two remaining daily newspapers focus attention on  covering the entire city, bringing attention to unheard stories that impact  many of the 3.4 million people who make the City of Los Angeles home."  </P> <P> "I think the Herald did a better job in dealing with local issues and minority  communities," said Linda Wong, executive director of California Tomorrow, an  immigrants' advocacy group.  </P> <P> The Herald has received acclaim in the past year for its investigations into  the Bradley Administration.  </P> <P> "Anyone who works in a competitive city knows that competition keeps staff on  their toes and much more concerned (about) missing stories," said Ben H.  Bagdikian, a professor at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.  "Competition . . . has always meant an improvement in the quality of  reporting."  </P> <P> Times Publisher David Laventhol stated: "The absence of the Herald is going to  place an even greater responsibility on The Times to be fair, accurate and  complete in its reporting and to provide a forum for multiple voices on  important issues."  </P> <P> Added Times Editor Shelby Coffey III: "It's a sad day for journalism and a sad  day for Southern California. The Herald Examiner has been a lively competitor  and it will be a melancholy absence."  </P> <P> The Times is considering picking up some of the Herald's syndicated features  and is reviewing applications from many Herald employees. The Times also will  acquire more than 10,000 of the Herald's newspaper stands and racks, and its  subscription list.  </P> <P> Among prospective buyers who looked at the paper, it was learned, were the  Toronto Sun Publishing Co. of Canada, movie and oil tycoon Marvin Davis,  British tabloid publisher Robert Maxwell, and a group that included City News  Service owner Tom Quinn.  </P> <P> Changes in 1962  </P> <P> In the end, Hearst was not demanding a heavy price, only someone with the money  and commitment to make a serious attempt at turning the publication around.  </P> <P> The paper's problems dated to 1962, when Hearst chose to concentrate on  afternoon circulation, merging the morning Examiner with the less successful  Herald-Express. The announcement closely followed the closure by Times Mirror  Co. of its afternoon paper, The Mirror.  </P> <P> That left The Times with no morning competition, and the Herald was forced to  pursue a blue-collar audience that tended to go to work and return home earlier  in the day.  </P> <P> Advertisers followed the money. By 1967, The Times enjoyed a 2-1 advantage in  advertising, despite only a 120,000 lead in circulation. The Herald's  readership started to fall.  </P> <P> That year the American Newspaper Guild struck the Herald over wages and was  eventually joined by 11 other unions. By the time the strike ended 10 years  later, the Herald's circulation was just 330,000.  </P> <P> Since then, Hearst has thrashed around for a comeback strategy, trying to  position the paper for more sophisticated readers, pondering a conversion to a  tabloid. It also converted back to a morning publication.  </P> <P> As circulation declined, rumors of the paper's demise or sale swirled around  the city from time to time. But the Herald was a powerful symbol to the Hearst  family, which is still active in the company. The building at 11th and  Broadway, with its hand-painted tiled entrance floor and gold and black onyx  lobby, once included press lord William Randolph Hearst's private apartment.  </P> <P> Brokers for Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services said chances are  good that the ornate Herald building will be sold to someone who will keep the  existing structure. "A major printer could use that, maybe a group that prints  law books," said broker Ray Lepone.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Darrell Dawsey, Maura Dolan, Scott Harris, Shawn Hubler,  John Kendall, Jesus Sanchez and Hector Tobar contributed to this story.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, PICTURES: A30, D1  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAD GUNMEN AND OUTLAWING ASSAULT RIFLES  </P> <P> I quote Sullum: "Yet the Jacksonville and Stockton massacres cast serious  doubts on the notion that gun-control laws can prevent rampages by armed  lunatics."  </P> <P> If I understand Mr. Sullum, he believes that, since we can't stop all maniacs  from buying all types of semiautomatic weapons, regulatory laws are useless.  His logic escapes me. If gun control laws can prevent just some of the  rampages, I shall be immensely gratified.  </P> <P> NRA, take note: Guns weren't out-lawed, so Patrick Purdy and James Pough got  guns -- assault rifles.  </P> <P> RAY B.

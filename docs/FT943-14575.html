			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Tassotti's eight-game ban 'excessive', says Spaniard Luis Enrique, the Spanish forward whose nose was smashed by Italy's Mauro Tassotti during the World Cup quarter-final last weekend, yesterday criticised the eight-match ban Tassotti subsequently received. Enrique called the punishment 'excessive' and said he would have been satisfied with an apology from Tassotti. Fifa, soccer's governing body, imposed only a four-game suspension on Brazilian defender Leonardo for elbowing American Tab Ramos in the face during a second-round match, even though Ramos suffered a fractured skull. Tassotti's suspension, one of the heaviest in World Cup history, was also criticised by Italian newspapers. The Corriere della Sera called it 'a mad decision by the Fifa mafia' while La Voce chipped in: 'This ugly mess over Tassotti has shaken the national team, in a World Cup ruined by the mad omnipotence of (Fifa general-secretary Sepp) Blatter.' Fifa used video evidence for the first time to decide Tassotti's punishment. Earlier, Blatter had refused to study such evidence to examine the sending-off of Italian striker Gianfranco Zola. Spanish newspapers viewed the ban on Tassotti as compensation for Spain's elimination from the finals. The Italian soccer federation has said it will appeal against the ban, which could end the 34-year-old Tassotti's international career.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIACOM SCALES DOWN 'COSBY' RERUN PRICES  </P> <P> When reruns of "The Cosby Show" went into syndication a year ago, they were  expected to hit TV like a megaton bomb, giving the 187 stations that bought  them the kind of immense lift that NBC got from the original broadcasts of the  series.  </P> <P> Expectations for the reruns were so high that stations bid feverishly for the  show, paying unprecedented prices that totaled more than $600 million in  overall sales. In Los Angeles, KCOP-TV Channel 13 shelled out about $300,000  per half-hour episode for rights to the series for the initial 3 1/2-year rerun  cycle.  </P> <P> But the rerun miracle of "The Cosby Show" -- the big blowout -- never  materialized.  </P> <P> Despite doing very well -- the Bill Cosby comedy is at the top of off-network  programming -- the series is drastically dropping its price with sales now  under way for the second cycle of reruns, which will begin in 1992 or 1993,  depending on how many episodes are available.  </P> <P> "Everybody that bought 'Cosby' paid too much," said KCOP station manager Rick  Feldman, who, like other buyers, ignored Wednesday's deadline on new sales set  by the syndicator, Viacom. He said he's in no hurry to renew.  </P> <P> Several station sources said Viacom has dropped the price for "The Cosby Show"  by one-half or more, depending on how the series fared in individual markets.  </P> <P> At KCOP, where "Cosby" runs at 7 nightly, Feldman said bluntly: "Everybody's  going to pay less. Those prices people paid, you're not going to see again. The  prices that many stations paid for 'Cosby' were two or three times more than  they ever paid for any program. So 'Cosby' has to come back down to reality."  </P> <P> Added Feldman: "TV has changed. It's just tough to get huge ratings when you  have VCRs and so many new channels to compete with. You buy shows years ahead,  and by the time they air, the business is different. It's not 'Cosby's' fault.  It's tremendous. But the TV landscape is altered."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Viacom said the show "has performed extremely well," but  acknowledged that the other point is whether "it is performing at a level of  what the price was."  </P> <P> Viacom says the series "has doubled the number of stations that were ranked No.  1 in their time period." But some stations are threatening not to renew "The  Cosby Show" at all. That would have seemed inconceivable a year ago, and still  is surprising -- the series remains a huge hit on NBC.  </P> <P> A new development has also complicated matters: Viacom has paired "The Cosby  Show" with its spinoff, "A Different World," as a rerun package, which has  turned off some buyers. And realizing it's dealing with stations that think  they got burned the first time around, Viacom is even offering, at no added  cost, five extra episodes of "Cosby" each week to stations that take the  two-show package.  </P> <P> Under Viacom's two-show proposal, stations could take one or both of the  series, turn down the entire deal or make counter-offers.  </P> <P> Did "The Cosby Show" live up to KCOP's expections in its first rerun season?  "No," said Feldman. "It did about a point less in the ratings than what we  thought it would do, but the demographics were good. Network affiliates that  bought it as a lead-in to the news got hurt the most. It turned out not to be a  good lead-in. But it is tops off-network. And for independent stations like us,  it did really well."  </P> <P> What was expected, however -- especially for the huge prices charged -- was a  rerun blastoff that would be a franchise-maker, turning around the entire  fortunes of stations, the way "MASH" repeats did.  </P> <P> " 'MASH' didn't cost much to buy in its first rerun cycle," said Feldman, "but  it took off in renewals. The show did incredible demographics almost anywhere  you ran it in the schedule over a long period of time. It's definitely No. 1 in  the syndication hall of fame."  </P></p>

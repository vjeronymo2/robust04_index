			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Socialists say Delors has duty to run The French Socialist party yesterday told Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing head of the European Commission, that he had a 'duty' to run for the presidency in its colours. Picking up Mr Delors's statement last week that if he decided to become a candidate it would be out of duty, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the party's first secretary, said: 'In the name of the very great majority of Socialists, I say to you, Jacques, that it is your duty.' This appeal brought prolonged applause from the 4,000 Socialist delegates and militants at the party's national congress which concluded yesterday. The relative strength of the Delors-for-president camp within the party probably approximates to the 87.5 per cent of delegates who earlier yesterday voted for Mr Emmanuelli as first secretary. Since Mr Emmanuelli faced no rival for the post to which he was nominated last July in succession to Mr Michel Rocard, the 12.5 per cent vote against him came largely from those who regard Mr Delors as too much a man of the centre. The possibility of a Delors presidential candidacy, partially reviving Socialist hopes shattered in recent legislative elections, gave the congress a rare degree of harmony. Adding to the aura of reconciliation, President Francois Mitterrand came to the former mining town of Lievin on Saturday to commemorate a colliery disaster of 20 years ago, to make his peace with a party from which he has seemed increasingly distant in recent years, and to stiffen its resolve to keep the Elysee palace in Socialist hands. Mr Emmanuelli reminded delegates that Mr Delors 'has been one of us for more than 20 years and many of us were members of the same government' when Mr Delors was finance minister in 1981-84. The reality is that the Socialist party, winning only 14.5 per cent of the vote in last June's European parliament elections under Mr Rocard's leadership, is virtually at the beck and call of Mr Delors, whose opinion poll rating is far higher. But Mr Emmanuelli promised delegates that the party would go through the form of approving its presidential candidate and platform, at a further convention probably in January. Mr Emmanuelli made no apology for 'swinging the party to the left'. He called for France's 39-hour working week to be reduced progressively to 35 hours without any comparable reduction in basic pay, not as a miracle cure for unemployment but for a fairer division of effort and wealth. He also said it was time for Socialists, particularly those in the European parliament, to break their working consensus with Christian Democrats which was alienating left- and rightwing voters from Europe. He admitted 'some differences' on these points with Mr Delors, who has warned against Europe harming its competitiveness by reducing work but not rewards, and who has always valued the role played in European integration by consensus-minded Christian Democrats. But there was no sense in the left playing up its differences, he said. The first secretary clearly indicated his view that the Socialist party's role would be to anchor the left for Mr Delors, who would be free to reach out to the centre. Mr Francois Hollande, a former Socialist deputy who runs Mr Delors's Temoins political discussion club in France, said he did not think Mr Emmanuelli's public appeal would greatly influence the Commission president's decision. 'This turns on personal factors, and on developments on the right as much as on the left.'</p>

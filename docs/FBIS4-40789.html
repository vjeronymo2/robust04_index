			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 6, RIA -- "The situation in Simferopol  is gradually normalising," Petr Chernyatevich, adviser to the  Crimean president on military issues, has told a RIA  correspondent in a telephone interview. Barricades and tents  outside the Supreme Soviet have been removed. The traditional  day of the city was held here yesterday and was a great success.    According to the presidential adviser, the fact that the  Crimean Tatars have captured two 9-storey buildings in Yalta  causes a certain worry. Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet, left for Yalta today on a fact-finding  mission to further report the situation to the parliament.    Mr. Chernyatevich has noted that the Crimea has received  information about a collegium of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  held in Kiev. The collegium discussed the findings of the  inspection of the 32nd Ukrainian Army Corps stationed in the  Crimea. There is no information about the findings of the  inspection, but as is known, a new inspection will be held this  autumn.</p>

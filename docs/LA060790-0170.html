			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SWITZERLAND SEEKS MEMBERSHIP IN IMF  </P> <P> Switzerland wants to join the 152 countries in the International Monetary Fund,  which plays a key role in the world's financial system, fund officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Switzerland, concerned about its traditional neutrality, has been reluctant to  join international organizations. In 1982, a government plan to join the fund  was postponed after Swiss voters defeated a proposal to join the United  Nations.  </P> <P> However, the Swiss government has had close informal relations with the fund.  </P> <P> The fund's board will consider the application.  </P></p>

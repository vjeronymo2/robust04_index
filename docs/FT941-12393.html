			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (10): 'High risk' concern  -Recreation is central to Vicaria's work in Chile It was during the height of recession and the depths of dictatorship that the Vicaria Zona Norte, an outreach office of the Chilean Catholic Church, began working with children in the slums of Santiago. The Vicaria set up its 'Recreation and Urban Centres' programme in 1982. At that time Chile's economy was in shreds, savaged by the Latin American debt crisis which had produced the worst assault on living standards since the 1930s. It was also a period of social unrest as huge unemployment and plummeting wages led to a wave of street protests against the military government of General Augusto Pinochet. Against such a backdrop the Vicaria's aims seemed modest. It began to work with children from the poorest parts of Santiago, encouraging them to meet, play sports and discuss their problems. Most of the children came from homes (often violent) where there was little motivation or time for leisure. Many of their families had been 'relocated' to squalid housing estates in the no-man's land around Santiago. The Vicaria's main concern was 'high-risk' children living in these so-called poblaciones, bereft of public services or recreational facilities. 'The kids just used to go out on to the streets, like vagabonds,' says Ana Leighton, who came to the Vicaria as a child and who is now chief programme director. 'It was a period of crisis in terms of participation. Nobody took part in anything in those days. There were no unions, no political organisations. But then people began to wake up, disillusioned with having been asleep for so long.' The church - often the focal point of opposition to the military regime - 'opened up' to this new-found need for solidarity in a society which had become deeply divided along political and social lines. 'When the kids first arrived, the games they played were violent. They had a lot of aggression. We encouraged them to play games where they would be in a team and learn to respect one another,' says Ms Leighton. Recreation was central to the Vicaria's philosophy of encouraging children to develop a sense of self-worth. 'It's more than just tossing kids a ball and saying: 'Get on with it'. For us, recreation is a tool of personal development.' It was through sports and activities that the Vicaria tried to impart what it saw as values under threat; love, understanding, respect for others, sharing and solidarity. Children, organised into neighbourhood groups under the supervision of trained counsellors, played team sports, went on country walks, put on plays and learned new dances. Once a year there was a week-long summer camp. 'From the outset the child was the focal point,' says Ms Leighton. 'The idea was to defend the rights of children - their right to an identity, to health, education, a family and a place to live. This became our slogan.' The programme has worked with more than 4,000 children, and it has trained 700 volunteers, Today it finds itself operating in very different circumstances. Chile, which returned to democracy in 1990, is now experiencing rapid economic growth and is seen as the 'miracle' of Latin America. While this has helped to drag many people out of poverty, the country's success has brought its own problems. The Vicaria now finds it harder to raise cash internationally, as charities switch funds to more needy causes. Many centres have become adept at raising their own financing. Ms Leighton is also concerned that the growing conspicuous consumption of Chile's middle classes is creating new resentment among the country's poor, especially its youth. UN criteria show nearly one in three Chileans below the poverty line. 'Lots of the kids don't have much sense of the future. They speak of today, but not of tomorrow,' says Ms Leighton. She says that higher education is beyond the reach of most poor children - save for the few who win scholarships. Those stranded in the slums can only watch with envy as their wealthier contemporaries advance ever closer to a western lifestyle. Among the difficulties faced by children today, Ms Leighton highlights the rising rate of teenage pregnancies - particularly problematic in ultra-conservative Chile, where the use of contraceptives is controversial and abortion and divorce are illegal. She is also worried by the spread of football hooliganism, and evidence that violent crime is rising. Towards the end of 1993, the press devoted much attention to the case of a 15-year-old accused of killing an eight year-old boy for his ice-cream money. Like the James Bulger case in the UK, many commentators are using the incident as evidence that, despite the economic 'miracle', all is far from perfect with Chile's children.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH on 8 March publishes  on pages 1 and 3 an approximately 4,000-word article by Chief  Editor Mahfuz al-Ansari. The article describes a "dialogue"  between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and several Egyptian  Government and opposition figures, writers, journalists, and  artists during a late-night Ramadan banquet hosted by Dr. Usamah  al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of  the President's Office for Political Affairs. The banquet is  also attended by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 'Arafat, and  a number of unnamed 'Arafat "aides." The date and place of the  banquet is not given, but the writer notes that the al-Baz'  banquet was preceded by an earlier banquet to break the fast  hosted by President Mubarak, which suggests that the dialogue  was held on 6 March.    The writer begins the article by giving background  information on the Hebron massacre and 'Arafat's contacts with  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He then notes that in times of crisis,  'Arafat's mind is "clear" and that he acts in a cool manner. He  then quotes some of 'Arafat's remarks during the dialogue.    'Arafat says: "I am not a man who lives in dreams.  Undoubtedly, mean and violent incidents disturb me; they make  me angry and outraged. But during a crisis, I always sit down  and think with my mind, not my emotions. In a crisis, I am  governed by my mind and the sense of responsibility wins me  over. This is because I am required to make a decision and take  a stand, a decision and a stand that will affect the destiny of  a people and a homeland. Thus, I can never allow myself to make  a decision with such magnitude and influence under the pressure  of anger or the inspiration of emotions and outrage." 'Arafat  then sheds light on his telephone conversation with Christopher.  He says: "U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  telephoned me. After expressing his regrets and condemnation of  the crime and after conveying President Clinton's condolences,  he said: Could you send a high-level envoy to discuss all the  details of the situation? I immediately answered: Yes. I will  send Nabil Sha'th. This is despite the anger, the outrage, and  the extreme grief. For I do not allow anger to govern politics.  Anger does not make politics."    'Arafat is then asked by journalists Makram Muhammad Ahmad,  Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, National Progressive Unionist Group  leader Khalid Muhiy-al-Din, and Lawyers Association President  Ahmad al-Khawajah about the results of Sha'th's mission in  Washington. He says: "Our people are passing through the most  difficult and complicated stage of their lives. Either they  will win their struggle and battle or lose everything. Thus,  for the thousandth time, there is no place for outrage and there  is no room for a decision motivated or dictated by anger. Work  to regain the land and rights must not stop. To be clear,  Christopher was not the only one who contacted me after the  massacre. Rabin did, too, and said a lot of things. I could  have declined to take the call, and I had reasons to, but I did  not. I told my colleagues in the occupied territories: Do not  reject the contacts and do not stop the work, and it is going on  day and night. The fact is that if the situation is viewed in a  reasonable and sane way we will find that Israel, particularly  after the massacre, is in a real predicament. It is trying to  get out of the situation by all means--the extremists and the  moderates, the political and governmental forces--although each  party is trying to get out of it in its own way."    The writer then notes that 'Arafat explains the "political  and technical details" of the Oslo agreement. 'Arafat discloses  how Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in one of his  diplomatic missions in Tel Aviv, managed to "obtain Rabin's and  Peres' approval to grant the East Jerusalem Palestinians the  rights to run and vote in elections and that Rabin agreed to  allocate two ballot boxes for the Jerusalem residents, one in  front of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and another in front  of the al-Aqsa Mosque."    The writer then notes that al-Baz is asked about Egyptian  press reports calling for speeding up normalization with Israel.  After noting that decisions on such issues as normalization are  not made by the state, since it involves relations between  peoples, al-Baz says: "The Egyptian state is linked to Israeli  by a peace agreement. Egypt is loyal to its pledges and  agreements. The magnitude of cooperation and dealings, which is  known as normalization, is governed by practices and responses.  It is not made by an administrative or political decision." He  adds: "I believe that some writers have noticed that some Arab  states, which are advocating the boycott and have discussed with  us several joint projects, have hastened to announce various  cooperation projects between themselves and Israel. I believe  that some of our writers, in the hope of reaching a quick peace  and a near solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, thought that  everybody was rushing to gain the benefits of peace while Egypt  remained faithful to its Arab principles and commitments to  Palestine. This is the whole situation and there is nothing  more to it. Common interests are too great to be made or  motivated by decisions."    'Arafat is then pressed to disclose the U.S. position and  the answers brought back from Washington by Nabil Sha'th. He  says: "I disagree with Nabil. He is always optimistic and he  says good things about the position of Christopher and the U.S.  Administration. But at the same time, he brought us many U.S.  reservations regarding the failure of the Security Council to  issue a resolution, because of the Americans, following a  horrible massacre. We did not ask the United States for  anything new. We asked it to make a reference to what it had  already agreed to in Security Council Resolution 799 on  Jerusalem issued in 1992. The strange thing is that the United  States, the sponsor of this resolution, refuses to mention it in  the new resolution. It also does not want to announce anything  before obtaining Israel's prior approval, particularly with  respect to the international monitoring or the international  troops. We do not want troops equipped with heavy weapons and  tanks, we just want two platoons [fasilatyn]. And I have an  approval from Russia, France, England, and Belgium for  approximately 1,000 soldiers. This would be a multinational  force, like the one in Sinai, armed with personal weapons to  only undertake protection and monitoring. The sad thing is  that, while we are waging this fierce and tough battle to  maintain the momentum, preserve the rights, and regain the land,  many come out and make the most horrendous accusations against  us. For instance, they call Nabil a traitor and say that he  surrendered, but the fact is that he is waging a tough battle of  negotiations and defense." 'Arafat adds: "The agreement on the  occupied territories is the beginning of the establishment of a  Palestinian state. When I found hesitation from the United  States because it was waiting for Rabin's approval of  international troops in the occupied territories, I told them  that the land is my land. The land is Palestinian and  sovereignty is for the Palestinians. Those who have the right to  approve or disapprove of the presence of troops on the land are  the Palestinians, the PLO, and we accept it to protect our  people. The agreement signed stipulates withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho on 12 April. In July we should start discussions  about measures for the withdrawal of Israelis from the remaining  area of the occupied territories. Thus, I say it loud and clear:  I, and no one else, am the one who has a right to accept or  reject the international troops."    'Arafat is then asked if he thinks the Israeli Government is  involved in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 'Arafat says:  "Frankly, the Zionist extremist and fanatical forces are still  in control of the situation in Israel; in the Army, the  government, and the institutions. It is true that the majority  supported the agreement and stands strongly behind peace and a  settlement, but the extremists still have a strong opinion and  hidden tools that they could use at any time, like what happened  in Hebron." 'Arafat adds: "Some say that the Army was behind  the crime, and I believe this is not accurate. The fact is that  some Army factions, not the entire Army, must have acted in  collusion. I also refuse to believe that it was an individual  act."    Asked if he could still control the Palestinians despite the  tragedy, 'Arafat says: "I am confident about the awareness of  the Palestinian people, their wisdom, and their sane and  rational revolution that refrains from excesses. I am sure that  meeting our legitimate and just demands, which must be  stipulated in a Security Council resolution, could restore  confidence to the Palestinians so that they can proceed toward  regaining their rights. The Palestinians are tired of war and  displacement and want stability and reconstruction, without  surrendering or one-upmanship. But for Israel to maneuver or  try to improve its image by minor resolutions, this will solve  nothing. We have shown the entire world our goodwill in the  saddest moment of the massacre and in the darkest hours of  disappointment. If Israel responds, we will return to the  negotiations on the basis of a just resolution by the Security  Council on the condition that all the Arab parties--meaning  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan--will return to the negotiating  table, too. We are in touch with them and I have called for a  five-party meeting among Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and  Lebanon to coordinate our stances before any new step is taken."    Asked if this requires a meeting with Rabin, 'Arafat says:  "I  do not refuse to meet with Rabin, but shall we meet just to take  a picture for the masses? I cannot accept this. But if the  meeting is intended to adopt practical steps that could remedy  the flaw of the old resolution and open the door for the new  rounds, I believe that the awaited Security Council resolution  could pave the way for such a meeting."    Asked if he still has pressure cards to negotiate from a  strong position, 'Arafat says: "Of course, we still have cards  in our hands. Who said peace is our only option? We say it  clearly and simply: If you change your mind, we will. If you  do not want peace, this is your choice and we are ready with all  means. We have shown the world our intentions and the world has  seen the crime. On this occasion, I would like to say that this  is not the time for ending the Arab boycott, particularly after  what happened in Hebron, which could be repeated by the Zionist  extremists. I repeat once again that the Palestinians are  intelligent and cultured. They want to get rid of the  occupation, but at the same time they can endure a great deal.  They can endure appalling crimes, such as the Hebron massacre  and others, if this is the price for its freedom."    Asked if the Palestinian extremist current will engage in  one-upmanship against him, particularly now, 'Arafat said:  "Unfortunately, this current is violent against their fellow  Palestinians, not the Israelis. We refused the proposal that  PLO and Fatah supporters be freed from Israeli prisons and  insisted that Israel release everybody without exception. As a  result, our cadres are still in prison, while the Islamic  current negotiated the release of its cadres alone in a separate  agreement with the Israeli authorities."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report: "Will Pay Go Up? If Only We Knew </F> What It Will Entail..."]    [Text] According to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's information,  Boris Yeltsin intends to sign within the next few days a  decision on a further increase in the salaries of servicemen in  the Russian Armed Forces -- by 50 percent, so it is supposed.  One could only congratulate officers and generals in this  connection, if it were not for one "but."    This is not the first time the president has demonstrated  his  concern for the Army. But, by a strange coincidence, similar  decisions have hitherto been adopted on the eve of a possible  exacerbation of the political situation in the country. For  example, before the referendum of April 1993, when the troops  were paid "arrears" of pay and more than 150 generalships were  conferred on top officers. The situation was repeated shortly  before the president's "strategic fall offensive," when the  Ministry of Finance suddenly and "unexpectedly" paid servicemen  the salaries for July-September, which had been delayed, with a  coefficient of 1.8. At the time, comments appeared in  newspapers in this connection, and there was talk of a special  plan to influence the Army and a desire to boost its loyalty to  the authorities on the eve of important political events.</p>

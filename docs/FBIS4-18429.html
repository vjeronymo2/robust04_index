			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said  the Turkish side's reasons for placing the occupation forces on  alert are unjustified and provocative. He also clarified that  the National Guard has been placed on partial readiness due to  the alert of the occupation forces along the confrontation line.  Kasoulidhis described the National Guard's reaction as a normal  procedure that will conclude when the Turkish occupation forces  are taken off alert. It would be naive, the spokesman  concluded, for anyone to believe that the Greek Cypriot side,  amid the current political developments, would be foolish enough  to tamper with the confrontation line.</p>

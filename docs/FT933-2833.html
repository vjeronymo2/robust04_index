			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan sets up index on Latin American bonds JP MORGAN has set up the first index to track the performance of international bonds issued by Latin American corporate and sovereign borrowers. Eurobond issuance by Latin American borrowers has grown rapidly since 1990, when Mexico led the way for them to access the international capital markets for the first time since the debt crisis of the 1980s. According to JP Morgan, Dollars 10.9bn worth of Eurobonds were issued by Latin American borrowers in the first eight months of this year, compared with just Dollars 1.1bn in 1990. Ms Jeanne Feldhusen, head of JP Morgan's emerging markets fixed-income research group, said the index had been set up in response to investor demand for a tool to analyse this rapidly-growing market on a more objective basis. JP Morgan's Latin Eurobond index aims to provide investors with a benchmark which will allow them to compare risks and returns in this market with more established fixed-income markets around the world. The index will track the liquid or traded market for fixed-rate, dollar-denominated Eurobonds issued by Latin American borrowers. It comprises 46 bonds with a total amount outstanding of Dollars 8.6bn, which represents about 35 per cent of the total face value. The bonds are issued by borrowers located mainly in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. Corporate issues make up 57 per cent of the index, with sovereign issues comprising the remaining 43 per cent. The index tracks returns on Eurobond issues from the end of 1991. Since then, the index has had a return of 25.8 per cent, with corporate issues outperforming sovereign issues.</p>

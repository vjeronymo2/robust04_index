			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A, section 6.c. advises how processors can ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that microbiological hazards associated with final product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling can be controlled. Following the manipulation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product during postcooking processing, it will be necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor to cool the product to a temperature that will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the further growth of mesophilic or psychrotropic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens. This result can be achieved by cooling the finished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product to an internal temperature of 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) within 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours of either placing it in the finished product container or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing pasteurization. Again, the recommendation is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella spp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Of specific concern to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization process is the reduction of the internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature of the product to a level that will not support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth of any surviving spores of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , type E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ability of the firm's processing procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to address the particulars of the firm's processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Real time documentation of this monitoring should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done to facilitate management and regulatory review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternately, the firm's ability to consistently meet its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these processing variations include container size, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature of the cooling medium, and the amount of product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally placed in the cooling unit. In many instances, in-process time/temperature monitoring may be impractical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expensive for sealed finished product containers. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientifically conducted study is especially appropriate in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations, where it can be assured that in all plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations the time/temperature constraints will be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documentation of the conduct and results of the study is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under proposed &sect;123.8 to facilitate management and regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temperature control during refrigerated storage is best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved through the use of temperature indicating and recording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices and recordkeeping, as stated in Appendix A, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.d.2. (Ref. 85). However, FDA recognizes that some processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may desire to manually monitor the temperature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration unit, using only a temperature-indicating device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a logbook. When coupled with a high temperature alarm or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum-indicating thermometer, the agency feels that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice represents an acceptable alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guideline advises, in Appendix A, section 3.i., that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans prepared in accordance with subpart A of part 123  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will normally identify distribution as a critical control point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution of perishable products encompasses the same hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as associated with refrigerated storage. For this reason, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A, section 6.e., the agency is recommending a critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit of an internal temperature maximum of 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraging the shipper and consignee to arrange for appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recognizes that distribution patterns vary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerably from single shipments to pooled and multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery shipments, from iced shipments to refrigerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipments, and from shipments on the consignee's truck to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipments on the shipper's truck to common carrier shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each mode presents different opportunities and impediments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Temperature Monitoring Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Processors must monitor and control the temperature of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration units in order to ensure that microorganisms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health concern do not increase in numbers. Likewise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors must control the times and temperatures of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal processes in order to ensure that the minimum thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is consistently delivered to the product. The guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the outfitting of cooking, pasteurization, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration equipment with temperature indicating and recording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices (Appendix A, sections 4. a.2.ii. and b.2.ii., and section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.d.2., respectively). A temperature-recording device provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete history of the temperature throughout the thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process by continuously recording it on a chart. As has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated for low acid canned foods, the chart itself provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an excellent HACCP record for the benefit of both processor and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulator. For this record to be meaningful, it is critical that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temperature-recording device sensor be installed so as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately represent the temperature of the heating or cooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

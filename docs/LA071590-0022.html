			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSERTS CONCERNING NIXON TERMED UNFAIR  </P> <P> Regarding the article that Beverly Beyette wrote, "After Smoke Cleared" (July  3).  </P> <P> In the first paragraph, Beyette establishes the date of the devastating  Brentwood fire as Nov. 6, 1961.  </P> <P> Yet she makes two more references to the time period in her description of the  fire that threatened Richard Nixon's home, stating "Richard Nixon, defeated in  the presidential race the year before by John F. Kennedy" . . . and, in the  same paragraph, "before fleeing with treasured possessions that included notes  on the forthcoming gubernatorial campaign (which he was to lose to Edmund G.  (Pat) Brown)." Just what do these political inserts have to do with Nixon's  treasured possessions? Does recalling two of Nixon's lost campaigns have  anything to do with the news of the inferno?  </P> <P> In the interest of good and fair reporting, my husband and I take exception to  these inserts.  </P> <P> HELENE DROWN  </P> <P> Rolling Hills  </P></p>

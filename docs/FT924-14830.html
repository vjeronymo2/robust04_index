			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Ethiopia reforms 'depend on aid' ETHIOPIA'S central bank governor Mr Leikun Berhanu appealed yesterday for urgent foreign aid to help the country cope with economic reforms and the legacy of Marxist rule and civil war, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. 'Timely and adequate financial support from multilateral and other donors is very critical if the reform package is to succeed,' Mr Leikun said. The reforms would shortly include introducing higher interest rates. Borrowing rates would no longer favour farmers' collectives, which paid 4.5 per cent compared to 9 per cent for businessmen. Rates will still be set by the central bank. Ethiopian businessmen would be allowed to establish banks and insurance companies. The finance sector would remain closed to foreign investors for the time being.</p>

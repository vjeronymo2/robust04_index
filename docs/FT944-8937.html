			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Finsbury Growth Net asset value at Finsbury Growth Trust expanded from 112.9p to 118.9p per share in the year to September 30. The 5.3 per cent rise compared with a modest gain over the same period of 0.3 per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index and a fall of 0.4 per cent in the FT-SE 100. Net revenue dipped to Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 1.37m), reflecting exceptional dividend income last time, a changed ACT rate, higher management fees and the absence this time of underwriting and dealing income. Earnings per share were 2.3p (2.94p). The proposed final is held at 2p, maintaining the total at 2.9p and requiring a transfer of Pounds 278,000 from revenue reserves.</p>

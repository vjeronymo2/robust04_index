			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Cookson merger talks collapse on terms of deal Merger talks between Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and Cookson, the specialist industrialist materials concern, collapsed yesterday after a failure to reach agreement on the terms. Following the surprise news, Johnson Matthey shares fell by 9p to 565p - the price they held before the companies confirmed negotiations were being held. Cookson's shares ended 2p up at 247p, compared with 251p before talks were announced. If successful the deal would have been the largest agreed merger in UK corporate history, creating a company with a market value of about Pounds 2.5bn and placing it in the FT-SE 100 Index. A banker involved in the discussions said: 'Both companies had a clear idea of their own worth and the gap between them was simply too wide. When it was obvious no deal could be done, we all went out for a friendly drink.' A joint statement stressed that relationships remained 'excellent'. Johnson Matthey and Cookson have a new joint venture, Cookson Matthey Ceramics, the world's second-largest ceramics business and an important element in the operations of both groups. They said they would 'co-operate fully in the development' of CMC. The statement from Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson chairman, Mr Richard Oster, its chief executive, and Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive of Johnson Matthey, added: 'We looked fully into the ways in which a merger might fairly have rewarded shareholders on each side. Sadly, we were not able to agree a recommendation to our respective shareholders and so our discussions have now ceased.' Bankers insist that newspaper 'leaks' about the talks played no part in the eventual breakdown in negotiations. Mr Richard Malthouse, Cookson's company secretary, said his company would probably send a note to its shareholders today which would include some indication about present trading conditions. Johnson Matthey is scheduled to announce its half-year results tomorrow. Cookson took a hostile 8 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey in the late 1980s but this was sold when Cookson itself ran into financial problems. Under Mr Oster, a friendlier relationship has been fostered and there were widespread rumours last year of merger talks. Lex, Page 28</p>

It  also stressed it will entrench all forms of struggle against the  Zionist machine of suppression and the Zionist settlers and  emphasized need for withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories.    In a statement entitled "The Vengeance Call" distributed  here  today, UNLI said the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque crime, which was  committed by the Israeli occupation authorities, reveal the ugly  criminal face of these authorities and the true Israeli  objectives; namely to murder our people, to empty our land of  its inhabitants, and to settle the Zionist settlers in their  place. The crime also reveals the falsity of the Zionist  allegations, which keep talking about peace.    In its call, UNLI demands the United Nations, particularly  the UN Security Council, to shoulder its responsibility to  protect our unarmed people and provide real protection for them  so the world organization can prove its credibility.    UNLI urges the international and regional organizations and  the European peoples who support human rights to work on  fulfilling their role toward our unarmed people and their right  to live in freedom, dignity, and security on their land.    It also urges our people in the diaspora camps to continue  the solidarity activities in the face of the Zionist killers.  It also hails the decision made by Fatah Hawks [group in the  occupied territories] and Fatah militants to resume armed action  and struggle against the occupation troops and end the so-called  truce.    UNLI also calls for a plan to activate the work of the  militant coordination committees in the field, which should  group all militant forces and figures in the homeland, and to  continue and escalate all forms of struggle throughout the  entire homeland.</p>

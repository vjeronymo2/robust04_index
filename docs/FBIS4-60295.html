Brother dear citizens: On this venerable day of faith, in  which the magnificence of the shining picture of the Islamic  nation manifests itself, represented in the guests of God  visiting the holy places and taking up position in common  worship to the one God on the blessed Mount 'Arafat, and in the  apex of great rites that almost count as the complete pilgrimage  to quote Prophet Muhammad, who said that to climb Mount 'Arafat  amounts to a complete pilgrimage. This is because standing on  Mount 'Arafat [word indistinct] is an important religous event,  where the sentiments of all Muslims gravitate [word indistinct]  the close bond that does not unravel, and that makes us stick  more firmly to it and believe more in the justice of the  virtuous Islamic faith. We thank God for his guidance.    On the occasion of the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, I  take pleasure to send my sincere, heartfelt congratulations to  all members of our people and Arab and Islamic nations, hoping  that when the occasion next comes round all of us will be in the  happiest state possible. This 'Id confirms great values of  sacrifice and self-denial that are today manifest in the heroic  acts of the courageous and faithful sons of our believing and  proud people in the Armed Forces and Security Forces as they  fight battles of sacrifice and self-denial and stand up to  rebellious and secessionist gangs within the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party and display the finest examples of  sacrifice with all courage and chivalry and dedication to the  sacred duty. To them in particular, I send my warmest greetings  on the occasion of 'Id al- Adha [word instinct] what they have  always done in the areas of sacrifice and self-denial and  standing up to the enemies of the people and the homeland and  the enemies of principles, ideals, and values.    Thanks to them, our people have been able to ward off the  dangers that were ignited by the rebellious secessionists,  threatening the homeland's unity and safety. They have  extinguished the fire of those dangers before they became an  overall national ordeal, thus bolstering and fortifying the  people's unity, increasing the firmness of the people's faith in  democracy, and enhancing faith in the present and future of the  new Yemen, the Yemen of unity, freedom, and democracy, the Yemen  of wellbeing, justice, and prosperity.    On this occasion, we beseech Almighty God to have bountiful  mercy on all the martyrs of our people, the martyrs of the  revolution, unity, and democracy, and to elevate their souls to  highest ranks among the prophet's companions and martyrs. We  beseech God to accept the prayers of the pilgrims to holy Mecca,  to guide our steps, and to lead us along the path that pleases  Him. God is all-hearing, ready to answer. Many happy returns.</p>

UDP interim national chairman Mr. (Kapemba Phiri)  said it was wrong for people in Mongu to behave in such a  manner. He said the president should be respected regardless of  which party he belonged to, and urged all leaders to discipline  their members. The motorcade was pelted with stones and mangoes  when President Chiluba went there to campaign for the Mongu  Central by-election.</p>

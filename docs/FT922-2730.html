			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Thailand will urge investors to return THAILAND'S Board of Investment (BoI) yesterday acknowledged that new foreign investment would be severely curtailed by last month's political violence and said it was planning a campaign in conjunction with the private sector to restore international confidence in the country. Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BoI secretary general, said many existing foreign-funded projects had advanced beyond the point of no return, but potential newcomers to Thailand were likely to have second thoughts after the events in May, in which troops shot dead 50 or more pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok. 'One has to admit that the incident now has really frightened investors who've never known about Thailand before,' he told journalists. 'If you're talking about the first-time outlay of funds - forget it.' He said the BoI would co-operate with leading companies such as Siam Cement to raise Dollars 3m to Dollars 4m (Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 2.16m) for a public relations campaign which would express faith in Thailand's future. Mr Staporn's efforts to extract money from the government and reassure foreign investors should both be made easier by the appointment of Mr Anand Panyarachun as prime minister last week. Mr Staporn is close to Mr Anand, and the premier's economic reforms were generally praised by the business community during his previous administration between February 1991 and March this year. Mr Anand, however, expects to be in office only until elections are held in about four months, and fresh investment was already falling before the violence because of concern about Thailand's overloaded transport networks, a shortage of skilled workers and other problems. Mr Staporn said even in 'normal' times it would take a year to recover from the sort of trouble experienced by Thailand this year, but Japan's financial difficulties, Germany's preoccupation with eastern Europe and the weakness of western economies made the foreign investment outlook even worse.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Baltic region problems occupied a significant  place at the Russian-Finnish summit. Here is what Foreign  Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev told our observer Yuliy Semenov  and other journalists.    [Begin Kozyrev recording] There is to be a meeting in  Tallinn  on cooperation between the Baltic Sea states. Finland has given  us support in implementing our initiative on creating the post  of commissar for democratic institutions and human rights,  including the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities.  I have to say that there was a very difficult debate literally  right up to the last few days, and I was even considering not  going to this meeting at all unless there was agreement on this  issue. But now Finland, Finnish diplomacy has taken the part  of, what I would call, mediator, and has helped to work out a  compromise that gives this commissar a clear mandate to tackle  human rights issues in the Baltic states.    We discussed in detail the tasks of this regional  institution  in general. Lastly, we have expanded bilateral ties; we  discussed issues of regulating border crossings, in order to  make such crossings simpler though, of course, controllable. We  discussed matters relating to regulating the issuing of visas.  We agreed to speed up the signing of a bilateral agreement on  this score. One of the basic favorable factors of  Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that we do not have any  territorial problems. Neither side has any territorial claims  on the other. These matters have been fully resolved by  bilateral agreements and fully dealt under the principles of the  CSCE. Incidentally, this is one of the issues that we will  definitely be raising at the meeting of Baltic Sea states, so  that Latvia and Estonia do not put forward any territorial  claims. The existing borders are unshakable and, strictly  speaking, no one with any sense contests them. It is true that  such claims are being put forward by Estonia, but we are  counting on assistance, perhaps even from the Finnish side and  other states, in defending this principle without which  stability as a whole would simply collapse.    We are conducting bilateral talks on the matter of, say, the  withdrawal of troops and we do not need any mediation here but,  of course, we value and welcome friendly participation and when  our Baltic neighbors give sensible advice. As for the problem  of human rights, including the rights of ethnic minorities, this  problem is an international one, because we cannot allow double  standards and the violation of human rights in any country or in  any region of Europe. This is not a problem for Russia alone.  It is a problem for everyone.    That is why the post of CSCE commissar for the rights of  ethnic minorities was created who, incidentally, works primarily  with the Baltic states. And now, to assist this commissar, the  post of commissar for the Baltic Sea states is to be created.  We believe that the high standards that have been achieved in  Finland, Sweden, and other Baltic Sea countries in the human  rights area and the rights of ethnic minorities should be  applied in the Baltic states as well.

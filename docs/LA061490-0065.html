Shortstop Benji Belfield was two for four with a double for East (6-1).  </P> <P> Gabe Miller hit a solo homer in the seventh for Granada Hills (2-5).  </P> <P> In other District 20 games:  </P> <P> Las Virgenes 4, Chatsworth 3 (eight innings) -- Bret Resnick hit for the cycle  and tripled in the winning run with two out in the eighth to lead Las Virgenes  at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Resnick finished with three runs batted in and teammates Paul Schaffer and Tom  Hoover each had two hits for Las Virgenes (4-4).  </P> <P> Harold Turk, Dusty Wood and Paul Johnson combined on a six-hitter. Johnson, who  pitched three scoreless innings of relief, earned the win. Rodney Bloom and Wes  Doll each had two hits for Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Valley Encino-Tarzana 14, North Hollywood 5 -- Catcher Seth Rosenzweig hit a  two-run home run in the third inning, then hit a bases-loaded triple in an  11-run fourth inning to finish with five RBIs and pace Valley ET (3-2) at  Birmingham.  </P> <P> Mike Belasco, Noah Kirshbaum, Mike Malkin and winning pitcher Jason Mansfield  (1-1) each had two hits for Valley ET.  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West 4, Encino-Crespi 1 -- Paul Geller and Pat Treend combined  on a five-hitter to break a three-game losing streak for West (2-3).  </P> <P> Geller (1-0) pitched four innings, allowed five hits, struck out four and  walked none. In three innings of relief, Treend struck out eight and walked  none.  </P> <P> Chris Teich and Geller each had two hits for West, which has recorded both of  its victories at the expense of Encino-Crespi.  </P> <P> Burbank 7, Van Nuys-Notre Dame 3 -- Burbank took a 3-0 lead in the first off  spot starter Vinnie Orlando, who walked five batters in the inning at Notre  Dame.  </P> <P> Bobby Medina was three for three with two RBIs and Bobby Sherwood was two for  two with two RBIs for Burbank.  </P> <P> Jason McConaghy was two for two for Van Nuys-Notre Dame (5-1), which had four  players on vacation.  </P> <P> Reseda 19, Agoura 6 -- Ari Jacobs and Joe Arnold each went three for five to  pace Reseda (3-4) at Agoura.  </P> <P> Jacobs drove in three runs to support winner Robert Reynoso (1-0).

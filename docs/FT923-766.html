			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: A wine bluffer's guide to the Midi - A primer on Languedoc-Rousillon and some of the world's best value bottles WE ALL know that the Languedoc-Roussillon, France's biggest wine region, can offer some of the world's best value bottles but few of us, even wine merchants, know our way round it yet. Britain's biggest off-licence chain thinks Sete is 'on the edge of Cotes de Rousillon (sic)', most of its rivals still lump both Languedoc and Roussillon in with minor obscurities under the belittling title 'French Country Wines', and many wonder where Oc is. Here is the briefest of bluffers' guides to bottles that can offer real diversity and character in the Pounds 3 to Pounds 5 bracket: Midi is a general but delightfully evocative name for the south of France. In terms of time rather than place, midi is noon, a time of firmly closed shutters when you may as well have your feet under a table here as everyone else will be busy lunching or snoozing. Languedoc, the land where 'oc' meant yes and white wine is still pronounced 'venga blenga', is a vast sweep of vine monoculture around the Mediterranean coast. Generalisations about the wines produced are now, happily, impossible. The plains which once spewed forth vapid vin ordinaire for thirsty workers in northern France now boast pockets of quality-consciousness where prices are still ludicrously low (which means most cellars are still frugally equipped). Roussillon should not be a Languedoc suffix at all but is the quite distinct, Pyreneen, semi-Spanish region that is French Catalonia. Here are exotic soft, full, dry whites; some uniquely complex dessert wines labelled Banyuls, Maury and Rivesaltes; and reds that are cheap but only occasionally excite. The Rivesaltes co-operative and the larger houses Cazes and Sarda-Malet do a good job but all producers struggle to fit the wines they want to make into the straitjacket of appellation controlee rules. Corbieres. The Languedoc's most interesting appellation, spread over 11 newly-defined but almost equally rugged terroirs of arid, generally hilly vineyards. Although generic blends of Corbieres are as dull as any, many individual domaines are busting a gut to win medals and competitions with wines as well-made as France's finest. A typical good Corbieres is deep red, slightly wild and intensely savoury. Fine dry whites are also increasingly easy to find, if not invariably thanks to fashions for oak-ageing and grape varieties as exotic as Roussanne, Marsanne, Vermentino and even Viognier. Over-achievers: Lastours, Voulte-Gasparets (Cuvee Romain Pauc) Roque-Sestiere (white), St Auriol, La Baronne, Villemajou, Fontsainte, Ollieux, St Louis. Minervois is the queen if Corbieres is king, its wines lacking some of the punch perhaps, but making up for it with their suavity. As in Corbieres, the best reds are made of Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault, Mourvedre and as little Carignan as possible. There are dozens of dedicated domaines, but also some fine co-operatives which are investing in luxuries such as de-stalking machines and new oak casks. Over-achievers: Fabas, Laville-Bertrou, Fontbertiere, La Combe Blanche, Violet, Gourgazaud, Centeilles, La Grave, Tour St Martin, Jean d'Alibert. Fitou commands a mysterious price premium over the two appellations which lie to its immediate north, but has recently been coasting on a reputation cleverly built upon the wholesome-sounding but effectively fictitious Madame Parmentier's label. At best a mature Fitou can be a rewarding, full-blown experience but too high a proportion of production is undistinguished, fairly tough, high-volume stuff. Notable exception: Ch de Nouvelles. St Chinian, the appellation to the immediate east of Minervois, is already slightly more Rhone-like, producing rounder red, and occasionally pink, wines with more obvious Cinsaut/Grenache sweetness, which can make them slightly less distinctive to palates brought up on Cotes-du-Rhone. Over-achievers: Coujan, Jougla, Berloup (top cuvees) Faugeres The best are silkier than St Chinian next door and manage to slip the juiciness of the local grape varieties into a bordeaux-like structure. Over-achievers: Estanilles, Laurens, Grezan. Coteaux du Languedoc is the catch-all appellation for wines made east of Minervois and west of the Gard of which the authorities approve (ie are not named after grape varieties) So far sub-regions St Chinian and Faugeres have managed to float above the surface to establish their own identity. Others bubbling up include La Clape - its Bourboulenc whites can beguile - another oddity, Picpoul de Pinet, and Pic St Loup. Over-achievers: Rouquette-sur-Mer, Mas Jullien, Prieure de St Jean de Bebian, Hortus. Vin de pays. Most of France's 'country wines' come from either the Languedoc or Roussillon, and many of the Languedoc-Roussillon's most interesting wines qualify only as Vin de Pays rather than one of the appellations above. They often carry obscure geographical names, but can offer superb value. The most common is the catch-all Languedoc category, Vin de Pays d'Oc, which may also be labelled with the name of a grape variety. Syrah and Merlot have been particularly successful reds, while whites stray boldly outside Chardonnay and Sauvignon territory. Although Chardonnay is being planted fast and furiously, until recently the lion's share of Languedoc Chardonnay was planted around Limoux, famous for its sparkling Blanquette. After Mas de Daumas Gassac, the Vin de Pays de l'Herault with the classed-growth prices, the most successful PR coup has been Limoux co-op's Toques et Clochers annual auction of oak-aged Chardonnays, now available from Britain's Majestic chain for around Pounds 7.50. Some of Roussillon's finest wines qualify only as Vin de Pays (and Fernand Vaquer's only as Vin de Table) because of grape varieties or alcohol levels. Languedoc: Condamine l'Eveque, Limbardie, Arjolle, St Martin de la Garrigue, Aupilhac, Bosc, Cante Cigale, Valmagne, Raissac, Peyrat, Montmarin, Coussergues. Roussillon: Mas Chichet, Gauby, Cazenove.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Inquiry hits at former Nordbanken management THE FORMER senior management of Nordbanken, the ailing Swedish state-controlled bank, is criticised strongly in an inquiry into its financial troubles, published yesterday. The report suggests that the administration of the bank at the time of its merger with the private PK Banken three years ago was 'almost catastrophically bad'. It accuses Nordbanken of an 'extraordinary and unacceptable' lack of management during 1988 and 1989 particularly in its Stockholm headquarters over provision of credit. The report points to a high turnover of staff dealing with credit policy with a large number young and inexperienced. In spite of internal warnings calling for better credit procedures, the bank's senior executives had never followed up the recommendations made to them, suggested Mr Bertil Sodermark, a distinguished Swedish solicitor, who wrote the report. Only parts of the reports have been authorised for publication by the Ministry of Finance.</p>

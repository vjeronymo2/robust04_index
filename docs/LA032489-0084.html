			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF NAVY HOSPITAL GETS NEW POST  </P> <P> The commander of the Long Beach Naval Hospital is being transferred, but Navy  officials said last week that the move is not related to recent claims that the  facility has been dangerously under-equipped.  </P> <P> Navy Capt. Clarence William Cote', commanding officer since 1987, will leave  May 19 to assume command of the Naval Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes,  Ill.  </P> <P> "It's just a regular change of command," said Ensign Richard Dewey, a hospital  spokesman. "It's a step up in his career."  </P> <P> As of Thursday, Dewey said, it was unclear who would replace Cote'.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the 114-bed facility -- the only Naval hospital in Los  Angeles County -- made headlines after a group of physicians in its internal  medicine department signed a memo saying they would refuse to treat seriously  ill patients because of conditions at the facility, which they considered  poorly equipped and under-staffed.  </P> <P> According to Dewey, the commander's imminent reassignment is unrelated to those  revelations.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / More investment from private sector: World Bank sees trend affecting middle-income developing countries but not poor ones Private-sector capital is replacing government finance for the middle-income developing countries, the World Bank says, but the poorest countries have not benefited from this trend. Both private-sector loans and equity investments in the developing world climbed steeply last year to Dollars 102.1bn (Pounds 68.5bn), exceeding for the first time government loans and grants, which fell to Dollars 54.6bn, according to statistics compiled annually by the World Bank in its World Debt Tables, published yesterday. The Washington-based development bank projects a further increase in private capital flows to Dollars 113.2bn, while official loans and grants are projected to recover to Dollars 63.5bn. 'There has been a remarkable turnaround in private capital flows to the middle-income countries,' said Mr Michael Bruno, the World Bank's chief economist. Mr Bruno's enthusiasm is tempered, however, by the much starker prospects for the low-income countries. With the exception of China, which has become the leading recipient among developing countries of private capital resources with a projected total of Dollars 27bn this year, all of the increase in capital flows has gone to middle-income countries. While excessive flows of capital can create problems for policymakers in developing countries - for example, by pushing up exchange rates - Mr Bruno argues that the importance of private equity investment should make these flows more sustainable than the loans that created the 1970s debt crisis. Not only are equity investors more likely to remain long-term partners, whereas bond investors might pull out if US long-term interest rates were to rise again, but the principal reason behind the turnaround in private capital flows has been the economic policy reforms carried out by the developing countries, Mr Bruno argues. While private-sector lending to the developing world bounced back to Dollars 41.7bn in 1992 and Dollars 43.7bn in 1993 - four times the average annual rate in the previous six years - equity investment has risen even faster over the same period. Foreign direct investment in the developing world, in which the investor acquires a long-term management interest in a company, climbed steadily from Dollars 10.1bn in 1986 to Dollars 47.3bn in 1992, and was projected by the World Bank to have risen again to Dollars 56.3bn in 1992. Portfolio equity investment, in which foreign investors buy shares without seeking management control, also soared from Dollars 600m in 1986 to Dollars 13.1bn in 1992 as new stock markets opened and investment conditions in the developing countries improved. This category of capital flow is expected, however, to flatten out to Dollars 13.2bn in 1993. Low-income countries, except for China, are in a much worse position. Most, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, have no access to international capital markets. Government-to-government financing has also slowed for these countries, although the World Bank notes 'a welcome shift toward grant financing', paralleling the shift from lending toward equity investment in the private sector. For the 29 severely indebted low-income countries, with outstanding debts of Dollars 204bn among them at the end of 1992, net flows of long-term capital almost dried up to total Dollars 1.7bn in 1992 before recovering slightly to a projected Dollars 2.8bn this year, but grants grew steadily through the late 1980s to reach Dollars 14.9bn in 1992 and Dollars 15.2bn this year. The difficulty Mr Bruno sees for these poor countries is not so much the cash flow problem of servicing their debts as the overhang of accumulated debt. 'The capitalisation of interest and the accumulation of arrears has outweighed debt forgiveness,' he said, calling for renewed efforts by creditor countries to reduce the stock of debt burdening the low income countries. *World Debt Tables: World Bank Publications, Box 7247-8619, Philadelphia PA 19170-8619, US.

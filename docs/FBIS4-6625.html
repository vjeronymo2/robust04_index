			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's food imports  expanded 5.5 percent in 1993 to a record high 40,158.40 million  dollars, going above the 40 billion dollar level for the first  time, a governmental trade body said Wednesday [20 April]. The  Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) said the record high  imports stemmed mainly from increases in fresh vegetables, beef,  fish and rice.    Imports of fresh vegetables, which suffered a poor crop as a  result of a cool and rainy summer last year, posted a 15.4  percent climb, and those of beef rose 18.2 percent, supported by  a reduction in custom duties and the yen's sharp rise, Jetro  said.    An 11.1 percent increase in fish, which has the largest  share  of total imports, also contributed much to the record high, it  said.    Imports of rice, which began as an emergency measure  following a shortage of domestic rice in the wake of last year's  unseasonable summer, totaled 107,900 tons worth 42.18 million  dollars.    Orange imports rose a tiny 2.8 percent, discouraged by lower  prices of domestic "mikan" mandarin oranges, while imports of  orange juice plunged 25.9 percent in a reactionary move against  last year's surge after liberalization of the farm product.</p>

Muzhitskikh, chairman of the board of the </F> Elektrobank Commercial Bank, under the rubric "Competent  Opinion": "The Difficulties Experienced by Commercial Banks Are  Not Diminishing"]    [Text] Despite the criticism leveled against the  Central Bank, commercial banks, and other credit and financial  institutions, the banks are ensuring on the whole the normal  operation of the economy during the most complicated period of  transition from a totalitarian to a market economy, all the  current difficulties notwithstanding. This is what V.V.  Muzhitskikh, chairman of the board of the Elektrobank Commercial  Bank and the author of this article offered to you, believes.  However, in his opinion, many problems affecting the banking  sector not only remain unsolved but are even being  aggravated.    Legislation is the first problem. The debate over to whom  the  Central Bank is subordinated goes on. We need stability in the  interests of the strength of our credit and monetary system, the  reliability of commercial banks, the exchange rate, and the  general prestige of the country. The replacement of Central Bank  chiefs, which is easy and poorly substantiated, as we have seen  on occasion, cannot be allowed to occur. Within the framework of  strict legislation, the Central Bank should have the power to be  able, if necessary, to oppose both government structures and  local organs in defending the interests of strengthening the  ruble and the entire credit and monetary system, all the more so  because in keeping with the new constitution, expansion of the  rights of local government organs is envisioned. Naturally,  under the new conditions we need such a Central Bank and such  laws as will ensure normal balanced development of our monetary  and credit system and at the same time strengthen the role of  commercial banks. Significant success will not be achieved in  the absence of this.    I do not maintain that the Central Bank is free of flaws.  However, on the other hand, I am convinced that this organ  should have a special status which should be codified in  legislation. The argument over to whom the Central Bank should  be subordinated--the president, the government, the parliament,  or the Ministry of Finance--is superfluous. Foreign experience  indicates that the state of affairs in the economy is far better  in countries in which the Central Bank acts as an independent  state structure, as compared to countries where the bank plays a  secondary role, being subordinated and resubordinated to various  government structures.    As far as commercial banks are concerned, a number of  legislative acts have been developed which envision reinforcing  their role. The adoption of these laws was delayed by events  everybody is aware of. We have 1,800 commercial banks, for each  of which there are two branches on the average. In essence, most  of them cannot be considered banks at all. Only some banks--the  Mosbiznesbank and certain other banks--have weighty grounds to  operate on an equal footing with foreign banks both at home and  abroad. Meanwhile, the good performance of a bank does not  necessarily hinge on the size of its capital. All kinds of banks  are needed, large and small alike; they complement one another  and form a unified banking system serving the Russian economy.    Much has been said and written in our country about  improvements in the operation of commercial  banks--computerization, credit cards, and so on. All this is  fine; however, a completely different qualitative standard for  operation of the banking system is needed. Settlements are the  most pressing problem. No matter how much the Central Bank and  commercial banks are criticized in this area, the settlement  situation will not change until the state of affairs in the  economy improves. If an enterprise is insolvent, what has this  got to do with the bank, even if the latter delays documents for  collection?    The state sector of the economy is suffering the greatest  economic losses. To this day its monopoly position virtually has  not changed; production outlays have not been reduced. State  enterprises have long been insolvent. However, taking advantage  of their monopoly position, they have continued to demand still  new credit. Our bank services the largest enterprises of the  fuel and energy complex. These enterprises are still convinced  that they will receive funds from the budget to cover their  losses because of their monopoly standing. Getting funds from  the budget means getting them from me and you. A tribute of  1,000 rubles [R] has been exacted from each resident of Russia  in order to cover the losses of the enterprises of the energy  complex. We have already come to the decision to stop financing  the hopelessly unprofitable enterprises which are being  sustained by banks. For this reason, commercial banks are forced  to sharply reduce the issuance of credit: they have no right to  risk their clients' funds.    When they talk about a debt of R16 trillion, they think for  some reason that this situation is advantageous for commercial  banks, forgetting in the process that a slowdown in the turnover  of funds unavoidably brings about excessive outlays for the  banks, and that the issue of settlements may only be resolved  through the joint effort of the government, the Central Bank,  commercial banks, and enterprises. Anyone who thinks that the  commercial banks alone and the Central Bank can solve everything  is in grave error. The enterprises themselves and the entire  economy should be restructured.    Each group of commercial banks strives to create its own  computer system, without which it is no longer possible to  operate. Special satellite communications systems are being  designed, but at present there is no money in the country to  create a global communications system. Nonetheless, it is unwise  to disperse funds by creating local and regional systems. We  should pool efforts in this area and gradually create a unified  communications and information system similar to SWIFT [Society  for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication] out of  regional systems.    Providing escorts to clients abroad is the next issue. If we  look at foreign experience, all the banks provide escorts for  their clients in virtually all countries of the world. This is a  quite expensive endeavor calling for relevant cadres and the  knowledge of legislation. Practice has indicated that this task  will not be accomplished without training specialists abroad.  There are opportunities for that. The government of Switzerland  has a program for retraining our specialists so that they will  later work in our representative offices abroad. The cost of  training one specialist comes to $700 a year. This is a feasible  sum, and we should coordinate efforts to this end and determine  the need for specialists and a schedule for training them.    Our country lacks a primary center for cadre training and  retraining. In conjunction with this I would like to say that  our bank has suitable parcels of land, and we could join  together with other banks to establish such a primary center.  The Association of Russian Banks could offer assistance in this  endeavor. We should be aware that at present we are still  getting by with cadres who were trained in the environment of a  centralized economy. Training new cadres of bank employees is  our most important common task. Nobody will accomplish it for us.    The issue of investment is one of the greatest problems. If  we exist for another year or two within the same arrangement as  at present, an overwhelming number of enterprises which ensure  the maintenance of the economy at a certain level will shut down  because of the wear on fixed assets. Equipment has been 70-80  percent depreciated in the fuel and energy sector and in  metallurgy. The enterprises are in danger of shutting down. Some  attach their hopes to banks. However, even if we scrape up all  the monies, including statutory capital, this will be nothing  compared to what is needed. Where are resources to be obtained?  They are available in the country. Many different off-budget  investment funds have emerged in Russia. They are disbursed  haphazardly; funds are transferred from one region to another,  and frequently disappear and get dispersed there. They should be  concentrated for investment in the fuel and energy complex, a  base industry which ensures the viability of the entire economy.  Otherwise, we will be threatened with a reduction in electricity  generation and a new increase in rates for it.    We cannot agree with the existing system for the  distribution  of investment. The government commission for substantiating the  requests of ministries and departments prepares a decision for  the Ministry of Finance. In the process, everybody gets as much  as he can grab. It is not economic effectiveness or the speed  and security of repayment of credit that are the main arguments  but rather the fact that construction has begun. The supporters  of this procedure refer to the fact that the collective and the  equipment are idle, that funds have already been invested in the  construction project, and so on. Meanwhile, there is little  accounting for whether it is necessary to complete all  construction projects under the current conditions and what the  returns from the newly built enterprise will be. Under such  conditions, the banks are put at an impasse. Who will pay back  their credit? Each new appropriation is processed as a one-time  act, while the construction project drags on for several years.  We usually say: We will still give you money this year, and we  will see about later. Recently the chairman of the State  Construction Committee reported that one-third of the facilities  had to be shut down. So, why were they financed in 1992, and who  will pay back the credit now? The economy indeed needs many of  these facilities, but banks cannot invest their resources in  this manner.    It is necessary to revisit the issue of creating a  specialized group of bank-government agents under the Ministry  of Finance. They exist in a number of countries and have  acquitted themselves well. However, this does not amount to the  creation of a parallel government system for the management of  state property. Bank-government agents should evaluate locally  the effectiveness of investment and opportunities for its quick  recovery, rather than be mere transshipment points: We have  issued you centralized credit, you clean up the mess yourselves.  Nothing like this exists anywhere in the world.    The banks under the Ministry of Finance should ensure the  safety of investment and study its effectiveness. They should  possess a powerful expert and auditor staff. We cannot allow  money to be committed to construction projects without an  analysis of the effectiveness of its spending and opportunities  for recoupment anymore.    Here is one more problem associated with investment:  guarantees to foreign capital which could be used as a  supplemental investment resource. It is feasible to create a  banking company to this end. One such company has already been  established. It is a very large structure compared to our banks.  Its combined capital assets come to R240 billion. Such a company  may finance a number of large projects and extend credit to them  in many regions of the country on its own, without using the  resources of the Central Bank. Banks belonging to the company  remain independent and are not subordinated to the government or  other structures. In addition to banks, two of the largest  state-industrial corporations belong to this company. At  present, the company is being registered by the Central Bank.  When this process is completed successfully, we will obtain one  of the most important structures which, on the one hand, will be  able to independently issue guarantees to foreign banks, while  on the other hand it will conduct negotiations on behalf of the  banks belonging to it about attracting investment to our  country. Besides, unlike the previous practices whereby  guarantees to foreign investors were issued only by the state  banks and the government, the new company will be able to also  give such guarantees in cases in which it is approached by banks  that do not belong to it.    In the process, we should not hope to obtain significant  credit resources in the West. The process of renewal of fixed  assets has begun there, and they need money themselves. We have  sufficient resources ourselves, but they should be raised and  pooled, which only the companies are in a position to do. We  will not secure major success without creating such companies  and using budgetary appropriations correctly, on the basis of  repayment.    A report surfaced in the press to the effect that a decree  on  commercialization of commercial banks has been prepared. Upon  familiarization with this document it came out that at issue was  the transfer to the State Committee on Administration of State  Property of all the capital of former state enterprises with all  the dividends, and the buildings and structures which the banks  are now leasing. This amounts to R40 trillion in current terms.  If this decision is made, we will all end up as Mr. Chubays's  property. This decision was prepared without the participation  of the Central Bank, which once again indicates the government's  lack of appreciation for it. So far, we have succeeded in  stopping the document, and we are trying to have it amended.  Nonetheless, our representatives are still not participating in  working on it. How can such an important issue of the national  economy be resolved without the banks? It turns out that  everybody has converted to joint-stock operations and has  undergone a voucher process, but the banks have been forgotten.  Now they have suddenly remembered the banks, and want to make  the State Committee on Administration of State Property the  owner of all banks.    What will this bring about? When the capital of banks is  bought out with vouchers or in some other manner, the statutory  capital of the banks will be softened. A tremendous number of  shareholders will come along. Our bank made such an assessment,  and it resulted in 103,000 shareholders with registered shares.  Our computer took three days to process this data base. Now  imagine settlements on contributions, and so forth. In turn,  there are almost 1,800 commercial banks! Why was everything  reduced to registered stock? After all, there is the tax  service, which should control profits from stocks. Besides,  mandatory registered stock restricts the circulation of the  shares on the stock exchange. While the banking system has still  accomplished something under market conditions, the decision in  question will set it far back. In this situation, a clear-cut  law is needed, rather than rushing back and forth. I think that  in all this we could be helped by a unified national association  and individual banking associations created on the regional  principle, as they now are. The national association could  represent us before the Central Bank, the government, and the  Federal Assembly and ensure more effective decisions which would  indeed take the interests of bankers into account.</p>

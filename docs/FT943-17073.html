			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / 'State takeover' of Venezuelan banks The Venezuelan cabinet has approved a decree which effectively gives the government full, direct control over the country's troubled banking system. This is the most recent measure taken by the five-month-old government of President Rafael Caldera to confront a crisis in the financial system first made public last January, when the country's second-largest bank, Banco Latino, failed. Earlier this month, the government closed down eight financial institutions that had been kept afloat by official financial assistance. The decree calls for the establishment of an Emergency Financial Board with the power to order banks and other financial institutions to take any measures deemed necessary, remove and replace directors and executives, suspend an institution's licence to operate, and take over any or all of the company's shares in the name of the government. Among its powers, the board can order a healthy bank to 'recycle' its deposits to banks that are in trouble. One local banker, who asked not to be identified, warned: 'If this is not handled intelligently, it could mean the end of Venezuela's financial system.' The panel, chaired by the minister of finance, includes the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, the president of the Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund (Fogade), and the Superintendent of Banks. Earlier this week Mr Julio Sosa, the minister of finance, said: 'I hope it will not be necessary to nationalise Venezuela's banks, but this cannot be dismissed. Everything depends on the financial system's performance.' However, as he announced the new decree on Wednesday night, Mr Guillermo Alvares Bajares, minister of information, said, 'In fact, we can call it a state takeover.' At the same time, the finance minister asked the presidents of some of the country's largest banks to reduce their interest rates on loans by 15 percentage points as part of the government's anti-inflation programme. Rates on 30-day commercial loans are now at an annual 66-67 per cent, while rates on passbook savings and longer term-deposits range from 10 to 56 per cent. On Wednesday, the cabinet also approved a decree ordering the payment of a special bonus of Dollars 30 (Pounds 19.70) a month (equivalent) to workers earning up to Dollars 225 per month. This means that both the government and private companies will be in effect obliged to provide a big wage rise to most employees starting on July 1.</p>

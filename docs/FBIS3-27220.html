President of the academy Mr. Hu Sheng revealed this news at  a  work meeting for 1994 held here today. He added that it was a  necessity for such a system to be set up. Mr. Hu noted that the  establishment of the academician system was considered an  important measure for upgrading the prestige and status of the  academy in international academic circles, enhancing the  influence of the academy in these circles and helping realize  the developmental strategy of the academy.    At the annual meeting, the academy confirmed clearly its  goal  for further development which involves the building of the  academy into a national research centre on philosophy and the  social sciences of a high level and of great vigor with the  eventual aim of serving reform and opening to the outside world  as well as material and spiritual civilization.    The academy has taken a number of measures for this end  including the introduction of excellent scholars from outside  the academy and from abroad for the undertaking of research.  Mr. Hu said that this was aimed at attracting top-rate  researchers in order to make the academy a real research centre  for the social sciences and the humanities.    The social science sector in China has given a strong  positive response to the establishment of the system and see it  as an urgent need. The creation of such a system, however,  involves many social science personnel coming from local  branches of the academy as well from other government organs,  the military force, higher learning institutions and party  schools at various levels. It poses certain difficulties in its  setting up, but with the creation and improvement of a system of  this kind in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is inevitable  for the social sciences academy to follow suit.</p>

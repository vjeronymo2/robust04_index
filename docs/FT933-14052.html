			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UN holds out hope for Iraqi weapons backdown A SENIOR United Nations diplomat, holding out the prospect of lifting crippling economic sanctions against Iraq if it accepts long-term monitoring of its weapons programmes, arrived in Baghdad yesterday for talks with Iraqi officials. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is expected to spend four days in Baghdad trying to resolve the stand-off between UN weapons inspectors and Iraqi officials over the installation of monitoring cameras at two missile test sites. Two teams of UN inspectors have failed to persuade Iraq to mount cameras at the site, or seal monitoring equipment there as an interim measure. Failure to defuse the crisis would reopen the possibility of a UN-backed military strike against the sites - a threat which has been raised particularly by the US administration over the past week. But Mr Ekeus' visit comes amid signs that Iraq is increasingly anxious to win whatever easing it can of economic sanctions which have prevented Iraqi export sales, particularly of oil, for almost four years. Mr Ekeus and fellow diplomats at the UN believe Iraq's pressing economic needs could force authorities in Baghdad to back down in the present confrontation. 'The major carrot (for Iraqi compliance) is the ongoing sanctions and the oil embargo,' Mr Ekeus said before arriving in Baghdad. Parallel talks in New York between Iraqi Oil Ministry officials and UN legal experts on a special six-month sale of oil worth Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) were suspended on Wednesday as Iraqi officials considered a possible draft agreement on the sale. Confidentiality surrounding the market-sensitive talks have made it difficult to assess their success, but UN diplomats said yesterday there were indications an agreement might be close. About 60 per cent of the revenues from the oil sale, which would add about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the market, would be set aside for food and medicines in Iraq, to be distributed and monitored by the UN. The remainder would go towards paying for UN activities in Iraq. But the scale of Iraq's economic problems was underlined by a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation report, pointedly quoted in the official Observer newspaper in Iraq, which warned of a 'grave human tragedy' unless food supplies were augmented. The report said Iraq needed to import 5.4m tonnes of food before July next year at an estimated cost of Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Ekeus emphasised before leaving for Iraq that he would also be discussing more broadly the principle of long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programmes, called for under UN Resolution 715. 'We will try to address some more important issues this time that I hope should clarify some points which are creating problems for us,' he said later in Baghdad. His first meeting last night was to be with Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Iraq's foreign minister. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil prices dropped to a three-year low in London and New York as traders fear the resumption of even limited Iraqi oil exports could add to the surplus on world markets, leading to a collapse in prices. The price for North Sea Brent crude oil in London slipped another 30 cents yesterday to Dollars 16.45 a barrel. Oil prices, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NAACP VOWS ACTION AGAINST WILSON ON VOTE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles branch of the NAACP is gearing up to ensure that Sen. Pete  Wilson is "held accountable" in the upcoming gubernatorial election for his  role in sustaining President Bush's veto this week of a major civil rights  bill, the branch president said Thursday.  </P> <P> Joseph Duff, president of the National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People branch, would not say exactly what actions the group would take  against Wilson, the GOP candidate, but vowed that the NAACP and its supporters  statewide will "make it clear to voters he is against civil rights."  </P> <P> Duff said details of the strategy against Wilson, Duff said, will be formulated  this weekend in Riverside at a previously planned meeting of NAACP officials  from California.  </P> <P> Other local activists, including an officer of the Los Angeles chapter of  National Organization for Women, said they are urging their supporters to  deluge the president and Congress with letters, telegrams and phone calls  protesting the actions of the president and the U.S. Senate, which Wednesday  that failed to override Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Bill of 1990.  </P> <P> Bush said he vetoed the measure, which would have reversed or altered six  recent Supreme Court decisions, because he felt it would have led to hiring  quotas for women, African Americans and other ethnic groups that have  traditionally been the victims of employment discrimination. Supporters of the  bill have assailed that position as dishonest.  </P> <P> The Senate Wednesday upheld the veto, falling a single vote short of the  two-thirds majority needed to override.  </P> <P> Supporters of the bill, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne  Feinstein, are criticizing Wilson for upholding the veto, with Feinstein  charging that he cast "the deciding vote against this historic measure."  </P> <P> James Lee, a Los Angeles-based spokesman for Wilson's campaign, said Wilson  "did not vote to uphold the veto of a civil rights bill. He voted to uphold the  veto of a quotas bill."  </P> <P> Latino activists said they are planning a series of meetings on how to deal  with elected officials when a revived version of the civil rights measure is  introduced in Congress, some hope as early as next year. A day before the  Senate override vote, a coalition of Latinos held a news conference in Los  Angeles at which they denounced Wilson for not supporting the bill.  </P> <P> Alicia Maldonado of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  (MALDEF) said Wilson "could have been the key vote" in overriding the  presidential veto.  </P> <P> Mark Ridley-Thomas, director of the local branch of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, said Wilson has sent "a very clear message" to women and  members of ethnic groups. "We ought to respond to it accordingly and cause him  to live with the consequences in ways that he will never forget."  </P> <P> Lee, asserting that Wilson's record on civil rights is unassailable, said the  wrath now directed against him in the governor's race is no more than "partisan  politics."  </P></p>

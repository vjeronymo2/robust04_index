			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANCY REAGAN'S CRITICS TAKE TURNS  </P> <P> After California's recent tragic disaster, it was just the right tonic to lift  the spirits of the masses, a portrait of Nancy, and to know that after hundreds  of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising she continues to live the  life of luxury. Missing from her book are the 100-plus of Ronnie's appointees  who were looting the government while the Reagans stood and watched.  </P> <P> RUSS JACOB  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Brian Milne, despite being diagnosed as having cancer two months ago, won the  Pennsylvania small school discus championship at the state high school meet in  Shippensburg, Pa.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old Milne learned he had Hodgkin's disease -- cancerous enlargement  of the spleen and lymph nodes -- during a routine examination in March.  </P> <P> He had complained of stiffness in his back while weight lifting.  </P> <P> Milne, who had surgery to cut a cancerous growth off his heart only six weeks  ago, threw the discus 178 feet 2 inches.  </P> <P> On Friday, Milne will have his spleen removed in an operation that will  determine if the cancer has spread and if chemotherapy or additional surgery is  required. The operation also may determine if he can play football in the fall.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Milne rushed for 2,419 yards and scored 31 touchdowns  for his school, Fort LeBoeuf, last season, and was expected to be heavily  recruited.  </P></p>

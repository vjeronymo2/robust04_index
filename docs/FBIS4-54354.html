			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Ten opposition members in  the Diet met Thursday [26 May] in an effort to form an  interparty political group in early June aimed at establishing a  liberal government.    Among the 10 legislators were Katsuhiko Shirakawa, a House  of  Representatives member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  the biggest opposition party, and Seiichi Kaneta, also a lower  house member of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ], the No. 2 opposition group.    The participants said they expect the new group to help  establish a liberal government. They criticized the ruling  coalition for practicing "totalitarian, high-handed way of  management."    Meanwhile, the ruling coalition said they have agreed to  allow two SDPJ members and two former members of the Japan New  Party (JNP) to take part in its policy forum teams. The JNP led  by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is one of the ruling  parties.    The four are Masanori Goto and Churyo Morii both of the  SDPJ,  and Seiji Maehara and Yukio Edano, who bolted from the JNP.    They will join in the capacity of individuals, coalition  officials said.</p>

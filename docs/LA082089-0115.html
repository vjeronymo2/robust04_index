			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VARIETIES OF FLIGHT;  </P> <P> WITHIN THE RIBBONS BY FRANK MANLEY (NORTH POINT PRESS: $16.95; 256 PP.;  0-86547-379-X)  </P> <P> Frank Manley, a professor of English at Emory University and the recipient of  two Guggenheim fellowships, creates a remarkable world in this fine collection  of short stories. All of his characters share a common denominator: They  inhabit and are inhibited by worlds from which they try desperately to flee.  </P> <P> Manley takes us into small spaces, indwelling and claustrophobic, where events  spin out of control in a matter of seconds. In "Within the Ribbons," the title  story, Daisy Feed, who had spent her life caring for her recently deceased  mother, confesses to her friend that she has never been to a wedding. Her  friend, Amelia Thorlew, a study of easy alarm and good intentions, replies, "I  go to a wedding once a year. Sometimes twice. And sometimes it just comes in  bunches. I don't even get back home and take my bicarbonate of soda sometimes  when here comes another and I got to get sick all over again."  </P> <P> So Daisy accompanies Amelia to the next wedding and Manley, in detailing the  surreal aspects of the event, draws us into Daisy's inner core.  </P> <P> She gets to sit within the ribbons -- the church pews reserved for family  members -- but spiritually and physically, she remains on the periphery,  longing to connect. Yet when the bride tosses the bouquet, she steps back. "  'Why didn't you get it?' Amelia asked, trying to kick it with her foot. The  bridesmaids were still screaming and scrabbling. 'You could have got it. She  aimed it at you.'  </P> <P> " 'I didn't want it,' Daisy Feed said. 'I wouldn't know what to do with it.' "  </P> <P> The wedding is a rich, vulgar and graceless affair that Manley describes in  trenchant language: " 'Wait a minute.' The young men rushed up. 'Look here,'  one of them said. He held out a plate of shrimp.' "  </P> <P> "How do you eat it?"  </P> <P> "With a fork."  </P> <P> "There aren't any."  </P> <P> "Daisy Feed looked at the plate, then at the table. There was nothing to eat  the shrimp with. 'I don't know,' Daisy Feed said.  </P> <P> " 'That's what I mean,' the young man said.' 'They got it fixed where you can't  eat it.'  </P> <P> " 'Hey, try a toothpick,' one said.  </P> <P> " 'Look how I do,' the other one said, and he opened one of the sandwiches and  with a piece of bread dug at the pile of shrimp on his plate as though he was  mopping it up with a towel. Then he thrust it in his mouth. Most of it got in.  The rest rolled down the front of his suit onto the floor. 'Goddamn,' one said.  'Son of a bitch,' said the other. They both stopped to clean it up, and Daisy  Feed left."  </P> <P> Amid this confusion, Daisy glimpses an ephemeral figure, more shadow than man,  who slips in and out of her line of vision. At first, she imagines he is a  thief, then she realizes that she alone sees him and she alone knows that his  presence portends fulfillment and disaster of horrifying proportions.  </P> <P> In "A Joy Forever," the characters are finely drawn against a background richly  detailed to illuminate the dynamics of small town corruption and the casual  cruelty hidden behind a curtain of soft Southern gentility.  </P> <P> Mattie Chadwick, a spinster buoyed by a new interpretation of Scripture, is  moved to fight the powers who have closed a rural road, a road to the past that  must remain open. "That road goes back to the beginning of time . . . I go down  there, and the rocks are the same, and the trees are the same, and the river,  it's still the same and it's like I step back. It's important to me. I can't  live just here. Living here without that road opens like plants living without  their roots. They shrivel up and die in a day."  </P> <P> Manley pulls us along, almost submerging us in a subterranean current of  sexuality as Mattie tries to enlist the help of her neighbors -- the  pistol-packing Widow Grizzle and her three daughters. Her quixotic crusade is  nearly sidetracked by the women's intense preoccupation with the thought and  threat of rape; their obsessive attempts to define and describe, within the  limits of their experience, aggravated sodomy.  </P> <P> Mattie then describes her encounter with the commissioner of roads: "It's like  he was violating me. One time they robbed me when I wasn't there. My momma and  daddy just died the year before, and I was out down at the river. It was still  light, and I got back just before supper, and the door was standing open. It  was the fall, and it was cold. When I saw it open, I knew something was wrong,  and I crept up and looked in the windows. It's like somebody lifted my skirt.  'Oh, God,' Althie said. She clutched her hands.  </P> <P> Mattie continues: " . . . and it was like they did something to me -- lifted my  skirt and did what they do, and I couldn't stop them. That's how I feel about  that road -- if I let them, that's what they'd do."  </P> <P> Mattie lets the commissioner know that she intends to fight. To the threat  implicit in his response, she replies, "That's why I'm doing it, Benny. I don't  care if I die, anyway. I figure I'm a joy forever."  </P> <P> There are several battles being waged on different fronts. For Mrs. Grizzle,  the road is a path to the past that should remain closed. "All that talk about  opening the road and going back there where you were a child and all that talk  about old lives. That got her (one of her daughters) stirred up and thinking  about things she wished she hadn't. Let sleeping dogs lie. Better just forget  about some things. We do what we can. That's all we know how to. And sometimes  our children forgive us, and sometimes they don't."  </P> <P> But the conversation rolls out of control, assuming a power of its own,  plumbing the well of memory until finally the image of Reverend Grizzle,  reeking of incest cloaked in religious ritual, is brought to life, forcing an  act of personal absolution that is at once pathetic and bizarre.  </P> <P> The urge to escape spirals to comic dimensions in "The Call of Nature." Dortis  Mulkey, a young thief who specializes in stealing anything on wheels (go-carts,  dune buggies, tractors, bulldozers, etc.) swipes a car parked in a shopping  center. He takes off. No particular destination.  </P> <P> In his haste, he neglects to check the back seat and like most thieves who get  tripped up by minor details, he finds that he has taken a dotty and feisty old  woman along for the ride. The dialogue here is wonderful and vivid. Dortis  discovers that the woman, Lucille Arp, wants to get away also. She wants to get  back to Unadilla, Ga. Back to where she once knew what it was to be happy and  also to fulfill her life-long ambition to become a reader/adviser. She  envisions Dortis as a gift sent from heaven and insists that he drive her.  Dortis, recovering from the shock, "was listening to the tires. The tires were  saying, 'Unadilla-kiss-my -- Unadilla-kiss-my -- .' "  </P> <P> He develops a plan: Take the car to the nearest car wash and there, abandon the  old lady. "Dortis Mulkey started to slow down. 'Why are we stopping?'  </P> <P> " 'This's the car wash.' Dortis Mulkey said. It was at the rear of a filling  station, a long tunnel with red and white brushes. 'Time to get out,' Dortis  Mulkey said, executing the plan perfectly. He reached back and freed the door.  'I ain't leaving,' Lucille Arp said, pushing back in the imitation velvet  upholstery. It was gray. It reminded her of the sides of a coffin she had seen  in the funeral home at Unadilla . . . no telling what was underneath it. 'I'll  wait here till you get done. . . . Thank God you came. You're going to drive me  to Unadilla.'  </P> <P> " 'As soon as you get out of the car so we can get it washed, I am.' Dortis  Mulkey got out of the car and opened the back door. Lucille Arp screamed as  though cleaved in the middle. Dortis Mulkey leaped back in and drove through  the car wash, triggering the wash mechanism. It was still churning and  squirting behind them as they broke into the sunlight and fishtailed around the  side of the service station onto the highway. 'That's better,' Lucille Arp  said. 'What you say your name was?' The question evokes painful memories for  Dortis: of abandonment and ridicule which he had tried all his young life to  outrun.  </P> <P> " 'Pull over here.' She pointed with an arm that looked like a stick with a  dead bird nailed to the end of it. 'What for?' 'The call of nature.' Oh God,  Dortis Mulkey thought. He imagined Lucille Arp stepping out of the car and  calling and nature responding -- stars sweeping out of the sky as in the Book  of Revelations, figuring forth the promised upheavals and cataclysms of the  last days."  </P> <P> Lucille tries to convince Dortis that she has the gift, describing how she had  helped the high school girls' basketball team win the state championship two  years in a row by rounding up every cross-eyed girl in town and convincing the  coach to train them. "Natural-born basketball players. Look here and shoot  there. Couldn't figure out which way they were going. That's how signs are.  Look one way and go the other. Took me to tell them or else they'd still be a  bunch of ugly girls instead of a state championship team bringing back glory."  </P> <P> Dortis Mulkey is by turns, fascinated and repelled. He reveals his dream of  becoming a professional stock car racer, then his heart hardens again and he  succeeds in abandoning Lucille at the entrance of a Pizza Heaven. But only  temporarily. When he returns to fetch her, his encounter with the leathery  waitress triggers some of the funniest dialogue in the collection.  </P> <P> Conversation with Lucille Arp widens Dortis Mulkey's sense of the possible. He  envisions something vast, a life beyond Unadilla, beyond Macon, miles from the  mother who walked out because she was too tired to care for him. Lucille and  Dortis are now convinced that a new beginning awaits them in Florida. "Disney  World where you can park your car at one of the dwarfs -- Sleepy or Sneezy" but  the more they struggle, the tighter the net becomes.  </P> <P> The tone of these stories vary from surreal to sad to sensual to sometimes  wildly funny and the characters are, by turns, murderous, lecherous, righteous,  and sometimes childishly simple. The thread drawn through all of this is the  crying need to escape.  </P> <P> Manley, in addition to the Guggenheim fellowships, has won several awards for  poetry and deservedly so. He has a fine eye for detail and a sharp ear for  dialogue. He has created people trapped in the skin of old lives; mired in the  indescribable misery of failed marriages, and we watch as they seek deliverance  by unlikely routes. They engage in bruising battles with unpeaceful memories  that gnaw at the core of the self. They cannot outmaneuver them, yet they  cannot quite come to terms so they keep trying in ways that make these stories,  rich in the nuance of Southern experience, memorable indeed.  </P></p>

This was a  statement made by People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Holovatyy at  a news conference held in Kiev. [passage omitted]    [Begin Holovatyy recording] My opinion is that officials  from  Ukraine's leadership circles have falsified the Ukrainian  Supreme Council's resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the  START I Treaty]. These actions fall within those provided by the  Criminal Code of Ukraine with regard to the crime under the name  of falsification when in civil service.    The matter here is this. The initial version of Paragraph 2  of the draft of this resolution submitted by the Ukrainian  president, was as follows: The Government of Ukraine will be  instructed to exchange the ratification certificates relating to  the START Treaty.    During the discussion of this paragraph, I put forward an  amendment, the essence of which was as follows: The sentence in  the president's draft is to be augmented as follows: And to  this end the government will step up its activity to conclude  specific international agreements that follow from the  reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the  ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution in question  now is the original one of 18 November 1993].    The second paragraph of the resolution, with my amendment in  it, was put to the vote and adopted.    However, the official text of the Supreme Council's  resolution, printed in government newspapers, offers a different  version. It reads as follows: The Government of Ukraine will  be instructed to exchange the certificates on the ratification  of the START Treaty and will step up its activity to conclude  specific international agreements that follow from the  reservations in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution on  the ratification of the START I Treaty.    The words -- to this end -- have been excluded from my  amendment. I regard this as a correction that has essentially  altered the text of the decision, rather than linguistically  correcting or editing it. This is because the three words -- to  this end -- and the sentence, or the decision, in Paragraph 2  with these three words, envisage that the sequence of the  government's actions relating to the START I will be as follows:  First, concluding international agreements that follow from the  resolution of 18 November [1993] -- when putting forward this  amendment, in particular, I primarily had in mind security  guarantees -- and then exchanging the ratification certificates.    The falsified text lacks this sequence. The conjunction --  and -- enabled the government to make a statement that Ukraine  had lifted all reservations concerning the START I Treaty and,  accordingly, security guarantees. So, I cannot interpret the  lack of correspondence between the text of the shorthand record  and the text of the official document published in the press, as  anything other than a crime when in public service.

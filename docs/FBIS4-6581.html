			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Papers Rap at Anti-Chongnyon Rowdyism" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- More than 70 gangsters  belonging to an ultra-rightist organization of Japan, "the Kanto  Council of the Great Japan Patriots Union" kicked up a row in  Tokyo on April 19, shouting "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and  "North Korea, promptly stop nuclear threat to Japan."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this was an  organised and premeditated provocative act perpetrated under the  backstage manipulation of the Japanese authorities for a  sinister political purpose.    The analyst says:    This rowdyism staged in Japan in broad daylight was also a  product of the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy toward the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their moves against  the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon.)    Drawing attention to the fact that the incident occurred at  a  time when the United States was intensifying its aggressive and  belligerent moves on the Korean peninsula and shortly after the  traitor Kim Yong-sam toured Japan, the analyst continues:    Chongnyon is an authoritative and dignified organization of  overseas citizens of the DPRK. We will decisively cope with the  attack on Chongnyon and its subsidiary organizations and  Japan-resident Koreans, regarding it as an attack on the DPRK.    The Japanese authorities boasting of Japan being "a  constitutional state" took no step to check the incident that  occurred in the city center of Tokyo.    They must now make a thoroughgoing investigation into the  incident, apologize for it, arrest and punish all the criminals  responsible for the provocation, make clear the truth behind the  incident and take responsible steps to prevent the reccurence of  such incidents.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says:    If an unhappy thing occurred due to the sinister acts of the  reactionary forces against Chongnyon and its branch organs, we  will regard it as a provocation against the DPRK and call the  Japanese authorities to account for it.</p>

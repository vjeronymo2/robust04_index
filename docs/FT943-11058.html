			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Qatar in French jet deal Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday flew to Qatar to seal an unusual triangular deal involving the Gulf state buying a dozen Mirage 2000-5 jets from France and selling the same number of the older-generation, French-made Mirage F1 fighters to Spain. Dassault, which makes the Mirages, said yesterday it was awaiting an official communique from the French and Qatari governments before commenting. But according to French press and diplomatic reports in Qatar, the deal would meet Qatar's desire to update its air force with Mirage 2000-5s, in service with the French air force but so far only ordered by Taiwan, and Spain's need for a stop-gap reinforcement of its air force, which is awaiting delivery of the long-delayed Eurofighter. Spain remains a member of the four-nation Eurofighter programme, delayed by German hesitations and financial problems, but in the interim wants to increase the number of its front-line fighters. Spurning a US offer of F-16 fighters, Madrid has decided to add to the 50 Mirage F-1s it already possesses by taking a dozen second-hand ones from Qatar and paying for five more direct from France by giving Paris a couple of CN-235 transport aircraft. Newspaper reports said Spain would pay some Dollars 130m for the old aircraft. The sale of new Mirages to Qatar and second-hand ones to Spain will provide a welcome boost to the French arms industry, which last year saw its exports fall 32.5 per cent in value, after the 20 per cent increase posted in 1992, thanks to Taiwan's order of 60 Mirage 2000-5s. In addition to Dassault, Thomson and Sagem are expected to win the contract to fit new avionic equipment in the Mirage F-1s for Spain. The Matra defence arm of the Lagardere group yesterday announced that it had won a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) contract to equip the Mirages with Mica and Magic missiles for Qatar.</p>

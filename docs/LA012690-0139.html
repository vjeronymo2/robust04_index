			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHINTZIUS QUITS TEAM AT FLORIDA  </P> <P> Dwayne Schintzius, Florida's leading scorer and rebounder until his suspension  Jan. 15, said Thursday he is leaving the team because he doesn't want to "sail  under the authority of Captain Ahab."  </P> <P> The comment was an apparent reference to Coach Don DeVoe, who replaced Norm  Sloan before the season.  </P> <P> Schintzius and teammate Tim Turner had been suspended for their role in a fight  at an off-campus fraternity.  </P> <P> DeVoe said he invited Schintzius, a senior, back on the team Wednesday as long  as Schintzius obeyed team policies.  </P> <P> "No one can argue that Coach Sloan and (departed assistant coach Monte) Towe  were easy to play for, and to them you had to accept the coach as the absolute  authority," Schintzius said in a written statement. "But that does not mean you  must sail under the authority of Captain Ahab. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU steel plan postponed The European Commission yesterday postponed a decision on whether to approve a revised rescue plan for the steel industry. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, asked for a week's delay in order to review the treatment of Ecu415m (Pounds 319.5m) Italian state aid in exchange for closure of steel-making capacity in Brescia, northern Italy. The Italian closures are crucial for reaching the target of cutting EU capacity by 19m tonnes, with the Brescia mini-mills contributing 5m-6m tonnes. But the complex cross-ownership of the mills means not all companies linked to steel-making would shut down. This raises legal problems about state aid being used to fund 'partial closures'. Mr Bangemann is pressing for a more flexible interpretation of rules on steel aid which would focus on capacity cuts rather than ownership, overturning a Commission decision in favour of a rigorous application of the rules. Mr Bangemann signalled yesterday he was unhappy with a compromise which would have opened infringement proceedings against the Italians for illegal subsidies, while pressing Rome to come up with a new package of state aid to the Brescia mills. But Brussels officials remain hopeful of agreement next week.</p>

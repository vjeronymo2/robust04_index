			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, EPA's interpretation is supported by the legislative history of title II's enforcement provisions. As reported out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, sections 211(d)(1) and 205(c) of the Act authorized administrative assessment of civil penalties of no more than ``$25,000 per day of violation.'' <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In describing this authority, the Committee Report states that ``[t]his section of the bill changes the section 211(d) penalty amount *&blank;*&blank;* to a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of violation. This penalty amount applies to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> each day for each violation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' (emphasis supplied) <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  This shows that when Congress used the term ``per day of violation'' in amending section 113 it had no intention of barring an EPA interpretation that such term meant ``per day for each violation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> S.

This is important, among other things, given the decentralized nature of this program and the authority to issue citations in the field. One option considered was issuance of internal Agency guidance on this point. As discussed in section D of this notice, EPA does intend to issue guidance on a wide variety of matters related to this program, and an important component of this will include guidance on when to issue a citation and when to employ other enforcement tools open to the Agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also considered and is proposing establishing a maximum cumulative dollar amount that may be assessed in an individual citation. This would have the advantage of providing an objective indication in the regulations themselves that a more serious compliance problem exists and other, more stringent enforcement mechanisms would generally be more appropriate. This maximum penalty amount could be reached by, for example, a combination of many violations (whether occurring on the same or separate days), with low amounts per violation, or a smaller number of violations combined with larger penalty amounts per violation. Either of these circumstances would serve to indicate that a stronger enforcement approach may well be appropriate. While such a cap could be included in internal Agency guidance, a regulatory cap will provide greater structure for this program, at least initially. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a variation on the above, EPA considered establishing a maximum number of violations that could be included in an individual citation. This option, however, might preclude issuance of a field citation where the number of violations exceeded the maximum, even if the violations were all very minor and would receive a low penalty assessment. For this reason EPA is not currently proposing this form of a cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that the maximum cumulative penalty in an individual citation not exceed a dollar amount in the range of $15,000 to $25,000. EPA invites comment on this range, and whether such a dollar cap should be in the regulations or in Agency guidance. EPA is also considering and invites comment on whether the penalty cap should ``sunset'' after a pre-set time period, ranging from one or two years to a longer period. Before the cap expired of its own terms, EPA would reevaluate whether it should continue, and if appropriate, would revise the regulations to extend the cap or some more useful version thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Penalty Assessment Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations proposed today define minor violation, establish the maximum penalty amount per violation, and address matters concerning hearings to contest assessment of a civil penalty through a field citation. EPA plans to develop detailed guidance that will address many of the other issues concerning implementation of the field citation program. The following section discusses important aspects of EPA's planned guidance on the penalty amounts to be assessed by field citations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Penalty assessment under the field citation program will be designed to achieve expeditious compliance with the applicable Clean Air Act requirements. Although only minor violations of the Act will be subject to the program, the penalties must be significant enough to deter violations and to ensure a high rate of compliance. On the other hand, penalties will generally be significantly lower than amounts that could be assessed through other enforcement means. EPA plans to incorporate these objectives into a field citation penalty assessment policy, which will become a component of the Agency's Clean Air Act civil penalty assessment policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The penalty assessment guidance will explain how the Agency intends to evaluate the penalty assessment criteria in section 113(e) of the Act when determining penalty amounts. The Agency is considering assigning standardized penalty amounts to specific categories of violations. These standard amounts might then be modified by means of a penalty matrix, which would take into account such factors as the seriousness of the violation; the degree of environmental harm; or other appropriate criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects that its penalty assessment guidance will limit the discretion of inspectors and others in setting penalty amounts. For example, any matrix approach as described above would constrain the person issuing the field citation to operate within the limits of the matrix. In addition, EPA expects the guidance will establish that where the amount of a penalty would be based on specific characteristics of the violation and the person issuing the citation has not obtained evidence relating to one of the characteristics, then that characteristic would be treated as neutral for purposes of penalty assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

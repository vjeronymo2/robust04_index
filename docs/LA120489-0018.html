			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS MISFIRE FROM START TO FINISH  </P> <P> The Chargers started a rookie quarterback named Billy Joe Tolliver Sunday. They  lost to the Jets, 20-17, because he was Billy Joe Terrible.  </P> <P> "I can't see any good points in my performance today," Tolliver said after  completing 24 of 51 passes for 230 yards, throwing two interceptions and  getting sacked five times.  </P> <P> It wasn't all his fault. Chris Bahr could have sent the game into overtime but  pushed a 37-yard field goal attempt wide right with 10 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> And Tolliver's offensive teammates, an odd assortment of injury-plagued free  agents and Plan B types were Just Barely Tolerable.  </P> <P> "We didn't have a great deal of help around Billy Joe," Charger Coach Dan  Henning said.  </P> <P> All of which was Pretty Much Horrible for a Charger defense that has now held  11 consecutive opponents to fewer than 21 points. The Chargers have won only  four of those games.  </P> <P> The defense sacked Jet quarterbacks five times, including two by Pro Bowl  defensive end Lee Williams. Williams took over the team and AFC lead in sacks  from Leslie O'Neal. Williams now has 12.  </P> <P> But the loss was the Chargers' third in a row, dropped them to 4-9 and (in case  anybody was still wondering) mathematically eliminated them from the playoffs.  The Jets, also 4-9, have won two in a row.  </P> <P> Much of Tolliver's trouble stemmed from inexperience. This was only his second  NFL start. But he also had problems throwing passes that required touch.  </P> <P> On more than one occasion, many of the 38,954 in attendance -- the Chargers'  smallest crowd of the year -- booed lustily. "I've been booed before," Tolliver  said. "Those people paid their money."  </P> <P> The Jets, ranked last in NFL defense after 12 weeks, were smart enough to try  to confuse Tolliver. And they succeeded.  </P> <P> "They were in some defenses in the first half and early in the second where I  wasn't sure what was going on," Tolliver said.  </P> <P> "You could tell he hadn't been in game situations," New York cornerback Bobby  Humphrey said. "You could could play with his mind a little bit."  </P> <P> So, yes, the Charger quarterback, at times, was Billy Joe Gullible.  </P> <P> Several Jet defenders said they kept waiting for Henning to insert veteran Jim  McMahon, but Henning said he never came close to making such a move. He also  said Tolliver will "probably" remain his starter next week in Washington.  </P> <P> Both Tolliver interceptions cost the Chargers dearly. The first occurred late  in the first period after Ken O'Brien's underhand pitch to running back Johnny  Hector on third-and-seven resulted in a nine-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 New  York lead.  </P> <P> Hector's score was highlighted by a textbook block on Elvis Patterson by Jet  right tackle Reggie McElroy and completed a 47-yard, seven-play drive set up by  JoJo Townsell's 30-yard punt return.  </P> <P> Charger Jamie Holland responded with a 34-yard return on the ensuing kickoff.  Pass interference on Humphrey moved the Chargers to the New York 20. But two  plays later, Tolliver threw into double coverage, and cornerback James Hasty  intercepted.  </P> <P> Undaunted, the Chargers tied the score with five minutes remaining in the half  on a 40-yard magical mystery tour up the middle by rookie running back Marion  Butts, who broke at least five tackles on the play. "As good a run as I've seen  this year," Henning said.  </P> <P> "I could smell the end zone," said Butts, who scored seven touchdowns in the  first six weeks but none in the next five. "It had been a long time."  </P> <P> The Chargers took the lead late in the third period on a 39-yarder by Bahr, set  up by Lester Lyles' interception of a Pat Ryan pass. Ryan had replaced O'Brien,  who jammed his shoulder in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Lyles' interception was one of three by the Charger defense, which also  recovered a fumble.  </P> <P> The Jets regained the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by Roger Vick. And they  stretched that margin to 20-10 on a 14-yard rumble by Vick. Pat Leahy missed  the extra point.  </P> <P> Vick's 76 yards on 16 carries complemented Hector's game-high 106 yards rushing  on 20 tries. The Jets, ranked 22nd in rushing coming in, totaled 181 yards, the  most allowed by the Chargers this year.  </P> <P> Vick's second touchdown came after Erik McMillan intercepted an ill-advised  Tolliver bomb and returned it 40 yards to the Charger 16.  </P> <P> "One of the stupidest plays of the year," Tolliver said. "That's a play any  high school kid knows not to do. It's a team sport. But when you get down to  the final analysis, that interception I threw cost us the game."  </P> <P> But thanks to Leahy's miss, the Chargers weren't dead yet. After O'Neal  recovered a Vick fumble at the Jet 49, Tolliver hurried them upfield. His  eight-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Miller cut the deficit to 20-17 with 3:25  to play.  </P> <P> Miller has scored six touchdowns in the past five games and a team-high nine  this year. He finished Sunday with seven receptions for 70 yards.  </P> <P> After a Jet punt, the Chargers took over on their 44. Six plays later, Bahr  pushed what would have been the game-tying field goal. He was six of eight from  between the 30 and 39 before the miss.  </P> <P> "The snap was fine, the hold was fine, Chris told me he just got a little  behind it," holder David Archer said. "It's like a golf shot that you hit a  little fat and leave it out to the right."  </P> <P> Leahy, watching from the sidelines, figured Bahr was a cinch to make it because  Leahy's missed extra point had left the door open. "And I'm sitting there  thinking 'it's all because of you, you jerk,' " he said. "I was sitting there  thinking what he (Bahr) must be thinking now."  </P> <P> Or as Billy Joe Tolliver, who hails from Boyd, Tex. and talks as if he just  walked out of a Dan Jenkins novel, put it: "It just looked like today we were  snakebit and born to lose."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning said he had no problem with the "in-the-grasp" ruling  late in the third period that negated what would have been a Lee Williams  touchdown return of an interception. "I heard the whistle," Henning said. "It  was a correct call." The whistle signified that Les Miller had sacked Jet  quarterback Pat Ryan for an 11-yard loss before Williams got his hands on the  ball. . . . Williams' 55 1/2 career sacks are second in Charger history to Gary  (Big Hands) Johnson who 67. . . . The last time Jet kicker Pat Leahy missed an  extra point was in Week 14 of 1985 against the Bills. . . . Believe it or not,  the Chargers have scored 25 touchdowns this year, their opponents 24. . . . The  Chargers were a miserable four of 19 (21%) on third-down conversions. . . .  Asked to assess rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver's performance, wide  receiver Anthony Miller said, "I really don't have any comment on that. I'm not  a person to judge. I've got to worry about my job." Charger wide receiver Wayne  Walker, when asked the same question: "I'm not one to assess anybody." Henning  on the same question: "Roller coaster-like. Billy Joe played poorly in the  first half and got better at the end." Said running back Marion Butts: "I think  Billy Joe did a good job with the exception of the interceptions. Lack of  playing time will hurt anybody."  </P></p>

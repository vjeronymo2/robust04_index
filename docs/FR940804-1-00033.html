			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A significant threat to the survival of both species considered herein is the potential for vandalism by landowners who may view the presence of sensitive species as an obstacle to development. The habitat of the largest and most dense quino checkerspot population in the Gavilan Hills of Riverside County was deliberately disced, in 1984 or 1985, to eliminate this population (J. Johnson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Disease or Predation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Disease is not known to be a factor affecting the species considered herein. There are no known predators of the Laguna Mountains skipper. However, there is evidence that predation is a threat to the quino checkerspot. Studies conducted by David Hawks (pers. comm., 1993) indicate that predation has contributed to the decline of the quino checkerspot at sites where habitat has been invaded by non-native plant species, which may also harbor predatory arthropods. Historical quino checkerspot habitat sites that have been heavily invaded by Mediterranean plant species also have high sowbug ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oniscus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> sp.) and earwig ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forficula  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> sp.) densities. Sowbugs and earwigs prey upon butterfly eggs. These predators, as well as the non-native plant species that support them, are absent from natural sites currently occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly (D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although specific parasites are unknown for the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, Johnson ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989) speculates that parasitism can eliminate a butterfly colony. ``*&blank;*&blank;* butterfly or moth populations will build up on the food plants for three or four years, then one will begin to find examples of larvae or pupae with parasites. The parasitism increases for two or three seasons, when nearly all of the larvae or pupae are affected, the moth or butterfly population disappears completely from the observed area, remains absent for some years, then the cycle is repeated'' (J. Johnson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1989). This cycle can only continue if the affected area is recolonized, which is difficult when the host-butterfly population is small, fragmented, and isolated. In general, however, outbreaks of disease or parasitism are more likely to occur under conditions of high population densities. The Laguna Mountains skipper occurs in low population densities; most populations of the Quino checkerspot also occur at low densities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection for both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot include: (1) Listing under the California Endangered Species Act; (2) adequate consideration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); (3) local laws and regulations; (4) occurrence with other species protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; and (5) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations for the conservation of these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither of the species discussed herein is under consideration for listing under the California Endangered Species Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The status of and threats to the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, as discussed under Factor A above, reflect the failure of CEQA, NEPA, and local laws and regulations to protect and provide for the conservation of these species. Although there are several regional conservation planning efforts underway within the range of the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, none have been completed, approved, funded, or implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is not aware of any overlap in distribution between the Laguna Mountains skipper and any State or Federally listed species. At some localities, the quino checkerspot co-occurs with the coastal California gnatcatcher ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Polioptila californica californica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), a Federally listed threatened species. However, the habitat requirements for the quino checkerspot are different than for the gnatcatcher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some protection is afforded to the Laguna Mountains skipper on Forest Service land. However, this protection is limited to a campground area that is subject to human disturbance. Considering the small population size and extremely limited distribution of the Laguna Mountains skipper, this protection is insufficient to conserve the species. In the case of the quino checkerspot, some protection may be provided to one population by its occurrence, in part, on Bureau of Land Management land near Vail Lake in Riverside County. However, this Federal land is currently subject to off-road vehicle activity (G. Ballmer,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is not aware of any regulatory mechanisms that protect the quino checkerspot in Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Man-Made Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extremely restricted range and localized distribution, and small population size of the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot makes them vulnerable to the effects of fragmentation, especially with regard to stochastic events (e.g., see Gilpin and Soule 1986). For example, the Mount Palomar population of the Laguna Mountains skipper is known from one site, where five specimens were taken. A chance event could easily extirpate this population of the skipper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although both butterflies occur in fire adapted ecosystems, a single fire event could eliminate affected populations. Orsak (1977) reported that a quino checkerspot population near Hidden Ranch, Black Star Canyon, in the Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County was apparently destroyed by a fire in 1967. (As discussed in the Background section above, the quino checkerspot is now extirpated from Orange County.) The only site known to be occupied by the Laguna Mountains skipper in the Laguna Mountains is subject to cattle grazing and trampling by both cattle and people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

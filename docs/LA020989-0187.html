			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE;  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS WINS BY 31 IN TUNEUP FOR FULLERTON  </P> <P> With the preliminary now out of the way, Sunny Hills High School can  concentrate on its showdown against Fullerton for the Freeway League title  after a 73-42 romp over visiting La Habra Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills (16-7 overall, 8-1 in league play) got into a championship mood in  the fourth quarter, outscoring La Habra, 27-4, and served notice that it will  be tough to beat at home Friday night against Fullerton (17-5, 9-0).  </P> <P> Forward Marcus Hopkins scored 10 of his game-high 20 points in the last  quarter, including seven points in a 30-second span that gave Sunny Hills a  59-40 lead. Teammate Walter Mitter put his own seal on the victory with a  resounding dunk to give the Lancers a 66-40 lead with 1:49 remaining.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills made 10 of 20 shots in the last quarter, with a level of intensity  that it had been lacking for three quarters.  </P> <P> "We have to play that way for the entire ballgame against Fullerton," said  Steve White, Sunny Hills coach. "Hustle will be the key on Friday night."  </P> <P> La Habra (12-11, 5-4) went inside to take a 25-24 lead midway through the  second quarter when guard John Roundy made a three-point shot.  </P> <P> But Sunny Hills responded with nine unanswered points to gain a 33-25 halftime  lead, and the momentum carried into the second half.  </P> <P> The Highlanders are assured of their first playoff berth in five years, but  second-year Coach Frank McCarroll wasn't completely satisfied.  </P> <P> "One of our goals was to beat either Fullerton or Sunny Hills once, and we  didn't," McCarroll said. "Our program still has a ways to go before we can  compete with those guys."  </P></p>

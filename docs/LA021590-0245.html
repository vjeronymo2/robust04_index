			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACING Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Question: I have a feeling that if the same 10 horses raced against one another  10 times, there would be a different winner almost every time. Do you agree?  </P> <P> Answer: "That depends, I would think, on the class of horse to which your  reader refers," says Hall of Fame trainer Leroy Jolley. "If you are talking  about cheap claiming horses, then I agree that there would be a lot of winners  in 10 races with the same field. If good horses were involved, I think two or  three horses would dominate. Good horses have the consistency that is often  missing in cheap horses."  </P> <P> Q: What percentage of horses never win a race?  </P> <P> A: A study was made some years ago of the produce of 1,000 broodmares. These  mares produced approximately 6,600 foals. Of this group of foals, 18% never  raced. Another 20% raced but did not win. Thus, 38% of this study group failed  to win. Students of breeding estimate that these figures would stand up fairly  well if a similar study were made today or tomorrow. These statistics underline  the hazards of horse ownership. It is important to remember that it is the  owners who put on the show. If not for their willingness to buy horses, there  would be no racing as we know it. The late (Sunny) Jim Fitzsimmons always said  the owners and the public who support the sport are the only important groups  in racing.  </P> <P> Q: How much will a horse's speed rating change during the course of a season?  </P> <P> A: "If a horse does most of his racing at the same distance and in the same  area through most of the year, his speed ratings won't show a wide range of  change," says the well-known handicapper and breeder, Jule Fink. "However, when  a horse changes distances, his speed ratings can be affected. Consider a  sprinter asked to go a distance of ground in several races. He will probably  show a higher speed rating in those races, for he has been conditioned in  sprints to run at a faster pace. On the other hand, when he drops back to  sprints, his speed ratings are likely to be lower for his speed may have been  dulled going distance of ground several times. A point to remember, however, is  that this horse may have more stamina because of those distance races. This  added stamina could be of help to him, even in sprints."  </P> <P> Q: How far is a horse beaten if the margin is a neck?  </P> <P> A: "We calculate that two noses equal one head, two heads equal one neck, and  four necks equal one length," says Daily Racing Form track man Jack Smallwood.  "The length of an average racehorse is between 8 and 9 feet, and thus a neck  would be about 2 feet."  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Invisible exports well ahead of visibles significantly more than visible exports of Pounds 104.8bn and second only to the US, according to a report published yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry. The report says 40 per cent of Britain's output is accounted for by invisibles, which include interest, profits and dividends earned overseas as well as tradeable services such as tourism and insurance. About a quarter of income from such invisibles comes from overseas. The fastest-growing areas include information transfer and transport services. The DTI says creation of the single market in Europe and international recognition of a number of professional qualifications has boosted invisibles trade. The report illustrates how critically the UK depends on the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, which are due to include for the first time an agreement on multilateral rules for the liberalisation of trade in services. World trade in invisibles was estimated to be worth more than Pounds 750bn last year, with the UK accounting for about 14 per cent of the total. In 1990 the UK was second only to the US, which earned Pounds 151.5bn. Japan earned Pounds 93.5bn, France Pounds 82.8bn and Germany Pounds 78.6bn. When services alone are compared, France overtakes the UK, since Britain's earnings are bolstered by interest, profits and dividends from overseas. According to Mr Julian Arkell at British Invisibles, a group representing a range of private-sector service companies, the UK has a greater dependency on invisibles trade than any industrial country, with tradeable services accounting for 17 per cent of gross national product. That is twice France's dependence, four times that of the US, and five times that of Japan. The UK has earned more from the export of invisibles than from merchandise exports since 1980. Small companies have been particularly active in invisibles trade. The DTI said: 'Smaller firms have found that large turnover and staffing levels are not a prerequisite for success, and many have been gratified to find that the international business language in services is English.'</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dyer made chief executive at BOC BOC, the industrial gases and drugs group, has appointed Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer as chief executive. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said the board had discussed the concept of splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, believing it to be 'a sensible move'. The group said such discussions had been going on since the Cadbury report recommended against having one man filling both roles. Mr Dyer, a 61-year-old American with some 30 years' experience in the international gases industry, became BOC's managing director, gases, in 1989 and was appointed deputy chairman earlier this year. Before BOC, he was at Air Products &amp; Chemicals. There he became executive vice-president responsible for AP's worldwide gases and equipment business in 1987. Mr Dyer is also currently non-executive chairman of Bunzl, the paper and packaging group.</p>

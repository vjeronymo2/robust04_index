			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Share option 'may be failing in aim' the period spanning the general election - typically realised a gain of 80 per cent, according to Income Data Services, the independent pay research group. The study suggests that share options - the right to buy shares in the company one works for at a future date but at today's prices - may be failing in their aim of binding directors to their employers over the long term. The gain may be a paper one if the shares are held, or a real one if sold. IDS said: 'Share options are a neglected element of the current corporate governance debate, but, given that our analysis shows they are a substantial part of directors' remuneration package, it could be that more attention should be focused on them.' The study, based on a sample of 153 share options exercised by directors of quoted companies in the second quarter of 1992, found that the median cash gain was Pounds 49,200. For directors of FT-SE 100 companies only, the gain was Pounds 94,980 - well below the Pounds 142,606 in the last quarter of 1991. IDS said: 'Every quarter has its own factors which will influence the value of shares. We have heard arguments which suggest directors who feared a Labour victory tended to exercise their options ahead of the general election, and equally some exercising their options after the election when the market rose. But we have no direct evidence of the effect.' The study confirmed an earlier IDS options analysis finding that directors tended to exercise their options after an average of 4 1/2 years - at the 'earliest opportunity'. Options must be held for three years and exercised within 10. IDS said, 'Share options were originally devised partly as a long-term incentive to tie in the behaviour of top directors with their companies. The study suggests they may not be really working.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Baghdad's Recent Decision"] </F>   [Text] If the intentions are sincere, and we hope that they  are this time; if the pan-Arab interest is put above personal  whims, ambitions, and interests; and if there is a real will to  return to Arab legitimacy -- and we are not saying international  legitimacy -- then Baghdad's recent decisions mean that  fundamental changes have taken place and that the winds of  reexamination have started. Arab responsibility makes it  incumbent on all the parties to help close this painful chapter  in Arab history.    Iraq has rescinded the decision making Kuwait its 19th  governorate. Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi  said in a news conference that Iraq has decided to drop the  decision it announced following his country's invasion of the  State of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. He said that Iraq has  officially informed the United Nations of this decision, adding  that it was the Iraqi parliament that rescinded the decision and  the Revolution Command Council that ratified it. At the same  time, Iraq's parliament speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih stated that  his country is prepared to discuss all pending issues with  Kuwait in order to achieve stability between the two countries.  He said that these issues could be discussed with a Kuwaiti  parliamentary delegation when it visits Baghdad to check the  facts and information on the issue of Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq.    In the first comment on the decision, the Kuwaiti ambassador  in Cairo said that such Iraqi statements do not add anything  new. He added that Iraq had already rescinded the annexation  decision so as to conclude the cease fire and then presented to  the Security Council a memorandum saying that the cancellation  was made under "the pressure of circumstances" of the time. But  Iraq's media and political articles later once again began to  reiterate the story of the 19th governorate.    The ambassador explained that the way to solve this problem  is for "Baghdad to recognize the Security Council and UN  resolutions and the decisions of the borders demarcation  committee whose establishment was approved by Iraq. These  resolutions concern the borders, the prisoners, and  compensations." The Kuwaiti ambassador called on the Iraqi side  to deal with the prisoner issue through the International  Committee of the Red Cross team that will be allowed to visit  the prisons and detention camps.    In his comment on the proposal to send a Kuwaiti  parliamentary delegation or letting some parties undertake  shuttle trips between Baghdad and Kuwait, he said that the Arab  League secretary general has exerted great efforts in this  regard and these trips will be futile without recognition of the  international resolutions.    Many circles believe that the recent Iraqi moves fall within  the context of Iraq's desire to end the international sanctions  imposed on it. Major countries such as France, Russia, and  China support such a move and Turkey is insisting on it by  raising the issue of the losses resulting from stopping the flow  of Iraqi oil through its territories.    These moves come against acts of blackmail and schemes led  by  the United States in the name of the United Nations. The  monitoring of the situation in Iraq is used as an excuse for  these acts. The United States has imposed a no-fly zone on  northern Iraq on the pretext of protecting the Kurds in the  north from the Iraqi regime's repression. This was done in  accordance with a Western agreement concluded by the United  States, Britain, and France outside the framework of the United  Nations and the Security Council. In the meantime, we see that  the Shiites in southern Iraq are subjected to the same  sufferings but the United States has not provided them with the  same measure of protection.    Is it not astonishing to see the United States volunteering,  by exploiting the United Nations name, to protect Iraq's Kurds  but ignoring the fierce battles and massacres being perpetrated  by Turkey's armed forces against the Kurds on the Turkish-Iraqi  border areas?    Is it not astonishing to see the U.S. President persisting  in  playing the role of the region's cop and ordering that air  sorties continue on the pretext of protecting the Kurds even  after the scandal of the downing of two UN planes over the  no-fly zone in northern Iraq? One wonders about the true U.S.  objectives toward Iraq. Are they really the implementation of  the UN resolutions? Or are they the dismemberment of Iraq and  the secession of the north from the south? Does the United  States want to implement international legitimacy or to carve up  Iraq and paralyze its economic, military, and human resources  and capabilities?    Is the complete erasure of Iraq as a state a supreme Arab  interest? In whose interest is this being done at a time when  the United States is making the deal of the century with Israel  involving the "F-15A1" aircraft which the U.S. military arsenal  has never sold to any country in the world and whose use has  been limited to the U.S. Army alone?    Does the Middle East peace from the U.S. point of view mean  subjugating, starving, and humiliating the Iraqi people and  exhausting their resources and at the same time arming Israel  and enabling it to achieve complete economic hegemony over the  Arab region in light of an overwhelming military domination?    The State of Kuwait--government, parliament, and people--has  the right to doubt the credibility of the latest Iraqi decision  and no one disputes this fact because they are still living the  bitter and painful experience ever since the invasion day. Any  ordinary Kuwaiti citizen has the right to wonder about the  seriousness of the Iraqi offer, ask what the guarantees are, and  even stress the demand for such guarantees. We will have  ignored the feelings of an entire nation if we do not achieve  for Kuwait all the guarantees it demands.    The whole Arab nation has the right to ask how long the  imposition of the blockade on Iraq and the starvation and  humiliation of the Iraqi people will continue. The Iraqi armed  forces have withdrawn beyond the borders and the Security  Council resolutions have been implemented to the full. Then how  long will the United States continue to use the international  organization as a tool to destroy the Iraqi people and land on  the pretext of implementing international legitimacy  resolutions? These same international legitimacy resolutions  are being trampled in the Israeli-occupied territories and in  Bosnia by the Serbs while the United States does not lift a  finger.    The Arab League is now required to benefit from the  opportunity provided by the recent Iraqi decision and all  nationalist forces are required in these circumstances to move  urgently toward Baghdad and Kuwait to transform the Iraqi  decision into reality.    The Egyptian Solidarity Committee which groups all  nationalist forces and personalities of all affiliations in  Egypt has made a move and issued a comprehensive political  statement emphasizing that Iraq's recent decision turns over a  new page to regain Arab solidarity and assert Arab  reconciliation that has become a pressing pan-Arab demand. The  Iraqi decision removes an obstacle that had blocked Arab  reconciliation based on respect for international legitimacy and  national independence of all Arab countries. The decision is  also an incentive for all nationalist forces, parties, and  organizations to work to enhance Arab solidarity to liberate the  occupied Arab territories.    The Arab nation is now facing a difficult test; to be or not  to be, submit and kneel to the new theorists who adopt the false  slogans of Rabin and Peres about the promised peace, or remain  steadfast, achieve Arab solidarity, fight for unity, and prove  that pan-Arab security is not a lie but rather an established  fact and that it will continue to exist today, tomorrow, and  forever.    Iraq's recent decision opens the doors for us to realize the  dream of Arab solidarity and by a joint Arab solidarity we will  achieve our desired Arab peace, a peace based on justice,  liberation of all the land, and recovery of Jerusalem, not the  peace of Rabin and his new incense carriers of some of the  former left-wing figures who have gone astray.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, acting Government Minister Adolfo Reyes  Calderon said the government is studying strategies to adopt in  case there are threats of new riots in Guatemala. This statement  by Reyes Calderon came one day after a government press  communique quoted him delivering a strong warning to potential  riot instigators, who reportedly have been acting within the  framework of the state employees' strike movement. This  statement also came at a time when the Army controls the town of  Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, the site of violent riots on Tuesday,  when the local police station was set on fire and many policemen  were attacked.    The incidents resulted from speculation by the townspeople  about a possible plot between policemen and members of a band of  traffickers of children, to which Melissa Carol Larson, a North  American, allegedly belongs. Yesterday Larson was in danger of  being lynched.    Today, Reyes Calderon talked about the measures that could  be  adopted, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, to  check threats to national stability.    [Begin recording] [Reyes Calderon] Highway Patrol cars and  other state vehicles have been used. Some people have used  state gasoline also and are not going to their jobs. They are  [word indistinct]. For this reason, today, in compliance with  the law, two pilots were arrested for misusing state funds. The  attorney general was with us to see that the prosecutors take  action in the upcoming trials.    [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reyes Calderon] No. I did not say that. Right now, six  people are officially under arrest. They were arrested in  Quezaltenango. Others are also under arrest. Late in the  afternoon, a communique will be issued to report on all the  people who were arrested. I have confirmation that six people  were arrested but I have been informed that another 11 people  were arrested in other places.    [Reporter] Where is the North American woman being held?    [Reyes Calderon] She is under arrest in Esquintla. Today,  she will be transferred to Santa Teresa in Zone 18.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] the participation of the  police?    [Reyes Calderon] This is a charge that was filed recently.  The Professional Responsibilities Office [Oficina de  Responsabilidad Profesional -- ORP] is investigating. I was  telling your fellow journalists a while ago that the  administration of Ramiro de Leon Carpio is trying 210 agents for  various crimes. If anyone is involved, we will act drastically  and prosecute them in the courts.    [Reporter] It has been said that these people are  trafficking  human organs.    [Reyes Calderon] This is speculation. What happened is that  there were two children in the morgue, and somebody spread the  rumor and that is why the townspeople were enraged. There is no  confirmed case of trafficking human organs in Guatemala.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reyes Calderon] According to Police Report 54.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reyes Calderon] Nine people were injured: four citizens and  five policemen.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reyes Calderon] Yes, of course, with reinforcements. As you  know, yesterday, the Army supported us, and this helped restore  order.    [Reporter] What kind of sabotage was done yesterday and what  kind of sabotage [words indistinct]?    [Reyes Calderon] Public buildings were seized; people were  prevented from exercising their right to move around freely;  border posts were closed; and public institutions were seized.    [Reporter] The Governor's Office was seized and the roads in  and out of Zacapa were blocked. Did you send riot police?    [Reyes Calderon] We sent a police contingent. That is why  the attorney general came. We discussed all the issues because  some people are blocking the road to Agua Caliente. Honest  people, businessmen, and people wanting to engage in commercial  activities cannot work because people are blocking the road. We  are going to respect human rights and ask them to leave but if  they insist on blocking traffic, we will act firmly, as the law  demands. [end recording]    Attorney General Telesforo Guerra Cahn met with the acting  government minister to coordinate preventive actions in case of  other riots. Guerra Cahn spoke about this matter following a  meeting with acting Government Minister Reyes Calderon.    [Begin recording] [Guerra] Yesterday, we agreed with the  government minister that his office would coordinate actions  with the Attorney General's Office to avoid the public-disorder  situations that are arising throughout the country. We as  authorities cannot permit groups to act as they did in [words  indistinct].    [Reporter] What measures will be adopted?    [Guerra] Preventive measures [words indistinct] and the  Attorney General's Office will also participate. We will take  legal actions against those who are arrested. [Words indistinct]  investigate charges that the North American woman is involved in  the trafficking of children because the neighbors have charged  that there is trafficking in children's organs.    I do not want to speculate. Sometimes situations of conflict  are created. I understand the woman is being held in the  Esquintla women's prison. She cannot be released without a  judge's order. Regarding your second question, we have no  information that she is involved in any such activity. This was  speculation yesterday and that is what causes mobs to carry out  actions of violence. [words indistinct] set state property,  including a police station, on fire, acted disorderly, carried  out demonstrations, injured and pressured people. Some criminal  activities were carried out. The judge must decide on this, but  we are beginning procedures and our prosecutors have been  brought [words indistinct]. Approximately 52 people are under  arrest. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / NAO urges better advice on benefits SELF-EMPLOYED people on low incomes often mistakenly believe they do not qualify for social security support, the National Audit Office says in a report today. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, calls on the Benefits Agency to improve the supply of information for self-employed people working part-time. Last year people who were or had been self-employed received Pounds 700m in social security income support. Almost all the claimants - 250,000 - were completely dependent on benefit, with only 8,000 still in part-time self-employment. The report says that the office, the public spending watchdog, found a widespread but mistaken perception that, because the self-employed did not qualify for unemployment benefit, they could not receive other help from the social security system. If the option of continuing to work were better publicised, more people might remain in self-employment and top up modest earnings with benefits. The report says Benefits Agency offices in southern England faced pressure from the large numbers of formerly self-employed people now claiming income support. The agency recognised the difficulties faced by these customers and was taking 'strong remedial action' to improve services. Income support for self- employed and formerly self- employed people. HMSO. Pounds 6.70.</p>

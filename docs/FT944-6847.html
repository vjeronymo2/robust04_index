			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: Sailing away from the boardroom - Sport Accountants are not expected to do the circus books for a decade before suddenly deciding to perform in the Big Top. Nigel Rowe was never, in fact, a bean-counter. But as group corporate affairs director of BOC, he spent more than a decade orchestrating the company's sponsorship of its solo round-the-world yacht race. All those years being the suit among a sea of yellow wellies obviously had an effect on Rowe, 53, for here he is in Cape Town, competing in the race aboard his own 50ft yacht Sky Catcher, and embarking on the 7,000-mile second leg through the freezing, lonely Southern Ocean to Sydney. Rowe's career is on hold while he takes a year's leave of absence from the boardroom to scratch an itch that became a nagging compulsion. He is short of money, sometimes short of motivation - in short, enduring all the trials and tribulations that he had watched, as a detached observer, during the past three BOC races. (The race has been held every four years since 1982). Sky Catcher's skipper found that several transatlantic crossings lasting three weeks or so had hardly prepared him for 52 days of solo racing between the race-start off Charleston, South Carolina, and the first-leg finish in Cape Town's Table Bay. 'It was exhausting beyond belief, with just an hour or so's sleep at a time, and I came to hate the monotony of tinned food,' Rowe told me. After two weeks' Cape sunshine, he is bearded and tanned. Being intensely competitive, and having spent thousands of pounds he could ill afford to make Sky Catcher go a little faster, Rowe also suffered agonies through making some unfortunate routing decisions across the Doldrums and finishing a whole 10 days behind the Class II leaders. Some of his enforced leisure went into starting an account of his voyage for publication next year. Most race accounts are written by professional yachtsmen, who have little experience of life away from the sea. What promises to make Rowe's book more absorbing is the semi-detachment of a successful middle-aged man looking at an escapade that has more emotional than rational underpinning. For example, after his last business meeting in London, Rowe made the somewhat childish gesture (his words) of ripping off his tie and stuffing it into a Tottenham Court Road rubbish bin. Here is his account of his first evening at sea on the first leg. 'I felt strange and unsettled. I loaded the CD player. Paris Texas first up, then Leonard Cohen's Songs From a Room. Then more like it that were in harmony with the melancholy I felt. These feelings needed some freedom to express themselves and be felt .. 'It was a new recognition of the magnitude of the undertaking ahead of me, and the fact that despite all the time, money and effort that had gone into the project over the past couple of years, this was still only the beginning. It had cost a lot just to get to this point, but now the planning, the preparations, the talking, had come to an abrupt halt and now the job itself had to be done. 'I had put so much at risk to do it - at the very minimum an uninsured boat that had soaked up every penny of my savings - and the anguish I was putting others ashore through while I was at sea alone was something I could not ignore.' These were first-night nerves. But worse was to come. After a week-and-a-half at sea, Rowe realised that through a combination of inexperience and stubbornness, he had sailed into a large, windless 'hole' just south and east of Bermuda. Some of his rivals were clocking 300-mile days, while Sky Catcher drifted around like the proverbial painted ship on Coleridge's painted ocean. Rowe's account is painfully honest: 'Finally, I cracked. My diary entry for September 29: 'After another bad night and little prospect of improvement in the next couple of days, I realise that making up the ground I've lost is virtually impossible.' After all the time, preparations, expense and other sacrifices, I'd managed to blow the race in the first couple of weeks. It was no one's fault but mine. I'd read it all wrong and taken a very bad decision on the weather - and the price was too much to bear. 'That afternoon I stood in the cockpit, clenched fists in the air, and screamed at the top of my voice: 'Giiiive meeeee mooooore wiiiiiind]' I stamped my feet. I thumped the side of the cockpit with my fist until it hurt. Then I did it all over again before slumping into the bottom of the cockpit feeling both better and worse after my tantrum.' Of course, things improved. The breeze arrived, the sun shone, dolphins criss-crossed the bow-wave and Rowe found an unexpected bottle of champagne cooling in the bilge. Life can't all be bad when you've got a year off and your suits are locked in the wardrobe back at home. Whether choosing to confront the competitive pressures of an event like the BOC race is a sensible thing for a middle-aged executive to do seems doubtful to me. Certainly the spice of competition and the locker-room camaraderie are vivid ingredients of the experience. But it has a brutal downside, as Rowe has discovered: winning and losing. Perhaps spectator sports arose because so few of us are willing to tolerate the brutal intensities between first and last place down in the arena - or out on the ocean. I look forward to Rowe's next despatch from Sky Catcher.</p>

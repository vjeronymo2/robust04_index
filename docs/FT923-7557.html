			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Final phase of British Library project started Rounding off: work has started on the new British Library's amphitheatre as part of the final phase of the Pounds 450m project. This phase includes the new reading room and the six-storey, glass-walled tower which will house the King George III collection of books and manuscripts. Construction of the building began 10 years ago, on the site of the former goods yard for St Pancras station in Euston Road, London. Some reading rooms are due to open in 1994 but the project will not be completed until 1996. The new library will allow the public access to 12m volumes and more than 1m visitors are expected each year.</p>

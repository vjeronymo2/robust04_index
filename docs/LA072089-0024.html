			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN SURRENDERS TO POLICE, ENDING STANDOFF  </P> <P> A North Hollywood man barricaded himself in his condominium for more than two  hours Wednesday after firing a gun while arguing with his wife, Los Angeles  police said.  </P> <P> Lawrence Tyson, 32, surrendered about 5 p.m. after talking with his wife and  police officers by telephone, Sgt. John Stilo said. Tyson was questioned at the  Police Department's North Hollywood Division station before he was transferred  to Olive View Medical Center for psychiatric evaluation, Stilo said.  </P> <P> Tyson did not fire the gun at his wife, police said. The bullet struck a piano  in the home.  </P> <P> Tyson's wife, Michelle, left the unit to call police about 2:40 p.m., Stilo  said. Police decided not to enter after she told them her husband appeared  suicidal and intoxicated and was a martial-arts expert, Stilo said.  </P> <P> During the standoff, officers evacuated about 45 people from neighboring units  at the complex in the 12200 block of Runnymede Street, Stilo said. There were  no injuries.  </P> <P> Stilo said police will ask the city attorney's office today to charge Tyson  with shooting a weapon in a grossly negligent manner.  </P> <P> Inside the unit, officers found several automatic and semiautomatic rifles, as  well as a high-powered rifle and several small-caliber guns, Stilo said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> '60S GURU REMAINS A FUGITIVE IN SLAYING CASE  </P> <P> Police officers removed a steamer trunk from the apartment of Philadelphia's  star flower child 10 years ago, and the world created by the so-called  "Unicorn" began to wither.  </P> <P> The trunk contained the remains of Helen Maddux, a blonde former cheerleader  known as Holly, Ira Einhorn's lover.  </P> <P> She had been missing for 18 months by the time private investigators hired by  her family in Tyler, Tex., pieced together enough information to point an  accusing finger at Einhorn, until then a living symbol of nonviolence with  incredible personal charm and a nimble intelligence.  </P> <P> Today, the Unicorn is a fugitive from justice and faces a murder trial if he is  ever caught.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Was Corporate Consultant  </P> <P> Einhorn was a '60s hippie guru of drugs and free love who rode the tide of  peace and unity to acceptance as a corporate guru-consultant in the '70s.  People looked to Einhorn for guidance as the New Age dawned. He became a  Harvard fellow and an environmental leader as he and the times matured,  although he still dressed as a campus radical, right down to the ponytail.  </P> <P> "He was a very engaging person," recalled Thacher Longstreth, former president  of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and now a city councilman. "I have  nothing but respect for what he was, or seemed to be."  </P> <P> An investigative journalist who chronicled Einhorn's case in a recent book said  the Unicorn was both the product and property of Philadelphia. The City of  Brotherly Love nurtured him and worshiped him. It was also his stage, and  Einhorn was the ringmaster, New York City's Steven Levy wrote.  </P> <P> Einhorn was a founder of the Free University at the University of Pennsylvania  in 1964, organizer of the city's first Be-In in 1967, first Smoke-In in 1969,  Earth Day in 1970 and Sun Day in 1978. He was an expert in the paranormal and  spoke at meetings around the world.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Body Partly Mummified  </P> <P> But the battered and partly mummified body in the steamer trunk, along with  some startling disclosures by Levy, led investigators and, finally, even his  close supporters to conclude that there was a grim, hidden side to the Unicorn.  </P> <P> "It's a shame," Longstreth said, because here was a man who held in his power  the magic of the mythical creature whose name he used as his own. The Unicorn  focused the attention of the nation on himself, on the environment and on  Philadelphia when he organized the city's Earth Day observance.  </P> <P> "It was truly wonderful," Longstreth said, recalling the day on which thousands  gathered to honor the sanctity of Earth and mankind in Philadelphia and other  cities. The premier event was in Philadelphia, on Independence Mall near the  Liberty Bell. The Unicorn presided as the television cameras zoomed in to show  him kissing Sen. Edmund S. Muskie full on the mouth.  </P> <P> Levy said the Unicorn was more than just a nickname. It was an ideal for  Einhorn.  </P> <P> "Since someone had pointed out how his name (Einhorn -- One Horn) relates to  the mythical horse-like creature with a single horn between the eyes, Ira had  fancied himself as kin to that mythical creature, representing purity,  uniqueness, gentleness and sexual power," Levy wrote.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office and police think he still has some of his old  magic left because he is still free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He's a Brutal Killer'  </P> <P> "Somehow, he's still able to get the confidence of some people, especially  women, it seems," said Terry Williamson, a spokesman for the district  attorney's office. "But he's a brutal killer as far as we're concerned."  </P> <P> Einhorn was arrested on March 28, 1979, and charged with the murder of Maddux.  The arrest shared the headlines with another big event that day, the nation's  worst commercial nuclear accident, at Three Mile Island power plant in  Middletown, Pa.  </P> <P> He contended that he was innocent and said it was a CIA-KGB frame-up. He was  able to get the services of a top attorney of the time, Arlen Specter, now a  U.S. senator.  </P> <P> But there was no evidence of a frame and, in January, 1981, when free on bail,  the Unicorn skipped. His trial was to have begun in February or March.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grew Up in Philadelphia  </P> <P> Einhorn grew up in Philadelphia's Jewish neighborhoods, attended the University  of Pennsylvania and was among the many caught up in the activism of the Vietnam  era. Levy grew up within a mile of Einhorn and attended the same high school  where Einhorn studied and played football. There was a chance meeting when Levy  was working on the underground newspaper known as the Drummer.  </P> <P> Those memories prompted his decision to research and write "The Unicorn's  Secret," which was published in October.  </P> <P> "I remembered well that Ira was the big presence in Philadelphia," Levy said.  "He stood for nonviolence, and it seemed unreal for him to be charged with  murder.  </P> <P> "I didn't set out to prove guilt or innocence. I just wanted to find out what  the real story was."  </P> <P> There was the story everyone knew.  </P> <P> Here was a man fluent in science, literature and hippiedom who had built a  worldwide network of intellectuals from all walks of life. He was the prophet  of new concepts, which he found in books, articles and his own brain and  disseminated around the world to those in his network. Bell Telephone of  Pennsylvania even paid the postage and listed him as a company consultant.  </P> <P> "I'm a communicator," he told the Philadelphia Daily News in 1975. "I dig up  facts and data and convey them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Had Two Faults  </P> <P> Longstreth says Einhorn had only two faults.  </P> <P> One was body odor. Another was simply his own motion.  </P> <P> "He was erratic," Longstreth said. "He pushed his bad ideas as hard as he  pushed his good ones."  </P> <P> Levy's digging uncovered another Einhorn, who could hide things from nearly  anyone, even his network of intellectuals and supporters, nearly to the end of  his reign.  </P> <P> His network was still somewhat intact when he fled, first to Ireland, because  it has no extradition treaty with the United States, according to law  enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> At some point, he assumed the name Ben Moore.  </P> <P> One of those who helped finance his exile was Barbara Bronfman, ex-wife of an  heir to the Seagram's fortune, Swedish authorities told the Philadelphia  Inquirer.  </P> <P> Bronfman read Levy's book and decided to cooperate with the Philadelphia  district attorney.  </P> <P> Williamson said he could not disclose how much cooperation there might have  been or the extent of the investigation over the years, but he added: "I can  say that he's definitely always been a high-profile fugitive for us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fugitive Tipped Off  </P> <P> In December, Interpol conveyed a tip to Swedish authorities that Einhorn was in  Stockholm. But Bronfman's boyfriend tipped off Einhorn, and authorities found  only empty rooms, the Inquirer said.  </P> <P> "The book definitely turned the heat on, and a few people have also contacted  us," Levy said.  </P> <P> "The Unicorn's Secret" is about how, in 1972, the Unicorn met the former  cheerleader from Texas, then a graduate of Bryn Mawr, and how such a man could  wind up as her murderer while fooling those around him.  </P> <P> Levy discovered a stormy relationship during which Maddux tried repeatedly to  shed Einhorn's overpowering influence. But her own insecurities kept pushing  her back.  </P> <P> Then, in September, 1978, she dropped out of sight. Einhorn said he knew  nothing other than that she had left the apartment to go shopping and never  returned.  </P> <P> At first, that seemed plausible, and police considered Maddux a missing person  who wanted to be missing. But Fred and Elizabeth Maddux had not liked their  daughter's companion and hired a retired FBI agent to find out what happened.  The retired agent turned to other retired agents for help.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Built by Investigators  </P> <P> Levy's book follows the case as it was built against Einhorn by the private  investigators, including reports by residents of the apartment house who told  of a terrible smell. One man even remembered a scream.  </P> <P> Levy found that Einhorn had asked two women for help in disposing of the trunk.  He had told them it was full of "Russian papers" he had to get rid of. He  wanted to dump it in the Schuylkill River. But the trunk wouldn't fit in their  car, Levy said.  </P> <P> In addition, he turned up two women who had been attached to Einhorn in the  past. One relationship ended when Einhorn choked the woman, nearly killing her.  The other ended when Einhorn smashed a bottle over the woman's head.  </P> <P> According to Levy, only one question remained:  </P> <P> "How could a smart guy like him deny that trunk in his apartment?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blames Drug  </P> <P> Levy concluded that the answer was a drug, ketamine, which wouldn't cause  brutal behavior but would allow Einhorn to dissociate himself from it.  </P></p>

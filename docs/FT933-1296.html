			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: QSP shares fall on 37% decline PROFITS at Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based accounting software company slipped sharply below budget in its first six months after going public in March this year. The shares fell 36p to 528p. Profits before tax for the six months to end-June were Pounds 143,000 compared with Pounds 227,000, a decline of 37 per cent. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 6.61m (Pounds 6m). Earnings per share were 2.1p basic and 2p fully diluted, against 3.9p and 3.2p respectively. No interim dividend is proposed but a final is planned. Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, explained that the costs of developing QSP's new Universal Olas accounting package had proved higher than expected, while a number of customers had held back from further investment in the traditional Olas system in anticipation of the new product, depressing budgeted results by about Pounds 1.5m. There were also budgeted costs of about Pounds 850,000 in preparation for the market exploitation of Universal Olas. The core general ledger module was released earlier in the year and sales and purchase ledger modules are expected in November. The extra expenditure was incurred in modifying Universal Olas to run on a broad range of computer designs. Mr Mordain said it is now the most open accounting system available. Analysts expect profits before tax of about Pounds 0.5m for the year. The share price continues to be supported by expectations that the company will return pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.8m in 1994 as orders for Universal Olas pick up. Mr Mordain said he expected the some 50 customers for the system by the end of next year, compared with four at present.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Deadlock in French prisons strike THE French government yesterday offered to freeze the temporary suspension of 40 prison officers announced on Monday as a conciliatory gesture towards resolving their industrial dispute. However, its efforts were blocked when two of the biggest officers' unions, the UFAP and Force Ouvriere, refused to attend a morning negotiating meeting. Despite the government's efforts, staff at most of France's 182 jails stayed out on strike yesterday. There were ugly scenes as riot police tried to restore order, sometimes clashing with picketing officers as well as inmates. The strike, which follows after a similar stoppage last month, was sparked by last Friday's murder of a warder at Clairvaux prison, when seven inmates tried to shoot their way out of the jail. Squads of security vans arrived at Clairvaux throughout the morning to move 100 of its 220 inmates. Clairvaux is one of France's maximum security prisons, but staff have refused to return to work until the prison has been thoroughly searched after Friday's shooting. Warders at Baumettes have also demanded that their jail be searched before they return to work. The warden's death was the latest in a series of violent incidents, which have included attacks on staff and dramatic helicopter snatches of inmates from prison roofs. The prison officers are demanding more staff and improved facilities, including the reintroduction of the top security wings recently phased out by France's Socialist government. The justice ministry has promised to review the whole prison system and to table legislation to improve financial compensation for officers' dependents. The French airline pilots' unions have called out their members on a 24-hour strike today in protest at proposed changes to their working arrangements. The pilots' union criticised the European Commission by claiming that it was tabling changes which would involve more flying hours and shorter rest periods for French pilots.</p>

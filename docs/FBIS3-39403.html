Papoulias stressed: There is much hope that we can avoid the  worst in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, as reports on the  withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo are hopeful.  However, he noted this process is not the exclusive obligation  of the Serbs and the Muslims should do the same. Papoulias  expressed Greece's fears for the chain reaction a general  conflict would have in the Balkans and in Europe, and added that  he does not believe air strikes can bring peace.    The Greek presidency of the European Union [EU] also is  contemplating calling a meeting of the EU Council of Foreign  Ministers before the deadline of NATO's ultimatum, the Greek  foreign minister said. Responding to a question if Athens will  exercise a veto in NATO on the air strikes, he said that Greece  is contemplating and will use all available means to avoid a  wider conflict. Papoulias also stressed that he discussed the  possibility of the war spreading to the south with Milosevic,  and underlined that something like this would be a tragic  development and the beginning of an armed conflict that would  have wider consequences in Europe. Responding to another  question, the foreign minister said that the Greeks living in  Serbia are safe. They consider it their second homeland and  have no need to leave.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Sharp rise in five-year fixed rate morgages - At a glance Five-year fixed rate mortgages have increased steeply this year. The chart shows Halifax's since its first issue in October 1991. Its cheapest five-year fix of 7.20 per cent in January this year was less than its standard variable rate of 7.64 per cent and a real bargain compared to its latest five-year 9.25 per cent fix issued this week. Cheaper five-year fixed rates are still available; for example, Alliance &amp; Leicester has one at 8.49 per cent, National &amp; Provincial, 8.45 per cent and National Westminster bank, 8.59 per cent.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / People: Confederation of British Industry A change of voice at the top of the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main employer organisation. John Dunkley, 65, director of public affairs, and his deputy Philip Ditton, 67, are retiring after 18 years handling the CBI's relations with the press. Dunkley, a former industrial correspondent of The Guardian, is being replaced by Stephen Horn, 34, a producer on BBC TV's Money Programme. Horn, who will have the title of director of media relations, is not the first TV journalist to do the CBI job. Richard Dixon, a former industrial correspondent of ITN, held the job in the 1970s.</p>

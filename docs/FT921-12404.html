			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Why British business remains relatively unprofitable THERE IS no doubt that the profitability of UK business has fallen sharply since the recession began; and little doubt that it has fallen further than in most other large industrial countries. But rather than dwell on the current gloom, this is a good time to re-examine the relative profitability of British businesses over the past decade. Ostensibly the 1980s do not look too good, as was pointed out here in August (Business profitability and the incentive to invest, August 12 1991). According to the OECD, the UK had the lowest average gross pre-tax rate of return on capital in the 1980s and the lowest share of profits in value-added among the six largest economies. Little wonder that it also had the lowest annual rate of growth of investment. Nor were the 1980s notably better for British business than the previous decade: the UK average rate of return was 9.5 per cent in 1980-87, just 0.2 percentage points up on 1975-79, while the G7 average remained unchanged at 14.6 per cent. Yet the Confederation of British Industry will argue in this week's Economic Situation Report that the recent record of British industry is more encouraging than this cursory glance at the evidence suggests. Both anecdotal evidence and figures from the UK Central Statistical Office, it asserts, show that UK profitability rose markedly in the 1980s. The upper chart, from the OECD, plots an index of the mark-up of output prices over unit labour costs, which indicates changes in the profit margins of manufacturing industry, accounting for around a quarter of the business sector. UK margins do appear to have risen faster than in France or Germany since 1980. How can we account for the discrepancy between this evidence and the OECD's measures of rates of return? The OECD calculates the latter by dividing the gross operating surplus in each year by national estimates of the value of the capital stock. But British estimates of the average life of UK machines and buildings are up to twice as high as in other countries. So the estimated UK capital stock is inflated and the average rate of return is depressed. This difference in national practice may explain why measured rates of return in the UK are lower than in other countries; but it does not explain why the UK has failed to make up more of the ground in the 1980s - unless these international differences in estimated capital lives have grown mysteriously. Moreover, the OECD removes North-Sea-oil-related capital from the total UK capital stock, but not North Sea profits. So the rate of return it calculates for the UK may even be too high. The CBI is not deterred: what matters is not the return on old capital but the return on new investments. For this reason, Mr Andrew Sentance and Mr Duncan McKenzie of the CBI have divided the gross operating surpluses of British and German manufacturers by the cumulative totals of real investment over the previous 15 years. Their results are shown in the lower-left chart. The profitability of new UK manufacturing investment did rise rapidly between 1980 and 1988, though it exceeded the return on German investments only briefly. The OECD has also calculated the marginal return on business sector investments, using an econometric model. It also finds that the return on new UK investments in the 1980s rose faster than in all the other G7 countries but remained absolutely lower. Interestingly, the OECD also finds that the capital-labour ratios of every country, save the UK, remained approximately stable in the 1980s. So investing in these six countries became more profitable because the same mix of machines and workers was being used more efficiently. In the UK, the rise in the return to new investment has been accompanied by a relatively sharp drop in the capital-labour ratio. Investing in the UK became more profitable in the 1980s not only because capital and labour were being used more effectively but because capital became relatively scarce. By investing in labour-intensive service industries, companies could obtain a higher return from a smaller capital investment. So higher profitability was partly a product of the UK's relatively low rate of business investment in the 1980s.  --------------------------------------------------------------------       INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GNP/GDP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series rather than under investment. Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer to import volumes. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and Jordan take step to full peace treaty JORDAN yesterday initialled an outline peace agreement with Israel, becoming the first Arab state to reach an understanding with the Jewish state since Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979. Just a day after Israel signed its outline agreement with the Palestinians, both countries initialled what they described as an 'agenda' framing future negotiations towards an eventual peace treaty. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, meanwhile sought to build on the momentum for peace by visiting Morocco for talks with King Hassan, while Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Senate leaders in Washington before travelling on to the United Nations in New York. In Rabat, a spokesman for Mr Rabin commented: 'It is the first time an Israeli prime minister has met an Arab leader out in public, other than the Egyptian leaders.' During an hour's meeting with about 20 senators, Mr Arafat requested a review and repeal of laws that impeded or prevented economic or other relationships between the US and the PLO and repeated his strong commitment to peace. Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said the general reaction among senators was to be helpful and that laws should be changed where needed. In sharp contrast to Monday's ceremonials on the White House lawn, the Jordan agreement was initialled by Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks, and Mr Fayez Tarawneh, his Jordanian counterpart in the small Thomas Jefferson room in the State Department. The modest affair took just over 10 minutes, after which the two signatories shook hands without hesitation or embarrassment. A small group of State Department officials applauded. A draft text covering the outstanding issues between the two sides has been virtually ready to sign since last year. Jordan, however, delayed a final signing until progress had been made on the Palestinian-Israel negotiations. The document contains undertakings from both sides to refrain from threats to each other's security and sets out the main areas for future discussion - notably on water rights, minor outstanding border issues and the status of refugees. 'We hope this is just a first step, which will follow into an agreement based on comprehensive peace,' said Mr Tarawneh. The document calls for 'steps to arrive at a state of peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338' - which demand an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied since the 1967 war - indicating that Jordan is unlikely to sign a full peace deal with Israel until the Jewish state has done so with others. In Israel there were mounting signs yesterday that Mr Rabin would face an uphill struggle to win the parliamentary votes he says he needs to pass the peace agreement, perhaps forcing him to call a referendum. Mr Arye Deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which has effectively quit the Labour-led coalition, said he had recommended the party's spiritual mentor to demand a referendum be held on the same day as local elections due on November 3. Mr Deri also said he had instructed the interior ministry, which he headed until his resignation took effect yesterday, to make preparations for a November referendum. So far there has been no government decision on a referendum. Two Palestinians died in further violence in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, including a suicide bomber who blew himself up in an Israeli police station in an apparent protest at the peace deal. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, welcomed the outline deal between Jordan and Israel as a 'signpost of the progress we hope and expect will soon come' in peace talks involving Syria and Lebanon.

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Perhaps Cadbury will be have more to say about Dr Pepper/Seven-Up's poison pill when it delivers its interim results this week. Meanwhile the market is left with the impression that Dr Pepper has dealt it a serious blow. Cadbury's Pounds 150m purchase of a further 20 per cent of Dr Pepper last month only made sense with the prospect of close operating collaboration between the two companies. If they are at loggerheads over ownership, the chances of that seem remote. Yet the commercial advantages of getting together would be considerable for both. Cadbury could strengthen its distribution in the US and Dr Pepper would gain access to overseas bottlers who were not involved with either Pepsi or Coke. Dr Pepper's latest outburst may simply reflect its management's desire to avoid ceding control, at least on the cheap. If so, an eventual compromise seems likely. The elegant solution would be for Cadbury to sell its US carbonates business to Dr Pepper in exchange for shares and a seat on the board. That would give it a large stake, which it could equity account, in a business with 15 per cent of the US soft drinks market, while sparing the need for a rights issue to fund a full hostile bid. The drawback is that such a half measure could underline Cadbury's lack of critical mass in the world market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- Japanese Deputy Foreign  Minister Shozo Azuma today outlined a picture of diplomatic  relations between his country and Latin American nations. He  thoroughly praised the "gradual, sustained transit" to democracy  and development, adding that he is confident these countries  will in the short term establish strong ties with Pacific Basin  and Asian nations.    During his visit to Congress, Azuma talked with NOTICIAS  ARGENTINAS in perfect Spanish which, he said, he learned years  ago during his stay in Mexico.    After meeting with Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and with  national Senators Juan Aguirre Lanari and Luis Leon in the  Senate reading room, Azuma delivered a lecture on "Japanese  policy in Latin America."    The Japanese diplomat said he "loved" Latin America. He said  Argentina holds "the capital that is known as the most beautiful  in Latin America, with good wine, good food, and the nicest and  most sophisticated people."    During the day Azuma also met with President Carlos Menem,  about whom he said that "we had a good talk; he met with us  despite the fact that he was very busy."    He said he is confident that after the Argentine president's  visit to Japan in December 1993 "political and economic  relations between Japan and Argentina will be intensified."    Azuma gave particular praise to "the efforts to achieve  democratization and to consolidate democracy under the excellent  leadership of President Menem, and the results of political  stability and the economic policy."    "I would also like to express our deepest respect for the  attitude with which Argentina undertook the peacekeeping  missions and a policy of nuclear non-proliferation," he added.    Azuma declined to give specific details of the commercial  exchange with Argentina or of the support that his country has  extended to Argentina in any area. However, he did so with  respect to other Latin American nations in referring to the  period of "the lost decade of the 1980's to the resurrection of  the 1990's."    In his analysis, he emphasized the modifications made in the  international arena with the end of the cold war and the  East-West conflict. Upon referring to the Latin American and  Caribbean nations, he said that in the current decade "they are  engaged in dynamic movements like democratization, economic  reforms, and the adoption of realistic diplomacies."    He said that in keeping with the new situation in Latin  America, Japan hopes to "assure long-term stability, consolidate  democracy and the market economy, and maintain and foment the  international coordination system."    Azuma cleverly said that to attain such objectives Japan had  adopted "policies that focus on the double `D' -- democracy and  development -- supporting and promoting democracy in the region  and cooperating with economic reforms based on the principles of  the market economy."    Concerning Japanese cooperation with Latin American nations,  Azuma said it is "substantial" in El Salvador, to which more  than $200 million was given for the national reconstruction plan  and for the democratization program which will end with the  elections on 20 March.    He also said his country is supporting the Nicaraguan  Government of Violeta Chamorro, which up to the end of 1992 has  received economic and technical cooperation worth approximately  $112 million.    In the case of Peru, he admitted that with the suspension of  the Constitution by President Fujimori on 5 April 1992, the  double "D" diplomatic policy "faced a dilemma," but "the reforms  on which the Peruvian Government was working had decisive  political and economic significance in the history of Peru, and  gave extraordinary results, resolving many unprecedented  difficulties."    While advocating the rapid return to democracy, Japan "did  not miss the opportunity of cooperating in the fair and regular  elections in November," Azuma said, adding that computers and a  $1 million contribution were donated and observers sent as part  of OAS delegations.    He praised the results of the Peruvian economic plan, and  said that it has successfully reached a growth rate of 6.5  percent, "which is the highest figure in Latin America."    Azuma admitted that in June 1993 the Japanese Government  "temporarily" froze economic cooperation with Guatemala "until  democracy was restored 10 days later under international  pressure."    In Haiti, Japan enforced economic sanctions and demanded the  return of democracy, and in April 1993 it gave $2.5 million to  the United Nations to support the activities of the  international mission of observers. Japan has also announced  that if democracy returns to Haiti it will provide a $10 million  financial contribution for refinancing the foreign debt.    Azuma finally expressed his desire that Latin American  countries in the short term promote commercial and political  ties with Asian and Pacific Basin countries.</p>

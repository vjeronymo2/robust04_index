			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 16 March.    Radio Reloj at 1504 GMT on 12 March reports that Matanzas  Province is outstanding in controlling borers through biological  means. In 1993, despite the nation's resource shortages, some 48  million borer-eating flies were released to control the pests in  78,000 caballerias. It is estimated that borers are responsible  for losses of between 9,000 and 130,000 tons of sugar per year.    Radio Reloj at 1509 GMT on 12 March reports that the Eliseo  Caamano Agriculture-Livestock Production Cooperative in  Consolacion del Sur Municipality, Pinar del Rio Province,  expects to harvest 5,000 quintals of tobacco during the current  campaign, a record figure in the co-op's 15 years of existence.  The co-op has harvested 250,000 poles of tobacco to date, almost  50 percent of the expected harvest.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 12 March reports that Ciego de  Avila Province has had the biggest white grapefruit harvest in  history, 14,500 tons in the 1993-94 campaign.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that exploitation of a  small gold mine in the Castellanos multimetallic deposit in  Minas de Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, will begin next  month. The engineer in charge of extraction and processing says  the gold is in tiny particles that will have to be extracted  from the soil. He says approximately one pound of gold, worth  $6,000 on the world market, can be obtained from every 500 tons  of soil. Putting the mine into operation will provide jobs for  over 200 excess workers from Pinar del Rio's mining enterprise.  Exploiting the mine has been made possible through an investment  of approximately 3 million pesos.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 March reports that in three  days of work members of the Antiaircraft Defense and  Revolutionary Air Force reached 142 percent of potato picking, a  great labor feat. In San Antonio de los Banos, Havana Province,  250 DAAFAR members are supporting the food program on orders of  the high command. Lieutenant Colonel (Juan Avelero), deputy  chief of the troops, has said that in Havana 2,000 men from  various Western Army units helping pick tomatoes will remain for  some 30 days to work in the potato harvest.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 March reports that the  Siguaney factory in Sancti Spiritus is producing a new variety  of gray cement which has proven very resistant to salt water and  good for many uses, including blocks. Specialists point out that  its production allows the factory to save 10 kwh of electricity  and 26 kg of oil per ton: in other words, 11 percent less than  what was traditionally required.    Radio Reloj in its 2030 GMT newscast on 15 March reports the  following:    "The Colombian subsidiary of the English hotel chain (Forte)  has, at Cubanacan's request, taken over the administration and  marketing of the (Las Yagrumas) Hotel in San Antonio de los  Banos." Cubanacan president Abraham Maciques confirms:  "Cubanacan has signed similar joint ventures -- which guarantee  a market, experience, and technology -- with prestigious hotel  groups from Spain, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Germany, and  Canada."    In Sancti Spiritus Province since January, 300 caballerias  of  cane have been cultivated using oxen. The province's Basic  Cooperative Production Units, agricultural-livestock  cooperatives, credit and services cooperatives, and state  organizations own over 1,600 teams of oxen. Sector workers  intend to cultivate some 2,800 caballerias of land using ox  teams, in addition to working on self- sufficiency plots and the  planting, collecting, and transportation of cane. The Ministry  of the Sugar Industry aims to have some 2,300 teams of oxen by  the end of 1994.    The workers of the sugar industry's machine shops in Havana  are carrying out two important tasks this year: manufacturing  chains for cane and conveyor belts (esteras) for bagasse, in  cooperation with a Spanish firm. They continue to support the  production of spare parts.    The National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) will this  year put a plan into effect to motivate those agricultural  producers most outstanding in fulfilling their plans for  collection and sales to state organizations. This was reported  at the ANAP provincial plenum in Matanzas, which analyzed  production and collection management in the small farm sector.  The plenum, held at the Alberto Delgado Cooperative in Perico  Municipality, was presided over by ANAP President Orlando Lugo  Fonte and attended by Agriculture Vice Minister Luis Gonzalez.    The first Guitart-Cayo Coco tourist complex, in the cays  north of Ciego de Avila Province, has hosted close to 20,000  foreign tourists during its nearly 10 months of operation. This  complex opened in April 1993 to outstanding Ciego de Avila  workers, received its first foreign visitors a month later, and  was officially inaugurated on 12 November 1993. There are plans  to build a second Guitart-Cubanacan tourist installation on Cayo  Coco.    The workers of the Ramiro Santiago fish farm in Las Tunas  are  trying to produce 20 million tilapia larvae and 12 million fry  in 1994, figures far greater than in 1993. In 1993, a little  more than 1,000 tons of fish were produced there; in 1994, the  farm expects to raise this figure to 1,600. Las Tunas' program  designed to increase production to 8,000 tons in the next four  years will provide each inhabitant of the province two pounds of  freshwater fish per month.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that Cuba is  going to cultivate sunflowers to produce fodder and sunflower  oil. Lieutenant Colonel Gilberto Pena Martinez says a  multidisciplinary group from the Ministry of the Interior is  going to work with each province to begin planting in August and  to begin developing the industry with a view to meeting  approximately 50 percent of the ministry's fat needs.</p>

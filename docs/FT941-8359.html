			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: In search of Pan and the people of Thrace (2) / JDF Jones admires the memoirs of an 'ordinary Greek' IN THE TRAIL OF ODYSSEUS by Marianna Koromila Michael Russell Pounds 14.95, 150 pages Patrick Leigh Fermor's services to our understanding and love of Greece extend beyond his magnificent travel books. His translation of The Cretan Runner, for instance - the war memoir of George Psychoundakis, one of Leigh Fermor's irregulars during the German Occupation - gave us one of the most fascinating books about Crete. Now he has introduced the English edition of another memoir by an 'ordinary' Greek. Like The Cretan Runner, In the Trail of Odysseus is a surprise and a delight. It is the life story of Yiankos Danielopoulos, who was born in merchant prosperity in a small port on the Black Sea in 1899 and died in contented poverty 88 years later on his small farm on Mt Hymettos near Athens. Yiankos apparently wrote a version of autobiography in old age, which was then put together and skilfully placed in context by Marianna Koromila. It has been fluently translated by Nigel Clive and Leigh Fermor contributes an introduction in his inimitable style. ('On the right a beech-forest wavered inland to the foothills of the Great Balkan Range, and on the left, beyond a steep tumble of rocks and a troop of cormorants, a sweep of green water fled away to the skyline. It was getting dark; light snow began fluttering down and suddenly revelation came . . .') The interest, and indeed the importance, of this book is that it calls from the shadows the least-known members of the Greek diaspora - the three million Greeks of the Black Sea, before the dramas of this century drove most of them back home to the Mediterranean. These Greeks (can we call them Thracians?) of the Danube Delta, the Crimea, Odessa, the Caucasus, Rostov-on-the-Don, etc., have never enjoyed the attention which has rightly been given to their compatriots in Egypt or Asia Minor. Here at last we have a portrait of a vigorous and thriving society of traders and sailors, a picture of a bygone age in which villagers dance on red-hot coals at the Feast of St Panteleimon, the children are all sent off by sailing boat to school in Constantinople, and drunken Cossacks drown in the cellars they have flooded with looted wine. But Yiankos' life was to be one of repeated crisis and disruption, as he suffered - with remarkable ebullience - the consequences of the Balkan Wars, the first world war, the 1917 Soviet Revolution and its aftermath, the 1929 Crash, the second world war, and Yalta. Again and again he built up a business and a home, whether in Constanza or Galatz or Rostov or the Sea of Azov or Novorosisk or Constanza (again) or Bucharest, only to lose it all and have to move on. He changed nationality twice and profession 13 times and he was seven times a refugee. He was a money changer, he owned a cafe and then a grocery store, he was director of a state confectionery shop in Romania, and he finished up a farmer in Attica. He survived the Bulgarians and their 'ethnic cleansing' of Thracians in 1914, the Anarchists in 1917, the Bolsheviks in 1924, the Iron Guard in 1940, the Stalinists in 1948. He made friends with the German invaders in 1940 and with their Soviet successors in 1945. Always he observed the golden rule of Greeks abroad - keep out of local politics. In the end, says Koromila, not too fancifully, he followed the guidance of Tiresias to Odysseus - to take an oar and to travel inland to the point where the oar is thought by the locals to be a spade, and there to make his home. In 1950 Yiankos brought his family back to the Mediterranean, as refugees. All of this is engrossing, but I am a little worried about Koromila's insistence that Homer specifically set The Odyssey in the Black Sea, with the Sirens in the Sea of Marmara and Hades located in the Cimmerian Bosphorus at the foot of the Caucasus. This is surely an absurdly literal interpretation of a great poetic myth - and anyhow, Odysseus was aiming for Ithaca, which lies in the other direction. Does this explain why this otherwise splendid slim volume is disgracefully devoid of a proper map?</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> DOUBLE TROUBLE: How's this for a super-session? Texas' hottest guitar slinger  Stevie Ray Vaughan is making an album with an equally incomparable guitar wiz .  . . his brother Jimmy, who handles the ax chores for the Fabulous Thunderbirds.  The siblings have been working in Memphis with (of all people) Nile Rodgers,  who is producing the record for a late summer release. . . . Meanwhile, two  guys who were double trouble -- at least if you put them in the same room  together -- have cooled their jets and buried the hatchet.  </P> <P> We refer to rappers Kool Moe D and LL Cool J, who have signed a peace treaty  (at least temporarily) and been hanging out together, all smiles, after years  of bad blood and dissing matches. . . . Reggae-rapper Shinehead has a new album  due out in early July called "The Real Rock." It features a slinky cover of  Sly's "Family Affair," plus originals like "Cigarette Breath," "Musical  Madness" and "Love &amp; Marriage Rap." . . . And "After the Rain," due later  this month from DGC Records, is the debut album from Nelson, the band formed by  Matthew and Gunnar Nelson, sons of the late Rick Nelson. Titled "After the  Rain," the album is dedicated to Rick and features such songs as "Love and  Affection," "I Can Hardly Wait" and "Tracy's Song."  </P></p>

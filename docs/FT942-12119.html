			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Dalai Lama criticised as MFN date nears A week of lobbying over China's Most Favoured Nation status in Washington ended with a blast from Beijing at the Dalai Lama for refusing to abandon hope of independence for his Tibetan homeland. The lengthy statement issued by Beijing may have been an attempt to defend China's record in Tibet in the run-up to the US decision on renewing China's low-tariff trade status. Respect for Tibet's religious and cultural heritage is one of the factors President Bill Clinton has said he will consider in making a decision on MFN by early June. He has pressed China to open talks with the Dalai Lama. The statement followed a meeting between Mr Clinton and his vice-president Al Gore with the Dalai Lama on Thursday. Yesterday Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, was set for talks with Mr Gore, in the last and most important meeting of a week spent lobbying in Washington against withdrawal of MFN on human rights grounds. She spent the week trying to persuade opponents of MFN renewal that human rights advances could better be achieved through trade than by isolating China. 'I don't think anybody else on this earth is more concerned about human rights than Hong Kong,' she said. The city-state is to revert from British to Chinese rule in 1997. With just five weeks left before Mr Clinton must decide on MFN, other Tibetan interests were lobbying this week. The Tibet Fund, a non-profit group which helps support Tibetan refugees, this week sent each member of the US Congress a tie of Tibetan design, bearing tags with pictures and names of individual Tibetan children.</p>

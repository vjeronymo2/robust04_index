			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN BEGINS 30-DAY JAIL TERM FOR FAILING TO CLEAN  UP YARD  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks resident began serving a 30-day jail sentence Thursday after a  judge found that he had repeatedly failed to clear his property of junk  accumulated over a decade.  </P> <P> Adolph Leben, regarded by his neighbors on Havenwood Drive as a kindly  eccentric, turned himself in to the Ventura County Jail after Municipal Judge  John R. Smiley denied his request for a modified sentence in a hearing  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Leben, a planner in the aerospace industry, pleaded guilty in April to charges  of creating a public nuisance and a fire hazard. He received several chances to  clear his front, side and back yards before Smiley sentenced him to jail Aug.  16.  </P> <P> The men's club of Leben's church even offered to help him and began clearing  his yard. But Leben asked them not to come back because he was afraid that he  "wouldn't have any control of what was going out," said Edward Krol, a member  of St. Paschal Baylon Church in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Nancy Schreiner, the deputy city attorney who prosecuted the case, said a jail  term was fair.  </P> <P> "We've been dealing with him on this matter for years and years and years, and  he's fully aware he needs to clean up his property," she said. "I feel he's  been playing with and taking advantage of the system long enough. He's been  given great latitude in the past."  </P> <P> Neighbors have said they long marveled at Leben's growing collection of junk  and lodged quiet complaints over the years. But they said they never pushed the  issue because Leben was quiet, pleasant and frequently offered to help them  with chores.  </P> <P> During a hearing Wednesday, Leben claimed that he had cleared his yard and  asked the judge to reconsider his sentence. But the city produced photographs  and testimony from code enforcement officers that he had only moved debris from  the front yard to the back, Schreiner said.  </P> <P> Leben could not be reached for comment and does not have an attorney.  </P></p>

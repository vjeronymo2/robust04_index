			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel of Militia Kuzma Shalenkov, chief of </F> department of the Main Administration on Economic Crimes of the  MVD of Russia: "How Do We Respond to Bandit Terror?]    [Text] Up until 1991 the number of crimes registered in the  banking system were few in number, but in 1992 the organs of  Internal Affairs of Russia instituted 617 criminal cases  involving facts of criminal phenomenon, but for 11 months of  this year--more than 1,500! The greatest public danger is  characterized by embezzlement with the use of counterfeit advice  notes, Rossiya checks, and other payment documents.    The first information on embezzlement using fictitious  advice  notes began to show up in January-May 1992, when 12 forged  documents with requisitions of banks of the Chechen Republic  turned up within the purview of employees of the Main  Administration for Fighting Economic Crimes. Over 1,400 cash  centers of the Bank of Russia began to calculate the "Chechen  advice notes." The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposed that  the leadership of the former Supreme Soviet make it incumbent  upon the TsBR [Central Bank of Russia] to verify the payments  and report on the results obtained, not to the MVD but to the  Supreme Soviet.    More than a year passed. In some regions, payments were not  yet verified for 1990.    V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, said  that somehow employees of the Central Bank of Russia had  succeeded in "catching" fictitious payments for 1 trillion  rubles [R], but nonetheless, 5-10 percent, on his admission, got  through; that is, R50-100 billion was credited this year and the  money embezzled. However, the Central Bank is not hurrying to  complete the work on verification of payments, as the results  obtained will show the ineffectiveness of the bank's activity in  regulating money circulation. But to place the blame for what  happened only on the Central Bank would be the height of  injustice. Evidence was acquired within the scope of specific  criminal cases that the organizers of acts concerning crediting  resources according to counterfeit documents were sometimes bank  employees themselves, and sometimes also the managers of those  banks that were experiencing a "credit shortage." In just one of  the criminal cases, criminal proceedings are being instituted  against Lazarev, who works as the director of the Moscow branch  of the KB [commercial bank] Terra-Bank, his deputy, Shchebrev,  and the chief bookkeeper of the Moscow branch of the  East-Siberian Commercial Bank, Nikishin. In another case, the  chairman of the board of the Soyuzprombank, Letunov, was  arrested. Evidence was also obtained regarding participation in  embezzlement of I. Medkov, manager of the Pragma-Bank, who was  killed in September of this year. This sorrowful list can be  continued.    Sometimes financial swindling happens out of sympathy for,  so  to say, professional solidarity. The former chief bookkeeper of  the RKTs [cash center] of the Main Administration of the Central  Bank of Russia for the city of Moscow, Prilepsheva, knew that  R2.7 billion being earmarked for a client of the Progressbank  commercial bank were not secured by real resources, but she made  a temporary credit entry of the indicated sum to a correspondent  account of the bank. She explained this with the fact that the  bank was in a difficult financial position, and she felt very  bad for her good friend who works in this bank as a bookkeeper.    The gratuitous use of state resources becomes food for other  commercial banks. Thus, for example, out of the 10 commercial  banks being studied by our group, more than R20 billion were  credited for 45 counterfeit advice notes. The monetary resources  were at the disposal of the banks from one to eight or nine  months, after which the "forgery" was "suddenly" found and the  sums written off. It is perfectly clear that R20 billion in  October-December 1992 was nowhere near the same as R20 billion  in August-September 1993.    The interests of the bank also require criminal-legal  protection. A "debit balance" sometimes arises because credits  are dispensed but the bank cannot get them back--there are no  capabilities. Swindling borrowers know this, and take advantage  of it to the utmost.    There is only one solution at the stage of forming market  relations--intensify criminal-legal repression. If you take bank  credit, you return it with interest at the specified date. If  you fail to do so--it means jail. Otherwise, order cannot be  maintained.    As a preventive measure, the Main Administration for  Fighting  Economic Crimes of the MVD of Russia is developing a mechanism  for the Association of Russian Banks to access name and  fingerprint reports on individuals. After all, before doing  business with a person it is not bad to know at least something  about his past, especially if it is a criminal past. The second  step in this direction will be the formation at the  Interdepartmental Commission on the Coordination of the Actions  of Banks and Law Enforcement Organs of a federal report of  structures that are parasites on the market economy, and also  the same kind of report on persons who work in these structures.</p>

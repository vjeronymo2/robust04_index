			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Mario Diaz; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The two leading presidential candidates' intense  political activities along the Atlantic coast coincided with a  survey published by the newspaper EL TIEMPO today showing  Ernesto Samper received 49 percent of voter support compared  with 39 percent for Andres Pastrana. This brings Ernesto Samper  close to the percentage of votes that would determine the  presidential elections in the first round.    [Begin Samper recording] I think the decision to choose Dr.  Humberto de la Calle was predictable, as the report so clearly  states. He is a serious, very responsible person, a great  constitutionalist, and he is well aware of the country's  problems. He guarantees not only a responsible ticket but also  the Liberal Party's unity. [end recording]    Samper also warned of the risks of being overconfident:    [Begin Samper recording] My principal enemy at this moment  is overconfidence. I ask all those who have supported me,  especially the Liberals, not to ease up in this campaign. The  election is not won yet. It is true things are going along very  well, but we must do better to exceed the 50 percent needed to  win in the first round. [end recording]    Samper and Pastrana concentrated their political activities  on the Atlantic coast. This area of the country has become a  decisive factor in the campaign, given its enormous electoral  potential.</p>

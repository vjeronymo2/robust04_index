			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Letter: Dividend cuts and dubious performers Sir, Adoption of a long-term dividend policy appropriate to investors and compatible with a company's cash needs is sensible. But Prof Paul Marsh argues (Personal View, August 12) for adherence to 'conventional ground rules'. Companies smooth dividends to balance cash needs and investor requirements. When the outlook improves, inevitably this is painless; with a downturn it is not. But a dividend reduction may well be consistent with achieving the new balance required and should not be ruled out. Thus bad news exists for the company whether the dividend is cut or not. But his article implies that the very fact that there is a dividend cut creates abnormal returns. This cannot be right. The cut is probably inevitable; but declaring it does not in itself put it into the 'club of dubious performers'. Dividend announcements are important and do have an impact on investor returns by affecting stock price. But Prof Marsh's conclusion is too simple. He does not clearly prove asymmetry (marginal returns in an increase not equal to returns on a similar reduction) because he does not seem to compare same-size dividend increases and reductions. His graphs show abnormal changes in returns before the dividend announcement  -revealing dividend announcements are not the only way a company can inform investors. I wonder how many of the dividend announcements used in the research were made at the same time as other announcements or annual results. For a company unable to fund its dividend in the short term it is a financing problem; but, longer term, not to the point where a company should consistently borrow to finance the dividend and the profitable investments he endorses. Apart from the cost of debt rising, as lenders see the uncovered dividend and rising gearing, investors can probably borrow on their own account as easily. Anyway, most investors are advised to spread their risk by investing in a portfolio. Finally, in his opening example, if no dividends had been paid by shares in the portfolio, then presumably there would have been a marginal increase in the share price, compensating the investor for the dividend forgone.

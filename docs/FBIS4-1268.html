			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Efforts have been going on to put finishing touches  to Liberia's Transitional Government. One of the participants,  ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], has  again been split by factional fighting. Krahn supporters of  Roosevelt Johnson have been battling with Alhaji Koromah's  Madingo forces at the Po River bridge just northwest of  Monrovia. It follows last month's assault on ULIMO headquarters  at Tubmanburg by Johnson's forces. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey  Allison telexed this report:    Factional fighting continued this morning with skirmishes at  (Krombatkam), a village 300 yards from the Po River bridge,  sparking off a wave of panic-stricken residents behind ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring  Group] checkpoint south of the bridge. One of the fleeing  residents, Joshua Schneider, who appeared terrified, said that  the villagers took to their heels as the sound of gunfire neared  the center of their village.    Troops of the peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, deployed south of  the Po River bridge, have sealed off the area to normal traffic.  ECOMOG troops on the Po River highway today told journalists  that one of their sergeants had been killed in crossfire in  yesterday's gunbattle at the bridge. Commanders of the Koromah  faction still in control of the Po River bridge said seven Krahn  soldiers were killed in yesterday's fighting around the Po River  alone. ECOMOG troops near the bridge confirmed that 35 Krahns  were rescued and taken to the headquarters of the peacekeeping  force. A commander of Alhaji Koromah's Madingo faction said  there are still pockets of the Krahns in the forest and we will  institute a systematic mopping-up exercise to rid the area of  any threat.</p>

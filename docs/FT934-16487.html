			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: Tales for fun - and tales for real - Television Happy the writer who not only sees the TV adaptation of his book puffed on billboards but has his name hoisted into the title. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (Tuesdays, C4) has earned golden opinions as a faithful adaptation of a book with the status in Britain of being a minor classic of 20th-century American fiction. Interestingly, Maupin is not nearly such a phenomenon in the US where he is seen principally as a gay writer for a 'niche market'. Tales of the City originated in 1976 as a daily serial contributed by Maupin to the San Francisco Chronicle - not exactly a heavyweight but a family paper all the same. Running Maupin was a bold editorial decision, and some of the book's pleasure lies in imagining the impact that its light-hearted description of bath-houses, gay bars and cruising supermarkets must have had on the newspaper's more uptight readers. Inevitably, that piquancy is missing now that Tales of the City has been translated to the small screen. However, my disappointment with the TV version arises from the great virtue of the book. Maupin's chapters are only a page or so long and written with such clarity that it is impossible not to wolf one of his books down in one gulp. In Richard Kramer's respectful screenplay, the scenes are correspondingly short and the result is dialogue so sparse that it sags like an old curtain. Tales of the City started off like a somnolent alternative soap. Only into hour three has it picked up speed as the charm of Maupin's characters takes effect. Acting ranges from fair to terrific. There is a problem with DeDe Day, the spoilt little rich girl, who even by California standards hardly seemed fat enough to make sense of her crash diet to win back Beauchamp, the tomcat husband. Olympia Dukakis and Donald Moffat play a touching autumnal romance as Anna Madrigal and Edgar Halcyon, the advertising executive living on borrowed time. If you have not guessed Mrs Madrigal's secret, it is safe with me. Plain Tales from Northern Ireland (Thursday, BBC 2) is an outstanding documentary series about the people of County Fermanagh, a beautiful region of pastures and lakes that borders the Irish Republic. It is essential viewing for anyone who has ever wondered gloomily what kind of an insane society Northern Ireland must be. Writer and director Carlo Gebler is an outsider who has chosen to live and work in Ulster. As Gebler explained in a particularly illuminating programme earlier in the series, he chose to move to Enniskillen, Fermanagh's principal town. Imagine telling them in New York that a sane person might actually choose to raise a family in the place sometimes described as the British Bosnia. One objective of the series is simply to show that life in the province is not as bad as outsiders think. 'Such an appealing place to raise a family', Gebler calls Northern Ireland. 'An unspoilt world . . . crime is low . . . children can play in the street.' Nonetheless, the knowledge is inescapable that in this redoubt of old-fashioned family values, families are destroyed and blighted by violence every new day. Gebler went to Enniskillen as a resolutely impartial outsider and yet he admits that as time has gone by, it has become harder not to be affected by the tug of ancient allegiances which lie 'like an old magnet in a drawer' beneath the attractive surface of life in the province. It would be wrong to give the impression that Plain Tales from Northern Ireland is just another of those all too familiar television ego-trips for writers. Gebler's real subject is the people of Fermanagh. Without sentiment or prurience, Plain Tales evokes the stoicism of Fermanagh people and their matter-of-fact way of dealing with shock and tragedy. In one programme we met the affable proprietor of a chain of drapery stores, preparing to move back into premises destroyed by an Easter fire-bomb. A former lieutenant-colonel of the UDR, he never knows when he may not again stare into the eyes of the gunman. Last time, it was at point-blank range as he arranged a shop-window. As is the way of the place, he knew his assassin. In 15 years, three of his staff have been widowed by the Troubles. 'It's just part of the game,' he commented. Northern Ireland conforms to what a visitor expects when there are armoured cars in the streets, flags are flying and kerbstones are painted out in sectarian colours. The puzzlement comes in the towns and villages, which outwardly lack the tribal markings. Outsiders are misled by the signs and symbols, warns Gebler, who intentionally does not point out whether it is Catholic or Protestant who is speaking. This week's programme about 'The Impartial Reporter' was the most subtle so far and could have seemed a trifle dull to anyone who had not watched the rest of the series. A Unionist newspaper, The Reporter, has been owned by four generations of the Trimble family of Enniskillen. Everyone in Fermanagh reads it, Catholic and Protestant, and it makes a profit for its proprietress. The paper prides itself on impartiality but more than that, its editor pursues a policy of stimulating debate. As Gebler points out, in a society where each side is convinced it knows what the other one thinks, even to point out that there are legitimate grounds of debate requires courage. If you have not been watching Plain Tales, there is just one part left. Anyone who has will surely agree that this series has made a significant contribution to helping outsiders see the people of Ulster more clearly and sympathetically. As everyone knows, Hitler was an incorrigible showman. This week's fascinating Timewatch: The Mother of All Battles (BBC 2, Wednesday), provided yet another example of Hitler's extraordinary propensity to turn life into theatre. A German general recalled the meeting with Hitler on July 1, 1943, four days before the start of the epic Battle of Kursk in the Ukraine. It was a conflict months in the preparation that was to claim more casualties than the entire British losses during the second world war. The generals stood in a semi-circle, waiting for their Supreme Commander to discuss the battle plan. Hitler strode in and stared each man in turn full in the eye and then, without a word, strode out. The stunned generals could only think that Hitler must have been reenacting a famous painting of Frederick II, addressing his commanders on the eve of battle. Who said something about hearing the word culture and reaching for a revolver?</p>

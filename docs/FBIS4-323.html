			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Whitfield, Esther Waugh, and Helen Grange] </F>   [Text] Proposals will be put to King Goodwill Zwelithini at  today's bush summit with the country's major political leaders  which could break the political logjam behind the violence  sweeping kwaZulu/Natal. There were also indications last night  that special provisions could be made for the boycotting Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) to still take part in provincial elections.  However, Government and ANC sources were adamant that this  month's poll would not be delayed, either nationally or in any  province.    Sources in all camps were yesterday also warning against  overdue optimism, predicting that a day of "very tough talking"  lay ahead. The ANC issued a blunt statement insisting that the  kwaZulu government be stripped of its powers.    Yesterday President de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela  met for brief discussions on the meeting. Government and ANC  negotiators also held talks. The king, De Klerk Mandela and  kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi will gather at a  secret bush venue early today for the critical talks, which  could hold the key to a peaceful election and an easing of the  crackling tensions in kwaZulu/Natal. The king and Mandela will  meet from 9AM for about an hour before joining the other leaders  for day-long discussions.    It is evident that the king's position would be critical to  the outcome of the talks. He is likely to be offered some form  of constitutional entrenchment of the Zulu monarchy. Although  he has rejected similar overtures in the past, sources were last  night confident the king's demands could be accommodated in new  proposals.    "But progress effectively depends on whether the King is  prepared to soften his demand for independence for kwaZulu and  Natal," a source said. It was reported yesterday that Zulu  royals believed the king would be prepared to drop his  independence demands, but that these would again be linked to  IFP demands, for changes to the Interim Constitution.    Should King Goodwill accept a deal, he will be expected to  drop his opposition to this month's election. In recent weeks  the king has said that he could not encourage his subjects to  vote, but stopped short of calling for a boycott.    Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairman Mr Justice  Johann Kriegler said yesterday his organisation was  investigating the possibility of reprinting the provincial  ballot papers for the kwaZulu/Natal and PWV  [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] provinces should today's  summit result in the IFP's participation in the election. It  would not be possible to amend the national assembly ballot  paper at this late stage, he said. However, IFP spokesman Ziba  Jiyane indicated yesterday that if the IFP did decide to  participate, it would only do so on a national level.    The ANC said in a statement last night that it would "not  accept any attempt to frustrate the holding of elections either  in Natal or the country as a whole".</p>

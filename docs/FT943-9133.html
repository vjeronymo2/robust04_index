			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: BOC hard hit It was unfortunate for specialist gases business BOC that it announced third-quarter figures on a day that interest rate concerns dominated the market. The misfortune was compounded by the absence of a finance director at the meeting with analysts and the net result was a slide of 31 to 714p in the share price. In fact, the underlying figures were less grim than the stock performance suggested. There was concern over increased competition to Forane, the anaesthetic gas, following expiry of the patent, and worries over the fall in gas margins. But Mr Jeremy Chantry of Kleinwort Benson who recently advised investors to take profits in the stock argued that gas demand was high and margins were merely affected by a shift of business to the US, where competition was historically greater. Although he trimmed back his full-year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 350m, he suggested that at current levels the shares were beginning to see yield support. Composite insurer Royal Insurance was the best performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, outside of the utilities, as the market gave a positive response to much higher than expected interim results. The shares settled 6 firmer at 265p. Royal's profits, at Pounds 191m, were around 25 per cent ahead of the most optimistic expectations, while the 4p dividend was a penny higher than the general consensus. Mr Andrew Pitt at BZW, the investment bank, described the results as 'outstanding' and the strength of UK profitability as 'quite staggering'. BZW hoisted its current-year forecast by Pounds 60m to Pounds 400m and that for 1995 by Pounds 45m to Pounds 440m. The investment bank increased its dividend projections for Royal to 12p for 1994 and 15p for 1995. Mr Pitt said the valuation case for buying Royal was 'overwhelming', especially since the shares are trading at a 14 per cent discount to the current net asset value of 308p a share. Chemist group Boots underperformed the market after securities house Hoare Govett put out a critical piece of research on the extent of the group's retail potential. Hoare poured some cold water on the argument that the trend towards over the counter medicines would boost profits. It argued that if price controls were relaxed, the chemist's profit margins could be eroded. It added that as the trend for self-medication continues, more competitors may want to grab a slice of the OTC market. Boots slid 9 to 525p. Turnover in Storehouse jumped to 12m and the stock eased 2 to 222p, after Smith New Court bought 6m shares and placed most of the stock with institutions. Grand Metropolitan was a busy market as two brokers recommended the stock. The shares rose 4 to 429p in heavy volume of 8.3m as Robert Fleming suggested that investors switch out of Allied-Lyons and into GrandMet. Allied gave up 6 at 587p. Northern Foods firmed 10 to 226p, with Smith New Court, the group's broker, said to have shown a keen interest in the shares. Nervous trading in Unilever ahead of today's figures left the stock 14 lower at 1042p. The range of forecasts is between Pounds 530m and Pounds 600m. Talk that it will buy Eastman Kodak's household products division continued to circulate. Encouraging first-half figures from Reed International were insufficient to prevent a dramatic turnround in the share price. The stock opened 11 higher as the international publisher revealed profits up 12 per cent. But there was some concern over medical publishing sales which were 9 per cent below last year, and also the group's performance in the US. The shares fell to end 22 off at 806p but mainly as a result of profit-taking. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

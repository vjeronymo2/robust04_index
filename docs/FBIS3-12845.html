China's foreign minister during his two-day  visit to Tehran will meet with Iranian officials. The two sides  will discuss mutual relations, as well as regional and  international issues.    It is well [as heard] to mention that China and Iran have  their relations since many years ago and, despite ups and downs  in the world policies, Sino-Iranian relations have always  enjoyed a positive stability. At this juncture of time, too,  leaders of the two countries intend to further strengthen their  friendly relations.    Beyond doubt, the expansion of cooperation between Iran and  China as two independent countries in the East and West Asia  indicate the significance of the relations in various  dimensions. Political analysts believe that common cultural and  deep-rooted Sino-Iranian civilization in the past as well as  strong ties between the two countries have promoted  Tehran-Peking relations to a fruitful and strategic level in the  region and the world.    The Islamic Republic of Iran and China enjoyed good  economic,  trade, political, and cultural relations during the years  following the culmination of the Islamic revolution in Iran.  During the years parallel to the regular formation of economic  joint commission, and tasked by the high-ranking officials of  the two countries, the volume of trade exchanges between them  increased to $710 million dollars in 1993. Presently, Iran and  China have extensive cooperation in the field of energy,  transportation, telecommunication, mines, industry, agriculture,  transfer of technology, and exchange of scientific information.    In view of the independence of Central Asian Republics  following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the existence of  exceptional potentials in Iran and China, the Central Asia has  presently turned into an area of economic and trade activities  and has expanded international cooperation among east, west, and  central Asia.    In the meantime, the Islamic Republic of Iran and China have  identical stands towards international issues, especially the  U.S. and West pressures against the Third World countries by  playing an active role. Hence, the two countries' cooperation  can foil the plots hatched by the enemies. On this basis,  reciprocal visits by the officials of the two countries and the  exchanges of views and consultations on various affairs can  boost the mutual understanding.    The visit to Tehran by China's Qian Qichen would undoubtedly  open a new horizon in expanding the relations between the two  countries.</p>

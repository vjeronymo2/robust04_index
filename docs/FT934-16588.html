			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Yeltsin's Tokyo visit to go ahead PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is to go ahead with a three-day visit to Tokyo from next Monday, a move which is likely to improve sensitive relations with Japan. His cancellation of two visits to Tokyo during the past year has blocked progress on a dispute over four islands off northern Japan which were seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. The cancellations also risked a snub to Japan, Russia's third largest aid donor. Tokyo yesterday voiced formal regret about the bloodshed in Moscow, but said it would continue to provide financial assistance to Russia. 'We must support (Mr Yeltsin's) way of thinking, which should be good for the world economy as well as world peace,' said Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. Japan has provided Dollars 5bn to Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed. But it says larger-scale economic aid depends on progress on the islands question. Russia and Japan have yet to sign a formal second world war peace treaty because of the this. Their return to Japan is becoming an increasing issue of national pride, as Tokyo becomes more confident in international affairs. 'I think it is the right way, to follow the existing policy, to expand economic and political ties at the same pace,' said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister. Given Mr Yeltsin's problems at home, Japanese officials do not expect to make great progress on the dispute. But they value the opportunity to keep negotiations going. A Russian delegation is expected to visit Tokyo today to prepare the ground.</p>

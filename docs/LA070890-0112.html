			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEA FOR BUILDERS TO AVOID WHITTIER  </P> <P> I hope Jeanne Muhlestein is right when she says that responsible developers  have become wary of bringing their business to Whittier ("Projects Exempted  from Whittier's Building Freeze." The Times, July 1). We can only hope that all  the other developers will follow their lead.  </P> <P> RICHARD V. ARKLIN  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

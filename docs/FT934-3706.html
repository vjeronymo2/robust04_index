			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Ivory Coast left an explosive legacy President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, Africa's longest serving leader, died yesterday at the age of 88. He was the only leader the country had known since independence from France in 1960. The speaker of parliament, Mr Henri Konan Bedie, subsequently announced that he had become president, sparking a struggle for the succession with the prime minister, Mr Alassane Ouattara. Whether out of vanity or superstition, Mr Houphouet-Boigny had refused to groom an heir. 'An African chief never names his successor,' he once said, and the subject became taboo. In the past few days a succession crisis had developed. Mr Konan Bedie's constitutional claim to the presidency, as parliamentary speaker, was strongly contested by supporters of the prime minister, and by opposition leaders. Ivorians had been expecting the death of the president, who was stricken by prostate cancer and had not been seen in public after he flew home from Europe in a hospital aircraft on November 19. He stayed in his palace in the town of Yamoussoukro, his birthplace. The succession row centred on Article 11 of the constitution, which states that the parliamentary speaker takes over at the president's death, ruling until the next elections. But Mr Ouattara's supporters have been campaigning for round-table talks to agree an interim authority until elections. Although Mr Konan Bedie, a career politician from the president's Baoule tribe, has the strongest claim to the presidency, Mr Ouattara, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, enjoys a more solid reputation. Mr Ouattara is nominally in charge of a government that has drifted for most of this year. Under Mr Houphouet-Boigny, Ivory Coast became the world's leading cocoa producer and third coffee exporter. But it was too dependent on fluctuating commodity prices and recent years have seen unemployment, crime and corruption soar. Policies that could arrest the Ivory Coast's economic decline have not been forthcoming. France, which has paid the country's annual Dollars 350m (Pounds 250m) debt-servicing bill to the World Bank since 1992, is threatening to withdraw its support at the end of the year. The country cannot service its Dollars 17.3bn foreign debt by itself. The collapse of commodity prices has impoverished the country. The World Bank estimates per capita incomes have plunged by 25 per cent since 1987. 'It is a decline comparable only to the hardships suffered in the Soviet Union,' says a World Bank economist, 'without safety nets or programmes for the poor.' In the minds of many Ivorians, the country's economic malaise became fused with the president's declining health. Ivorians fear there is no one of Houphouet-Boigny's stature to rein in ethnic and social tensions which threaten West Africa's most stable regime. 'Houphouet's legacy is crumbling,' says Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the largest opposition party, the Front Populaire Ivoirien. 'The ruling party is tearing itself apart in the leadership struggle; the government is bankrupt; civil servants are on strike. Our task today is to rebuild this crumbling edifice together.' So far, Mr Gbagbo's message has fallen on deaf ears. Racist overtones have crept into the fray. Newspapers backing Mr Konan Bedie denounce Mr Ouattara as a 'foreigner' because he was educated in Burkina Faso and the US. Newspapers behind the prime minister attack the Konan Bedie camp as 'fascists'. Underlying the concerns of many diplomats is the fear that if the politicians cannot agree among themselves, the military will take over. Mr Konan Bedie, 59, enjoys the backing of France, and the US, where he served as a young ambassador after independence. His only career setback was in 1977 when he was removed from overall charge of the Ivorian economy and sent into exile as an adviser to the World Bank in Washington. At the time, Mr Konan Bedie had presided for 11 years over an economy that enjoyed steady growth. Mr Houphouet-Boigny sacked him and other ministers after financial scandals. But in 1980 he was back, elected as parliamentary speaker.</p>

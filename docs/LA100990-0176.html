			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: DIVIDENDS IN 'GOODFELLAS'; 'RICHARD III' RAVES FOR KEACH  </P> <P> GOODFELLA PAUL Sorvino is reaping the benefits of appearing in Martin  Scorcese's lavishly praised "GoodFellas" gangster flick. He has just signed two  new movie deals. The first with Rita Moreno, called "Life in the Fast Food  Chain," and then he moves on to Disney for an as-yet-untitled film with Timothy  Dalton, who is taking a respite from his duties as James Bond.  </P> <P> IN WASHINGTON, they are talking about Stacy Keach! Keach opened last week at  the Folger Theater in "Richard III" to incredible reviews -- the kind most  actors only dream of. Some critics have gone so far as to call Stacy, once TV's  Mike Hammer, "the new Laurence Olivier"! (Oh, look, let's just leave that  alone.)  </P> <P> Stacy, his wife, Malgosia, and their new baby are settled in Washington until  his sold-out stint as "Richard III" closes Nov. 10.  </P> <P> I TOLD you the other day that word of mouth on Barbra Streisand's "The Prince  of Tides" movie is just great, and how happy Barbra is with her leading man,  Nick Nolte. Well, it seems that everybody connected with Barbra's labor of love  (she is the director, the star and the producer) is happy at this point. Pat  Conroy, who wrote the book on which the film is based, has this to say:  "Streisand's smart as hell to take this novel of biblical length and pretension  and break it down into a movie. She's not afraid of anything. Her sheer will is  the reason this movie is getting made."  </P> <P> "The Prince of Tides" is still filming, and obviously nobody can predict a hit  or miss, no matter the talent involved. But I do foresee that by the time this  movie is ready for release, we will be in the grips of Streisand-mania. This  is, after all, Barbra's first big screen effort since "Yentl," way back in --  can you believe it -- 1984?!  </P> <P> THE GREAT actress Sylvia Sidney was all but given up for dead earlier this  year. She was dreadfully ill and even in a coma at one point. But now Sidney,  who began her movie career in 1929, has made an amazing health comeback, and  will be on hand to receive honors from the Film Society of Lincoln Center on  Nov. 20 in New York.  </P></p>

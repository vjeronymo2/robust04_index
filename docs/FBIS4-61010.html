			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 30 April EESTI SENUMID, HOMMIKULEHT, POSTIMEES, p 1, </F> 4; "News Bulletin" No. 83/94]    [Excerpt] Monday, 2 May -- A summit meeting might help to  end the deadlock in Estonian-Russian relations, President  Lennart Meri told at a meeting with a group of Russian  journalists on Thursday [28 April].    Delayed negotiations have a negative feature of making the  delegations concentrate on details and forcing them to forget  the strategic directions, Meri said. He hoped that a meeting  with the Russian president might give new life to the  negotiations. The president admitted that his contacts with  Boris Yeltsin have been limited to letters so far. "Obviously,  the relations with the Baltic states are not a central issue of  the Russian foreign policy and the negotiations have been slowed  down accordingly," he said.    Meri welcomed the idea of finding an international mediator,  for example, the president of Finland. He also said that the  freezing of the Estonian-Russian border issue for 5-10 years  could be possible in order to enable to find a correct solution  to the issue. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: US rate rise decision too late to affect London - Market Report The London stock market was again preoccupied with watching for any signs of a precursor to a shift in US interest rates, eventually ending a tense but largely boring session marginally higher on balance. The FT-SE 100 Index settled with a net gain of 5.1 at 3,147.3, having moved in a narrow range throughout the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index delivered another uninspiring performance, closing 4.1 lower at 3,715.1. While dealers remained on alert for the rise in US rates, which could impact on the large number of UK stocks traded on Wall Street, the move of 50 basis points in the Fed Funds rate came two hours after London closed. The market began the trading session in subdued fashion with marketmakers lowering their opening prices in the wake of an eight-point fall on the Dow Industrial Average. The early decline proved short-lived, however, as a lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement number of Pounds 1.1bn, compared with a consensus figure up around Pounds 1.5bn, boosted gilt-edged stocks and produced a keen rally in the equity market. Gilts were also supported by the latest survey of disitributive trades published by the Confederation of British Industry which pointed to a slowing of retail sales, a move interpreted in the City as reducing the possibility of an early increase in UK interest rates. Down some three points at the outset, the FT-SE 100 moved into positive territory within the hour, gradually climbing to reach the day's high point of 3,151.6, up 9.4, shortly after Wall Street opened and while the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting was in progress. But with Wall Street faltering, before embarking on another good rise after London had closed, the UK market began to ease off. As well as having to contend with an expected rise in US interest rates, the market has to face a welter of domestic economic news this morning. This will include unemployment figures for July, average earnings and, most importantly, inflation numbers for last month. Some forecasters are looking for a negative inflation result month on month. Turnover yesterday came out at 511.8m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for around 57 per cent of activity. The value of customer business on Monday was a slightly disappointing Pounds 1.145bn. Meanwhile, a buzz of excitement went around the trading desks in the late afternoon as dealers picked up whispers that a big FT-SE 100 bid could be in the offing. GEC was one name being bandied about as a potential bid target for one of the big conglomerates such as BTR or Hanson. This story was mostly dismissed by analysts, who pointed out that GEC was much more likely to emerge as a predator than a target. And traders again began to focus on the obvious benefits of a merger between British Aerospace and GEC, which have been involved in tentative merger talks in the past. There was heavy trading in GEC stock, with one leading UK broking house said to have bought the stock aggressively, while British Aerospace shares were being chased in the market. Marketmakers also pointed out that GEC was in a strong position to buy in its own shares. Another takeover candidate, according to the market, was Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, with Glaxo one name being mooted. The regional electricity stocks were also being viewed as potential takeover targets. Bank shares continued to attract switching, with HSBC again badly affected by worries of static underlying profits growth. Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered were the prime beneficiaries of the stories. Dealers pointed to Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley as brokers advising the switch.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 7 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Today Costa Rican  President Rafael Angel Calderon expressed his solidarity with  the Mexican Government, and he called on the rebel groups  operating in several towns in the Mexican state of Chiapas to  stop the violence.    The president said in a telephone call, "I expressed our  broad and brotherly solidarity to Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari, and today I want to take this opportunity to  publicly reiterate it."    Calderon said that the violent actions in Chiapas are  unjustified now that Salinas de Gortari "has made Mexico a  nation of great economic and social development, the fruits of  which are already being experienced by the people." Violence,  he stressed, has never been a foundation for democratization  processes or a permanent base for social achievements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Half of Spanish People Believe World </F> Is Less Secure Today"]    [Text] Madrid -- Almost half the Spanish people (48.2  percent) believe that the world is less secure today than 10  years ago in terms of the possibility of wars or large-scale  conflicts, and 23 percent have noted no changes.    According to a CIS (Sociological Research Center) opinion  poll on "perception of the international political scene," 56.7  percent of the Spanish people believe that the greatest danger  to international peace and security that currently exists is the  inequality between poor and rich countries, followed by the  larger number of states possessing nuclear weapons (35.6  percent). The resurgence of nationalism is cited third by 23.6  percent.  <H5>  Threat From East </H5>   This poll, conducted last November among 2,500 people, shows  that Russia and the former USSR as a whole, together with the  East European countries, is the area that represents the  greatest threat to world peace, according to 32 percent of the  interviewees, while 26.6 percent cite the Arab countries, and  22.6 percent the United States.    Half of the interviewees believe that, out of the possible  sources of international conflict, the political instability in  North Africa is the one that could most affect Spain's security,  while 34.4 percent mention the former Yugoslavia.    Nevertheless, three out of every four Spanish people do not  find that any country poses a direct threat to Spain, as against  8.4 percent who say yes. Out of these, 39.4 percent cite  Morocco, and in second place, with 14.5 percent, comes the  United States.  <H5>  Allied Countries </H5>   Some 35.7 percent of the interviewees do not believe that  Spain now has any allied country in particular, the United  States being the one cited most often, by 9.2 percent, followed  by France with 7.8 percent.    Two-thirds declare themselves in favor of a multinational  force's being able to intervene in third countries' internal  affairs under a UN mandate and with humanitarian aims. The  percentage remains in the majority (52.9 percent) if it is an  intervention not explicitly justified on humanitarian grounds.  Despite his disappearance from the political scene, Mikhail  Gorbachev remains the best-rated international leader (with 6.57  out of 10). John Paul II takes second place with 6.25, followed  by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with 5.76. Clinton comes  after French President Mitterrand, with 5.56, and Boris Yeltsin  scores only 4.47. Hassan II [of Morocco] scores 2.83, and Fidel  Castro 2.80.    With respect to the most popular areas, on a scale of 0 to  10  the European Union (EU) scores 6.48, and Latin America takes  second place with 6.19. The West European countries outside the  EU score 5.97, East Europe 5.65, and Russia 5.46. Interest and  liking fall to 5.39 for the United States and 5.10 for Japan,  and North Africa, India, and China rate below 4.0.    Within the EU, the most popular country is Germany for 33.9  percent of the interviewees, followed by Italy with 33 percent  and France with 31.7 percent. Liking for the other countries is  felt only by less than 20 percent, and the percentage of  interviewees showing no liking for any of the other EU countries  is 16 percent. At the world level, Italy is the most popular  foreign country (cited by 11.7 percent), followed by Germany  with 10.5 percent and France with 9.4 percent.    Assessing the country with the best model of democratic  functioning and greatest respect for human rights, 6.5 percent  cite the United States, followed by 5.7 percent who mention  Germany, and France with 5.2 percent. Spain is cited by 2.6  percent, behind Britain, Sweden, and Switzerland. For a quarter  of the interviewees, no country stands out in this sphere.    Some 61 percent believe that Spain should cooperate  internationally in order to assist the less developed countries'  problems, even if this entails a financial cost.  <H5>  Throne's Important Work </H5>   According to the CIS poll on "perception of the  international  political scene," 45.4 percent of the interviewees describe  Spanish foreign policy over the past few years as "very good" or  "good" overall, while 30 percent rate it as "average." In the  opinion of three-quarters of the interviewees, the throne's work  has been "very" or "quite" beneficial for Spain's relations with  other countries. The percentage falls to 47.1 percent if it is  a matter of rating Felipe Gonzalez; 29 percent regard his work  as "average" and 13 percent "poor" or "very poor."    Overall, 33 percent state that our country's international  situation has improved in the past decade, and 57.3 percent  believe that Spain's standing on the international scene is  "very good" or "good."

According to the interviewees, the best relations are  enjoyed  with Germany, followed by France and the United States. Some  47.7 percent state that Spain maintains a special friendship  with the Arab countries, while 26.6 percent believe that this is  not so. Out of these, 60 percent believe that it should strive  to achieve it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- Mayor Paulo Maluf believes Senator  Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA [Progressive Renewal Party-Para]) is  "a great candidate for the presidency of the Republic because he  is the only Brazilian who has been minister four times -- in the  labor, education, social welfare, and justice portfolios." Maluf  avoided talking about his own possible candidacy for Planalto  Palace, preferring instead to commend the president of the CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee] on the budget scandal,  stressing that Passarinho was elected senator three times, and  Para State governor and Congress president.    "Very few people in this country have Passarinho's political  background. If our party chooses him as a candidate, he will win  the election. He is austere and competent," Maluf said, without  explaining what that would do to his candidacy. "It is the party  that will decide who the candidate will be. If the party chooses  Passarinho, I will campaign for him morning, afternoon, and  night."  <H5>  Carnival </H5>   Asked how he would take it if the PPR chose him as  presidential candidate instead of Passarinho, Maluf said: "The  problem is undefined because I did not tell the party that I  wanted to become a candidate."    Recalling the lyrics of Chico Buarque of Holland's song,  Maluf said he is getting ready "for the arrival of carnival."  The mayor said he will make a decision on an eventual candidacy  after February. "We still are in January. Let us wait for  February. People say that Brazilian history begins after  carnival."  <H5>  Lula [Inacio Lula da Silva] </H5>   Maluf avoided attacking Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  with whom he participated in a luncheon at the house of actress  and former Deputy Ruth Escobar on 23 January. His criticism was  once again directed at Lula. "I think Lula is inadequate to  become president. First he should be a candidate to San Bernardo  City Hall. He should be a mayor for four years and then he  should be a gubernatorial candidate. If he is a good governor  for four years he could become a presidential candidate. He does  not have the executive experience to become president," Maluf  said.    In Maluf's opinion, "the PT [Workers Party] should elect  Mercadante (Deputy Aloizio Mercadante) who is a university  professor and has experience, or even [Luiza] Erundina, who  already has been [Sao Paulo State] governor."</p>

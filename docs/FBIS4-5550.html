			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The seventh board  meeting of the Asian Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea  (ARIJI) was held in New Delhi on April 8.    The meeting reviewed the activities of the ARIJI after its  sixth board meeting and discussed future tasks.    ARIJI Secretary General Govind Narain Srivastava made a  report titled "Let Us More Energetically Study and Disseminate  the Chuche Idea To Achieve Asian Independence".    The reporter said the achievements in the institute  activities in the period of review are that it has been proved  through realities that the confidence in socialism of chuche has  rooted in the minds of the Asian followers of the chuche idea as  a strong ideological pillar unshaken in any trial and the study  and dissemination of this idea have been conducted in various  forms and ways in close combination with the specific conditions.    "Those brilliant achievements are a precious fruition of the  wise guidance and deep solicitude of the great leader His  Excellency President Kim Il-song and the dear leader His  Excellency Kim Chong- il," he added, and said:    "We are facing an honorable task at present to consolidate  and develop these achievements and make a positive contribution  to bringing about a turn in the consciousness of the popular  masses who have risen up in accomplishing the noble cause of  building an independent, new world. Outlining the task, he said:    "If the study and dissemination of the chuche idea are to be  developed in conformity with the requirement of the realities,  greater efforts should be directed to the study and  dissemination of the ideas and theories of the dear leader His  Excellency Kim Chong-il.    "In recent years His Excellency Kim Chong-il has developed  and enriched the chuche idea and published many monumental works  giving profound answers to the urgent problems raised by the  present era.    "We should conduct brisk activities for the publication and  dissemination of these works, study and disseminate the chuche  idea with them as the basic textbooks, and study, analyse and  solve the practical problems on the basis of the profound ideas  expounded in the works.    We should expand the ranks of the followers of the chuche  idea and, on this basis, broaden our organizations and  strengthen ideological and moral unity and cohesion of their  members, thus making our organizations a model for the  collectives of socio-political life which serve the people's  cause of independence.    "Clearly conscious that defending Korean socialism is  immediately to defend our own idea, we should lift up louder  voices exposing and denouncing the imperialists' anti-socialist  moves and closely rally all the socialist forces under the  banner of the Pyongyang declaration. And we should wage a  vigorous movement against a nuclear war in Korea, solidarizing  with anti-war, peace organizations and make a positive  contribution to an early realization of the proposal for  founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, mindful of  the important position of the independent and peaceful  reunification of Korea in achieving the independence and peace  of our continent.</p>

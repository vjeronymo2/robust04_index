			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Burundi remained surprisingly calm after its  president's death on 6 April. This calm has just been shattered  20 days later. Elements of the Burundi Armed Forces, dominated  by the minority Tutsi tribe, tried once again to seize power  yesterday. The coup plot was quickly foiled and was mostly  unnoticed in Bujumbura. Here is our correspondent Celsius  Senguyunva with a report.    [Begin Senguyunva recording] Officially, the information has  not yet been confirmed or refuted. We have been able to obtain  some scraps of information from the Army Headquarters which say  that about 10 soldiers tried to stage a coup by mobilizing  others who did not follow them. These 10 people have been  arrested. The Army Headquarters is still not prepared to  disclose the identity of these people. All we know, and I am  repeating what the Army chief of general staff told us on the  phone just a while ago, is that the people who attempted to  stage this coup are the same ones who tried to stage the October  coup in which President Ndadaye was killed. He said that these  people were already on the black lists of the investigators and  could have been arrested at any moment. Reports trickling out  to us say that some of the soldiers managed to escape. There are  some senior officers among these soldiers. [end recording]    The mutiny was therefore quickly quelled in Bujumbura, but  the number of soldiers involved remains unclear. According to  the Army Headquarters, six or seven soldiers including four  officers have been arrested. Others managed to escape.  Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the current speaker of the National  Assembly, who is acting as president of the Republic, confirmed  the coup attempt to Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou.    [Begin recording] [Ntibantunganya] Last night, some unusual  movements were observed within a unit of the Burundi Army. The  Army chief of general staff and [words indistinct] military  defense units tried to monitor the movements and they confirmed  this morning that an attempt was made.    [Saliou] Could you confirm to us reports that the four  soldiers, who are allegedly the brains behind this putsch, have  been arrested?    [Ntibantunganya] Actually, two officers have been  interrogated at the Army Headquarters and have provided some  information, which I cannot comment on now.    [Saliou] Do you fear for your life now?    [Ntibantunganya] If someone is a politician he always fears  for his life. This is especially true in a country such as ours  which is experiencing difficulties, but I am not scared. [end  recording]    The new coup attempt in Burundi illustrates the agitation  within the ranks of some Tutsi extremist soldiers, who have  never accepted the coming into power of the Hutus, yet are  nonetheless in the majority. [passage omitted] This morning,  gunfire could still be heard in the outlying northern districts  of Bujumbura. Armed clashes have for several days now been  taking place between soldiers and armed Hutu militiamen.  However, according to military sources, these clashes are not  linked to the coup attempt. The rest of the capital and the  country is calm.</p>

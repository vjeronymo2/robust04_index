Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism,  launched the Marshall Plan and NATO to put war-shattered Europe  back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, cold war  warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation and  communication with China and the former Soviet Union  respectively.    By these historical standards, there is something both  consistent and logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under  the Vietnam War by his decision last night to end the trade  embargo. This is a president, after all, who never served in  uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the war. There  was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his  evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest  victim, nearly 20 years after military hostilities had ceased.    Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only  war the U.S. can definitively be said to have "lost" in 200  years that Mr Clinton did not rush into normalising relations  with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up political  constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road  map laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first  flushes of victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been  tempted also to come to terms with Vietnam.    America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since  President John Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist  tide over 30 years ago. It must begin with the 67,000-plus  soldiers who never came home and the many more who returned  maimed in body and mind, the first returning U.S. soldiers not  to be welcomed as conquering heroes.    It took many years, and more controversy, for their  sacrifice  finally to be recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on  the Washington Mall. It is a recognition like no other -- a  long low dark gray wall etched with the names of everyone who  died -- and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and classical  Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes.    The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in  popular culture, recognised in films and books beyond number.  Words and images from that era still resonate the "domino  theory," Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the My Lai massacre  and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of the  little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of  a captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the U.S.  embassy in Saigon as the last Americans were evacuated.    Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign  conflict which found the nation so divided. The chalice  inherited by the "best and the brightest" in government, who  flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly stayed with  Johnson, was poisoned.    Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to  society  so much less than they might have been. A few sought  consolation in different forms of public service -- like Robert  McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and guilt as defence  secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the World  Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting  together memoirs of the period.    Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil  in the streets of Washington and around his country, decided not  to run for re-election in 1968 and died, a broken man, three  years later.    His Democratic Party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost  the presidency in 1968 but took years to come to terms with  Vietnam, holding the White House for only four of the next 24  years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was captured by  George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to a  landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not  above manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the  election to maximise his victory (he lost only liberal  Massachusetts.)    Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy  Carter into the White House but he, too, was afflicted by the  Vietnam syndrome, this time in Iran. A botched rescue attempt  in the spring of 1980 of the U.S. hostages in Tehran came to  seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's  blunt assertion that he would set "a date certain" for release  of the hostages, in the absence of which U.S. bombs would start  falling.    Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this  lesson better, committing themselves to the doctrine of "main  force," winning little victories in Grenada and Panama and a big  one in the Gulf, and proclaiming with each notch on the belt  that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that U.S. forces would  now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not  help George Bush in 1992.    Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no  evidence of American appetite for foreign military adventure, be  it in Bosnia, Somalia or anywhere not incontrovertibly related  to the national interest.    This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the  imperatives of domestic renewal. But it may also be the real  final legacy of Vietnam. "No more war" was a powerful chant in  the streets of America in 1968. It would still be so today.</p>

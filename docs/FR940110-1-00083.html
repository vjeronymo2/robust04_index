			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.19(d)(2) of the proposed rule provides that during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term of a temporary suspension approved by the Board, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected Bank shall provide to the Board such financial reports as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board shall require to monitor the financial condition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank, and the Board shall continue to monitor the Bank's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition. The requirement that the Board shall monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's financial condition is added because it is required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.19(d)(3) of the proposed rule provides that if,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the conclusion of the temporary suspension period, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board determines that the Bank has returned to a position of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial stability, the Board may, upon written notice to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank, terminate the temporary suspension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Application for Extension of Temporary Suspension Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.19(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's board of directors determines that the Bank has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to, or is not likely to return to, a position of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial stability at the conclusion of the temporary suspension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the Bank may apply in writing for an extension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary suspension period, stating the grounds for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.19(e)(2) provides that the Board shall approve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or disapprove a Bank's application for an extension of a temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension period within 30 calendar days of receipt of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.19(e)(3) provides that the Board's decision on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an application for an extension of a temporary suspension period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be in writing, shall be accompanied by specific findings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons for such action, and shall state the effective date and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time period if an extension is approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Notice to Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.19(f)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board shall notify the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate not less than 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar days before any temporary suspension (or extension of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such suspension) approved pursuant to this section takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deleted from this provision is the requirement in the Board's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulation that a copy of the Board's suspension decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be forwarded to the Congress since, as discussed above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act only requires that the Board provide notice to Congress of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension decision. See 12 CFR 960.11(f); 12 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1430(j)(6)(F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.19(f)(2) provides that a temporary suspension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or extension of such suspension) shall become effective as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Board, unless a joint resolution of Congress is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted disapproving such suspension (or extension thereof). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule deletes the provision in the Board's existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation that a temporary suspension extension may not take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect until at least 30 days after the Board gives the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to Congress, because this is inconsistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the existing regulation that the Board must notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Congress at least 60 days before such extension takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See 12 CFR 960.11(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;960.19(f)(2) also deletes from the Board's existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation the requirement that a joint resolution of Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproving a suspension or extension of a suspension must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted prior to the Board's determined effective date, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to track more closely the actual language in the Act. See 12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1430(j)(6)(F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Affordable Housing Reserve Fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the Board's existing AHP regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.20(a) of the proposed rule provides that if a Bank fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use or commit the full amount of its required annual contribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the AHP, 90 percent of the amount that has not been used or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affordable Housing Reserve Fund established and administered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board. See 12 CFR 960.12. The 10 percent of the unused and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncommitted amount retained by the Bank should be fully used or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed by the Bank during the following year, and any remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution where amounts are remaining at the end of the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to fund the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language allowing these amounts to remain at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year is added in the proposed rule to take into account situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where amounts remain uncommitted at the end of the year because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the balance of required AHP contributions remaining is too small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fund the Bank's next highest scoring AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last sentence in proposed paragraph (a) also is new, making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicit that such amounts remaining and funds returned to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank shall fund other AHP projects and need not be transferred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.20(b) of the proposed rule provides that by January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted funds from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing Reserve Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

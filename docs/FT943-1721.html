			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities slip back as pessimism prevails Wall Street US stocks extended their losses yesterday as pessimism over monetary policy continued to dominate investment strategies, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.49 lower at 3,851.60, having recovered from a 47-point deficit at mid-afternoon. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.9 at 461.46. Volume on the Big Board was heavy, with 354m shares traded by the close. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 3.38 weaker at 454.77, and the Nasdaq composite was off 6.04 at 760.70. Bargain hunters were in short supply at the opening, despite a 67-point tumble by the Dow the previous session. Amid the current uncertainty over interest rates, investors were unable to stem the losing tide. On balance, the day's economic news was neutral for stocks. The commerce department said August housing starts had risen by 2.1 per cent, surprising analysts who were expecting a small decline. But economists later explained away the increase as a reflection of activity in the multi-family sector. Single-family starts, viewed as a more accurate barometer, were down last month. Equity investors again interpreted the data through its impact on bond prices. Initially, the announcement of the headline figure send Treasuries into retreat. Stocks took the bait and plunged. After the data had been interpreted, bonds quickly pulled back to within a few ticks of their starting point. The Dow industrials followed suit. By early afternoon, however, the blue chip index was still showing solid losses, as investors tried to calculate the odds on whether the Federal Reserve policy would remain on hold until after the November elections. Mr Wayne Angell, chief economist for Bear Stearns and a former Fed governor, came out on the side of those betting on an early move, saying there was a 60 per cent chance the central bank would decide to tighten at its September 27 policy meeting. With such speculation afoot, the market's negative tone would not budge. The Dow industrials plunged anew, only to retrace their steps for a second time. By the close, Caterpillar had slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/8 , Kodak fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 3/4 and General Motors dropped Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 48 5/8 . The session's biggest loser was Maybelline, whose share prices plunged 24 per cent, or Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 . Banco Wiese climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 in its debut session. It become the first Peruvian stock to be listed on the NYSE with its IPO of 2.4m shares. On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development led the technology sector's slide. The stock fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/2 after Mr Timothy McCollum, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, warned that lacklustre European sales could depress third-quarter results. Canada Toronto prices staged a late-session rally, but still closed lower in moderate trading, as the Toronto market once again followed the lead of its slumping counterpart in New York. The TSE 300 composite index fell 18.25 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at 4,358.62. Volume was 62.22m shares down from Tuesday's 65.58m, but trading value rose to CDollars 976.8m from CDollars 973.1m. Brazil Sao Paulo stocks rallied as Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's running mate appeared to be absolved of responsibility in an alleged kickback scheme, to which news reports had linked him. The exchange gained 1,662 points, or 3.2 per cent, to 53,435 points on the Bovespa Index, up from Tuesday's 51,773. The Rio de Janeiro Exchange gained 413 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 19,553 points on the BVRJ Index.</p>

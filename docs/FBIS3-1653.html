Shanxi courts handled a total of 9,413 economic disputes and  finalized 8,264 of them in 1993. They also settled through  mediation 4,268 economic disputes involving overseas partners.    These cases involved more than 1.2 billion yuan.    The positive role being played by the judicial bodies of the  province has guaranteed proper and timely settlements of cases  of bankruptcy, patents and contracts, which have burgeoned in  recent years as China pursues a market economy.    According to provincial authorities, 90 percent of the  economic disputes in Shanxi concern economic contracts and often  drag in large and medium-sized enterprises.    Courts in Shanxi have zeroed in on the `knot of triangular  debts', a lingering problem featuring a host of parties.    Officials said that courts in the province's Yangquan city  have helped enterprises collect debts worth more than 57 million  yuan and saved 40 enterprises from bankruptcy.    To tackle the increasing number of economic disputes arising  from the rush to profitable markets, many courts in Shanxi have  set up mediation centers, which have helped settle cases  involving more than 270 million yuan for some 2,300 enterprises.    The courts also have helped local tax departments gather 310  million yuan in taxes and collect some 730 million yuan in  overdue loans. The money, in turn, was used to redeem IOU scrip  issued to farmers [sentence as received].    In co-operation with their counterparts nationwide, the  courts have broken down local protectionism to settle  cross-province economic disputes. Incomplete statistics show  that Shanxi courts helped to collect more than 83 million yuan  from outside the province last year.    Shanxi courts have also kept a close look at the latest  developments in the forms of economic disputes, in a bid to  provide legal protection for the establishment of a modern  enterprise system in the province.</p>

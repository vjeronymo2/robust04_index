			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Man in the News: Hard wear for a software warrior - Ray Noorda / Louise Kehoe and Geof Wheelwright on the 'Mr Nice Guy' who has taken on Bill Gates Ray Noorda, 69, looks like everyone's favourite grandad. The chairman and chief executive of Novell, the world's second-largest personal computer software company - after its arch-rival Microsoft - drives a pick-up truck to work in Provo, Utah, and decorates his offices with folksy Norman Rockwell prints inscribed with uplifting mottoes. A more unlikely adversary of Bill Gates, the testy, boyish multi-billionaire chairman of Microsoft is hard to imagine. Yet 'Mr Nice Guy' Noorda, has shown that beneath the amiable exterior lies a determination to influence the direction of the computer industry. And that means putting Gates in his place. This week, it emerged that Novell has filed an anti-trust complaint against Microsoft with European Community competition authorities. Novell has also played an active role, behind the scenes, in providing information to US authorities, leading to a justice department anti-trust probe of Microsoft. Clearly rattled, Gates has lashed out at Noorda. 'He has a tremendous vendetta against us. Novell has made a conscious decision to spread lies about us,' he has charged. Responding calmly, Noorda says: 'We have felt that Microsoft has broken certain principles or codes of doing business. Wherever we see unfair practices . . . particularly if we feel they are injurious to the industry at large, we will probably complain to the recognised authorities.' Noorda defers to his lawyers on details of the complaint to the EC, which alleges Microsoft has abused its dominant market position in personal computer operating systems to restrict competition. He is, however, forthright on the principle involved. 'Competition is absolutely necessary for anybody to improve what they are doing. So it wouldn't be good either for Microsoft or for the industry if they were to achieve a monopoly.' Gates 'is not a bad guy, he is a young guy,' Noorda adds. 'In my more than 40 years in the industry I have not met a bunch like them. They are possessive, aggressive and strong challengers, but they are afraid of head-on competition and that is anathema to me.' Noorda's outlook has been shaped by attempts to compete with Microsoft in the market for PC operating systems. Novell charges that Microsoft protects its share of this segment of the software business - more than 90 per cent - through restrictive licensing schemes. Adding fuel to perceptions of uncompetitive trading is the abortive merger plan between the two companies, initiated by Gates last year, which was called off when Microsoft acquired another software company without telling Novell. Noorda says: 'I don't know what their motives were. I can only speculate. But perhaps they were trying to slow us down.' Noorda warns that computer users do not benefit if one company - be it Microsoft or IBM - becomes so dominant that it can dictate 'how the game is played'. During a career which began in the era of punch cards, Noorda believes the most significant technological change has been the emergence of the 'networking environment' in which different types of computer are linked throughout an organisation, sharing information and processing tasks. 'Today, the customers demand that everything has to work together,' Noorda says. 'That means that everyone in the computer industry has to work together. We have tried to make a successful business out of working with companies who would otherwise be called our competitors.' Noorda has coined the word 'co-opetition' to describe the complex relationships which can bring competitors to share, for example, technical details of forthcoming products to ensure that they work together. 'We feel that he who will co-operate the most with competitors will be the longer-term survivor,' Noorda says. This does not mean Noorda is a push over. Indeed, Novell is one of the few companies in the software industry that has gone head to head with Microsoft and won. Since he acquired Novell 10 years ago, Noorda has transformed what was a failing computer company into the leading supplier of software for personal computer networks, with more than 70 per cent of the world market. Turnover has increased from Dollars 3.8m in 1983 to Dollars 933m for its fiscal year ended October 31 1992. In the process, Noorda, with about 11 per cent of Novell's stock, has become a billionaire. But money does not seem to excite him. Until last year he drew a modest salary of Dollars 38,000 a year, preferring, he said, to spend money on hiring. The board of directors forced him to raise his salary to Dollars 198,000 after Wall Street observers suggested his commitment to the company might appear to be in doubt. Since he took over at Novell, Noorda has acquired 15 smaller companies, expanding Novell's technology base and demonstrating a rare ability successfully to manage mergers. The largest acquisition, completed in June, with the Dollars 322m purchase of Unix System Laboratories, a former AT&amp;T subsidiary, may stretch those skills. Assimilating USL's employees is a challenge, Noorda concedes. The recent departure of Roel Pieper, former president and chief executive of USL and a respected industry executive, for 'personal reasons', hints at how difficult the adjustment may be. The purchase of USL will also test Noorda's 'co-opetition' philosophy. Novell now controls Unix, the widely used computer operating system. This makes Noorda the referee in an industry-wide feud over competing versions of the program. The acquisition also places Novell in head-to-head competition with Microsoft's latest Windows NT, an advanced computer operating system that represents Microsoft's bid to expand beyond PCs. As Novell and Microsoft's ambitions increasingly overlap, the potential for conflict increases. Yet Noorda insists he is not aiming to depose Microsoft as the industry leader. 'Our motivation is not to own the industry, not to be the biggest company necessarily, but to accelerate the growth of the industry,' he says. 'That is our best chance for survival in this intensely competitive business.' It is this competitive challenge that seems to motivate Noorda. He has no plans to retire, he says, although he plans to name his successor at Novell later this year. 'I'll expire before I retire,' he quips. 'I hope to continue to be involved with Novell for a long time.' And for that long Microsoft is likely to feel the heat.</p>

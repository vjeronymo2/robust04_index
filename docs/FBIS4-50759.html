			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A senior official at  the State Copyright Bureau (SCB) today described China "an  active member of the international copyright community."    He cited numerous facts to show that China sets great store  by protecting the intellectual property rights in line with  international standards.    Shen Rengan, deputy bureau director, noted that under  China's  copyright law, works of foreigners first published in China will  enjoy copyright.    The law protects any work of a foreigner published outside  China which is eligible to enjoy copyright under an agreement  concluded between the country to which the foreigner belongs and  China, or under an international treaty to which both countries  are parties, he said.    Addressing an international seminar here on intellectual  property protection, he said that China makes such protection  "an important part of the policy of reform and opening to the  world."    Work began in 1979 to draft the law, which was promulgated  in  September, 1990 and went into effect in June 1991.    "In drafting the law," he said, "judicial organs and the  drafting group seriously studied the international copyright  convention and see to it that the law meets the requirements of  that convention."    China became the 93rd country to accede to the Berne  Convention when it joined in October, 1992 and accordingly, the  State Council published a set of rules to implement it.    That means, he said, that China provides protection to  authors of all member states of the convention and their works.    According to the State Council document, foreign computer  programs, once imported into China, automatically enjoy  protection for a period of 50 years, in conformity with  stipulations of the convention.    When foreign works are performed in China, the Chinese users  are obliged to acquire agreement in advance from the authors and  duly pay them afterwards.    The Copyright Bureau and the Ministry of Finance see to it  that Chinese users acquire the foreign currency needed to pay  the owners of the copyrights they have used, he said.    The copyright law, he said, "basically conforms to the  standards of the Berne Convention," but differences do exist.  "Preparations are under way to revise the law so that it  conforms entirely to the convention."    He added: "China has established a rather complete copyright  law system and implemented it."    Last May, he said, the Enesco Corporation in the state of  Ohio requested the SCB to investigate and redress a case of  alleged infringement of its copyright in China. It complained  that counterfeit copies of its toys were displayed on exhibition  counters during the Guangzhou Spring Export Commodities Fair.    After investigation, the SCB ordered the infringers to stop  reproducing and selling the counterfeit toys, to turn over all  the counterfeit toys to the local copyright administration, and  to pay a fine.    "The doors of the Chinese people's courts and the SCB are  always open," he said. "Anyone who possesses valid copyright  finds it infringed upon can, and is welcome to bring the case  before a people's court or the SCB."    He admits that some copyrighted works were and still are  pirated in China, especially books and video works.    He said China has spared no efforts in cracking down on  copyright infringements and will continue to do so.    According to shen, the SCB has submitted a draft bill to the  legislative body to impose criminal sanctions against piracy and  other serious copyright infringement acts.    "In the international copyright community," he said, "China  is still a relatively young member and therefore, needs the  assistance of those countries with a more developed copyright  system."</p>

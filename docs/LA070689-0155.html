			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPLEX FOR ELDERLY OPENS  </P> <P> A 241-unit senior-citizen apartment complex with 20% of its units reserved for  low-income residents opened last week in Monrovia.  </P> <P> Heritage Park Monrovia is the first and largest of five complexes being built  in a $57.5-million joint venture between Calmark Development Corp. and the  nonprofit Corporate Fund for Housing.  </P> <P> Monthly rents for the low-income apartments, based on the tenants' income,  start at $380 for one-bedroom units and $427 for two-bedroom units. The maximum  rent for the rest of the apartments is $525 for one-bedroom units and $670 for  two-bedroom units.  </P> <P> Similar projects will be completed in Diamond Bar, La Verne, Whittier and  Lakewood by next January, constituting 845 affordable housing units for  seniors, according to Mario Guerra, spokesman for the Southern California Assn.  of Governments.  </P> <P> SCAG was instrumental in the creation of the Corporate Fund for Housing with a  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant in 1984 to create more  affordable housing in Southern California. Over the next 20 years, the county's  population of senior citizens is expected to more than double, according to  SCAG projections.  </P> <P> Because it is nonprofit, the fund can issue tax-exempt bonds and finance the  developments at a lower cost, said Project Manager Scott Kutner.  </P> <P> "The main benefit is that the fund owns the projects, and long-term  affordability (of the apartments) is assured," he said.  </P></p>

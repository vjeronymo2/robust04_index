Information released by the bureau today showed that China's  birth rate was 18.09 per thousand and death rate 6.64 per  thousand, which meant a natural population growth rate of 11.45  per thousand.    Statistics indicated a remarkable increase in household  income. In urban areas, the figure per capita was 2,337 yuan  last year, a real hike of 10 percent over the previous year,  while in rural areas it was 921 yuan, a three percent real  increase.    But the Bureau pointed out that differences in income level  between provinces and between urban and rural households were  expanding and that living standards of a host of households  declined.    The Bureau said in a statistical communique that the reform  in the field of labor and employment had been accelerated,  leading to the improvement of the employment service system. By  the end of last year, employment agencies in China totalled  13,000 and 7.05 million people found jobs in cities and towns.    The urban unemployment rate was 2.6 percent last year, it  said.    China's workers and staff numbered 150.4 million by the end  of 1993, 2.48 million more than a year before, while workers in  private enterprises and individual workers numbered 11.16  million, an increase of 2.78 million.    Last year also saw a continued development of the social  welfare sector. There were 954,000 beds in social welfare  institutions of various types in China, with 706,000 people  being accomodated. Some 41 million people in need received  relief from the government.    At the same time, the social security network extended to  nearly 32 percent of rural townships, 97,000 community service  facilities in urban areas were established and workers' pension  insurance was expanding.    China paid special attention to environmental protection. By  the end of 1993, the number of environmental protection workers  was 81,000. Seventy-seven nature protection areas were set up,  10 of which became members of the man and the biosphere  international protection network.    China has set 313 standards in order to keep the environment  clean and safe. In 1993 alone, 2.54 billion yuan was invested  in 5,737 projects to fight against environmental pollution, the  Bureau said.</p>

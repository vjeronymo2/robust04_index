			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Concern grows in US US officials were yesterday putting a brave face on the emerging policies of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but admitting surprise that President Bill Clinton's apparent successes in Moscow last week should have been so quickly called into question. The resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar from the Russian government has been seen as contradicting the whole tone of the Moscow summit, during which Mr Clinton emphasised the need to press ahead with economic reform. US officials are now pinning their hopes to the prospect of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister and another economic reformer, staying in the Russian government. Such concerns over the pace of economic reform have been accompanied by rising anxiety over the continued presence of Russian troops in the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia. Clinton administration officials were this week taken aback by the suggestion by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, that it would be dangerous for Russia to withdraw all its troops from the territories of the former Soviet Union. Mr Clinton had pressed Mr Yeltsin at the Moscow summit for a swift withdrawal of troops from Estonia and Latvia, and believed he had received assurances from Mr Yeltsin that this would happen. Mr Michael McCurry, a State Department spokesman, said that Mr Kozyrev's comments were 'certainly at odds with statements signed by President Yeltsin in Moscow'. 'We have told the Russian government repeatedly that we expect prompt withdrawal of all Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia,' he said. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

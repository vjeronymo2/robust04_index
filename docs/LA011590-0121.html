			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PARTY CHIEF IN LITHUANIA ELECTED REPUBLIC PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Lithuania's Communist Party chief was overwhelmingly elected the republic's  president today in a clear endorsement of his defiant stand toward Moscow and  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Algirdas Brazauskas was elected 228 to 4, with 19 abstentions, by the  republic's Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass press agency reported.  </P> <P> The republic's Supreme Soviet also voted to limit voting rights for military  personnel, requiring them to have lived in Lithuania for at least 10 years,  said Eduardas Potasinskas, a journalist for Lithuanian TV. The measure in  effect restricts voting in local elections Feb. 24 by servicemen to those from  Lithuania or a few long-serving soldiers and sailors.  </P> <P> Brazauskas, 57, faced two alternative candidates: national Legislator Kazimeras  Motieka and Romualdas Ozolas, a leader of the pro-independence group Sajudis.  </P> <P> Potasinskas said the vote will "strengthen the position of Brazauskas in  dealing with Moscow."  </P> <P> Brazauskas backed the Lithuanian party's decision Dec. 20 to break away from  the national Communist Party, the first such break since the Communists took  over in Moscow in 1917.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who had denounced the move, visited Lithuania from Thursday through  Saturday to try to persuade Lithuanian Communists to reverse their decision.  </P> <P> The Lithuanians refused to budge, and Gorbachev failed to end the schism. He  concluded his visit Saturday by saying he saw "no tragedy" in a multiparty  system -- a change from his previous unconditional call for a one-party system.  </P></p>

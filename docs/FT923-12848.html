			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Patents trade becomes a booming business / Charting the growing search for profits from technology Current wisdom in the electronics industry is that 'if you can't sell your products, sell your technology'. As competition and economic slowdown eat away at profits, the adage is winning a growing number of adherents. The trend to seek rewards for technological developments is encouraging an increasing number of companies to search their portfolios for patents on which they might be able to capitalise. Furthermore, companies which believe their technology is being used by competitors who have not made royalty payments for the privilege are increasingly willing to turn to the courts to fight for their cause. In the past few months Intel, the semiconductor manufacturer, has filed suits against Chips and Technologies (which has counter-sued Intel) and Cyrix, while Wang, the computer company, has brought actions against Mitsubishi Electronics America and NMB Technologies. The trend towards protecting intellectual property is spreading as the financial gains from licensing technology increase. 'It's a booming business and there is lots of money to be made in it if you have a patent,' says Mr Lane Mason, principal analyst at Dataquest, the high technology consultants, of San Jose, California. He estimates that last year, publicly-known licensing fees that were paid in the semiconductor industry alone came to roughly Dollars 800m (Pounds 418.8m), compared with about Dollars 300m in 1986. Texas Instruments has made more money in the past two years collecting royalties on its semiconductor patents than it has from selling semiconductors. The Dallas-based group made a loss from operations in both 1990 and 1991, but collected Dollars 428m during that time in royalty revenues from its competitors. In the five years since 1987 it has received in excess of Dollars 1.2bn in royalty revenues alone. Honeywell, the US controls manufacturer, this year enjoyed a rise in first-quarter income from Dollars 71.8m in 1991 to Dollars 116.8m, helped by a Dollars 127m settlement it won from Minolta, the Japanese camera group, over a patent infringement dispute. The US has set an example that European and Far Eastern groups are beginning to follow. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has agreed to assist in the licensing of patents owned by Mr Gilbert Hyatt, an American scientist entrepreneur. SGS-Thomson recently asked the US International Trade Commission to investigate the sale by several Taiwanese semiconductor companies and importers of certain integrated circuits, which it says infringe its patents. Japanese electronics companies, which for many years had silently watched competitors in Korea build up their semiconductor manufacturing capability, have begun to initiate licensing agreements with Korean manufacturers. The trend has sprouted law firms and organisations specialising in intellectual property rights. 'More companies are starting to understand that intellectual property should be a major strategic asset,' says Mr Melvin Sharp, president of Innovation Strategies, a consultancy set up specifically to advise companies on how to make use of their intellectual property. These moves reflect a marked change of attitude among electronics companies towards patented technology. While the electronics industry was still in its infancy, technologies were licensed widely at low prices in the hope that greater use would establish them as de facto industry standards, says Mr Osamu Ohtake, president of Semicon Research, a consultancy. But as R&amp;D costs have risen and competition intensified, the pioneers of technologies, many of them in the US, have not been able to make the necessary returns on investments in the marketplace, where they have been battered by competition from the Far East. They have been forced to turn instead to royalty payments as a source of revenue. 'Intellectual property is becoming a new commodity that's being priced at whatever the market can bear,' says Mr Mason. The companies blame rising R&amp;D costs for the trend. 'A company cannot go on indefinitely investing billions of dollars in R&amp;D without obtaining a reasonable return on its investment,' Texas Instruments says. The group invested Dollars 2bn in R&amp;D between 1986 and 1990, during which time it was able to recoup Dollars 700m through royalty payments, which were aided in part by court actions against six Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. The amount of time and money spent by companies on legal action over patent disputes and the spiralling costs of licensing technology are, however, raising cries of alarm in the industry. The number of legal disputes involving semiconductor manufacturers, for example, trebled from 12 in 1986 to 37 last year, according to a recent joint study by Pathfinder Research of the US and Semicon Research in Japan. With amounts being sought for royalties skyrocketing, companies being asked to pay up have started to resist. Sanyo, the Japanese electronics group which was in negotiation with Texas Instruments over renewing a licensing agreement, recently started court action against the US group, charging it with misuse of patent rights and anti-trust violations. Earlier this year, Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and electronics group, filed a petition in Tokyo seeking a court determination that a Texas Instruments patent does not apply to Fujitsu products. The aggressive stance of the patent holders is such that some in the industry believe there could even be a shift in the balance of power away from companies which succeed on the strength of their low-cost manufacturing and marketing ability, in favour of those which have patented technologies. Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, for example, has been able to dominate a highly lucrative sector of the semiconductor market for years, by refusing to license its microprocessor technology. But there is growing concern in the industry that if more companies took a similar stance or if licensing prices were allowed to continue to rise as they have done recently, the effects on competition could be detrimental.  ---------------------------------------------------------                RECENT PATENT LICENSING DEALS  --------------------------------------------------------- Licenser             Licensee                     Year  --------------------------------------------------------- Semiconductors  ---------------------------------------------------------   Texas Instruments  Mitsubishi Electric          1992                      New Japan Radio                      Nippon Precision Circuit                      Ricoh                      Samsung                      Seiko Epson                      Sharp                      Toko                      Wang   Fujitsu            Samsung                      1992   Gilbert Hyatt      Phillips                     1992   Wang               Fujitsu                      1992                      Oki Electric                      Matsushita Electric  --------------------------------------------------------- Computer software   IBM                Microsoft                    1992  --------------------------------------------------------- Camera technology   Honeywell          Minolta                      1992  --------------------------------------------------------- Disk drives   Rodime             Corner Peripherals           1992                      IBM                          1990  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: Pathfinder Research &amp; Semicon Research  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

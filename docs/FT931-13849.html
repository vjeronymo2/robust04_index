			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Spanish banking group in Pta150bn partial privatisation THE Spanish government plans to raise Pta150bn (Pounds 850m) through the sale of 25 per cent of the capital in Argentaria, the wholly state-owned banking group. This would be the biggest share placement ever by a Spanish institution. An Argentaria spokesman said yesterday that the government was expected to approve the corporation's partial privatisation in a matter of days. 'The decision is virtually imminent,' he said. Argentaria was created in May 1991 when five government-controlled financial institutions - including Banco Exterior, now Argentaria's flagship bank - were grouped into a single banking corporation. It reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pta50bn last year, a 64 per cent increase on income earned from May to December 1991. The issue is likely to be in several tranches, aimed at small domestic investors and institutional investors in Spain and abroad. The decision to float Argentaria partially is in line with the government's strategy of reducing the public deficit through disposals of state shareholdings. Repsol, the state energy group which raised Pta130bn in 1989, said earlier this week that it aimed to raise a further Pta50bn in an international share issue scheduled for the next two to three months. Argentaria's consolidated book value on December 31, 1991, was Pta528bn. Current market capitalisation is conservatively estimated at Pta600bn. In an important preliminary step to the Argentaria placement, the economy ministry has transferred a number of loans, credits and guarantees linked to mostly loss-making public enterprises from Argentaria to the Instituto de Credito Oficial the state financing agency. These assets, which total Pta392bn and include equity in certain steel companies, had belonged to the former Banco de Credito Industrial, which was absorbed by Banco Exterior. By putting all assets that could be subject to political decisions under the wing of the ICO, the government has underlined its policy that Argentaria should operate as a purely commercial institution responding solely to market forces.

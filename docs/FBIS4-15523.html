			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG special correspondents] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 8 April, TASS -- The West "should help Russia  in the process of reforms, democratisation and stabilisation,  nor for remarks by concrete politicians," President Nursultan  Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan told a news conference here on Friday.  [sentence as received]    Both Moscow and all its neighbours in the east and west are  interested in the success of Russian transformations, emphasised  Nazarbayev, who is currentlty in Japan on an official visit.    Nazarbayev believes that there is nothing surprising in the  complex processes taking place in the former Soviet Union. The  majority of current problems have been brought about by the  disintegration of the Soviet Union's economic system and  break-up of the common ruble area, and should have been foreseen  by politicians who were busy producing a Commonwealth of  Independent States in Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest, he said.</p>

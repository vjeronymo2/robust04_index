			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in UIPL 13&hyph;94, Change 1, the justifiable cause exception does not supersede State able and available requirements, but rather is an additional eligibility requirement related to participation in reemployment services. Claimants may be determined to have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services; however, they must still meet a State's able and available requirements to be eligible for UI. For example, although a claimant who is ill may have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services, the claimant is still subject to the State's able and available requirements and may, as a result, be ineligible for UI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeal Rights. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 303(a), SSA, any eligibility determination that a claimant has failed to participate in reemployment services must be appealable. In addition, all determinations of UI eligibility must contain appeal rights in accordance with the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although States must allow claimants to appeal denials for failure to participate in orientation and assessment, States are not required to permit claimants to contest the propriety of the referral to orientation and assessment. Orientation and assessment are aimed at determining what, if any, additional reemployment services may be needed by the claimants. Obviously, if claimants do not report, this determination cannot be made. In this regard, referrals to orientation and assessment are similar to reporting and ``call-in'' requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claimants must, however, be allowed to question whether any services tailored to the individual are, in fact, needed. If any evidence appears at any stage of the nonmonetary determination or appeals process indicating that the claimant does not need these services, the UI agency must take the initiative in determining whether the referral was proper. If it is found not to be proper, then the participation requirement does not apply and there is no need to address exceptions such as justifiable cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Feedback and Reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 303(j)(1)(C), SSA, requires that States collect follow-up information relating to the reemployment services received by the referred claimants and the employment outcomes for these claimants. This information is to be used in refining the profiling system. Section 303(a)(6), SSA, also requires the States to provide ``such reports, in such form and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these authorities, States will be required to submit information concerning profiling to the Department. This UIPL does not address what information must be collected or reported. Specific instructions for reporting any information on services and outcomes will be issued as changes to ETA Handbook 401, ``Unemployment Insurance Reports Handbook''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Action Required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Administrators are requested to provide this information to the staff developing the worker profiling and reemployment services system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inquiries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Inquiries should be directed to the appropriate Regional Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attachment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 303(j)(1) and 303(a)(10), SSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Attachment to UPIL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 303(j)(1) and 303(a)(10), SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The value of security Nothing ever seems to turn out right in banking. In the early 1980s bankers discovered that, despite all the theory to the contrary, sovereign borrowers could effectively default on their debts. So they must have thought they were on to a good thing by lending against the physical security of property. After Olympia &amp; York, they are learning that this theory does not necessarily hold either. Moreover, when a borrower is in deep trouble, a secured loan may not be worth much more than an unsecured one - as banks whose loans to the Maxwell empire were secured against equity in MCC have also found to their cost. That raises the question of how banks should judge the creditworthiness of their customers. The obvious answer, in an environment where asset prices are no longer rising, is to revert to the yardstick of cash-flow. What concerns a bank most is that its loan should be serviced. That a building is worth less than the money lent against it may not matter if it produces enough rental income to cover the debt. Unfortunately this criterion too is flawed. Commercial rents can fall. They are still soft in New York despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates. Seemingly free cash-flow can turn out to be committed elsewhere. The sad conclusion is that lending is an inherently risky business; a sadder one still is that banks seem incapable of learning to price that risk correctly. Perhaps that is why British banks have underperformed the market by 30 per cent over the past 20 years.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lot, American Airlines in pact Lot, Poland's state-owned national airline, and American Airlines, one of America's biggest carriers, are to sign a memorandum of understanding today on a co-operation agreement. According to Lot sources the agreement will involve no financial links between the two airlines but a sharing of ticket and communications networks. Lot, which has a modern fleet of Boeing airliners, carried 1.4m passengers last year, 10 per cent more than in 1992. Last year the airline reported a modest Zloty 42bn (Dollars 1.82m) net profit compared with a Zloty 84bn net loss in the previous year. Lot had also conducted talks on a similar agreement with Delta, which has decided to establish links with Austrian Airlines.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (10): Conflicting viewpoints - Industrialised Nations / A big issue for the industrial countries is how much money they are prepared to advance to help poorer countries clean up their environment THE INDUSTRIALISED countries may agree that the world's environment is under threat, but they differ on the seriousness of the danger and what should be done about it. Nothing illustrates this better than the reluctance of President Bush to commit himself to attend Rio until the eleventh hour, despite the strong urging of his partners in Europe and Japan. Yet it is the industrialised countries who will be expected by the rest of the world to take the lead in mounting a clean-up, and in financing the Third World's efforts to overcome its environmental problems. The strength of these countries' support will therefore be crucial to the outcome of Rio. Although the US probably has a longer record of environmental action, the Europeans displayed greater enthusiasm for the idea of an Earth Summit from the start. John Major, the UK prime minister was among the first political leaders to say he would attend. Europe also had a clear enthusiast in Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's passionate Environment Commissioner who was determined that the Community should put up a united front at Rio, and set a strong example on environmental matters. The EC accepted at an early stage that the industrial countries, as the largest processors of raw materials, had a special responsibility for the environment. Its members also committed themselves to providing 'new and additional resources' to finance a clean-up. But only a week before the summit started, Mr di Meana failed to secure the support of EC environment ministers for a carbon tax, the keystone of his strategy to cut pollution. In disgust, he said he would not go to Rio after all, meaning that the EC will not now speak as one at the event. The US position is more complex. The imminence of an election made Mr Bush reluctant to commit himself to the uncertainties of Rio, particularly at a time of economic recession and growing backlash against the green movement. Mr William Reilly, the chairman of the Environment Protection Agency, said during the preparations: 'There are many things about Rio that are not encouraging,' referring to the proposed treaties that would impose curbs on industry and seek to change consumption patterns in advanced countries. The US also made much of the continuing uncertainty in the scientific community about the dangers of climate change. In arduous negotiations in the final weeks before Rio, it managed to secure compromises on the key treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The coming days will demonstrate whether these were worthwhile in order to obtain US support. Mr di Meana was outraged by the compromise and some European Community members wondered why they should accept a treaty which fell below the standards they were implementing already. Japan, which accepts the climate change threat, will support strong measures to reduce pollution, according to its chief negotiator, Mr Nobutoshi Akao. A significant issue for the industrial countries is how much money they are prepared to advance to help poorer countries clean up their environment. Although they have agreed in principle to grant more aid, they have studiously avoided putting numbers on it, not least because of the heavy pressures on their own budgets. Although Japan is keen to take a high profile at Rio, it will not commit itself to specific aid ahead of the summit, Mr Akao says. EC members agreed in the run-up to Rio to pledge 0.7 per cent of GNP, nearly twice present average aid levels. But though some members wanted to set a target date of the year 2000, more preferred to leave the timing vague. The US has not been willing to make a similar pledge. The expectation is that the rich countries will agree to add up to Dollars 10bn to the Dollars 55bn they already make available each year. But this would be conditional on most of the money going through the Global Environment Facility, the three-year-old fund set up by the World Bank specially to help Third World environmental projects. Mr David Maclean, the UK's Minister of State for the Environment and the Countryside, told a Third World conference in Kuala Lumpur: 'The reason is simple. To persuade our taxpayers to accept new and additional burdens, we have to be able to point to new commitments and additional global benefits. The GEF allows us to do just that.' The World Bank, in its latest World Development Report, is blunt about the role to be played by the industrial countries: 'Industrial countries must bear most of the costs of addressing global problems,' it says, 'especially when the required investments are not in the narrow interests of developing countries. . .such arrangements have the potential to make all countries better-off if the world's willingness to pay for policy changes exceeds the cost of the changes.'</p>

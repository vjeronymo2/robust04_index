			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Prudential pays Pounds 73.5m for Welsh shopping centre The Prudential has bought the Cwmbran shopping centre, the largest centre in Wales, for Pounds 73.5m from Ladbroke Group and a trust belonging to Mr Leo Noe, chairman of Bourne End, the property company. The property comprises 170 shops occupying 750,000 sq ft. Tenants include Marks and Spencer, J Sainsbury, Asda and Boots. Ladbroke's sale of its 50 per cent stake for Pounds 36.8m represents a small surplus over book value at the end of 1993. The initial yield on the deal was about 6.5 per cent. The deal brings the total sales of commercial property by Ladbroke this year to about Pounds 140m. Mr Peter George, group chief executive, said that negotiations were continuing in respect of other properties and further disposals were anticipated during the remainder of the year. The deal is the sixth property acquisition exchanged or completed by the Prudential this week. It has spent Pounds 400m on buying a Wolverhampton shopping centre, a parcel of properties from Burton Property Trust and a 50 per cent share of Wimpey's Little Britain office scheme in the City of London. Mr Chris Taylor, property investment director of the Prudential, said that the insurer was continuing to look for potential acquisitions. 'Now the investment market has gone off the boil, it is easier to find value.' Eskmuir Properties, the property investment company owned by the Laing family, has bought Pounds 24m of investment property, to take its portfolio to a total value of about Pounds 170m. Eskmuir said it 'had taken advantage of the recent softening of the market'. The average yield was more than 8 per cent. It has bought its own building in London's West End, as well as an office building in Watford, Hertfordshire, three Leeds office buildings, and four warehouse properties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by health resort physician Asya Uyanayeva under the </F> rubric "Meteorological Dictionary": "These Dangerous Thaws"]    [Text] The weather in moderate latitudes is formed in a  struggle between warm and moist sea air and cold, relatively  dry, air forming in Arctic latitudes.    Over the past years on the European territory of the country  winters have been warm, with frequent invasions of Atlantic  cyclones. The result of this process was protracted thaws.    The meteorological dictionary gives the following  definition:  A thaw is the warming of air temperature to the freezing mark  and above in winter time amidst temperatures that have settled  below freezing, most often as a result of the spread of warm air.    On the European territory of the country thaws result from a  stream of either moderate latitude sea air from the Atlantic  Ocean or the moderate latitude air returning from southern  regions through the Balkans and Asia Minor. Thaws are frequently  preceded by snowstorms. They are accompanied by cloudy, foggy  weather.    What is the danger of thaw periods? First and foremost, the  snow begins to melt, which increases the probability that  wintering plants will be subjected to the impact of the cold  when cold temperatures return. If the snow cover is low, and the  impact of warm air is long enough, the snow may to a  considerable extent or even completely melt.    The southern and western regions of the European territory  of  the country are subjected to the most frequent thaws. In the  current year December and January had plenty of protracted  thaws, which were only briefly interrupted by minor cold spells.  The most frequent thaws occur in March, when the atmosphere  shifts to summer mode.</p>

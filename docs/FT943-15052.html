			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Accountants win surprise recognition Members of a little-known accountancy body based in the north of England were yesterday given government approval to carry out the audits of limited companies. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, said in a parliamentary answer he had decided to recognise the Association of International Accountants (AIA). His authorisation means that the qualification offered by the Gateshead-based association is recognised as legitimate for company auditors under section 32 and section 12 of the 1989 Companies Act. Mr John Turnbull, director general of the AIA, said last night: 'This recognition gives additional choice to people wanting to take qualifications.' The announcement caused surprise in the accountancy profession, with a number of officials in rival bodies saying they had never heard of the association. In a strongly worded and dismissive statement the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said few students were likely to opt to take the AIA's qualification. 'Although the DTI has recognised the qualification, it has not granted the AIA supervisory status,' said Ms Anthea Rose, the chartered association's chief executive. 'Holders of the AIA qualification will not be able to work in public practice - it will simply be a paper qualification of little practical value when compared to the other recognised qualifications offered by the accountancy bodies which are supervisory bodies, such as the ACCA.' Mr Turnbull said: 'That's ridiculous. What's it got to do with the certifieds? We have met the requirements of the government which were very onerous.' He said the AIA had been in existence since 1928, and offered qualifications in many parts of the world including south-east Asia - where it competed with the ACCA. He said the association had applied for recognition from the DTI in 1990 and its examinations had been approved by accounting professors from Aberystwyth and Essex. Mr Turnbull said the association had about 6,000 members, including 1,750 in the UK, of which 750 were fully qualified; about 4,000 were students. He stressed it had not applied to become a supervisory body because it believed there should be a single body to monitor auditing quality. Accounts filed with Companies House show the AIA had turnover of Pounds 98,000 and profits of Pounds 91,000 in the year to December 1992.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: UK shoe side underpins Hi-Tec advance to Pounds 8.2m HI-TEC SPORTS, the South-end-based designer and distributor of sports shoes, yesterday announced record pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m, up from Pounds 6.4m, in the year to February 3. Three months ago the group said that, despite the downward pressure on UK consumer spending generally, it would announce profits 'comfortably in excess' of the Pounds 7m achieved in 1988-89. Mr Frank van Wezel, chairman, said the result was underpinned by a strong performance in the core UK shoe operations. He thought Hi-Tec's middle-priced products might have benefited from people trading down from more upmarket training shoes. Additionally, part of the growth came from Bad Boys, the Dutch leisurewear business acquired in August 1989. There was a substantial increase to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.58m) in interest payable, although the company pointed out that interest costs were more than four times covered by profits before interest. The rise in borrowings was partly a consequence of the terms of trade with Hi-Tec's Far Eastern suppliers, which require the company to pay for goods before it has passed them on. Also, the company built up stocks towards the year-end on concerns about the duration and scope of the Gulf war. Borrowings net of cash at the year-end stood at Pounds 16.1m against shareholders' funds, depressed by a goodwill write-off for Bad Boys, of Pounds 22.3m. Turnover rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 119.78m (Pounds 83.65m). Earnings per share were up at 14.8p (11.5p) and the final dividend is 3.5p making 5p (4.5p) for the year. Mr van Wezel said that during the year the company had progressed its strategy of diversifying both in product range and geographically. Footwear diminished as a proportion of turnover from 86 to 77 per cent. Aside from sports clothing, the balance was made up of Bad Boys. By geographical region, the UK accounted for about 60 per cent of sales. The other two main markets were continental Europe, with some 19 per cent, and North America with about 14 per cent. Elsewhere, Mr van Wezel said that the company had made substantial progress in Japan. COMMENT Hi-Tec has had a rather dull profits history since it joined the market in 1988 and that has been fully reflected in a dreadful share price record: even after a recent smart rally the shares still stand, at yesterday's 142p close, 18p below the price at which they were offered. But if Hi-Tec can keep up the momentum after last year's impressive performance - achieved against ghastly market conditions - it will get harder to dismiss the company as a minor player not doing a great deal in a small part of the UK footwear market. Then again, the company's avowed aim of turning itself into a broadly-based international leisurewear company is still far from being realised. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the gearing and with Mr van Wezel owning 70 per cent the shares are hardly the most marketable. Still, assuming pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 9.5m this year the prospective p/e is hardly demanding at about 8.5.</p>

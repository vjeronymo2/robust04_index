			<p>BFN     [Text] Price differences between products and services at  home and those abroad, the so-called domestic-foreign price  differences, have been brought to the fore as a serious problem.  Why cheap foreign products are expensive in Japan has been  questioned so far from the consumers' point of view. Now the  question is being raised by others. Industrial circles have  also begun to take a serious view of domestic-foreign price  differences. The reason is that a progressively stronger yen  has given rise to price differences even for parts and raw  materials, possibly leading to decreased international  competitiveness and the hollowing out of industry    If the matter is left as is, the future of the Japanese  economy will be undermined. Forming such a judgment, the  government has at last begun to tackle the problem in earnest.  On the instructions of Prime Minister Hata, the Price Stability  Policy Council [an advisory panel to the prime minister] will  immediately organize measures to correct domestic-foreign price  differences beginning around mid-June.    On account of domestic-foreign price differences, how  expensive are the products that Japanese consumers have to buy?  According to a survey conducted by the Economic Planning Agency  (EPA) in 1992, the price level for Tokyo was 1.31 times higher  than that of New York and l.12 times and 1.l4 times higher than  that of London and Paris, respectively. Tokyo is one of the  cities in the world with the highest prices.    Due to the yen's rapid appreciation from 1993 to 1994, EPA  sees "a strong possibility of further widening in the  difference" between the price level in Tokyo and New York.  Although there have been growing opportunities for buying  cheap, good imported items due to the spread of volume sales  stores and other establishments, the flow back to consumers of  the profits from the strong yen has been only partial. The  situation whereby consumers are truly able to feel the yen's  strength by travelling overseas appears likely to continue.    A glance at the situation in domestic-foreign price  differences for major products shows clearly how expensive those  products are in Japan. According to a survey conducted by Daiwa  Soken [as published] in 1993, beer in Japan costs 2.5 times as  much as in the United States at the rate of 107 yen to the  dollar; 3.1 times higher in Japan for gasoline; 2.7 times higher  for electric power; 1.5 times higher for domestic air fares; 1.6  times higher for raw materials that directly bear on the  competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, such as steel and  cement. Of the 23 items surveyed, only pharmaceuticals for  physicians were cheaper in Japan than in the United States.    Why has the problem of domestic-foreign price differences  become serious? The trigger has been the strong yen.  Subsequently, import-hindering business practices and other  invisible barriers as well as the high-cost structure of  domestic industries are seen as the "main culprits."    According to common sense, the following process should  accompany the yen's appreciation: lower prices for imported  goods -- an increase in imported goods -- intensified  competition in domestic markets -- reduced costs and increased  productivity for domestic corporations -- a general fall in  prices -- and a decrease in the domestic-foreign price  differences. In Japan, however, prices for the main industrial  products have remained almost on the same level since the yen's  appreciation in 1985. Although prices for imported goods have  declined more than 30 percent since then, import ratios have,  with the exception of some goods such as textiles, risen little.    Ryuji Musha, head of the second corporate research bureau at  Daiwa Soken, points out that, "In addition to corporations and  consumers having valued product quality, complicated business  practices as well as the existence of various types of  regulations and standards have prevented the penetration of  imported goods."    In such fields unrelated to trade as utilities charges,  distribution, construction and services, domestic-foreign price  differences have widened as prices have not fallen. High costs  in these non-trade areas have pushed up production costs in  manufacturing industries, which are exposed to keen competition  with foreign countries, weakening the international  competitiveness of those industries. A senior executive at a  major textile manufacturer reveals that, "Even if we rationalize  and curtail personnel expenses, we cannot compete with imported  goods from Asia so long as the electricity rate is comparatively  high."    Hitotsubashi University Professor Iwao Nakatani offers  thorough deregulation and revision of current business practices  as a prescription for domestic-foreign price differences. The  idea is to make the price mechanism penetrate further into  domestic markets. For this to happen, Professor Nakatani  emphasizes "numerical targets" as a government policy "to halve  domestic-foreign price differences within the next several  years."    Improving the high-cost structure related to public  utilities  charges and other areas could reduce the incomes of people  working in those fields and increase unemployment. The  development of industries able to absorb such surplus labor is  likely to be an issue that must be promoted in parallel with the  correction of domestic-foreign price differences.</p>

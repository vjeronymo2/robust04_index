			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Toyota Motor to offer non-recourse financing to dealers TOYOTA Motor, Japan's largest car-maker, is expanding the operations of its fast-growing finance subsidiary by offering non-recourse financing to Toyota dealers in Japan. Toyota said yesterday Toyota Finance Corporation would begin purchasing credits on vehicle instalment payments from Toyota dealers and guarantee customer payments by the end of the year. Since operations began in 1989, Toyota Finance has confined its business to lending money to Toyota dealers, who take vehicle loans on to their books and administer the loans. The expansion of Toyota Finance's business is a reflection of changes in the financial and vehicle marketing environment, but it also represents an important step in the growth of a business with huge potential. Toyota Finance will begin accumulating a large databank on Toyota customers that will put it in position to move into other consumer financial services - from credit cards and consumer loans to insurance. Some of these ideas are under consideration by the Toyota management, although no plans have been fixed. A senior Toyota Finance executive said yesterday he expected Toyota Finance would become a major part of Toyota's business in the future, along the lines of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the finance arm of General Motors. Toyota said the offering of non-recourse finance was demanded by its dealers who, because of Japan's labour shortage, are having difficulting managing the administration of loans. The Bank of International Settlement capital adequacy requirements were also forcing banks to seek more profitable business, such as consumer finance. Toyota would have to offer similar services to compete. Toyota Finance now has about Y650bn (Dollars 5.27bn) in annual transactions, and it expected to have about Y200bn of annual transactions in non-recourse finance in about three years. The company had Y403.7bn of outstanding loans at the end of last June. Although Toyota Motor, a cash-rich company, provided initial funds for Toyota Finance, Toyota Finance is mainly dependent on bank loans for its operations, and expects to end entirely any use of intra-company funding.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Government Promises a New </F> Currency Exchange Rate"]    [Text] A news conference was held to discuss the results  of a Cabinet of Ministers meeting, which had to find ways of  overcoming the payments crisis. In the opinion of observers,  the top-level participation (two vice premiers -- V. Yevtukhov  and V. Landyk; ministers: of economy -- R. Shpek, finance -- H.  Pyatachenko, and agriculture -- Yu. Karasyk; chairman of  Ukraine's National Bank V. Yushchenko; and chairman of the State  Coal Industry Committee M. Surhay) is an obvious attempt to  attach a positive image to the Cabinet of Ministers prior to  discussing this issue at the Supreme Council session. As  regards specific decisions, the meeting adopted three  resolutions: On hard-currency regulation, on the introduction  into circulation of bills of exchange, and on the revision of  the taxation system, something that, as the members of  government assert, will create that normative foundation which  will make it possible to extricate the credits and finance  system from the crisis. It is, in particular, envisaged that  from now on, the currency exchange rates will be set on a weekly  basis, and the enterprises will be allowed to sell at free  prices 50 percent of their currency profit at currency auctions.  With regard to the circulation of bills of exchange, according  to V. Yushchenko, there may be bankruptcies of those enterprises  which, after purchasing products, will not be able to pay. The  new taxation system envisages levying taxes on the profit in  1995.</p>

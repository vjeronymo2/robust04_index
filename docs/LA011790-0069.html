			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERLIN IN THE '30S, BEIRUT IN '70S . . . NOW BAKU;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: A SEEMINGLY POWERLESS MOSCOW STANDS BY AS ARMENIANS ARE  SLAUGHTERED IN AZERBAIJAN. THE JEWS AND RUSSIANS WILL BE NEXT.  </P> <P> The new round of savage killings of Armenians in Baku, the capital of Soviet  Azerbaijan, underscores the Soviet government's inability to deal effectively  with its ethnic problems.  </P> <P> Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Russians and Jews peacefully coexisted in Baku for  decades. But the fragile balance has been irretrievably upset and the central  government seems powerless to restore order to this picturesque city on the  shores of the Caspian Sea. Even the state of emergency declared elsewhere in  Azerbaijan this week cannot call back the violence that has claimed many lives  and ruined others.  </P> <P> Residents proudly recall the rich history of an international city steeped in  tradition and blessed with a moderate climate, vast natural resources and an  ideal location. But during a recent visit to Baku, I saw the signs of a city in  decline everywhere. The billboard on the road from the airport reads in  Russian, "The U.S.S.R. -- Home for All Peoples." But one rarely hears Russian  spoken anymore in a city in which just two years ago more than half the people  were native Russian speakers. Today, the language of power in Baku is Azeri,  and non-Azerbaijanis are not welcome.  </P> <P> Armenians have been the subject of brutal attacks on the streets and in their  homes. Streets that only a few months ago had Armenian names now carry  Azerbaijani names. Statues of Armenians have all been destroyed. The Armenian  church, which until last month remained unscathed, has been desecrated. In  short, all public traces of Armenian culture and history are gone.  </P> <P> An influx of Azerbaijanis who were living in neighboring Soviet Armenia is the  primary trigger of this transformation. Extremist nationalist elements in the  Armenian population terrorized Azerbaijani inhabitants into leaving Soviet  Armenia. One Jewish woman now living in Baku told me that all 115 Azerbaijani  newcomers attending the institute at which she works arrived in Baku with limbs  missing or mutilated.  </P> <P> The Azerbaijanis fleeing Soviet Armenia have therefore come to Baku bent on  vengeance. These newcomers, known pejoratively throughout Baku as Yerazi  (Yeravan Azerbaijanis), have bolstered the ranks of the Popular Front, an  extremist nationalist organization in Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> The Popular Front has wrought havoc on Baku, visiting virtually every  enterprise in the city, requiring the firing of all Armenian employees. And on  the streets, one must carry an internal passport to show that he or she is not  Armenian. Armenians fear for their lives.  </P> <P> The nationalists are orchestrating a concerted campaign to secede from the  Soviet Union to create a separate union with southern Azerbaijan, which is now  part of neighboring northern Iran. The Popular Front's reign of terror in Baku  is part of this campaign.  </P> <P> More than 90% of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan has fled. Only the most  defiant, or those deluding themselves that the situation will get better, have  stayed. I met one woman who had lost her job the day before. She was married to  a Russian, her last name was Russian -- but one parent was Armenian. Someone at  work found out, and she was fired.  </P> <P> Other minority populations are also in danger. While walking to a store, a man  was accosted on the street. He had forgotten his internal passport showing that  he was Jewish. The Azerbaijani marauders were looking for Armenians. They  addressed him in Armenian, which he did not understand. He told them in Russian  that he was Jewish, so they addressed him in a language spoken among some Jews.  He knew a few words, convincing his assailants that he was Jewish. They let him  go, but warned him that once they rid the city of Armenians, the Jews would be  next.  </P> <P> Azerbaijani "collaborators" are also subject to attack. While I was in Baku, an  older Azerbaijani man helped a longtime neighbor and friend -- an Armenian. In  retaliation, a gang of about 15 youths came to his apartment, beat him up and  stole his jewelry and clothes. There are similar instances of Azerbaijanis  helping neighbors or friends, but the bonds that preserved the peace have  unraveled. The city has all but fallen into the hands of the Popular Front.  </P> <P> I attended a dinner at which former grade-school classmates who had known each  other for more than 15 years gathered for probably the last time. Most were  products of mixed marriages from a time when tolerance and understanding  reigned in this international city.  </P> <P> These lifelong friends will soon scatter to all parts of the globe to escape.  They recognize that they are re-enacting similar exoduses from Berlin in the  '30's or Beirut in the '70's -- in both instances, great cities on the verge of  calamity.  </P> <P> All remaining Armenians will soon leave; then the Jews. Then it will not be  safe for the Russians.  </P> <P> The great, tolerant and prosperous city that once was has vanished.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL NEWS;  </P> <P> TWINS HOPE TO CASH IN ON AMBASSADOR PROGRAM  </P> <P> They were told it would be impossible for two teen-agers to raise $8,000 in  three months. But, with a little hope and a lot of help from friends, the  16-year-old La Puente twins are almost there.  </P> <P> Joann and Talolo Lepale, juniors at Bassett High School, were chosen in January  to participate this summer in the People to People High School Student  Ambassador Program. People to People is a nonprofit organization that takes  selected students from around the United States on learning trips to different  parts of the world. Students are chosen on the basis of academic achievement,  community involvement and recommendations from teachers and counselors.  </P> <P> The students chosen must pay their own way; People to People had set an April 1  deadline for the fee of $4,000 per student. That meant $8,000 for the Lepale  twins, whose mother is a hospital worker and father is a mechanic.  </P> <P> The twins, their parents and little sister collected cans and newspapers. They  held a carwash and a yard sale. And they sent out 110 letters to clubs and  organizations in the San Gabriel Valley asking for donations.  </P> <P> Donations and pledges came from neighbors, local doctors, pharmacists and shop  owners, friends and co-workers. The largest donation came from the American  Legion, with the help of Tom Golden of the Monterey Park American Legion Post.  Golden had heard about the twins' fund-raising efforts and started collecting  money from the other 30 American Legion posts in the San Gabriel Valley. The  Legionnaires donated $1,620, Golden said.  </P> <P> Although the twins have their passports ready, the fund-raising isn't over yet.  Their mother, Yonneta Lepale, said some of the pledges are still not definite,  and the twins will need spending money. The Lepales have sent half the money;  People to People has extended the fee deadline for the twins to May 10.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the family is planning another carwash and yard sale.

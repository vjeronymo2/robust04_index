			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Hasan </F> al-Alfi by 'Amr 'Abd-al-Sami' in Cairo "the day before  yesterday"]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Reports of the arrest of 25  terrorists involved in recent bombings in Cairo have aroused  general satisfaction in Egypt. Meanwhile the terrorists were  shocked by the reports, which caused them to issue a statement  on Tuesday announcing a halt to their operations for a week.  However, the escape of three terrorists, among them Tal'at  Yasin Hammam (Islamic Group), arouses questions about whether  these fugitive are capable of carrying out new operations. What  is your opinion?    Al-Alfi: Anything is possible in the situation we  are going to talk about. [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Sami': It is said that terrorism poses a  threat to all Arab and Islamic states. To what extent are  Pakistani authorities cooperating in this connection, and are  there any positive signs in this cooperation under the new  government there?    Al-Alfi: Contacts with Pakistan are still  continuing.    'Abd-al-Sami': Has there been any positive  development under the new government headed by Benazir Bhutto,  which has no fundamentalist link, in contrast to the former  government of Nawaz Sharif?    Al-Alfi: To some extent.    'Abd-al-Sami': What do you mean by "to some  extent?"    Al-Alfi: I mean there is a positive development.    'Abd-al-Sami': Has that development produced  tangible results?    Al-Alfi: Yes, it has produced tangible results,  but these matters cannot be discussed in the press. [passage  omitted]    'Abd-al-Sami': How do you view Libyan allegations  that U.S. and Israeli intelligence services kidnapped al-Kikhya  to give these states the right to escalate their campaign  against Libya and hit it?    Al-Alfi: So far none of what has been said has  proved to be true. On that issue, I would like to say that  al-Kikhya came to Egypt with an Algerian passport to attend a  conference. He did not inform us of that. Besides, he is not a  political refugee in Egypt. Any political refugee in Egypt is  provided with protection, surveillance, and security. [passage  omitted]    'Abd-al-Sami': How do you view the effect of the  future situation in Gaza on security in Egypt, especially as  regards the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating via the  Rafah crossing point if the Palestinian-Israeli disagreement  over who should control this crossing point leads to a formula  resulting in loopholes in control measures?    Al-Alfi: There are security preparations  everywhere, especially the outlets and borders in Egypt: east,  west, north, and south; on land, at sea, and in the air. I have  set up a special department called the outlets department headed  by an assistant minister in order to supply the outlets with the  latest equipment to detect falsification and forgery, uncover  wanted people and smuggled and banned items, and arrest those  who infiltrate the borders. This is to be coordinated with the  border guard in the Armed Forces.    We have no fears over the possibility of some terrorists'  infiltrating, for two reasons: First, we are in control of our  side of the Rafah crossing point. This side will obviously not  be subjected to any change, regardless of the formula reached  between the Palestinians and the Israelis vis-a-vis control over  the other side in the negotiations concerning the implementation  of the declaration of principles agreement.    Second, both the PLO and Israel are eager to control  security  in Gaza, and it cannot be said that one of them is more  interested in the matter than the other.    There is complete agreement that the peace agreement's  success requires complete vigilance, because any terrorist  schemes through the Rafah crossing point would have a bigger  negative impact on the future of peace between the Palestinians  and Israel than on the situation in Egypt.    'Abd-al-Sami': I am asking that question in  particular because there are fears that a relationship might be  established between extremist elements from Hamas, for example,  and terrorists in Egypt.    Al-Alfi: We are taking account of all that.  [passage omitted]    'Abd-al-Sami': Quantities of arms and explosives  are seized whenever terrorist dens are attacked. Where do the  extremists get these quantities of arms and explosives, when  there are tight restrictions imposed on the arms trade and  quarries?    Al-Alfi: A major part of them comes from the  remnants of the past wars in Sinai. To this day we are still  seizing dens in Sinai containing huge quantities of all types of  arms, explosives, and ammunition. This is why a comprehensive  survey of these areas has been launched to destroy this  dangerous source, which is used by terrorists and other  criminals. [passage omitted]</p>

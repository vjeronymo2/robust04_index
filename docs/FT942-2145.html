			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric urges commercial freedom: Obstacles to sell-off 'largely overcome' - Concern over Magnox costs / Estimates attacked as optimistic Privatisation of Nuclear Electric would complete the government's programme for electricity privatisation started five years ago, the company said in its submission yesterday to the government's nuclear review. The company, which operates the nuclear power stations of England and Wales, called for commercial freedom to compete with National Power and PowerGen. 'The original obstacles to privatisation have been largely overcome,' it says. 'The company has been transformed since its formation in 1990, increasing output by almost 45 per cent and doubling productivity by March this year. Market share has risen from 16.7 per cent in 1989-90 to more than 23 per cent last year. 'The company's five advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) stations are among the best-performing in the world. This achievement, coupled with the successful completion of Sizewell B within the committed programme and below budget, provides assurance that Nuclear Electric has a sound commercial base on which to operate profitably and competitively in the market. 'The AGR stations and Sizewell B (the pressurised-water reactor station) will be profitable without government subsidy. Risks over liabilities and uncertainties over income of these stations have been greatly reduced to the point where the majority of risks for the AGR and PWR stations can now be considered transferable to the private sector. 'The expected lifetimes of the (six) Magnox stations have been exhaustively reviewed. Nuclear Electric is confident that they may continue to operate economically into the next century. However, the risks associated with their back-end costs, resulting from decisions taken decades ago, would not be acceptable to the private sector. 'To achieve a successful privatisation, the risks and liabilities to which investors are exposed must be appropriately allocated. One approach would involve Nuclear Electric divesting its operations to a new subsidiary, whose shares would be sold to private investors and which would then take forward the electricity generating of Nuclear Electric. The unprivatisable risks and liabilities would be retained by government. 'The new privatised company would own and operate the AGR and PWR stations, taking responsibility for related nuclear and other liabilities amounting to some Pounds 6bn. (It would not own the Magnox stations which would remain in state hands, but it might operate them.) Government would take a last-loss position on risks and would be paid premiums for doing so by other parties to the agreement. 'This option would transfer to the private sector the majority of the commercial risk in nuclear electricity generation; create opportunities to introduce competition to the management of long-term nuclear liabilities; give the private sector financial responsibilities for the company's investment decisions; and create substantial income for the government from the sale of shares. 'Privatisation could be completed within 18 months, without the need for new primary legislation.' Environmental and strategic benefits: 'The electricity market is not structured to respond to environmental and strategic needs. Nor does it take full account of the environmental effects of different forms of generation. The polluter does not pay. 'Adjusting the market framework to deliver the government's energy and environmental policy objectives would involve creating incentives to generators to invest in non-pollution technologies. 'Nuclear generation is alone among major technologies in accounting for and dealing with the effects of the entire fuel cycle. This is because it internalises the costs involved in waste management and decommissioning. The fact that the equivalent environmental costs of fossil-fuelled generation are ignored produces an imbalance in their relative costs and lead to market distortion. 'Nuclear Electric's current operations save the emission of more than 60m tonnes of carbon dioxide and 840,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide annually compared with a conventional coal plant. Of the options open to government to reduce gaseous emissions, nuclear energy is the most effective. It is controllable, certain in its effect, sustainable and can be achieved in a relatively short time without requiring a change in public lifestyles. 'Nuclear power also offers national benefits to the balance of payments, to employment and the export of technology. The industry employs 40,000 people directly. Building Sizewell C would provide 20,000 jobs during peak construction. 'A successful bid for a Taiwanese power station by the Westinghouse consortium, of which Nuclear Electric is a part, would create 5,000 jobs in British engineering over five years.' New plant construction: 'Nuclear power is more capital-intensive than combined cycle gas turbine stations which are being developed rapidly, but fuel costs are much lower. The cost of nuclear generation is therefore far less sensitive to fuel price movements, which many experts expect to rise significantly in real terms over the next few decades. 'In order to exploit fully the substantial national investment in Sizewell B, it is important to proceed with construction of a further plant as soon as possible. Nuclear Electric's investment appraisal of Sizewell C and Hinkley Point C (a Sizewell B replica for which the company has already gained planning consent) has indicated that on current expectations about gas prices, the projected annual return to investors would lie in the range of 5 per cent to 9 per cent. 'Price Waterhouse, advising the company, do not consider that sufficient private capital could be attracted unless the internal rate of return of a project exceeded 11 per cent in real terms. 'Government action is required to bridge the gap between the expected returns and market requirements. 'To ensure that the majority of risk is transferred to the private sector, a substantial private-sector consortium would have to be created to take responsibility for construction. Government support would be needed in three areas: security for lenders during construction; long-term electricity purchase contracts; and share of regulatory risks. Financing would be easier if the project sponsors included a privatised nuclear generating company. 'Income security could be provided by means of a new non fossil-fuel obligation order (which would oblige regional electricity companies to take a certain amount of nuclear power). This may require primary legislation.' Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric chairman, said the review was about whether the UK wanted nuclear power to wither away, or whether it wanted to recognise its role in providing market competition, long-term electricity supplies and environmental balance. Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said that unless the government took action, Sizewell B could be the only nuclear power station operating in the UK in 30 years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nuclear Electric powers up for privatisation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1989/  1990/  1991/  1992/  1993/94                                      90     91     92     93   prelim  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Output (terawatt hours)            42.5   45.0   48.4   55.0    61.0 Income: market sales (Poundsm)     2044   1077   1167   1426    1732 levy premium (Poundsm)                    1195   1265   1280    1230 Operating profit (loss)*            n/a (1009)  (783)  (564)   (224) Accounting unit cost                5.2    4.4    4.2    3.6     3.1 (p/kWh at Oct 93 values) Return on capital employed %*              3.4    7.9   11.0    14.4 Market share %                     16.7   17.4   18.5   21.6    23.2 Staff employed at year end       14,164 13,542 12,674 11.323   9,454 Productivity (GWh/employee)         2.9    3.2    3.6    4.5     5.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Restated for Financial Reporting Standard No 3 but before provisions for restructuring and before revision of previous year's nuclear provisions Source: Nuclear Electric  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

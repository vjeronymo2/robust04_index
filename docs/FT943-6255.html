			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / West Bank agreement is signed Israeli Major General Danny Rothschild (left) and Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestine Liberation Organisation negotiator, pocket their pens yesterday after signing an accord transferring the control of education, taxation, health, welfare and tourism affairs in the occupied West Bank to Palestinian hands. The deal is the most important step in the Israeli-PLO autonomy process since self-rule for the Palestinians of Gaza and Jericho came into effect four months ago. The transfer of the education system has already been completed, in advance of the start of the new school year. At the signing, at the Erez crossing point between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Mr Sha'ath said the accord 'proves that the peace process continues, that it will not stop at Gaza and Jericho, that it will go through the West Bank . . . that it is implementable.' The ceremony was delayed for a short time by the PLO representatives, protesting at Israel's refusal on Sunday to allow a Pakistani diplomat to enter the Gaza Strip. The diplomat had intended to prepare the ground for a visit to Gaza by prime minister Benazir Bhutto. She has since cancelled the planned trip.

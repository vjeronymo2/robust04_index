			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, May 19 (AFP) -- Denmark has protested to  the United Nations about a refusal to provide close air support  for the Nordic battalion under attack by Bosnian Serbs at Tuzla  Airport this week, Defence Minister Hans Haekkerup said here  Thursday [19 May].    Ritzau news agency said he complained about "excuses and  reservations" among the UN Protection Force command in Bosnia  which had occurred many times in recent months.    "It is not for the fun of it that the Danish commanding  officer on the ground asks for NATO planes to intervene,"  Haekkerup said. "He is within his rights to have that backing  when the life of his soldiers is in danger."    The minister announced the protest after the head of  parliament's foreign affairs committee Peter Duetoft called for  such a move to protest lack of protection for the UN force's  Nordic contingents.</p>

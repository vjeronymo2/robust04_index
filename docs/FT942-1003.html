			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Three-P principles pull M&amp;S through - People, property and product have proved their worth over the decades for the British retailer Marks and Spencer's chairman Sir Richard Greenbury does not have much time for modern management gurus. He is more likely to turn for inspiration in running his company to one of his heroes, former US president Harry S Truman. Part of the reason could be that Truman was a man after the spirited M&amp;S chairman's own heart: 'He was feisty. He said what he thought.' Perhaps more importantly, Sir Richard regards a passage in Truman's memoirs summarising his thoughts on running large organisations as one of the best management texts ever written. Truman, like Sir Richard, thought management was largely a matter of good sense. Running a country was little different from running any large body. Marks and Spencer has had a century to shape its philosophy and style. It has stayed close to its founders' principles. The company grew out of a market stall in Leeds, northern England, set up in 1884 by a Polish-Jewish immigrant, Michael Marks. Ten years later Marks moved to Manchester and went into partnership with a Yorkshireman, Tom Spencer. They founded a string of Marks and Spencer's 'penny bazaars', with the slogan: 'Don't ask the price, it's a penny'. From market stalls to shopping arcade stores, the business evolved into a chain of department stores and later into the familiar format offering clothing and food. The business was driven forward by a partnership between Michael Marks' son Simon and Israel Sieff in 1915. They ran the company as a chain of stores until the 1960s and laid the foundations underpinning today's success. One was a policy of acquiring freehold and long leasehold properties. Another was cutting out wholesalers and middlemen to buy goods in bulk direct from manufacturers. A third was an emphasis on quality and innovation. As Simon Marks said in 1936: 'Efficient distribution is not a static conception. It involves constant alertness and study of the changing habits, desires and tastes of the consumer.' He might have had difficulty grasping the scale of the company today. It has 354 stores, 72 of them in seven countries outside the UK, as well as owning Brooks Brothers in the US and Japan, Kings supermarkets in the US, and the D'Allaird's chain in Canada. It also has 76 franchise stores in 18 countries. M&amp;S employs 62,000 people, and made profits last year of Pounds 851m on sales of Pounds 6.54bn. The guiding philosophy has changed little from Marks' time. Sir Richard sums this up as 'giving customers the best value for money - that is the price paid in relation to the (quality of) the good - and the best service.' Sir Richard acknowledges his debt to his predecessors. He summarises the strengths of Marks and Spencer as 'the three Ps' - people, property and product. M&amp;S has a reputation for taking on young people, training them, and keeping them. Sir Richard joined at 16 and many of its senior executives are career-long employees. Staff are wrapped into a corporate welfare and benefits system which includes competitive pay, and a non-contributory pension scheme which costs the company Pounds 50m a year. Sir Richard says M&amp;S promotes young talent and attempts to nurture 'mavericks and entrepreneurs'. One of the company's most valuable legacies is a property portfolio of which 93 per cent is freehold or long leasehold - a great asset when many retailers are struggling to pay rent. The policy of buying freeholds continues today. 'Buy a prime freehold site and get the business right,' says Sir Richard. 'If you don't get it right, it's still a prime freehold site, and you can sell it and kiss it goodbye.' The third 'P' - product quality - is inextricably linked to Marks and Spencer's relationship with its suppliers, regarded by many as the most important feature setting it apart from its rivals. M&amp;S was one of the first retailers, in 1935, to set up its own quality-control and research laboratories. It specifies stringent standards to its suppliers, many of which it has been dealing with for decades. At the same time, by buying early in large quantities, it can get very good prices. M&amp;S has a reputation for being a tough negotiator; Sir Richard says it is hard, but fair. Fairness, he adds, is another guiding principle. 'If I was asked the two qualities that mean most to me, I would say integrity and fair dealing were number one. Number two is courage, not physical courage, but courage to make decisions and get on with things.' The company's reputation for integrity - exemplified by its policy of paying suppliers within 20 days and food suppliers within 10 days - is one of the factors that has enabled it to expand into other areas such as financial services. As for courage to get on with things, M&amp;S is planning a Pounds 1bn investment programme over the next three years to increase its UK floorspace and expand its overseas operations. Its main targets are France and Spain, south-east Asia where pilot stores have proved successful and, eventually, Japan and China. The pace of expansion will, however, be measured and will be through organic growth and franchising, not through acquisition. Marks and Spencer has had less than happy experiences with acquisitions. Its acquisition of Brooks Bros in the US and Japan is regarded as a rare mistake. Many retail analysts believe M&amp;S paid too much (Dollars 750m) for a business which is yet to match the performance of the rest of the group. As the business expands, Sir Richard says another principle will guide his strategy. It is a principle he illustrates by reference to another of his passions - football. 'I used to love the Brazilians, and I still love my own team Manchester United, because they have a belief that winning is very, important . . . but if you win with a bit of style it helps.'</p>

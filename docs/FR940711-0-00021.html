			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the former program, handlers were denied credit for individual advertisements if those advertisements directed consumers to a specific retail store. Under the new program, this type of activity will be covered under the 14 broad categories for which credit will be allowed. Thus, the new program eliminates previous restrictions on handlers and will allow them greater flexibility in the promotion of their own products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, under the former program credit was denied for advertisements which also promoted competing nuts. Under the new program, advertisements which contain references to almonds as well as competing nuts will be eligible for reimbursement. Any reimbursement will, however, be limited to that percentage of the advertisement's cost which is equal to the percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to almonds or the percentage of the product's weight which is almonds. The Board believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler credit originates from assessments on almonds, not on other products. The Board believes that to allow more credit than provided in the percentage rule would not serve the best interests of the industry because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing to do with the almond industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previously, handlers were not allowed credit for advertisements which promoted complementary branded products. Under the new program, credit will be allowed for advertisements that promote both almonds and complementary branded products. For the reasons described above, however, the amount of the reimbursement will be directly related to the percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds. This will allow the almond industry to operate under a system which is as unrestricted as possible without sacrificing the objectives of the Almond Marketing Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, under the old program, credit was denied for advertisements which promoted products which were less than 50% almonds. Under the new program, credit will be granted for all advertisements of products which contain almonds, regardless of the amount of almonds which are actually in the product. Again, the amount of the reimbursement will be directly related to the percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recommending the new Credit-Back program, the Board concluded that because of the fundamental changes which have occurred in the almond industry in recent years, it has become more difficult for individual handlers to directly reach end consumers through their own advertising and promotion. Therefore, the importance of a collective industry effort to generically promote the overall use of almonds has grown. For these reasons, the Board elected to strengthen its generic promotion program while at the same time providing increased opportunities and incentives for handlers who wished to continue to advertise their own brand products in order to receive Credit-Back against their assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that the implementation of the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program will directly advance the industry's collective goal of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. In addition, the new program encourages and empowers handlers to protect their own interests by promoting their own brand of products in order to get Credit-Back. The new program also recognizes that the collective interests of the industry are better served if brand advertising and promotion is combined with the generic advertising and promotion of almonds. Both generic and brand advertising and promotion are proven promotional tools which have fostered the growth of the almond market over the last twenty years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising and promotion program have been modified or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing a minimum of restrictions on handlers. The Board, the elective body composed of industry representatives, has carefully considered all aspects of this program and believes that its implementation will lead to even greater strides in the development of the almond market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

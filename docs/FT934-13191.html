			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: AMR posts second consecutive profit AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, one of the biggest US airlines, turned in a second consecutive quarter of profit. Net income was Dollars 118m for the third quarter, compared with net losses of Dollars 100m last time. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, said the profits were 'insufficient, but a step in the right direction'. 'While we remain far short of our goals, we are pleased that our continuing efforts to control costs and maximise revenue have begun to improve results,' he said. The company dismissed reports that it was seeking an alliance with Sabena, the Belgian national carrier. American Airlines is the only large US airline not to have secured a large alliance with a European partner. American Airlines, like others in the US industry, has been dogged by tough competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. Last month it announced plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs and ground 11 of its DC-10 aircraft. Net earnings for the first nine months are Dollars 143m, compared with a loss of Dollars 275m.</p>

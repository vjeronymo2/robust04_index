			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION VII;  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS OVERCOMES PLAY-CALLING AND ST. MONICA  </P> <P> Steve Bresnahan hasn't made too many mistakes while coaching Laguna Hills High  School quarterback Casey Sullivan this season. But Bresnahan admitted to a  glitch that nearly proved disastrous Friday night.  </P> <P> Sullivan passed for two touchdowns as Laguna Hills held off a fourth-quarter  St. Monica rally, 21-17, in the first round of the Division VII playoffs at  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The Hawks (9-1-1) advance to Friday's second round against San Marino. St.  Monica ended the season at 6-5.  </P> <P> Bresnahan took full blame for giving St. Monica life in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Uncomfortable with a 21-7 lead, Bresnahan called for Sullivan to roll out to  the left for an option pass. There was only one problem -- Laguna Hills was at  its three-yard line and Sullivan was sacked for a safety.  </P> <P> After the safety, St. Monica went 41 yards with Na'il Benjamin scoring on a  two-yard run that cut the deficit to 21-17 with 6 minutes 19 seconds left to  play.  </P> <P> "That was a brilliant call at the three-yard line," Bresnahan said. "I'll take  credit for that. We were trying to get a big play. It was a gamble call."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Bresnahan, the Hawks' defense came up with some big plays in  the final four minutes, keeping St. Monica from crossing midfield.  </P> <P> "This wasn't our best game tonight," Bresnahan said, "but a lot of that had to  do with the fact we were playing a good team."  </P> <P> No one needed to tell that to Sullivan, who transferred from St. Monica last  spring. He completed three of five passes for 80 yards, including touchdowns of  60 and eight yards, against his former teammates.  </P> <P> Running back Marwan Saba added 97 yards in 17 carries and a touchdown.  </P> <P> St. Monica scored on its first possession as James White capped a 17-play,  64-yard drive with a four-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills tied the score, 7-7, with 1:21 left in the first quarter when Saba  scored on a nine-yard run. Saba was a workhorse on the drive, carrying the ball  six consecutive times for 59 yards.  </P> <P> The Hawks used a different route to the end zone in the second quarter.  Sullivan threw to a wide-open Sergio Jiminez for a 60-yard touchdown pass with  10:23 left in the second quarter.  </P></p>

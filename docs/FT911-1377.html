			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Big rise in installations: FT Satellite Monitor THE NUMBER of satellite television installations has more than doubled to encompass nearly 1.5m homes in the past year, Alice Rawsthorn writes. Figures from the FT Satellite Monitor indicate that in spite of the recession there were 1.48m installations by the end of April, compared with 653,000 at the same time in 1990. The number of satellite dishes has increased each month this year, from 1.3bn in January. Nearly 7 per cent of homes now have access to BSkyB television. The Satellite Monitor, a monthly study compiled for the FT by Continental Research, suggests that another 414,000 homes 'definitely' plan to install a satellite dish and a further 1.74m homes will 'probably' do so.</p>

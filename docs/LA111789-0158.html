			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMIRAL SAYS MISHAPS MAY BE ROOTED IN COMPLACENCY  </P> <P> A rash of Navy accidents may signal an outbreak of complacency among Navy  personnel following completion of stressful ocean maneuvers, Chief of Naval  Operations Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost told a congressional committee Thursday,  the second day of an unprecedented Navy-wide safety review.  </P> <P> "Are we saying to ourselves: 'OK, the hard stuff's over, this is a piece of  cake'?" Trost mused before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The sudden  spurt in mishaps, many of which came on the heels of a virtually accident-free  Pacific exercise, "does lead one to conclude that perhaps people are more  safety-conscious when operation tempo increases," Trost said.  </P> <P> Trost said "we place strong emphasis on supervisor and officer oversight," but  several senators nevertheless harshly criticized the Navy for lapses in  managing its personnel.  </P> <P> Trost and other naval officials also faced harsh criticism for the Navy's probe  of the April 19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, which killed 47 sailors.  </P> <P> In concluding that blast probably was a deliberate act by Gunner's Mate Clayton  M. Hartwig, the Navy disregarded glaring lapses in Navy safety practices and  personnel procedures, congressional critics charged.  </P> <P> "This is an appalling, appalling situation aboard a capital ship of the U.S.  Navy," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio). Hartwig and several other sailors killed  in the explosion were from Ohio.  </P> <P> Glenn repeated a litany of management shortcomings aboard the Iowa, ranging  from the unauthorized live-firing experiments aboard the ship to inadequate  training and certification of sailors.  </P> <P> Though the Navy's investigation called the deficiencies "a foundation for  disaster," the probe concluded that they did not cause the April blast or  contribute to the loss of lives.  </P> <P> Other senators and critics of the Navy joined forces to blast investigators for  discounting evidence contradicting the official conclusion that Hartwig  probably set off the explosion in a suicide attempt.  </P> <P> "It is a report that seems based on supposition and guesswork rather than fact  and physical evidence. It is in short a report that appears to be unraveling"  said Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> "I do not think we can have this flawed investigation stand as the truth of  what happened," added Dixon, who called for an agency separate from the Navy to  conduct a new probe.  </P> <P> In the face of a barrage of criticism, Navy Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, who  directed the probe, staunchly defended his panel's conclusion. "I know of  nothing that would cause me to change my report," he said.  </P> <P> Committee chair Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) dismissed the proposal of an independent  study as costly and duplicative.  </P> <P> But the father of one of the casualties applauded the idea.  </P> <P> "I think they're covering their butts all the way from the top to the bottom,"  said Robert Gedeon of Lakewood, Ohio, the father of Seaman Apprentice Robert  Gedeon III.  </P> <P> "My kid is dead. If the Navy is going to spend $20 million to fix that gun, it  can spend the same amount of money to find out what killed our boys -- and  what's still killing our boys," he added, in a reference to the recent rash of  accidents.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bank Policy Must Be Restructured"] </F>   [Text] There is a serious need for the complete  restructuring of economics and bank policy in the republic. This  was discussed broadly at a meeting held at the Cabinet of  Ministers which was chaired by Azerbaijan's prime minister,  Surat Huseynov, on 5 October.    At this meeting, which was attended by leading workers in  the  republic's banking, financial and tax organizations, the  situation in the finance and credit system was analyzed from all  sides. The discussion about the budget shortfall, shortcomings  in the collection of taxes and the low level of banking  technology was broached uncomfortably. It was noted that a  number of institutions openly avoid paying taxes, checks are not  accepted by the cashiers at commercial stores, and there is no  supervision over fully transferring to the budget taxes on  income attained.    In the opinion of those who spoke at the meeting, there is  an  urgent need for changes in the tax law, in preparing tax  prognoses, and in defining types of additional taxes. The  situation in the economy requires that domestic debit and credit  obligations be met rapidly. There can be no satisfaction in the  fact that these debts amount to some 200 billion rubles.    The speakers also touched on the issue of taking relevant  measures to use the state's expenditures more effectively. It  was noted that the most important production sectors have to be  restructured and that investment financing means must be used  correctly. The strengthening of the state's control over  currency transactions was made a priority at the meeting. It was  noted that import-export activity by banks was not supervised  adequately and that the employment of personnel with no  experience in the banking system had led to a lagging behind in  many sectors.    Prime Minister Surat Huseynov, in summing up the meeting's  results, talked about concrete duties connected with the  subjects discussed.</p>

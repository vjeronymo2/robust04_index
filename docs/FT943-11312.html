			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Granny's houses My daughters have jointly inherited two properties from their grandmother. These are valued at Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 28,000, with sitting tenants. If one became vacant and was sold for approximately Pounds 50,000, how would CGT be calculated? Would it make a difference if my daughters lived in the house before selling? Your daughters are deemed, for CGT purposes, to have acquired the houses at their grandmother's death at probate value, broadly speaking. The solicitor who acted for the executors will be able to give them the precise figures for CGT purposes (it is rather surprising that he or she did not give them the necessary information as a matter of course). By living in the house in question, and giving judiciously timed main-residence notices (first in favour of that house, and then in favour of their present residence, probably, with appropriate periods of retrospection), each of them could reduce her prospective CGT bill on the sale of the house, without producing an unacceptable CGT bill upon any sale of her present residence. It should be possible (as the law stands at present) for the prospective CGT bill on the other inherited property to be mitigated in a similar way. The rules are complex and arbitrary. Your daughters should seek guidance from the solicitor who acts for them in the house sale. As a first step, they can ask their tax offices for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses) and CGT14 (Capital gain tax: an introduction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

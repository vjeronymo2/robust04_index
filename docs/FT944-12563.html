			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Chimes at midnight Something seismic seems to be under way in London. First some areas round Heathrow start to collapse, resulting in underground trains not stopping at terminal four for the next few weeks. Now one of London's best-known landmarks, Big Ben, has slipped, albeit almost imperceptibly. A 3mm shift on the clock's east face has been detected by electronic sensors, caused by the natural sway of tall buildings and by tidal movements on the river Thames. With all this talk of (metaphorical) cracks appearing in the fabric of the UK establishment, it's just a trifle spooky to see some real ones too.</p>

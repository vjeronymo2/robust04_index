			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that the May 19 report of  "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and "Human Rights in China" alleging  that there were 500 newly reported detainees from the '89  turmoil was groundless.    The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported  detainees from the 1989 protests in Beijing No. 2 Prison and the  Qinghe Reform-Through-Labor Farm in Tianjin. It claimed that  the prisoners remain under harsh conditions and often have been  tortured and poorly treated in jail.    "This is a sheer fabrication," the spokesman said in  response  to a request for comment.    The "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and "Human Rights in China"  have a deep hostility toward China, the spokesman said, adding  that in the past they fabricated similar rumors on the issue of  human rights.    "It is out of ulterior motives that they spread such rumors  now," the spokesman said.</p>

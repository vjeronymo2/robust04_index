			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VANDALISM AND HATE CRIMES  </P> <P> Your article on the vandalism of St. Francis of Assisi Church misses the point  ("Attacks on Church Part of Rise in Hate Crimes," Metro, May 27). These attacks  are incorrectly characterized by many, including the conservative majority of  the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, as hate crimes.  </P> <P> It is clear that whoever these vandals are, they are not protesting the  church's wafer and wine, statuary, prayer beads or incense. Any attack against  the use of these implements and their associated rites are and should be  considered hate crimes. They are not the issues here.  </P> <P> The vandalism, though regrettable, is clearly in protest of the church's  anti-life AIDS policies, and anti-choice abortion policy. If churches are going  to encourage their parishioners to engage in political activity, if church  officials are going to take controversial political stands and threaten  political candidates with ecclesiastical retaliation unless they apply church  teachings to their secular responsibilities, they cannot expect to be exempt  from protest.  </P> <P> They cannot cry foul when confronted with the anger of those who work to  protect the rights and health of citizens.  </P> <P> MICHAEL SHERE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

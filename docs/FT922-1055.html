			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Airtours reduces losses as winter sales improve AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest package holiday company, yesterday reported a reduced first-half loss after a sharp rise in sales last winter. In the six months to the end of March, Airtours increased the number of passengers carried by 77 per cent and its sales by a larger 83 per cent to Pounds 101.55m as margins increased. UK holiday companies traditionally incur losses in the first half as they pre-pay certain of their summer season costs. But as a result of the jump in sales, Airtours cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 5.59m. The deficit included for the first time a seasonal loss on its leased aircraft fleet and Pounds 1.1m in start-up costs on the introduction of three additional aircraft. Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the summer holiday market as a whole had increased by 20 per cent, the first growth in two years, while the winter market had grown by 8.3 per cent, the first increase since the 1988-89 season. Airtours' summer bookings are 31 per cent ahead of last year following a 30 per cent increase in the number of holidays on offer. Bookings in April and May were higher than in the same period last year, but the first two weeks of June had been weak with volumes maintained but at the expense of lower margins. Mr Crossland said Airtours had taken a large slice of the market left when Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group collapsed last year. The company had benefited more than competitors such as Thomson and Owners Abroad but remained as dependent as ever on margins that could be attainable in the late booking market between July and September, he said. The results suggested that, in spite of the recession, holidays were among the last non-essential costs to be cut. 'People are using holidays as a form of escapism,' Mr Crossland said. Airtours ended the half year with cash balances of Pounds 90m which will rise substantially by the year-end. Mr Crossland said the company was actively looking for acquisitions. The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 0.55p. Losses per share fell from 6.33p to 4.29p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The recent meeting of the foreign ministers of the  Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] in Riyadh has shown the  differences in the points of view of the members of this council  more than ever before. Saud al-Faysal, Saudi Arabian foreign  minister and rotating chairman of the meeting, said in his  speech: Iraq remains a threat to the security and stability of  GCC countries. Therefore, the council's member states should  take a unified stance toward it.    According to political observers, this statement is not only  a reiteration of the previous position of this council on Iraq,  it also points to the relations between Qatar and Oman, which  have in the past year expanded considerably. Three years ago,  during the oil Gulf war, in opposition to a GCC decision, Oman  did not sever its relations with Iraq. Recently, with mutual  visits by officials of these two countries, their relations have  expanded. Qatar, unlike Oman, severed its relations with Iraq  during the oil war and took part militarily in the liberation of  Kuwait. However, since then -- and, more precisely, since the  border clash with Saudi Arabia -- Qatar has restored its  relations with Iraq and is currently expanding them.    Another issue on the agenda of the GCC foreign ministers,  which was also pointed out in the final communique of this  session, was the stance of this council regarding Israel's  participation in regional multilateral meetings, which are due  to take place in the future in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain.  Multilateral sessions are basically derived from the so-called  Middle East peace negotiations. Unlike bilateral negotiations,  in which only the two opposing sides take part, the Zionist  regime participates in the major multilateral sessions of Arab  countries [as heard] and some European, American, and Asian  countries. It is worth noting that Syria and Lebanon, which are  themselves two major partners in the negotiating process with  the Zionist regime, have boycotted multilateral negotiations.  They believe that regional cooperation with the participation of  the Zionist regime cannot be possible until tangible progress is  made in resolving the crisis in the Middle East and until the  aggressive policies of Israel are reversed.    A multilateral meeting on water resource cooperation is due  to take place in Oman in two weeks' time. A similar session is  to take place in Qatar a month later on arms control in the  Middle East. Next fall, another session on the environment is  due to take place in Bahrain. The Zionist regime is to take  part officially in these meetings, which are being held in Arab  countries of the Persian Gulf. According to political experts,  this issue was brought up in the recent GCC session because the  host countries of the multilateral meetings intend to act  collectively [sentence as heard].    Of course, opening the door of the region to the usurper  Zionist regime will not have fortunate results. The negative  impacts of such uncalculated measures will definitely engulf  those countries that engage in political adventurism without  taking into account public opinion.    Another issue that was mentioned in the final communique of  the recent GCC foreign ministers meeting was support for the  position of the United Arab Emirates on the Iranian island of  Abu Musa. It is obvious that the GCC is a regional organization  which could clearly help to resolve any misunderstanding between  the countries of the region. However, repeating the mistaken  policy of this council on the Iranian island of Abu Musa  destroys the cooperation of this council in finding a solution  to this matter. According to political experts, the GCC cannot  take part in any political effort to solve differences until it  exhibits a neutral stance on regional problems.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Campaign aims to alter tunnel vision A CAMPAIGN by Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, to counter the public's innate suspicion of being linked to mainland Europe begins this week, Diane Summers writes. Newspaper advertisements (above) will aim to explain how the tunnel car-passenger service from Folkestone to Calais will operate from next May. The Pounds 2m advertisements will form part of a wider Pounds 25m pan-European campaign to publicise 'Le Shuttle'. Eurotunnel said there was still widespread ignorance about how it would work. BMP DDB Needham, which devised the advertisements, said the public was less interested in the engineering achievements of the tunnel than how the shuttle would work in practice. The 1990s marketing techniques are being applied to an idea that dates back more than a century. Work on the first Channel tunnel began during the 1880s at Folkestone, Kent (below). By 1888, 2,000 yards had been dug from England but fears over national security forced the government of the day to scrap the project.</p>

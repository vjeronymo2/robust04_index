			<p>BFN     [Text] Tabriz, E. Azerbaijan, April 21, IRNA -- Volume of  Trade exchanges between Iran and Australia reached dlrs.  [dollars] 400 million last year, Australian Ambassador to Tehran  Nicolas Warner told IRNA here Wednesday [20 April].    Warner said during the period Iran's non-oil exports to  Australia stood at dlrs. 25 million, up by 40 percent as  compared with the amount of the preceding year. The exported  commodities mainly included dried fruit and carpet, he added.    Australia has made some efforts to reduce the negative  balance in the two countries' trade exchanges through organizing  trade fairs and seminars for the Iranian exporters in several  Australian cities.    Noting that Iran mainly imported wheat, meat and  telecommunication equipment from Australia, Warner said his  country had allocated dlrs. 750 million in credit for the  Iranian importers in an effort to further consolidate mutual  industrial and trade cooperation.    The ambassador visited this northwestern Iranian city to  explore the grounds for the promotion of commercial cooperation  between the provincial units and country.</p>

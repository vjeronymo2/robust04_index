			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Executive share option schemes 'lack performance targets' Some two-thirds of UK-listed companies are operating executive share option schemes without any performance targets, KPMG Peat Marwick said. A survey by the accountancy firm of 374 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with executive share option schemes found that some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 10.5bn of publicly quoted shares allocated to executive option schemes do not refer to performance. Mr David Tuch, a KPMG tax partner, said: 'It is clear from our survey that in the vast majority of the original schemes, there was no attempt to link the company's performance in any way to the rewards via share options . . . a senior executive could expect.' While this was now changing, he said, only slightly more than half the companies introducing schemes since 1988 had performance targets. Mr Tuch said the report highlighted a need for schemes to be more closely related to performance: 'Executive share options should be powerful performance motivators for directors, linking their rewards to those of shareholders.' The government is under pressure to end the income tax exemption for Inland Revenue-approved schemes. This was introduced in 1984 and led to a proliferation of schemes giving executives the right to acquire shares in the future, usually at a price based on the share price at the time the option was granted. The schemes were initially popular because they were financed by equity rather than profits, but companies have been under pressure from institutions to introduce option performance targets. The survey found some 74 per cent of schemes with performance targets used formulae linked to earnings per share, although this was losing its popularity.

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress [USC]  said that today the Somali National Alliance [SNA] soldiers  loyal to Mohamed Farah Aidid today launched attacks reopening  old scars in Makka and Madina Districts in Mogadishu. The  spokesman said the fighting was going on around an area adjacent  to Gezira Beach and near Madina hospital.    The spokesman said that by launching the flagrant attacks,  the SNA had broken the UN-brokered cease-fire agreement signed  in March 1992 by the two USC factions and the SNA in order to  bring peace to Mogadishu, the Addis Ababa agreement of 22 March  1993, the Hirab community agreement stipulating no further civil  war and the Nairobi agreement to which 15 Somali organizations  were signatories.    The spokesman wishes to inform officials of UN Operation in  Somalia II, the USC communities, the Alliance of 12 [Somali  Salvation Alliance, headed by Ali Mahdi Mohamed], and the  peace-loving Somali people that the SNA has broken the peace  agreement, and adds that the SNA will be held responsible for  any problems arising from the fighting it has sparked off.    In light of the fighting, the spokesman has called on those  forces fighting for the defense of Somalia's honor and  sovereignty to be extra alert and to prepare to counter the  SNA's provocation and aggression. Listeners, we will  communicate to you any new developments in our later bulletins.</p>

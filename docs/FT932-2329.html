			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Miners agree to pit closure 10 weeks after reprieve BRITISH COAL yesterday signalled the beginning of the end for most of the 12 pits it reprieved just 10 weeks ago when it secured miners' approval to close one and sought the closure of another two. The moves drew a fierce rebuke from the Labour party but only muted criticism from rebel Tory MPs who had forced the government into a politically damaging retreat from its original plan to close 31 pits, after public outrage at last October's announcement. It is likely that the vote to close Rufford, in Nottinghamshire, will be the first in a series of votes among the 12. Coal and electricity industry executives believe few are likely to survive beyond a year because of an even worse slump in the coal market than was predicted in March. At Rufford, miners voted by a majority of 20 to carry on working until the current face runs out of coal around the end of the year. This option attracted 226 votes, according to British Coal. Another option rejecting the claim that the pit has no future beyond next year won 206 votes. British Coal wants to close Rufford by Christmas. At Markham, in Derbyshire, members of the National Union of Mineworkers, the pit's majority union, meet today to consider British Coal's closure proposal and colleagues in Silverdale, Staffordshire, are likely to follow suit shortly. Unlike officials of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, who recommended the vote should take place at Rufford, NUM officials at Markham are advising members not to hold a vote, and to resist attempts to close the pit. In all three cases, British Coal has warned that geological problems are threatening the pits' futures. If miners accept closure by Christmas, they will be entitled to enhanced severance terms of up to Pounds 37,000 or a job elsewhere. Rufford, Markham and Silverdale were among 12 pits which the government said it would subsidise in March after a backbench revolt over pit closures. The subsidy depended on British Coal finding a market for their coal but the corporation said yesterday that some of the 12 were still not competitive enough. Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry secretary, said he would demand an explanation from the government on Monday as to why it had misled the Commons by claiming it had saved the 12 pits. The reprieve followed a public outcry over plans to close three-fifths of Britain's mines. With the market for coal contracting, few are expected to have a long-term future. Mr Cook said the energy market had been rigged against coal and urged Tory MPs to resist the new closures. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Labour wanted the government to destroy jobs in the rest of industry 'to try to maintain jobs in the coal industry.' Meanwhile, British Coal said it had received about 100 expressions of interest in the first four of 20 pits it is offering to the private sector, although not all applicants wanted to mine coal.

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORE THAN 500 FLOCK TO COUNCIL REMAP SESSION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: RESULTS OF MARATHON MEETING SCHEDULED TO BE DISCUSSED TODAY.  </P> <P> More than 500 San Diegans with an interest in the city's redistricting attempt  gathered in Golden Hall on Monday night to learn if the City Council would vote  to support one of two competing maps under consideration.  </P> <P> At 9:30 p.m., the council was still gathering testimony from the hundreds of  people in attendance. It was unclear whether a vote on the controversial maps  would follow.  </P> <P> However, two motions made at the meeting's outset failed to draw a majority.  One of them called for a vote after the completion of testimony. The other  called for a vote at an upcoming council meeting.  </P> <P> The results of Monday night's meeting were to be discussed during an 11:30 a.m.  meeting today in U. S. Magistrate Harry McCue's chambers, and in the early  afternoon in the chambers of U. S. District Judge John Rhoades. McCue and  Rhoades are reviewing the city's redistricting effort as part of a settlement  between the city and the Chicano Federation.  </P> <P> The federation has alleged that the City Council, in its July 9 vote, violated  the terms of the settlement. At that meeting, a council majority supported a  map that was introduced by Councilman John Hartley.  </P> <P> A second map, which is supported by the Chicano Federation, was forwarded to  the council by an appointed redistricting advisory board.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Monday night's meeting drew strong comments from supporters  and detractors of the two maps now being considered by the council.  </P> <P> "We clearly support the Hartley map," said Bonnie Poppy, a Golden Hill resident  who linked her neighborhood's continued economic revitalization to a  redistricting that does not split the community.  </P> <P> "Big money can fool most of the people . . . but it can't fool all of us," said  Eric Seigel, another Golden Hill resident who supports the Hartley map.  </P> <P> The advisory board's map drew strong support from Laura Langman, a San Diegan  who said the turnout Monday night offered proof that "there are a lot of people  here who do care."  </P> <P> Pacific Beach Town Council President Barbara Hughes complained that the Hart  ley map "suddenly appeared" with little or no public discussion. Hughes asked  the council to vote for the advisory board map because Hartley's would split  her neighborhood in half.  </P> <P> Vicky Durham, who now lives in Councilman Bruce Henderson's district, asked the  council to support the advisory board's map and then concentrate "on real  problems that we need to solve."  </P> <P> Irma Castro, executive director of the Chicano Federation, defended the board's  map-drawing process as open and aboveboard.  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Danes resolute in fending off attack on krone THE SIEGE of the Danish krone on foreign exchange markets has re-opened the debate about whether the pressure on the currency can be put down to 'speculators' or something more seriously wrong in the Danish economy. Mrs Marianne Jelved, the economy minister, is adamant it has nothing to do with 'economic fundamentals' - and that there is no case for a devaluation, let alone for leaving the European exchange rate mechanism. As the krone enters its second week under attack, she is determined to see the doubters and speculators beaten off for the fourth time in 12 months. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its half-yearly Economic Outlook published in June, warned that the Danish government's expansive fiscal policy could well lead markets to doubt 'the country's continued commitment to a hard currency policy'. Mrs Jelved points to Denmark's low inflation rate - about 1 per cent over the past 12 months - and a DKr28bn (Pounds 2.84bn) surplus on the balance of payments of the current account, well over 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But, as the OECD reports, the central government budget deficit this year and next will be about DKr55bn, 6 per cent of GDP, according to the government's own forecasts. A deficit of half that is sought under the Maastricht treaty on closer European union. Then there is an unemployment rate of 12 per cent, which reflects the fact that over the past six years the annual average GDP growth rate has been just 1 per cent. In the first quarter of this year, GDP fell by 1.3 per cent compared with the first quarter last year. Export competitiveness has been hit by the depreciation of the British pound, the Swedish krona and other currencies, leaving the trade-weighted value of the krone up about 8 per cent. First quarter exports fell in value by 8.6 per cent from the same quarter last year and by about 6 per cent in volume. Nonetheless, few leading export companies are actively urging a devaluation, although their profits are being badly squeezed. But it is 'a very sensitive issue', as Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of the country's biggest bank, Den Danske Bank, said, even before the latest attack on the krone. The coalition government, headed by the Social Democratic leader Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, is determined to get the economy moving again. It has embarked on an expansionist fiscal policy, in marked contrast to most other European governments, which are searching for spending cuts in the interests of lower interest rates. The main thrust is in big cuts in income tax next year. Over five years, the revenue loss will be made up through other tax increases, but in 1994 and 1995 the reform will be under-financed. In addition, there is a programme to increase infrastructure investment. The government says the boost to demand is a result of the changes will lead to an increase in GDP of 3.4 per cent in 1994, with private consumption soaring by 4.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honeywell in call for patent defence fund HONEYWELL, the US controls manufacturer that was last week awarded Dollars 96m by a US jury for alleged violation of its autofocus camera patents by Minolta of Japan, has urged other US companies to join in establishing a defence fund for small business owners. Honeywell said it would launch the fund with its own contribution of Dollars 1m, and would ask other US technology companies to participate in the fund. The plan is for a Dollars 10m fund that would assist small businessmen and entrepreneurs who wished to protect intellectual property against international competitors. The fund would be replenished from legal fees awarded or negotiated as patent disputes are resolved, according to Mr Christopher Steffen, Honeywell finance director.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dasa, Fokker reach takeover deal DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany is to pay Fl 880m (Dollars 503m) for a 51 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft builder, under an agreement reached yesterday after several months of intense negotiation with the Dutch government. The deal, which ushers in a major restructuring of Europe's regional aerospace industry, calls for Dasa to pay Fl 37 per share for the 10.6m shares owned by the Dutch state and the 13.2m new shares to be issued by Fokker. This price, which had been widely leaked to the press, is well above Fokker's closing price of Fl 17.80 on Wednesday. The shares were suspended all day yesterday because of conflicting initial reports on whether or not a definitive deal had been agreed. The delay in announcing the deal was caused by the precise wording of the contract's references to the future of the Fokker 50, a 50-seater turbo-prop launched in the mid-1980s with the help of government funds. Mr Koos Andriessen, minister of economic affairs, sought guarantees that the Fokker 50 would be safeguarded. The aircraft is a direct competitor to the ATR-42, built jointly by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Dasa is planning to sell parts of its Fokker stake to the French and Italian companies later in the 1990s to create a European regional aircraft consortium. Both sides have now agreed that production of the Fokker 50, which generates 25 per cent of the company's turnover, can be halted, if necessary, provided that the move does not threaten Fokker's 'continuity'. Mr Andriessen said that this gave him 'reasonable' confidence about the aeroplane's future. Fokker, which also produces the 100-seater Fokker 100, welcomed the deal because Dasa has promised to give it the leading role in aircraft with between 65 and 130 seats. This means that Fokker can continue developing a new aircraft, the Fokker 70. The takeover has proved to be controversial in the Netherlands, sparking debates about industrial policy and the position of minority shareholders in Dutch listed companies. Under a preliminary agreement signed in July, the state will use half the proceeds to buy shares in a new Fokker holding company to be set up by Dasa. However, it will have to sell this 22 per cent holding within three years. Yesterday's accord must still be submitted to the unions and the European Commission for approval.</p>

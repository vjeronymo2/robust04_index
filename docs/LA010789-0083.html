			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JONES TAKES 1-SHOT LEAD AT LA COSTA;  </P> <P> 10 OTHERS IN T OF C ARE IN HOT PURSUIT  </P> <P> The La Costa course was still wet and muddy in spots from Thursday afternoon's  rain. A persistent wind made conditions in the MONY Tournament of Champions  more difficult.  </P> <P> However, the touring pros weren't complaining about the course Friday, saying  it was a fair test of golf.  </P> <P> Considering the conditions, a sub-par round was commendable, and 10 were  recorded Friday. So it's a rather tightly packed field after 36 holes.  </P> <P> Two newcomers to the tournament, Steve Jones and Chip Beck, were still playing  consistently. Jones had a 69, as he did Thursday, to take a 1-stroke lead at  138, 6 under par.  </P> <P> Beck, who had a 69 on the first day, shot a 70 Friday for 139. Three players,  Lanny Wadkins, Mark Calcavecchia and Jeff Sluman, are very much in contention  at 141.  </P> <P> So are Jay Haas, David Frost, Sandy Lyle and Ben Crenshaw at 142. Greg Norman  and Andrew Magee, the first-day leader, are only 5 strokes behind Jones.  </P> <P> Magee, who had a 68 Thursday, faltered to a 75 Friday. By contrast, Haas had  the best round Friday with a 67 after shooting 75 Thursday.  </P> <P> Crenshaw had the roughest finish. Playing with Beck, he was 5 under par through  16 holes.  </P> <P> Then, on the 569-yard, par 17th hole, his second shot went into the water  bordering the fairway. So did his third shot, and Crenshaw wound up taking a  triple bogey 8 on the hole.  </P> <P> Jones said his driver betrayed him early in the round, but his putting saved  him. He made 6 birdies to offset 3 bogeys.  </P> <P> "I'm getting a lot out of my game," said Jones, adding that he's surprised to  be playing so well so early in the season.  </P> <P> Jones said he benefited from a tip from Mac O'Grady.  </P> <P> "I remember him telling me to tee it low, and then you have to stay low through  the ball," Jones said. "I hit every green coming in and made pars (on the 13th  hole through the 18th)." Beck said his chipping was a little bit off, but he  still managed to make 6 birdies.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, tomorrow I won't make as many mistakes," he said. "I left myself in  too many tight situations today.  </P> <P> "It was colder today than it was Thursday, and, along with the wind and mud, it  made judgment difficult."  </P> <P> Because this is the season's first tour event, and all the players here won on  the tour at least once in 1988, it would be premature to establish a favorite  after 2 rounds.  </P> <P> However, Wadkins, an aggressive veteran, is in a favorable position. He won  this tournament in 1981 and 1982 and has 6 career victories in California  tournaments.  </P> <P> At 39, Wadkins is the oldest player in the field, and what he calls a long  layoff hasn't affected his game.  </P> <P> "I haven't played since Nabisco (November)," said Wadkins, jokingly adding:  "Unfortunately, I haven't made any money, but my wife hasn't slowed down her  spending."  </P> <P> Wadkins, a fast starter in the past, said he plays scared because he's tied  with everyone at the start of the year.  </P> <P> "All in all, I've played some solid golf the last 2 days," said Wadkins, who  had a 70 Friday after shooting 71 Thursday. "The course was playing long coming  in because of the wind and cold. For example, on No. 16 (a 423-yard par 4), I  hit a driver and 1-iron and didn't get there.  </P> <P> "I like this course, and you don't have to beat as many people (only 32). It's  a good, solid test of golf and, when the rough is up in April, it's as good a  test as you'll see."  </P> <P> Haas said he was pleasantly surprised with his round, considering that he woke  up with a cold.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to get back into the tournament. I guess you have to look out for  the sick guys," he said.  </P> <P> Haas shot a 5-under-par 31 in the first 9 holes and was even par on the back  side.  </P> <P> He recorded 5 birdies through 9 holes and added 1 more on the 16th hole. Then,  he recorded his only bogey of the day on the tough par-5 17th hole.  </P> <P> He drove into the right rough, and his second shot found the left rough. His  third shot was about 50 yards short of the green. He then chipped onto the  green and 2-putted.  </P> <P> Haas had a hot putter most of the round.  </P> <P> "I switched putters today, using one that I had won with before," he said. "It  has a similar blade to what Crenshaw uses, and I imitated his stroke a little  bit."  </P> <P> It's doubtful that Haas will switch putters again today.  </P></p>

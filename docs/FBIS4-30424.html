			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 24 June that the government is  reviewing a plan to request that the United States ask North  Korea, in the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks slated for early  July, that North Korea export the used nuclear fuel and  plutonium that was produced inevitably in the course of  reprocessing, to a third country.    A relevant Foreign Ministry official said that "the  reprocessing process that generates plutonium is inevitable if  North Korea permanently stores extracted nuclear fuel rods." He  added that "in the event that North Korea attempts to merely  store fuel rods without reprocessing them, there is the danger  of explosion and of radioactivity leakage."</p>

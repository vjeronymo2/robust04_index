			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> USC KICKS OFF IN GIANTS STADIUM; KCOP AIRS ACTION  </P> <P> While Tennessee and Colorado receive the honor of opening the 1990 college  football season, USC will be playing in the second game, facing Syracuse in  Friday's Kickoff Classic at 5 p.m. on KCOP. Phil Stone and Dave Rowe will call  the game.  </P> <P> NBC sportscaster Don Criqui has been a member of the Kickoff Classic's  committee since its inception in 1983.  </P> <P> "A team's season turns on that first big game," Criqui said. "Teams that have  come out of the Kickoff Classic with a win have usually gone on to have  terrific years. But the good team who loses tends to start off on a real down  note. Either Tennessee or Colorado will be off to a pretty big start in the  Disneyland Pigskin Classic and the same is true with USC or Syracuse in the  Kickoff Classic."  </P> <P> The game at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., is USC's first appearance  in the greater New York City area since a 28-6 win over Army in 1951.  </P> <P> The Trojans will be getting nearly as much air time as Bart Simpson this  season, with 11 of their 12 games set for live television. ABC will televise  games against Penn State (Sept. 15), Ohio State (Sept. 29), Stanford (Oct. 13),  Arizona State (Oct. 27), UCLA (Nov. 17) and Notre Dame (Nov. 24). Prime Ticket  will carry games against Washington (Sept. 22), Arizona (Oct. 20) and Cal (Nov.  3.) ESPN will broadcast the Oct. 6 Washington State game. Only the Nov. 10 game  against Oregon State is not scheduled for a live broadcast.  </P> <P> What about UCLA? The Bruins will have at least seven of their 11 games on live  television, beginning with their Sept. 8 opener against Oklahoma. ABC will  provide coverage beginning at 12:30 p.m. ABC also will carry the Sept. 22  Michigan game and Nov. 17 USC game. Prime Ticket has scheduled UCLA's games  against Stanford (Sept. 15), San Diego State (Oct. 13) and Oregon State (Oct.  27), while ESPN will broadcast the Washington State game Sept. 29.  </P> <P> Other games could be added depending on their importance.  </P> <P> Prime Ticket will air tapes of all USC and UCLA games.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's lone television appearance will come on Sept. 29 when  SportsChannel carries the Titans Big West Conference game at Fresno State.

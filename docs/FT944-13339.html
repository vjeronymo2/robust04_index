			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Forstmann acquires Ziff's publishing business for Dollars 1.4bn Most of the assets of Ziff-Davis Publishing, a US leading pub lisher of computer magazines, trade newspapers and books, are to be acquired by Forstmann Little, a New York investment firm, for Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 857m) in cash. The privately held publishing group is being sold by the Ziff family, which will retain a small equity interest. The three Ziff brothers, Dirk, Robert and Daniel, have approximately a 90 per cent interest in the company. They announced plans to sell the business - built up by their father William - in June. The men said their interests were in investing, rather than publishing. Proceeds of the sale will go to Ziff Investments, an investment firm run by Dirk Ziff. The sale has attracted broad interest in the media industry because Ziff is on the leading edge of multimedia publishing, including computer on-line publishing and CD-Rom titles and because computer publications are one of the strongest growth sectors in publishing. Other companies believed to have shown a serious interest in acquiring parts of Ziff include Anglo-Dutch publishing company Reed Elsevier, Japanese software distributor Softbank and German media company Bertelsmann AG. K-III Communications, McGraw Hill and Time Warner are also said to have considered bidding. Mr Dirk Ziff said the family was 'delighted' with the sale agreement. The Forstmann bid was attractive, among other reasons, because the investment group was expected to be able to close the transaction by the end of the year, he added. Forstmann will acquire Ziff's business magazine group, which includes PC Magazine, its flagship publication with a paid circulation of over 1m copies. Also included in the deal are Ziff's recently formed consumer media group, its international media group, a market research group and Ziff-Davis Interactive, which provides on-line information to thousands of users. Ziff's annual revenue of nearly Dollars 1bn and Dollars 160m in operating profit comes largely from its computer trade magazines. Forstmann said that it will invest over Dollars 900m of its own capital in Ziff-Davis. The investment 'will facilitate the dynamic growth of this business as the PC revolution continues to gather momentum', said Mr Theodore Forstmann, senior partner.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Low bidder dropped from BTG contest THE GOVERNMENT has ruled out one of the three short-listed bidders for British Technology Group, the state-owned technology transfer organisation. It may make a provisional choice between the two remaining consortia today, though an announcement is unlikely until next week. Technology Marketing Corporation, a company formed to bid for BTG by Strategy International, a London-based consultancy, was told yesterday that its bid was too low. It is believed to have offered only about Pounds 13m. The two consortia still in the contest - one led by BTG management and the other by Research Corporation Technologies of the US with Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics - are understood to have submitted bids well below the Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m valuation unofficially put on BTG when the controversial privatisation process started last year. Price Waterhouse, the government's financial adviser, was locked in negotiations with both groups yesterday. The final composition of the winning consortium is unlikely to be settled until the last moment.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A YIDDISH TERM EVOLVES  </P> <P> In "The American Jewish Experience" (Dec. 22), Elaine Woo referred to a common  but mistaken explanation of the Yiddish term bobe mayse.  </P> <P>  First, a bobe mayse is not merely an anecdote about the past but rather an old  wives' tale, often of doubtful veracity. Moreover, while most Yiddish speakers  believe that the expression derives from the Yiddish bobe (grandmother), it  actually has a more literary antecedent: an early 16th-Century Yiddish romance  called the "Bove-bukh" ("Bove-Book"), written in Italy. Its author, Elye  Levita, borrowed from an earlier Italian source, which was in turn based on the  escapades -- in English -- of one Bevis of Hampton. Via the Italian, Bevis  became Bove.  </P> <P> Once the Bove-bukh was no longer regular reading among Yiddish speakers, the  term bove-mayse (Bove story) acquired its present folk etymology.  </P> <P> JANET HADDA  </P> <P> Associate Professor of Yiddish  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

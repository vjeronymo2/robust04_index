			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Revenge of the central banks - This time around, speculators have lost heavily After the halcyon years of 1992/3 when bull markets in financial assets and one way bets in the ERM swelled foreign exchange trading profits, 1994 has proved to be more challenging. In contrast to the earlier period when the ERM crises saw currency markets dominate the headlines, the recent ructions in financial asset markets did not spill over directly into currencies. But the overall nervousness, as investors contemplate whether a bear market is under way, has not helped foreign exchange trading rooms which depend on cross-border deals for their volumes. Indeed, there is a sense in which 1994 has witnessed the revenge of the central banks. In 1992/3, many of them were humbled by speculators who profited handsomely at the expense of taxpayers. This time round it has been the 'speculators' who have lost heavily, with just about everyone appearing to have got the dollar wrong against the yen. Up-to-date national and global foreign exchange trading figures are not available, but the overall picture is one of volumes having returned to roughly the levels before the ERM shake-up (though some claim volumes are as high as ever). A consultant to a leading European bank active in foreign exchange argues that the total volume of foreign exchange business in London, easily the largest market, grew by 10 per cent last year. Although there have been periods of considerable intra-day volatility, the general complaint is that trading has been trendless, with foreign exchanges taking their tune from other asset markets. The one glaring exception, of course, has been the steady downward path of the dollar, with most investors on the wrong side of the trend. Profit trends are also not easy to determine. UK banks do not report on a quarterly basis, while US banks tend not to disaggregate their trading revenues. In general, though, those banks which rely more on an established client base than own-account trading are likely to have done better. And as the first quarter results of leading US banks like JP Morgan, Bankers Trust and Citicorp made clear, trading revenues were sharply lower. Within these figures, foreign exchange revenues probably fell proportionally less than bond and equity revenues. Banks appear to have lost most of their money during the first quarter in emerging market securities and European bonds. The two bits of hard information about 1994 trading come from Chase and Citibank which show a separate foreign exchange revenue figure. Looking at the income line, Citibank's revenues fell to Dollars 66m from Dollars 156m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 240m a year ago. At Chase, the comparable figures were Dollars 85m, compared to Dollars 75m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 103m in the first quarter of 1993. Citibank's figures form the basis for a widely-held market view that the industry leader performed worse than expected. But Citibank says this figure is distorted by accounting vagaries and notes that if its revenues are broken down by trading activity, foreign exchange is flat at Dollars 200m compared to a year previously. With proprietary profits more difficult in a trendless market, the focus has switched sharply back towards the customer. This has helped a bank such as Midland, a distribution-led outfit that functions more as a market-maker than as a position taker, relying on a core client base to generate business. Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, says that he is still seeing growth in both the funds and the corporate side of the business. Foreign exchange earnings, he says, were also better in the first quarter of 1994 than the same period in 1993. Chris Deuters, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers, says although the first quarter of 1994 was a difficult one, the aim remains the same: to use foreign exchange as a separate asset and investment class, with a premium on the relationship with the customer. It is a case, he says, of 'back to basics', of getting close to the client to understand his needs. With 'central banks no longer in the middle, dishing out taxpayers money', says Mr Deuters, there is a greater premium on relationships and good traders. Getting close to the customer is hardly novel, but 'it's not the originality of the idea that differentiates the bank. It's the execution.' Another key challenge he stresses is the globalisation of the business. 'Clients' risk doesn't end at 5pm, so you have to be global.' Putting this operation together, without having multiple trading rooms in the same time zone, is an important task. For Julian Simmonds, managing director foreign exchange and money markets, Europe at Citibank, a key difference between 1994 and 1993 is the shift in emphasis between costs and revenues. Whereas business was so hectic during 1992/3 that managing the huge turnovers was a full-time activity, the quieter period offers opportunities to look at costs. It also allows greater time for strategic thinking, such as how to embrace the challenge of emerging markets. In terms of costs, Citibank is looking at whether it can tidy up its operations on the process and technology side. It has now centralised the back-office function for clearing its European business in London. Mr Simmonds hopes also to standardise dealing rooms. 'I've got to believe that there should be much more commonality among our systems. The days are gone where every branch can have 100 per cent of what it wants.' He is quick to add, however, that 'this is not a revolution. It's an evolutionary process. Ask the questions, and then try and change things slowly.' Mr Simmonds is also concerned about the 'effervescent' state of the labour market. 'Packages are being offered as rich as at the height of the boom. I find that strange. Market participants have failed to recognise that things are changing. People need to become more realistic about what is attainable.' Another important challenge which all businesses face is the increasing integration of foreign exchange, capital market and derivative functions. 'Customers require solutions that cut across the products,' says Mr Simmonds. 'You have to think more broadly.' Quieter times need not signal lower profits, as Chase's first quarter performance shows. David Clark, treasurer Europe at HSBC, adds: 'You don't need a lot of big moves to make money. Foreign exchange dealers can live quite easily with the volatility we have.' What about the future? Mr Simmonds comments: 'Foreign exchange is in transition. I suspect bitter disappointment for those who are gearing up to face the last two years again. I don't think any of us have had to manage against this backdrop before.'</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Chicago banker to head NY Fed MR WILLIAM McDonough, a 59-year old native of Chicago and former commercial banker, will take on one of the most important jobs in central banking on Monday when he becomes president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr McDonough, whose appointment was announced only yesterday, takes over from the forceful Mr Gerald Corrigan, president since 1985. As head of the most important of the 12 US reserve banks, he will play a central role in protecting the health of the country's financial system and determining monetary policy. Speaking after the appointment was announced, Mr McDonough listed the pursuit of price stability as his main priority. He added, though, that inflation in the US was at 'very acceptable levels' and that he expected price rises for the rest of the year to level off at around the 3 per cent level of the first half. The appointment comes after a protracted search for a new head of the Fed which has covered more than 50 possible candidates. Mr McDonough, who had effectively been Mr Corrigan's number two for the past 18 months, had been widely seen as the most likely successor. Over a 22-year career at First Chicago, one of the country's biggest commercial banks, Mr McDonough had built up a reputation as a pragmatic, careful banker with a good command of detail. He rose to become chief financial officer, before retiring six years ago. As head of the Fed's financial markets group for the past 18 months, Mr McDonough has held the most influential position in determining the day-to-day conduct of monetary conditions in the US. He has also been responsible for the handling of the Fed's foreign exchange policy at a time when the dollar has risen sharply against other currencies. During that period, he has won the support of economists on Wall Street, and his appointment was widely welcomed yesterday. Although Mr McDonough's appointment is likely to bring a change of style to the leadership of the Fed after eight years under the dynamic Mr Corrigan, it is generally not expected to make a significant difference to the conduct of monetary policy in the US. The Fed president will also become vice-chairman of the 12-member policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

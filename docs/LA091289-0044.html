			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means  Committee, presented an alternative capital gains tax plan. Dorgan told a news  conference that his proposal would target most capital gains tax reductions to  families earning less than $200,000 a year and would phase them out to  households earning higher incomes. Capital gains are paid on profits from the  sale of stock and other assets. The plan appeared to counter a proposal by Rep.  Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) that would institute a 30% exclusion for capital gains  across the board.  </P></p>

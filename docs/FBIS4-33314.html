			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said  upon returning from Costa Rica yesterday that U.S., Spanish, and  German citizens have received over $600 million in bonds as  compensation for their properties. The ranking government  official also confirmed that all Nicaraguans favor an  intensification of democracy and reject violence.    [Begin recording] [Lacayo] To date we have issued bonds  worth over 600 million cordobas [figure as heard] as  compensation without regard for the nationality of the  beneficiaries. The only problem with foreign citizens is that  they are subject to special procedures at the Foreign Ministry  aimed at maintaining good relations with their governments. On  this occasion we are dealing with the Spanish, German, and U.S.  Governments, and they have all received equal treatment.  Nevertheless, in accordance with the law, the Foreign Ministry  is giving priority to U.S. citizens.    [Unidentified reporter] Returning once again to the  conference you held in Costa Rica, did you agree on anything  with Dr. Sergio Ramirez?    [Lacayo] I agreed on many issues with Dr. Ramirez and Mr.  Aleman because we are all in favor of an intensification of the  democratic system. We fully agreed on that. We all favored a  special market economy that will foster progress and well-being  for the Nicaraguan people, especially the poorest sectors. We  all agreed that violence can never again be used as a means of  achieving a change of government in this country. We all agreed  on the importance of strengthening the conviction that a  democratic system is the best means of changing the government.    We also agreed that the management of the economy, community  projects, and production resources are priorities, which is  exactly what the government's economic policy is doing. We  agreed on so many issues that the students wanted to know where  our disagreements lay. [end recording]</p>

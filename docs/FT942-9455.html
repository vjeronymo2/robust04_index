			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Push for punctuality - Delays at UK airports are being reduced Airport delays are to business travellers what traffic jams are to city drivers: infuriating, unpredictable, but inevitable. No more, says Britain's National Air Traffic Service, the body responsible for organising UK air traffic control. With an announcement due from the government on whether the service will be privatised, NATS has become aggressively consumer-oriented. It is reorganising flight paths, introducing more flexible take-off and landing procedures, and upgrading technology - all in a concerted effort to eliminate hold-ups. In a programme that began in early 1993, NATS has cut average delays on scheduled flights from Heathrow to nine minutes last year, from 20 minutes in 1989. The average delay on morning commuter flights from UK domestic airports was 3.8 minutes last summer, down from 20 minutes in the summer of 1992. Delays on chartered flights have also been reduced. The service now looks on its past indifference to delays with disdain. 'There was a problem in our attitude before,' says Mr Derek McLauchlan, NATS chief executive, 'in that we thought we knew what was possible and we were satisfied with that. But following the management reorganisation of two years ago, we took a more proactive stance, and found that many of the problems were solvable.' Many solutions have been simple. One problem was the early morning influx into British airspace of some 400 transatlantic flights, which tended to hold up departures from Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester. 'We instructed flow managers to be more careful about transatlantic tracks, so as not to block domestic take-offs, and delays were cut at a stroke,' says Mr McLauchlan. In addition, a computer link from Canada is giving London Heathrow controllers 4 1/2 hours' notice of transatlantic traffic into UK airspace, making it easier to tailor routes. Routing clashes caused by the limited number of air tracks, or flight paths, are also being addressed. The Civil Aviation Authority, of which NATS is an agency, is implementing a Pounds 750m investment programme to increase airspace capacity over south-east England by 30 per cent from 1995, and capacity for en route flights over England and Wales by 40 per cent from 1996. However, airspace is only part of the problem. With the CAA forecasting a doubling of air passengers in Europe between 1992 and 2005 - increasing passenger flights by 55 per cent - airport infrastructure is also a constraint. The British Air Transport Association, representing UK airlines, argues that take-off and landing slots are so fully booked that a new London runway is essential. However, NATS has been tackling the issue in a different way. Last year, it introduced a free-flow system between Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris. Normally, airlines must book slot times for their departure, their air track and their arrival. Mismatches cause delays, which put rescheduling pressure on the congested take-off and landing slot timetables. Under the freeflow system, aircraft can leave whenever their departure slot permits, without needing an air track slot. As a result, British Airways reported a fall of 94 per cent in delays from Paris to London, and of 47 per cent from Heathrow. Air France said delays had been cut by 97 per cent from Paris and 98 per cent from London. Trials have begun on other routes. NATS is also investigating how Heathrow's two runways could be used more efficiently. If all goes well with its plans, the service's ingenuity will go unnoticed this summer - as travellers pass through departure lounges without delay.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK airports: waiting time shrinks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average delays to scheduled flights (minutes)                   1989     1990     1991    1992     1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Heathrow            20      16       14      12        9 Birmingham          15      13       13       9        5 Gatwick             26      19       18      15       11 Luton               25      23       22      22       11 Manchester          15      11        9       6        5 Stansted            18      13       13       9        8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average delays to charter flights also fell  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham          50      38       38      33       21 Gatwick             62      49       43      41       38 Luton               54      49       42      44       30 Manchester          55      40       41      36       31 Stansted            60      38       48      31       23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average delays to all services at the six airports (minutes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Average delay       27      20       18      15       12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Civil Aviation Authority  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

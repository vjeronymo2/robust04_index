			<p>BFN     [Text] To allow the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers to  meet, the Greek Government has asked the Albanian side to  adequately explain why last night it banned the procession for  Christ's burial in Tirana and other Greek minority areas. The  meeting was canceled at Greece's initiative after the Albanian  authorities refused to allow Christians to carry out their  religious obligations. Greece also stipulated as a condition  for the meeting that the Albanian Government allows resurrection  celebrations.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today in  Thessaloniki that the meeting would be meaningless if Albania  does not respect international law, the Greek minority's human  rights, and a just state. The spokesman said: The foreign  ministers' meeting depends on the Albanian side. Yesterday, we  had an aggravation by the Albanian authorities: The banning of  the procession for the Orthodox Easter Mass. We will see  whether this will remain in effect until tonight. It is a  terrible insult to the freedom of religion and human rights. We  definitely want Greek-Albanian relations to improve, but this  depends on respect for international law. Greek-Albanian  relations cannot improve without these conditions and the  foreign ministers' meeting would be meaningless.    Asked about the government's reaction to criticism of a  passive stance to the Albanian provocations, Venizelos said:  The Greek Government's stance is one of continuing vigilance  and diplomatic demarches. I believe the entire international  community respects this stance and has confronted Albania's  [words indistinct] campaign in the past two weeks.    Commenting on a statement made by Political Spring Chairman  Andonios Samaras that this situation would not have happened if  a Greek parliamentary delegation had gone to Albania, the  spokesman said: I would ask Political Spring and Samaras to  consider past responsibility for the situation of the Greek  minority in Albania.    Albanian President Sali Berisha verbally decided to allow  the  Mass to be held outdoors in the Greek Orthodox churches in  Albania. According to diplomatic circles in Tirana, Berisha's  decision was conveyed to Archbishop Anastasios of Tirana and all  Albania last night, immediately after the conclusion of Mass at  Evangelismos Cathedral. The decision was expected to be  submitted in writing within the day.    Greek [words indistinct] circles in Albania said they  believe  Berisha's decision may contribute to improving the atmosphere  between Greece and Albania and holding the meeting of the two  foreign ministers scheduled for 3 May in Zurich.    The Greek Government decided to cancel the meeting of the  two  ministers after the Albanian Government banned the procession  for the Easter Mass. Thousands of Orthodox people in Tirana  were informed about the banning when they arrived at the  churches. In a resolution to Albanian President Berisha, the  Greek Orthodox people asked him to intervene personally and  restore the unjustified limitation of their freedom of religion.    Churches in Gjirokaster held their Mass normally. They also  held a procession for Christ's burial without any interference  from the Albanian authorities.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Weak oil prices take toll on Lasmo Lasmo, one of the UK's largest oil exploration and production companies, yesterday passed its final dividend as it struggled to come to terms with continuing oil price weakness. It reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m, against a restated deficit of Pounds 262m. After tax and dividend payments, the amount withdrawn from reserves was Pounds 141m. The loss per share was 17.5p, reduced from 52.3p. The group said the loss attributable to shareholders before exceptional charges was Pounds 59m, compared with a Pounds 34m profit. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said oil prices lingering around the Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel level for Brent Blend constituted the 'exceptional circumstances' that caused the board to chop the final dividend. It promised last year to make a final 2p payout to equal the previous 3.3p total. 'We thought the 1.3p announced at the time of the interim results was enough,' he said. The decision would save Pounds 20m cash. The future annual dividend would be 1p, until 'an increase can be justified'. Low oil prices caused the company to make a Pounds 120m provision against assets including fields in Nova Scotia and Italy, and a new accommodation platform at the UK Claymore field. UK tax changes allowed the release of Pounds 45m provisions, leaving a net exceptional charge of Pounds 72m. Turnover was Pounds 678m, up from Pounds 621m, as production rose 10 per cent to 167,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (including natural gas). Operating profits totalled Pounds 110m, against Pounds 112m. Lasmo's vulnerability to low prices was illustrated by an average cost of sales of Pounds 8.15 a barrel, compared with current sterling price of about Pounds 9.30. The company aims to trim unit operating costs of Pounds 4.10 a barrel by 10 per cent this year and by 25 per cent in real terms over the next four years. A shift towards lower cost production was highlighted by yesterday's announcement of the Pounds 84m sale of Lasmo's interests in the high-cost mature Ninian field in the North Sea. Year-end gearing was reduced from 110 to 75 per cent, on net debt of Pounds 794m. The company has extensive development programmes, and Mr Darby acknowledged that the target of keeping gearing to 80-90 per cent by 1995 was based on oil prices 'higher than they are today'.

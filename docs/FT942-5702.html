			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: Cadbury urges new roles for companies Boards of UK companies will have to give greater recognition to their responsibilities towards employees and society, Sir Adrian Cadbury, the chairman of the committee on corporate governance, warned yesterday. He presented this as part of a process which would bring about some convergence between British and continental European practice. Underlying his remarks was the thought that the form of company boards will change, given UK membership of the European Union. Sir Adrian said the UK viewed a company as a capitalist enterprise, while the Continent saw it as a coalition of interests and a partnership between capital and labour. Sir Adrian said that if there was to be a convergence between these two notions British boards would have to recognise a wider responsibility while Continental companies would have to pay 'more regard to shareholders' rights and Anglo-American standards of disclosure, especially if they want to tap international sources of equity finance'.</p>

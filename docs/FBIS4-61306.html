			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today received  Nicholas Burns, the U.S. National Security Council's senior  director, who leads a representative economic delegation on a  visit to our country. There took place a friendly conversation,  during the course of which a number of important issues relating  to further developing bilateral cooperation was raised.    I am pleased about your delegation coming to us to settle  some very important issues in accordance with the accord reached  between President Clinton and myself, said Kravchuk. He went on  to say: I have received a letter from President Bill Clinton  saying that the delegation will work in three principal  directions of mutual economic relations between our two states,  which, above all, relates to the $350 million granted to  Ukraine, the accord about which was reached earlier. The second  direction is the development of trade and investment in this  sphere, and the third has to do with reforming the Ukrainian  economy and [securing] assistance from the United States of  America in this matter. I was very glad to have received this  letter on the eve of our meeting.    We are happy [to acknowledge] that very good relations have  formed between our countries, Nicholas Burns told journalists.  We came here to promote their further development. Our  president holds President Kravchuk in great esteem and  instructed us to do our best to bolster the formation of the  best possible relations between the two countries and their  governments.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Skopbank lines up FM470m sale Skopbank, the Finnish state-owned bank, yesterday announced a preliminary agreement to sell the Finnish Real Estate Bank (Freb), its largest subsidiary, for about FM470m (Dollars 87m). The purchaser is Finvest, a development company focusing on industry and banking, and the parent of Interbank, the Finnish commercial bank. The sale reflects Skopbank's new focus on corporate and wholesale banking. Its role as the central bank in the Finnish savings bank system has been sharply reduced after last year's dismemberment of the Savings Bank of Finland. It said it no longer needed Freb's balance sheet for the purpose of advancing loans. Freb is a mortgage banking operation concentrating on long-term secured lending. Total assets at the end of 1993 amounted to FM9.1bn, and shareholder equity and reserves were FM480m. Mr Heikki Jarvi-Eskola, Skopbank chief controller, said the deal would have minimal influence on Skopbank's long-term earnings potential or capital adequacy.</p>

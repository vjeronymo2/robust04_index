			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Group turns in 14% profits rise JARDINE Matheson Holdings, the diversified Hong Kong trading and investment company, yesterday reported improved first-half profits and announced a sharp rise in the interim dividend. Net profit for the first half of 1993 rose by 14 per cent to USDollars 173.8m, up from USDollars 151.8m a year earlier. The interim dividend is going up to 6.8 cents a share from 3.7 cents. Turnover - up 6 per cent at USDollars 4.04bn - grew more slowly, reflecting adverse conditions for the trading and distribution business in Japan, and slower car sales in Hong Kong. The wholly-owned Jardine Pacific unit, which includes engineering, car sales, and restaurant businesses, recorded 9 per cent growth to USDollars 80.3m, in spite of a halving of profits from its trading and distribution business. Jardine Fleming, the joint-venture securities house owned with Robert Fleming, announced strong figures due to buoyant Asian stock markets. Profits jumped 81 per cent to USDollars 77.1m, and the company's fund management business reported a 33 per cent increase in funds under management to USDollars 13.3bn. Of the group's other listed operations, Dairy Farm and Hong Kong Land both reported steady earnings growth, while Mandarin Oriental's profits were flat. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, warned of the continuing effects of the economic slow-down in Japan. He added that China's austerity measures would have an adverse impact on business in the current six months. However, he stressed that the group continued to benefit from strong financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region. 'Our diversified businesses and financial strength should enable us to achieve satisfactory earnings growth for the full year', Mr Keswick said.</p>

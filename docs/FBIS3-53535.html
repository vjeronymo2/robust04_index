			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime </F> minister and foreign minister, by Buthaynah Abu-'Ubayd in Abu  Dhabi; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Abu-'Ubayd] Kuwait has concluded defense  treaties with the big powers, but it has failed on the Gulf and  Arab axes. What do you have to say about this?    [Al-Ahmad] Who told you that it has failed. As an official,  who is aware of the situation, I announce that it has succeeded  on all fronts to protect its sovereignty and independence.  Everyone knows that the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member  states all participated, even shed their blood, in the  liberation of Kuwait. After liberation, we have continued to  coordinate joint defense among the GCC states. This shows  cooperation among these states. On the Arab front, there is no  difference. There are Arab states that participated in the  battle of liberation such as Egypt and Syria. After this, we  cooperated within the framework of the Damascus Declaration.    [Abu-'Ubayd] How true are reports about the collapse of the  Damascus Declaration?    [Al-Ahmad] May God forgive us. Where did you get such an  idea? If this is true, then we must say that all our meetings  in the Arab world are unsuccessful.    [Abu-'Ubayd] This year is expected to witness important  developments in the Western stands toward Iraq. The recent  visits by three senior Western personalities to Iraq indicate  the possibility of ending Iraq's diplomatic isolation. Are you  concerned about the exertion of pressure on Kuwait in this  regard?    [Al-Ahmad] First of all, it saddens me to even have to deny  any reports on the existence of pressure on Kuwait concerning  its policy. Basically, this is something that should not be  said. Second, these personalities' visits to Iraq took place for  specific reasons pertaining to the release of Western hostages.  However, we should not say that there are no interests in  ending the isolation. However, these interests will begin when  the problems end. From this premise, everyone now wants to  stake claim, pending a solution of the current issues.    I would like to reaffirm that the diplomatic isolation  imposed on the Iraqi regime should not be lifted for two simple  reasons: First, If some say that Iraq has agreed to implement  Resolution 715, which was issued as a result of the occupation  of Kuwait, then this resolution is still linked to other  resolutions. In this case, the implementation must be full and  comprehensive, including all UN resolutions. As regards the  Iraqi regime, I believe that no state should extend bridges to  those who starve and displace their own people and carry out the  ugliest forms of torture against them.    [Abu-'Ubayd] Your statements in which you call for  differentiating between the Iraqi regime and people appear  contrary to the facts on the ground.    [Al-Ahmad] What you are saying is very strange. You might  not know that Kuwait has sent relief aid to the Iraqi people,  particularly those expelled by the Iraqi regime in the north and  south.    We differentiate between the regime and the people. We hope  we can help the people inside Iraq, because we are not pleased  to hear that a fraternal people are being exposed to starvation  and coercion.    [Abu-'Ubayd] Your continuous denial of secret talks with  "anti- Kuwait" states shows that Arab reconciliation is more  unlikely than before, despite the continuous attempts by these  countries and some Arabian Gulf states to bring you closer  together with these countries. Will the coming days witness the  success of these attempts?    [Al-Ahmad] I want you to answer this question: On what basis  shall these attempts succeed and the reconciliation be achieved?  What happened was caused by a problem. Therefore, if the  problem ends the reconciliation will begin. If reconciliation  takes place now it will be futile. I hope peace will prevail  and all repercussions of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will end.  I hope peace will be achieved. But, when? I do not know. As  long as differences exist in the Arab world everything will  remain unresolved.    [Abu-'Ubayd] What is your opinion of the [Arab-Israeli  peace]  settlement?    [Al-Ahmad] Regarding the settlement, we welcomed the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step. We hope that  agreements will be reached on all levels, otherwise, there will  be no progress on the path to peace.    [Abu-'Ubayd] What will happen if this step fails?    [Al-Ahmad] I hope this will not happen. Even if this step  fails, the road to peace will not be closed. This road has been  opened and the first steps have begun. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (5): The sweet smell of success - Latvijas Finieris / Business case studies - Progress by Latvian companies Latvijas Finieris, a manufacturer of wood products and furniture, is quite clearly a success. Its managing director, the taciturn and shrewd Mr Juris Bikis chose to lease his company jointly with his fellow managers, under a system which allows them to buy the plant in stages from the state. Until the late eighties it had served the Russian market, with more than two thirds of its output going to the east. Ten per cent of these sales were then re-exported to western markets through a centralised system 'which meant we knew nothing about them, not where they went or what was paid for them,' says Mr Bikis. Quickly grasping that the world was changing, Mr Bikis and his colleagues took effective control of the company and began making changes. Russian orders fell back substantially in 1990-91, and workers had to be laid off. They went in search of new markets - and found them in Britain, Finland and Scandinavia, forming joint ventures in the first two of these to aid marketing. Exports now account for 95 per cent of output, which has risen steadily since 1992. The number of workers has risen to 1,700 - about the same as before the downturn in orders. The company, housed in three adjoining plants, has its head office in crumbling post-war buildings but inside young men and women sit at computer screens and handle the orders in several languages. 'It has been difficult,' says Mr Bikis. 'We had to implement very rapid changes. We worked as a team, otherwise we could not have done it. We are now getting young people especially trained for our needs. We make an agreement with a technical institute that when they first enter, they sign up with us. When they come out they are already trained. 'We created a marketing department where we had none before, and we sell through our own shops and to other companies. But we sell only our own brand: we won't make brands for other people. 'Capital is the most difficult thing to obtain. The risk is thought too great by most of the banks so we use our own profits as far as we can.' Laima All around the factory, the air is heavy with a chocolate smell. Laima is one of the best known names in Latvia, famous for its dark bitter-sweet chocolate, made in Riga for 120 years. The plant was sold by its Latvian-Jewish owners before the war - and was then taken over by the state, in whose hands it has remained until now. It became, once again, a share-issuing company last year - with over a third of the capital owned by the workers and the managers, another third by a Latvian company, Avellat, 20 per cent by the state and the rest by pension funds. Mr. Janis Zvanitajs, the general manager and the moving spirit behind the plant, says the management changed the way the company was run three years ago when it was clear that inflation was shooting up and previous markets were being closed. Not only did markets disappear, however. The centralised supply system which had ensured all the necessary ingredients were more or less reliably assembled and despatched also went. As a result the company had to secure its own sources of supply - and made a disastrous contract with Uganda for cocoa, the non-delivery of which nearly ruined it. With its protected markets removed, the company began to experience competition in its own domestic market as well. 'The Poles are strong in the confectionery market, says Mr Zvanitajs, 'and there is a big Lithuanian plant with. which we have to compete. More than 20 companies sell their chocolate brands here - including all the main ones, such as Mars and Rowntrees.' Laima fought back on the same grounds as the foreign companies: it introduced its own chocolate bar, a tangy, unusual tasting candy called Miks which tastes quite different from the Mars-Snickers products. The company is now capitalised at Lts1.9m and employs 650 workers - 450 at its central Riga factory and 200 more at various shops and depots which it runs throughout the country. 'We have received many proposals from foreign companies: I think every one of the companies you could think of in our business has been here for talks. But we don't want to team up with anyone yet. 'The shares are still in the hands of the workers and the state. That can change, but not until it becomes more clear to us what we want to do, and then we'll think again'. Lattelekom Among the most radical moves the Latvian state has made is to hand over its telecoms service to a foreigner. Though Lattelekom, the monopoly supplier of the telephone service to Latvia for at least the next 20 years, is still 51 per cent state-owned, the 49 per cent which is owned by the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless and Telecom Finland provides much of the expertise, the capital for new equipment - and the managing director, Mr Gavin Jeffery. The joint venture came into being at the start of the year. Western partners have invested Dollars 160m in equipment and cable, satellite dishes and switchgear - to provide a basic network for subscribers. This investment is enough for a three-year installation programme: thereafter, modernisation will be financed by earnings. It will be, Mr Jeffery agrees, a delicate business. Subscribers have to apply for a new line, as if they were applying for a phone for the first time. They will then be charged for local calls (they are currently free, as was the case throughout the former Soviet Union) before any improvement in service arrives. Lattelekom, because it is at the heart of the state provision and run by a foreigner, is an obvious target for nationalist politicians. 'There certainly is suspicion of foreigners coming in and running the company,' says Mr Jeffery. It's partly a linguistic thing - the people we work with had to speak Russian for 50 years, now they have independence and they have to learn to speak English because foreigners arrive. 'But the Latvian government has tried to make the transition as smooth as possible. There's a clause in the contract which says there will be no redundancies for three years - which gives us a chance to plan how to minimise the effect on staff.'</p>

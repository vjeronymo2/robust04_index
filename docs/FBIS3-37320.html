Now we offer  for your attention an exclusive interview which the high-ranking  guest gave to the Russian television.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, there are different  symbols and stereotypes: good and bad; a red star, a matreshka  doll, rockets. For a long time they were the stereotypes of our  country. What image of Russia do you have now?    [Major] I believe that many of the stereotypes you have just  mentioned have given way to new realities and a new  understanding. This morning President Yeltsin said that  relations between Russia and the United Kingdom today are better  than they had been in past decades. The main reason for this is  that they have become closer. We know more about one another.  Trade between our countries is developing, political contacts  are expanding, and visits of top officials are becoming more  frequent. The British now have a better understanding of what  is going on in Russia, and the Russians have a better  understanding of what Britain supports.    [Correspondent] What are the current potential areas of  disagreement? Can you predict some of them at all? In general,  we have a good idea as to where our positions are close and  opinions coincide, but it is no less important to know where  they do not coincide and how to overcome them.    [Major] I will be straightforward. Today in the course of  the talks we were unable to identify many disagreements. But we  discovered many areas where we coincide. For example, we  actively support your reforms. They are rather painful, we know  that. They are difficult. It is not easy to make the  transition from the type of system you used to have to a free  market system, but when the transition is completed, major  advantages are revealed. At some point in time Russia's  citizens saw that transformations were occurring in the old  system, but the price of change entails difficulties, and the  Russian people are carrying difficulties on their shoulders.    It is a time of heavy burdens and a time of change, but at  the moment the advantages which will be revealed later--they  will not fail to be revealed--are not very apparent to people,  because people live for today. That is why the main thing is  accord and support for bold actions. As we are in a position to  help, we would like to do so.    [Correspondent] Disagreements and a divergence of views  still  exist, they exist here and there, but they exist. Where do you  think they are apparent?    [Major] Really, there are not many such areas. Now, in  bilateral relations between Russian and the United Kingdom the  number of such disagreements is very small. Where there are  some, we try to eliminate them. It is an amazing fact that only  four and five and, even more so, seven and eight years ago, one  could state numerous disagreements between our countries, and  nowadays they are hard to find. What can be found straight away  is accord. Coincidence of views on the issue of the reforms,  agreement on Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade and on Russia's joining the European Council,  agreement regarding ways to bring an end to the bloodshed in  Bosnia and, finally, the agreement, which we signed officially  today, on not targeting Russian nuclear weapons on Great  Britain. Our nuclear weapons will not be targeted against  Russia. We have achieved a great deal of accord.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, in what areas of  cooperation can you suggest a greater breakthrough was made and  what prospects are most favorable?    [Major] I think that we reached great understanding in the  economic sphere. There is every possibility of increasing the  volumes of trade. At present out trade aircraft has just taken  off, it is still touching the ground and has not yet gained any  height. The potential for increasing mutual trade is immense.  The potential for increasing capital investments is equally  great. What is good for Russia will also be good for Great  Britain. I think that as the reforms progress, Russia's  attractiveness for foreign investors will increase sharply as  stability increases. Then trade turnover with western  countries, and with Great Britain in particular, will increase  as a whole.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, would you please say a  few words directly to Russian television viewers.    [Major] We have watched with great admiration from afar how  in the past four-five years Russia has been carrying out amazing  political reforms--difficult reforms, complex ones. Five years  ago the British people could not imagine that your country  would have a publicly elected president, a new constitution, and  a democratically elected parliament, whose work can be followed  on television. Very few people could imagine the considerable  economic transformations which are taking place in your country.    These transformations include a great degree of price  liberalization, an immense scale of privatization and, finally,  the determination with which you are advancing toward a free  market. Of course, this needs time, and this cannot be achieved  without hard work, sweat, and pain, but I see that Russia and  Russia's citizens are full of determination to advance in this  direction and we support you in this.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Regional rivalries threaten coalition efforts Regional rivalries last night threatened efforts by Malawi's President-elect Bakili Muluzi to establish a coalition government after his southern-based United Democratic Party appeared to fall short of an overall majority in the country's 177 seat national assembly, Nick Young reports from Lilongwe. Poll results showed the three main parties winning support from north, south and central regions, raising fears Malawi politics may be dominated by local tensions. Mr Muluzi's UDF won 84 parliamentary seats, five short of an outright majority. He has so far ruled without co-operation with former President Hastings Banda's outgoing Malawi Congress Party, which won 52 seats.</p>

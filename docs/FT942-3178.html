			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Canberra warns Pacific islanders Australia, a substantial trading partner and provider of aid to the South Pacific, yesterday urged island nations to improve internal government policies, warning that they could face serious and mounting economic problems if they failed to act. In a hard-hitting speech, Mr Gordon Bilney, Australia's Pacific island affairs minister, said there were some broad issues - such as environmental management, population growth, and trade and investment - 'which if not addressed with a sense of urgency could have consequences which would make more immediate political problems seems small by comparison'. Mr Bilney noted that real gross national product in the Pacific island countries had grown by an average rate of only some 0.1 per cent a year over the past decade. 'In short, whatever policies we've been following in the South Pacific - and by 'we' I mean island countries and donor countries alike - are demonstrably not working,' he said. The minister offered few precise remedies, but stressed the need to achieve lower population growth rates by 'a careful mix of policies'. He also urged nations to develop a united approach towards bigger, distant-water fishing nations, to ensure sustainable development; to guard against exploitation of topical forests; and to mobilise domestic savings and open their economies to foreign investment. Asked whether Australia would consider withholding aid from Pacific nations which failed to improve internal policies, Mr Bilney said this was 'far too stark'. Mr Bilney's speech represented the first significant policy statement on the South Pacific by an Australian minister for six years. Australia's trade with the region amounts to around ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.46bn) a year, and its aid contribution is close to ADollars 500m.</p>

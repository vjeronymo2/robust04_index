			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: All-round margin growth at UniChem PRE-TAX PROFITS at UniChem, the pharmaceuticals group, jumped 49 per cent from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 31.9m in 1992 as both wholesale and retail operations showed sharp improvements in both volume and margins. The acquisition of retail chemists shops in the UK and three wholesale companies in Portugal helped push turnover over the Pounds 1bn mark for the first time, reaching Pounds 1.05bn - a 14 per cent rise. While the Portuguese companies produced Pounds 43.4m in overseas sales, wholesale turnover in the UK grew by 6 per cent to Pounds 977.6m (Pounds 916.9m). Improved margins at home, attributable in part to greater automation in UniChem's warehouses, pushed up UK wholesaling profits from Pounds 21m to Pounds 28.4m. The acquisition of Moss chemists and other additions saw the number of UniChem's pharmacies rise from 130 at the beginning of 1992 to 209 at present. Retailing turnover surged from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 79.7m, while operating profits grew seven times to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 700,000). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.03m) arose from the disposal of its nappy manufacturing business, which left the net attributable balance at Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 13.3m). Fully diluted earnings per share were up at 15.1p (13.3p). The proposed final dividend is 3.75p, for a total of 5.65p (5p). COMMENT From a standing start, UniChem has now become the UK's third largest retail chemist chain, after Boots and Lloyds Chemists. It is now seeking to extend its retail reach through instore pharmacies in superstores, having already established outlets in Asda. The idea is that the group's expertise in wholesaling will allow it to extract good margins at the retail end. But it has not neglected its traditional operations. Wholesale margins have been pushed up by concentrating on warehouse automation and with six of its 11 UK warehouses still to be upgraded there appears to be room for more improvement. Meanwhile, the move into Europe looks less clear cut. The company says its solo Portuguese acquisitions will not set the pattern; it intends to play a part in Europe, but sees a long timescale and development through companies such as PHE, a joint venture it is involved in Germany. The company may be vulnerable to any moves by the UK government to cut the health service drugs bill, but its growing involvement in the over-the-counter market - as distinct from prescription medicines - should provide a cushion. Pre-tax profits for 1993 are seen at about Pounds 36m, a prospective p/e of 14 times.</p>

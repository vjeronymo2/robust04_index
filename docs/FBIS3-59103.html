			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The European Commission is  to haul six European Community countries to court for not  dismantling their gas and electricity monopolies, EC officials  said here Wednesday [26 January].    They said the EC's executive complained to the European  Court  of Justice that France, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the  Netherlands were retaining the monopolies in contravention of  the EC's principles of free competition.    The move is an attempt to pressure the six countries into  accepting a directive from the Commission that they should make  their state-owned utility networks available to power companies  from other countries.    The directive has been blocked for nearly two years. The  Commission is targeting France for its electricity and gas  monopolies, Denmark for gas, and Spain, Italy, Ireland and the  Netherlands for their electricity monopolies.    Commission officials said the liberalisation of the power  and  gas markets was essential if the EC's single market was to work  properly.    It would mean that a French company, for example, could get  its power from Germany if this was cheaper.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian aluminium exports higher than thought Russian aluminium exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States rose to 1.116m tonnes in the first half of this year from 673,600 tonnes in the corresponding period a year earlier, according to the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, reports Reuters from Moscow. Aluminium exports in January-May were 978,200 tonnes, up from 495,800 tonnes in the year-ago period, a ministry official said. The official, who declined to be named, said an initial January-June estimate of 1.25m tonnes had been revised. The latter figure was published by the State Statistics Office in its latest report on the economy. An official of Aluminiy the country's aluminium producers' group declined to comment on the figures. Russia and other major world aluminium producers agreed earlier this year to cut output in a bid to prop up the market. The agreement was in response to a sharp fall in aluminium prices caused by a surge in Russian exports following the breaking up of the Soviet Union. Prices have since risen strongly. Data released at a meeting of the producers in Australia this month showed that Russian output fell to 220,800 tonnes in June from 236,100 in November 1993. That data also indicated, however, that exports in the first five months of this year amounted to about 800,000 tonnes, roughly in line with the 1993 total of 1.9m tonnes.</p>

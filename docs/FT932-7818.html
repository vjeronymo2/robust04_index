			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas With all eyes focused on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, there is a tendency to forget British Gas's current financial condition. The result of the investigation will be vital to the company's future, but on any likely outcome life will continue to be pretty tough. With the RPI-5 price formula and increased competition, earnings this year are likely to be around 22p a share. That means dividend cover will only be 1.5 times against the company's declared target of a twice covered payout. Interest cover is close to the company's own comfort level of four times. Meanwhile capital expenditure - particularly on exploration and production - will mean a further cash outflow this year. Those financial ratios might seem comfortable for a pure utility, but the profile of the business is shifting markedly. Even if some of the more radical suggestions are ignored by the MMC, competition in the UK gas business will increase, lessening the security of the utility franchise. At the same time, the heavy investment in exploration and production is taking the company into higher risk areas which will not start to produce substantial returns until 1995. If the MMC produces a particularly tough report, that might even force a hard look at the dividend. On a milder outcome, the prospects for dividend growth will still be severely limited. The 6 per cent yield on British Gas shares is supposed to reflect uncertainty over the MMC investigation. But unless that review increases the rate of return on the UK gas business, a re-rating looks unlikely.</p>

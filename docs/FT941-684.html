			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: PIA looks at symptoms not causes Sir, The criticisms of the Personal Investment Authority are now familiar and well rehearsed. The new regime hardly adds up to the 'step change' called for by Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. This is because the PIA's scope is limited to regulation of 'conduct of business' rules, that is sales and marketing practices. Its scope does not cover 'prudential' regulation, which, in the case of insurance companies, remains with the Department of Trade and Industry. The distinction between the supervision of a company's financial strength and its urge to book new business is arbitrary and unhealthy. From the days when I used to go along to 'prudential supervisions' at the Bank of England, I can testify to the Bank's understanding of the risks inherent in such distinction. The UK insurance industry is characterised by over-capacity and by cost structures which are too high. All too often, the senior management response is to keep the sales machine running ever faster. I suggest that where there is suggestion of mis-selling and a decline in public confidence, attention should be aimed at the management approach to structural weaknesses in the industry, rather than management of the sales force. By failing to bring together prudential supervision and conduct of business regulation, the PIA is set up to deal with the symptoms rather than with their causes. Any move to combine the two would necessitate statutory regulation. Peter Tann, 28 Sekforde Street, London EC1R 0HH</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE 'SORCERY' FUND-RAISER CANCELLATION  </P> <P> I was sorry to read on the front page of Calendar ("O.C. 'Sorcery' Fund-Raiser  Goes Poof" by Mark I. Pinsky, June 15) that once again the religionists were  allowed to dictate what others can do, think and see.  </P> <P> I was sorry to read that the Laguna Playhouse decided that the Rev. Jerry  Tankersley knows more about what is good and righteous for adult, intelligent  theatergoers than they do. The Laguna Playhouse should have had a little more  courage and just said no to religious bigotry and meddling.  </P> <P> I was looking forward to a night of psychics and palmists but can't since this  evening offended a minister's personal religious standard that he has forced on  me. I resent a minister of a church that I do not attend telling me what I can  do, see or hear.  </P> <P> I think that the Laguna Playhouse should reschedule the event. Anyone who does  not want to attend the party will not be forced to go. The Rev. Tankersley does  not speak for me. I will not allow him to think for me, either.  </P> <P> ALAN ALBERT SNOW  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

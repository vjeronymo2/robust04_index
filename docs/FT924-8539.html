			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Intl Communication declines Mr Nigel Balcombe, chairman of USM-quoted International Communication &amp; Data, has resigned from the board because he faces a long period of convalescence after major abdominal surgery in October. The leaking of the news of the consequent boardroom shuffle meant that the company's interim results - due to be released today - had to be announced to the Stock Exchange last night. Pre-tax profits at the group, which provides names, addresses and information to the direct marketing/direct mail industry, fell to just Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 404,000) on lower turnover of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.96m) for the six months to August 31. However, Mr Daniel Unger, who was chairman from 1983 to 1989 and who has now stepped up from non-executive director to interim chairman, said that 'a good first quarter' was offset by a 'hard' second when turnover was down 9 per cent on last time. He added that the second half was 'always by far the better half'.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Growth in South Korea shows quarterly slowdown SOUTH Korea's economic growth slowed during the first three months of this year after years of overheating that caused high inflation and large deficits, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. According to the Bank of Korea, the central bank, gross national product during the period rose 7.5 per cent on a yearly basis, compared with 8.7 per cent a year earlier. The figure also contrasts with an economic growth rate of 8.4 per cent for the whole of 1991. A central banker described the level of growth in the first quarter as 'very desirable' because it approached South Korea's optimum economic growth rate of 7 per cent. The slowdown was aided by the government's tight monetary policy, said the official. The central bank said in a separate report yesterday that the current account deficit in April was Dollars 280m (Pounds 158m), compared with Dollars 960m a year earlier and Dollars 870m a month earlier. This was mainly because of a sharp slowing in construction.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / TSB chief to urge freedom for Bank SIR NICHOLAS GOODISON, chairman of the TSB bank and of the British Bankers Association, will today urge the government to give independent control of monetary policy to the Bank of England, Robert Peston writes. In a speech at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Sir Nicholas will urge 'the creation of an independent monetary authority', free of political interference, to safeguard the currency. He will say there should have been a realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism before the UK was forced to suspend membership. 'The fault was to believe the ERM had already become a fixed rate system', he will say. 'The ERM bands were never intended to cope with the strains of German reunification coinciding with a worldwide recession. It was foolish to expect them to do so. The members of the mechanism should have agreed to a general realignment earlier.'</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Concern over US steel maker THE possible sale of the missile and aircraft divisions of LTV, the large bankrupt US steel maker, to France's Thomson-CSF should be reviewed because of its potential impact on national and economic security, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee havetold President George Bush, Nancy Dunne writes in Washington. Similar concern was expressed in a letter to Mr Bush on March 10 from 40 senators of both parties, worried that foreign companies, backed by their governments, might obtain advanced technology. The sale of LTV's aircraft and missiles division to Vought, a new group jointly owned by Martin Marietta and Lockheed, could be jeopardised, the senators said, by 'a pending higher offer' from Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group, and Carlyle Group, a Washington investment banking firm. Although LTV and its union have accepted the Vought offer, there is concern that a federal bankruptcy court will require LTV to accept Thomson's higher offer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Eight RP [Welfare Party] deputies who had signed  an anti-Ataturk parliamentary motion have withdrawn their  signatures. (Oyke Semdiler), a member of the Great Unity Party,  had already made such a decision. The motion still carries the  signatures of Hasan Mezarci [the sponsor of the motion], Melik  Firat from True Path Party, and two DEP [Democracy Party]  deputies.    Hasan Mezarci could be expelled from his party [Welfare  Party]. The administrative council of the RP parliamentary group  consigned him to the group's disciplinary committee. Sevket  Kazan, deputy leader of RP parliamentary group, said that since  the day of his election Mezarci has been acting in violation of  party discipline. Sevket Kazan said that despite verbal  warnings, Mezarci continued to act in ways that eroded the  party's public image and that is why he was sent to the  disciplinary committee by unanimous vote.    In the meantime, Hasan Mezarci's motion, which called for  the  rehabilitation of those who were executed for trying to  assassinate Ataturk in Izmir, was rejected in Parliament even  without submitting it to normal procedure. Vefa Taner, deputy  speaker of Parliament, said that a motion that demeans and  incriminates Ataturk and Parliament cannot even be considered.    Hasan Mezarci drew reactions from everybody, from ordinary  people to the president. The most interesting reaction came  from the presidency of the General Staff. The General Staff  spokesman made the following one-sentence statement: The  Turkish Armed Forces cannot accept as its counterparts those who  hold such perverted ideas. President Demirel described attack  on Ataturk as a subversion and provocation.    [Begin recording] [Metin Corabatir] President Demirel said  that an attack on Ataturk would very much disturb me and the  Turkish people. Indicating that raving souls always have enmity  for Ataturk, Demirel said that these things are being done to  undermine peace in Turkey, and those who are doing such things  will eventually realize that they are simply in a daze.    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said the following while leaving  the parliament:    [Ciller] We were deeply grieved that an Erzerum deputy was  involved in this. The Administrative Council of our  parliamentary group met yesterday and we asked the Disciplinary  Committee to definitely expel this deputy from the party. This  is our stance. Let our people rest assured we will oppose  anything that opposes Ataturk. Our state is great and lofty,  and will continue to walk the path charted by the lofty Ataturk.    [Corabatir] ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Masut Yilmaz  described the deputies who signed the motion as people holding  perverted views. [end recording] [passage omitted]    SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] leader Murat Karayalcin  described Hasan Mezarci's anti-Ataturk statements as part of a  plot being hatched by forces opposing democracy. During his  Istanbul tour today, Murat Karayalcin said that for a long time  now secular institutions in Turkey have been facing serious  difficulties.    [Begin recording] [Fatma Korunoglu] Is Turkey being dragged  into something with Mezarci's statements?    [Karayalcin] That is what I am trying to discern. We are  already in a tense situation. We have been experiencing a  number of incidents one after another. These could be planned  or coincidental; that is not important. But, these incidents,  coming one after another, are further exacerbating the tense  election atmosphere in Turkey. These are certainly the plans  and actions of the antidemocratic forces and circles. We must  realize this, and must be able to assess very well the  consequences that might result. [end recording]    [Announcer] On his election bus, Karayalcin also referred to  coup rumors.    [Begin Karayalcin recording] Apparently, there are people  who  need to hear the word "coup." They are trying to extract other  meanings from my statements. They say: He is saying there will  be a coup; let him reveal the names of those who want to make a  coup. I replied, saying that I do not know these circles, and I  would have revealed them had I known them. But, again I cannot  interpret these incidents in any other way. That is, I see all  these attacks, bombings, murders, and statements as the work of  forces outside the pale of democracy. [end recording]</p>

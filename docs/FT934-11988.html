			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Flotation for new Canadian timber group FLETCHER Challenge Canada is putting most of its timber and logging operations into a new company, TimberWest, and will then take it public in December. FCC, controlled by Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, will retain 51 per cent of the new company. Analysts estimate FCC will raise almost CDollars 100m (USDollars 76m) from the spin-offs. TimberWest will own two big coastal wood products plants, 210,000 hectares of private forest lands, crown licences from the Queen Charlotte Islands to southern Vancouver Island, plus logging operations and Interior sawmills. It will continue to supply fibre to FCC mills.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Argentina set to continue Latin American sequence THE international bond market had a Latin American flavour yesterday as Venezuela launched its well-flagged, D-Mark Eurobond offering and Banobras, the Mexican government agency for financing economic development, tapped the dollar sector. The Republic of Argentina is also due to tap the D-Mark sector. Mr Daniel Marx, the finance under-secretary, said that Argentina will launch a five-year Eurobond to raise between DM750m and DM1bn before the end of the year. CSFB and Deutsche Bank have been awarded the mandate. Mr Marx said the new placement was aimed at 'diversifying the investor base by increasing sales in Europe and Germany in particular'. He added that the D-Mark bonds will refinance Eurobond debt maturing this year. The forthcoming offering will bring the government's bond sales to more than Dollars 1bn this year. It follows two dollar-denominated Eurobond offerings in April and July which raised a total of Dollars 500m. A third batch of dollar debt will be issued in coming months, Mr Marx said. Investors looking for high-yielding paper flocked to the Republic of Venezuela's DM300m seven-year Eurobond offering. Demand was such that the bonds' yield spread over underlying bunds narrowed to 260 basis points in the afternoon from a break-even spread for co-managers of 290 basis points. Lead manager WestLB said that retail clients in Germany and Switzerland were particularly strong buyers of the bonds. In the light of Venezuela's offering, the spread of 210 basis points over underlying US Treasuries on the Dollars 100m five-year offering from Banobras was not very tempting. The bonds were re-offered at 99.97 and they were not freed to trade by the close of business. The pricing of Banobras's bonds reflects the Mexican government's desire to tighten the spread on its Eurobonds. However, investor focus has moved away from Mexican offerings as other Latin American borrowers become more active in the international bond market. Corporacion Andina De Fomento, the Latin American supranational agency which finances trade and infrastructure, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m five-year Eurobond offering, via CSFB, early next week. Elsewhere, the flow of Ecu-denominated Eurobonds continued as DNIB, the Dutch re-development bank majority-owned by the government, raised Ecu150m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds. Lead manager Nomura said the DNIB issue was designed to tap the remaining pockets of demand, particularly in Switzerland, for current-coupon bonds in the Ecu sector. The bonds were re-offered at 99.47 and were not freed to trade by the end of the afternoon. As with the other recent issues, the bonds yielded less than the French government's Ecu paper. This reflects the fact that there has been a shortage of new Ecu-denominated issues.</p>

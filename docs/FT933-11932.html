			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter rise at Citizens Financial CITIZENS Financial, the US subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, reported net income of Dollars 7.2m (Pounds 4.8m) for the third quarter to June 30. That compared with Dollars 6.2m for the corresponding quarter and makes a total for the year to date of Dollars 24.8m (Dollars 13.8m). Citizens attributed the increase in third quarter income to continued strong mortgage banking activity and income from its newly-acquired banking operation in south-eastern Connecticut. Tangible capital ratio at June 30 was 6 per cent and the total risk-based capital was 11.17 per cent, compared with federal minima of 3 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. Total assets at the quarter's end were Dollars 5.25bn (Dollars 4.46bn). The increase, the company said, reflected the acquisition of the Plymouth Five Cents Savings Bank in Massachusetts and the New England Savings Bank in Connecticut.</p>

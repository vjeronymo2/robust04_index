			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Mar 6 KYODO -- Japan will apply for  exemptions from an international ban on the use of  chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) harmful to the earth's ozone layer  despite the availability of substitutes, government sources said  Sunday [6 March].    The sources said the government has informed the  Nairobi-based secretariat of the Vienna Convention for the  Protection of the Ozone Layer that it will seek the exemptions  in three areas, including coolants in refrigerated and frozen  food display cases.    The exemptions, if permitted, would allow the limited use of  CFC's beyond the late 1995 international deadline for the  suspension of their production and use.    Such exemptions are permitted under the Montreal Protocol on  substances that deplete the ozone layer.    The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet  rays.    Given an international trend toward minimizing exemptions,  though, the Japanese request is likely to be the main issue to  be discussed at an autumn meeting in Nairobi of countries which  are signatories to the protocol.    The Japanese list of proposed exceptions is likely to come  under severe criticism from European countries and environmental  conservation organizations because it includes substances for  which substitutes have already been developed.    The government is arguing that the exceptions are necessary  because Japan has many small businesses which rely on CFC's and  industry has not made sufficient advances in the recovery of  CFC's.    It is requesting that Japan be allowed 1997-98 reserves of  about 80 tons of CFC-115 used in refrigerator display cases and  freezers and an additional 240 tons or so of four types of CFC's  used as jet agents for sprays in medical equipment because there  is no suitable substitute.    The government is also arguing that Japan will need  additional reserves of several substances for use as solvents  and standard reference material for use in analysis and research  into CFC's.    These include about 150 tons of carbon tetrachloride used in  fire extinguishers, about 6 tons of CFC's, and about 3 tons of  1,1,1- trichloroethane normally used in the production of  insecticides.    All of the substances cause damage to the ozone layer.    Under the convention, their production and consumption is  due  to be suspended by the end of 1994.    Exceptions to the Montreal Protocol are permitted under an  "essential use" clause, but only apply where they are necessary  to health and safety and where a substitute is not economically  or technologically practical.    The international environmental and conservationist  organization Greenpeace says the United States has submitted  requests for exceptions for its space shuttle program and for  local anesthetics which far exceed Japan's requests.    But Greenpeace says the U.S. requests do not include  refrigerator coolants for which substitutes have already been  developed.    European Union countries have indicated they will submit  requests for exceptions of only small amounts, while  Switzerland, the Netherlands and Australia have all indicated  they will reduce amounts to zero by the deadline.</p>

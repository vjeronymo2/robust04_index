This was  stated by Lee Lam Thye, vice president of Pemadam Kebangsaan  [National Drug Prevention Program].    According to him, the rate of drug addiction, that is, the  number of new drug abusers, has fallen by more than 50 percent,  based on a study published by the Pasukan Petugas Anti-Dadah  [PPAD--Anti-Drug Detachment] in the Office of the Prime Minister.    In a New Year's statement issued on 2 January he said: "In  1983 the PPAD registered 14,624 new addicts, whereas in 1993 the  total number declined, as 6,797 new addicts were registered."    However, in the 1990's the drug addiction prevention effort  using education needs to concentrate on the problem of repeat  offenders.    He said: "In 1993 10,637 repeat offenders were registered  throughout the country, or 61 percent of all drug addicts  recorded."    Lee said that for this reason the drug rehabilitation effort  needs to be supported by parents whose children are addicted to  drugs.    He said: "The community must also show a high level of  commitment to welcoming drug addicts who have come to their  senses."    Beginning in 1994, the National Drug Prevention Program will  increase its efforts to help the government in its war on drugs.    He said: "This is in accordance with the objective adopted  by  nongovernment organizations (NGO) of helping the government  resolve the social problems of the community."    According to Lee, the National Drug Prevention Program will  increase its preventive educational programs by establishing a  rehabilitation service program for former drug addicts who have  been released from treatment centers.    He stated: "The National Drug Prevention Program hopes to be  able to set up a larger number of rehabilitation service centers  throughout the country to help former addicts return to the  community."    Lee said that the National Drug Prevention Program wants the  people to participate in the war against drug addiction by  carrying on preventive educational programs in the community.    Furthermore, the people should support former addicts by  giving them an opportunity to return to the community.</p>

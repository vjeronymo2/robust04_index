			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-'Amudi] </F>   [Text] In the first southern reaction to Sanaa's denial of  accepting the cease-fire proposed by the southern leadership  through the UN envoy to Yemen, 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj,  deputy prime minister and foreign minister in the government of  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has said that Sanaa's denial is not  new. He said: We are used to Sanaa's going back on its  approval of previous initiatives. He added: There is no going  back on the decision to separate Democratic Yemen. Al-Asnaj  described the presence of northern forces in the South as  occupation.    Al-Asnaj revealed some aspects of the initiative proposed by  the southern leadership to resolve the Yemeni crisis. In an  exclusive statement to AL-ITTIHAD AL-USBU'I, al-Asnaj said: The  southern initiative was an integrated plan that came in harmony  with Security Council Resolution 924. The plan, he added, took  into consideration the idea of setting up a military committee  in which the two sides are represented, in addition to the  parties that were represented in the previous military committee  before the outbreak of the military operations such as the  Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, as well as the U.S. and French  military attaches. He said that the Russian Federation also  asked to participate in this committee, adding that the southern  plan called for expanding international participation to include  the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council.    Al-Asnaj said the southern party also proposed expanding the  work of the committee to guarantee its success in entrenching a  cease-fire by adding some sisterly Arab countries and  representatives of the Arab League and some Asian and African  countries to monitor cease-fire violations and the party that  causes these violations, to ensure the arrival of humanitarian  aid, and to achieve disengagement between the forces in light of  the military situation, which is completely different from the  picture drawn by news agencies.    Al-Asnaj said he considered the presences of northern forces  in the south an occupation, noting that the removal of these  forces is only a matter of time.    The deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Aden  government stressed that there will be no retreat from the  declaration on the establishment of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen following the southerner's suffering from, and contempt  for, a unity that was based on hegemony, tyranny, and  annexation. He said the assessment of unity in the future must  be left for the future generations after people recover from  this painful experience to realize a more stable and untroubled  unity that agrees with Yemeni realities.    Al-Asnaj revealed why the meeting between President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and UN Envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was delayed. He  said: When we were in al-Mukalla, President al-Bid insisted we  all must go to Aden so that the UN envoy can see for himself the  extent of damage in the city and the deteriorating health and  human conditions there. Ibrahimi, however, said he could not  make the trip because UN regulations forbid its envoys from  going into war zones and putting their lives in danger.    Al-Asnaj expected the UN secretary general to receive the  report of his envoy soon and to present the report, after  completing it, to the UN Security Council to take the necessary  steps to implement Resolution 924.    Al-Asnaj explained that the southerners will call for an  emergency UN Security Council session to discuss the northern  violations that prevented the implementation of the UN  resolution. The southern foreign minister underlined his  accusations that foreign hands are prolonging the Yemeni war by  providing military and political support to Northern Yemen,  referring, particularly, to Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, and Iran. He  said the prolongation of this war will have serious consequences  on security and stability in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf,  especially in view of the important world interests in this  region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Victor Borge, member of the Borge y </F> Asociados Company, by Dorita de Reyna at the Telemetro Studios  in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Reyna] After hearing the statement by the  magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal [TE], Telemetro Television  contracted the services of the Borge y Asociados company, which  conducted an exit poll for us. We must clarify that these are  simply projected figures. Mr. Victor Borge, could you tell us  what an exit poll is?    [Borge] All day long we have conducted a poll at more than  120 locations throughout the Republic. We have asked people who  are leaving the premises after casting their vote who they voted  for. The data collected has been sent via telephone and fax to  our computer center, where it has been processed. This is the  first projection of how people were voting all day long.    [Reyna] Throughout the entire country?    [Borge] Yes, throughout the country.    [Reyna] Would you then give us the results of your poll?    [Borge] Yes. Let's take a look at the graphs. According to  this poll, candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD] is in the lead with 37.8 percent of  the votes. Second place is close between Ruben Blades of the  Papa Egoro Party, who has 23.4 percent, and Mrs. Mireya Moscoso  de Gruber of the Arnulfista Party, with 22.4 percent of the  votes. Next in line is Ruben Dario Carles, with 11.2 percent of  the votes.    These figures have an error margin of plus or minus 3  percent, so we cannot be certain whether Mr. Blades or Mrs.  Moscoso de Gruber is in second place.</p>

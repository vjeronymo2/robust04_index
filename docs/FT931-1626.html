			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Reprieve for 12 pits planned in coal white paper CABINET MINISTERS last night agreed proposals that would save or 'mothball' at least a dozen, and possibly as many as 19, of the threatened British Coal pits - but perhaps for less than two years. The long-awaited coal industry white paper, expected to be approved formally by the full cabinet tomorrow, is understood to set out how some six of the 31 threatened pits could be 'mothballed' rather than closed. Up to as many as 13 more could be kept operating, helped by government subsidies lasting no more than two years. The white paper puts a heavy emphasis on speeding up coal privatisation, with the aim of transfering many pits threatened with closure to the private sector. The paper is understood to set out a number of possible ways to expand the market for coal. The possibility of a Commons vote on the package as early as next week was being floated at Westminster last night. Mr John Major and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will launch a concerted campaign to win over Tory MPs who are threatening to defy the government if insufficient miners' jobs are saved. The potential rebels meet this afternoon. Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, warned last night that if the deal was 'a two-year wonder and then all of the 31 pits that had been threatened were to close, that would be completely unacceptable'. If the saved and mothballed pits are added together, the proposals could be presented as exceeding the expectations of many Conservative MPs. But the government faces an uphill task to avoid a Commons defeat over the white paper's proposals which fall far short of those set out by the Commons select committee on trade and industry in a report in January. Instead of subsidies lasting five years, as proposed by the committee, the reprieved pits are expected to be given no more than two years to improve their competitiveness sufficiently to survive in world markets. No sum is expected to be put on the total Treasury grant in the white paper but Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is believed to have resisted allowing the subsidy to rise above Pounds 500m. Final details of the white paper were approved at a 2 1/2 -hour meeting of the economic and domestic policy cabinet committee, chaired by the prime minister, at which almost the entire cabinet was present. The draft white paper was approved in spite of the failure of British Coal and the electricity generating companies to agree core contracts on coal supplies from the end of this month. Earlier, Downing Street indicated that Mr Major would still publish the white paper even if no deal were reached by tomorrow. The longer-term viability of many of the threatened pits will depend on winning agreement from the electricity companies to buy coal over and above levels expected to be set out in the core contracts.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / China renews Taiwan link CHINA has invited an official from Taiwan to visit the mainland, the first such contact since the ideological arch-rivals held historic talks in Singapore in April, Reuter reports from Beijing. China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits extended the invitation to Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, the official Xinhua news agency reported yesterday. Both organisations were set up as ostensibly unofficial bodies to explore and foster bilateral contacts. The letter asked the Taiwan side to propose dates and an agenda for Mr Chiu's visit, Xinhua said. Mr Chiu visited Beijing early this year to arrange the Singapore meeting between Mr Wang Daohan, chairman of the Chinese body, and Mr Koo Chen-fu, his Taiwanese counterpart. The talks marked the first direct contact between the Cold War rivals since Chiang Kai-shek and his vanquished Nationalists fled to Taiwan at the close of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing and Taipei espouse eventual reunification of Taiwan and China, a goal that is opposed by Taiwan's growing opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party. Cross-straits relations have warmed in recent years as the rivals have become economically interdependent. In Taipei, officials said the government was studying conditions under which it could exchange representative offices with China, but added that such a breakthrough in relations is unlikely soon.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to retain lead in North Sea oil production NORWAY WILL retain its top position as Europe's biggest crude oil producer throughout the decade with daily average output peaking in 1994 at a rate of 2.5m barrels, according to a report to be released this week by Edingurgh-based analyst County NatWest WoodMac. North Sea production of oil and natural gas liquids is forecast by WoodMac to average a new record level of about 4.31m barrels a day in 1992. This will be achieved by a revival in UK output to 1.94m b/d this year from 1.76m in 1991, a 12 per cent production increase by Norway and an 8 per cent advance by Denmark. In January Norwegian production of oil and natural gas liquids surged to a record level of 2.26m b/d from 2.11m b/d in December. Last year WoodMac forecast correctly that Norway would overtake Britain as Europe's biggest producer, with daily average production rising by 13 per cent to 1.95m barrels, contributing 85 per cent of total north west Europe area production outside the UK. Norway's advance in 1991 was helped by the country's share of the Statfjord field increasing, partly because of reallocation of the field and the payback of overliftings by UK partners. In addition, oil production from the Oseberg field was boosted to a plateau level of 450,000 b/d when 23,000 b/d was added by two new satellite fields. Also contributing to the rise was an intensive development drilling programme in the Gullfaks field. WoodMac expects oil production from Gullfaks to rise substantially this year to 400,000 b/d. Oil production from the Hod field was higher than expected in 1991 and will be maintained at about 28,000 barrels a day, according to the report.</p>

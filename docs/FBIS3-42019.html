Even moderate deputies now come out against the signing  of such a document. According to them, the members of  parliament were not even told about the treaty signed in Moscow  by the presidents of the United States of America, Russia, and  Ukraine.    In the opinion of the members of parliament, the signing of  the Moscow treaty would mean that the president took a stand  which totally differs from that approved by the parliament. The  actions by Kravchuk play into the hands of Russia and the United  States and were carried out by him under pressure, stated the  members of parliament. Many of them say that they will come out  against any attempt by President Kravchuk to ignore the  reservations which were signed and expressed during the  discussion dedicated to the ratification of the START I treaty.  The communist deputies speak out for impeaching President  Kravchuk if the trilateral Moscow agreement is signed.</p>

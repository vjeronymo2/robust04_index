			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, April 12 (AFP) -- There was heavy shooting  Tuesday [12 April] morning in the Rwandan capital Kigali as  rebel forces neared the capital, and departing French troops  handed over the evacuation of foreigners to Belgium. The  shooting was concentrated in the southern Gikondo area,  according to Captain Eric Millet of the French Third Parachute  Regiment. The shooting, now coming from the north, had earlier  come in the east of the city where the rebel Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) had a battalion of 600 men. "It is hard to tell if  the forces shooting from the north are RPF reinforcements  (advancing) from the position they held two days ago 15  kilometres (nine miles) away, or if the rebels in the east have  repositioned themselves," Millet added.    On Tuesday the French Embassy had completely closed down,  adding to the sense of panic among Rwandans trying to escape the  fighting. the troops, sent to help the now completed evacuation  of French nationals, said they would leave as soon as control  over the city's remaining foreign population had been handed  over to Belgian forces.    More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from Kigali by  air  to date, the French troops said. The remaining foreign  nationals, waiting at the French school, were to be brought to  the airport in a convoy. A group of about 50 Rwandans who had  sought refuge in the French embassy were brought to the airport  Tuesday morning in a convoy of trucks. Their breakfast plates  were still lying on the tables of the deserted embassy, whose  doors had been left open.    "Everyone has left," confirmed the branch chief of Kigali's  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Philippe  Gaillard, who had placed sand bags around the ICRC offices in  preparation for the fighting to come.</p>

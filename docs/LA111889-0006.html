			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY'S NEW ORDER  </P> <P> By yesterday, 9.5 million of East Germany's 16.5 million citizens had applied  for and received foreign travel visas in the week since the country threw open  its borders. That staggering statistic speaks volumes about the frustration and  explosive claustrophobia affecting the long-penned-in populace. Not all visa  holders, to be sure, plan an early test of their new travel freedom -- although  on Friday alone more than a million crossed into West Germany -- and probably  only a small number of those who do go out will choose not to return. But when  60% of the population shows that it has one eye on the exit, a powerful message  is being sent.  </P> <P> The regime is responding to that message by shaking up both the government and  the Communist Party hierarchy and by promising changes to make more credible  the image of "socialism with a human face." That phrase, which has been  recurring for decades in Eastern Europe, seeks to suggest greater tolerance in  social and intellectual affairs along with expanded material comforts, all  under the continuing rule of the party. As far as the country's economic future  is concerned, Prime Minister Hans Modrow says he's ready to allow more  small-scale private enterprise, for example in retail trade. But he  specifically rejects any major turn toward a free market. His plan is to tinker  with the system, not overturn it.  </P> <P> East Germans will, however, see more political power-sharing than ever before,  thanks to the new prominence given four small parties that heretofore had only  token representation in government. Power sharing in this case, though, is not  the same thing as a real sharing of power. Although the non-Communist parties  have 11 seats in the new cabinet, the commanding heights of government -- the  ministries of defense, interior, foreign affairs, finance, economy -- will  continue to be firmly under Communist control.  </P> <P> All this is unquestionably reform even if, in the light of recent events, it is  reform at the bare minimum. The chance of far greater change in the near future  nonetheless exists. For one thing, the free elections that party boss Egon  Krenz has promised by 1991, along with a potential resuscitation of the  non-Communist parties, points to the possible emergence of a real political  opposition. Also, the simple unpredictability of events could force the  country's rulers to move faster and farther than they would like. The regime's  first need, as it well knows, is to try to gain greater credibility and popular  confidence. Those 9.5 million travel visas that East Germans have claimed  indicate how formidable that task is.  </P></p>

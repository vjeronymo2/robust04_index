			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cerus sells fund management arm CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, has sold Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse), its majority-owned Geneva-based fund management arm, to Banque Worms de Financement et d'Investissement (BWFI), the Swiss subsidiary of Banque Worms of France. Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse) sprang to fame last August following claims that it had been the subject of a highly complex attempted fraud involving L100bn (Dollars 83.75m) of Italian shares. Despite continuing investigations by Swiss and Italian authorities, the case of the allegedly 'missing' shares has not yet been resolved. Court action by Banque Dumenil Leble (Suisse) is also still pending. The sale of the bank's fund management activities will not affect those actions, as a small rump of the bank, covering corporate finance business, will remain. Nor will the sale affect the L100bn guarantee promised by Banque Dumenil Leble, the bank's French parent company. The acquisition will roughly triple the size of the funds managed by BWFI, which is thought to have had between SFr300 and SFr400m (Dollars 283.6m) under management before the deal. No price for the transaction has been disclosed. However, an official in Milan said BWFI had made a payment in respect of both the funds under management and goodwill. Fiat Auto, the car-making division of the Fiat group, will show a profit in 1991, according to managing director Mr Paolo Cantarella. He said the poor performance of the British, French and Spanish car markets in 1991 was offset by gains in the German market, which had expanded after reunification. However, the outlook for 1992 depended on the recovery in markets that showed a weak performance last year.</p>

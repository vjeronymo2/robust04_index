			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Midland rebuffed Lloyds' takeover advances LLOYDS BANK is privately furious with Midland Bank following Midland's decision to reject a takeover proposal after two months of negotiations. On Tuesday, Midland announced that it had agreed to be bought by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in a deal which is likely to create a transcontinental bank with a market value of Pounds 8bn. But it emerged yesterday that only two weeks earlier Midland had told Lloyds it did not wish to be bought by it. Negotiations between the two banks began in January. The talks were the initiative of Lloyds' chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman. 'He thought he had reached agreement with Midland,' said a financier with a close knowledge of the negotiations. 'He was deeply disappointed when Midland said it was no longer interested.' One banker close to Lloyds said he did not believe the bank would now make a hostile bid for Midland. The Bank of England was told of the talks and raised no objection to an agreed takeover of Midland by Lloyds. It advised both banks that they might face difficulties persuading the competition authorities in Brussels and the UK to sanction the deal, because a combination of the two banks would be a powerful force in the UK banking market. The negotiations were conducted by Sir Peter Walters and Mr Brian Pearse, respectively chairman and chief executive of Midland, and by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds, and by Mr Pitman. Midland was advised by the merchant bank SG Warburg and Lloyds by Baring Brothers. A banker close to Midland said yesterday it decided to reject Lloyds' advances having been given legal advice that the competition authorities were likely to block a bid. Another banker said Mr Pearse was also concerned at the impact on morale within Midland of a deal with Lloyds. Mr Pitman's prime goal in buying Midland was to cut the costs of the combined operations by closing branches, shutting one of the banks' head offices and shedding up to 20,000 staff. Midland's board was informed of the talks with Lloyds. Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong Bank, is a Midland board member. Hongkong Bank has had a 14.9 per cent stake in Midland since the end of 1987 and had considered buying the whole bank. Its takeover plans were put on ice at the end of 1990. At the end of February Mr Purves reactivated these plans having learned of Lloyds' interest. Hong Kong reaction, Page 26 London stocks, Page 48</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] yesterday complained to the UN Security Council  that Luanda is hindering talks on national reconciliation in  Lusaka. In a letter delivered by Ambassador Jardo Muecalia,  UNITA's Representative in Washington, who left for New York  yesterday, UNITA says that the Luanda government was adopting a  line aimed at prolonging the talks so that they will fail. The  same document states that Luanda is interested in the UN  Security Council imposing further sanctions on UNITA, this being  the main cause of its intransigence and arrogance in Lusaka.</p>

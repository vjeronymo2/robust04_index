			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: ANZ poised to open China branch ANZ is expected to become the first Australian bank to open a branch in China since the 1949 revolution. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is due to announce that ANZ has won approval to establish a branch in Shanghai when he visits China later this month. Mr Keating is anxious to make commercial relations the focus of his tour. ANZ, which has maintained a representative office in Beijing since the 1980s, applied last year to establish a presence in China's biggest industrial city. Official approval is being advanced to coincide with Mr Keating's visit. The Australian prime minister will also announce a ADollars 40m (USDollars 26.9m) chocolate-making joint venture, involving Cadbury Australia and the Beijing Agricultural Industries Corporation, in what will be the biggest foray by an Australian-based company into China's food-processing sector. In Shanghai, Mr Keating will also lay the foundation stone for a new Foster's brewing plant which is being established in partnership with the local Huaguang brewery. BTR Nylex is upgrading a glass-bottling plant in Shanghai that is expected to supply containers to the Foster's-Huaguang joint venture. ANZ's decision to establish a foothold in Shanghai seems certain to increase pressure on other Australian banks to follow suit, but China is not rushing to approve new licenses. Foreign banks already present in Shanghai include Bank of America, Citibank and Banque National de Paris. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and Standard Chartered Bank maintained a presence in the port city even during the gloomiest days of the post-revolution period. Australian investment in China totalled USDollars 228m in 1992 and should exceed USDollars 350m by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US, EU in procurement talks Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and the European Commission will today begin talks in the hope of reaching a deal on full liberalisation of public procurement contracts by April 15. The European Union, US and 10 other countries agreed in December to open up lucrative public contracts to full competition in most areas from the beginning of 1996. But in spite of the impetus given by the parallel Uruguay Round talks on global trade liberalisation, certain areas - including contracts offered by local authorities and utilities below central government level - were left out of the agreement. The EU has said it will withhold full liberalisation of telecommunications contracts, until the question of sub-federal contracts is resolved. Mr Kantor yesterday discussed public procurement and other post-Round issues with Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, in what both sides described as a 'stock-taking' of the Uruguay Round deal. Mr Kantor and Sir Leon agreed that trade representatives from the 'Quad' countries - the US, EU, Canada and Japan - should meet, possibly following scheduled talks among Quad trade officials in Washington on January 19. The US and EU are particularly eager to press on with the Gatt commitments on opening up access to markets of the four trade partners. Today, Mr Kantor will press the case for further public procurement liberalisation in talks with Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the internal market, and Mr Martin Bangemann, telecommunications commissioner. The US has always argued that it is difficult to oblige individual states to open their contracts to further competition. Instead, US officials said Mr Kantor would promise to persuade sub-federal authorities to make voluntary commitments to liberalisation. The EU and US took their first step in April last year towards a deal on public procurement by opening up markets for services and heavy electrical equipment.</p>

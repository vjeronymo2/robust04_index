			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Hard line investors trim Switzerland's gains - The professionals have been merciless since the news began to change for the worse Warnings started to go out a few weeks ago that most of the forces which had made the Swiss stock market the best performer in Europe during the first half of this year had played themselves out. The rest of the year, according to many analysts, promises to be much less buoyant. 'There is no reason to be aggressive on the Swiss market now,' says Mr Serge Ledermann, head of equity research at Lombard Odier &amp; Cie in Geneva. Mr Robin Seydoux of Credit Suisse agrees. 'There is little potential for the Swiss market at the moment,' he says. This is not, however, a unanimous view. Some feel that even though times are tougher the Swiss market will continue to outperform many other European markets, mainly because the profit outlook for the top Swiss companies remains surprisingly good. 'We still favour the Swiss market as one of the best in Europe,' says Mr Martin Gollner at Barings in London. The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) started the year at 1,053 and rose smartly to the 1,200 level in early May. It remained there for a month before sliding back to yesterday's close at 1,119, leaving it still some 6 per cent up in the year to date. The SMI index of leading shares has followed a similar pattern, rising from 1,670 at the beginning of the year to a peak of 1,988 in early May. It is now back at 1,791. Among the factors contributing to the market's rise were very high profit growth last year by leading Swiss companies and expectations of more good results this year. Also, there were indications early in the year that inflation and interest rates were about to fall and the recession in Switzerland to end. Lastly, there was the great leap forward in transparency and investor friendliness achieved by many Swiss companies as the implementation of a new companies law in July approached. Share splits and better financial reporting were particularly appreciated by foreign investors, and analysts agree that it has been foreign investors who have driven the market so far this year. In the past few weeks, most of these trends have been supplanted by less pleasant ones, both political and economic. Probably the most important new consideration has been the postponement of anticipated interest rate reductions following Germany's discount rate hike a month ago. Since then, Swiss economists have been revising down their already modest 1992 GDP growth forecasts. Credit Suisse, for example, cut its forecast from 0.8 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The dimmer economic outlook has naturally raised worries about corporate profits. Credit Suisse has revised downwards its estimate of profit growth for the 21 SMI stocks from 18.4 per cent to 15.1 per cent. Investors have been merciless in recent days with companies which have indicated in interim reports that business was deteriorating. Elco Looser, a popular maker of high technology burners, said on August 4 that its profit growth would not be as high as it hoped, and the shares have since shed SFr150 to SFr2,400. Logitech has been similarly hit, with the shares down SFr11 to SFr139 in just over a week. The noticeable exceptions to this trend have been the big bank stocks, which have been firm in spite of the gloomier interest rate outlook and warnings in the interim statements of Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation of higher than expected provisions this year. Mr Gollmer observes that inflation has halved in the past year and he thinks that interest rates have finally peaked. Thus it is probably time to start looking at the banks and insurance companies again. This view was reinforced last Wednesday by BZ Vision, an investment holding company which launched a SFr200m rights issue in Zurich to boost its investments in financial company shares. Then there are the looming milestone decisions concerning Switzerland's future relations with the European Community. On September 27, the Swiss will vote on an Alpine transit treaty with the EC, providing a good guide on how they will vote in December or next year on joining the so called European Economic Area (EEA). Both votes will undoubtedly be influenced by the result of the September 20 referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty. Mr Beat Philipp of Bank Vontobel in Zurich believes that political uncertainty over European integration is 'the major force' driving European markets at the moment. In terms of the influences on the Swiss market, he believes a rejection of Maastricht by the French would be positive, restoring a bit of the safe haven patina to Swiss securities. But the Swiss vote on the EEA is much more important, and a 'No' vote would be very negative because failure to join the EEA would weaken the country's economic growth potential. At present, the likelihood of a Swiss rejection of the EEA treaty is in our view seriously underestimated, especially by observers outside our borders,' Mr Philipp argues ominously. The political factors alone suggest that there could be a high level of volatility in the market in the coming months. And that makes most analysts tend to fall back on the very strong, and relatively inexpensive multinationals like Nestle, Sandoz, Roche and Ciba-Geigy, the latter two on p/e's of 13 and about 10 1/2 , while US competitors in the pharmaceutical industry, like Merck and Pfizer, are on around 20.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Swedbank sharply trims first-quarter losses to SKr864m SWEDBANK, the newly-merged savings bank group, reports a sharp reduction in first-quarter losses, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Operating deficit fell to SKr864m (Dollars 118m) from SKr2.94bn after loan losses of SKr2.78bn against SKr4.63bn. The comparative figures represent one quarter of 1992 totals. A rising share of problem loans meant net interest income for the period fell 8.1 per cent to SKr2.92bn and total income dropped to SKr3.90bn from SKr4.01bn. However, a cost-cutting drive reduced operating expenses by 14 per cent to SKr1.99bn and helped the operating result before credit losses to improve to SKr1.91bn from SKr1.69bn. The bank is aiming to cut costs by SKr2bn by the end of next year from 1991's level. Swedbank is one of the Swedish banks seeking state support although the terms are not yet known. The bank saw its capital adequacy ratio fall to 9.0 per cent at the end of March from 9.3 per cent at the end of 1992.</p>

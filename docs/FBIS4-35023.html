			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 27 Jun (AE) -- The Brazilian Government  today turned down requests submitted last weekend for export  licenses for a total of 1 million sacks of coffee. With this  move, the government expects to stop speculation on the  international market and to reduce abusive prices on the  domestic market. Coffee producers are apparently taking  advantage of the frost that has in recent days been affecting  the coffee producing regions in the states of Parana, Sao Paulo,  and Minas Gerais to increase their prices. Coffee price  increases have been a factor in increasing the June inflation  rate.    Frederico Robalinho de Barros, secretary for commercial  policy at the Industry and Commerce Ministry, believes the  coffee price increase could jeopardize the implementation of the  real on 1 July. The New York Stock Exchange today opened with an  increase of 49 cents per pound, representing a 42-percent  increase compared to the price on 24 June. Coffee prices have  also increased markedly at the London Stock Exchange, where on  24 June the price stood at $2,230 per tonne but today rose to  $2,980 per tonne; that is, a 33- percent increase.    The government has confirmed that in only three days -- 25,  26, and 27 June -- coffee exporters have requested licenses to  export 1 million sacks. This is a much larger volume than what  was exported for the entire month of May. Within three days,  government experts will survey the affected coffee plantations  to assess the damages provoked by the frost last weekend.  Ailton Barcellos, executive secretary of the Industry and  Commerce Ministry, said: "Preliminary assessments indicate that  coffee production may have been damaged to a level of between 30  and 35 percent in Parana State." Robalinho said that losses in  other regions may not go beyond 10 percent.    Robalinho announced that the government will have the damage  assessment reports by 4 July. Barcellos said: "When we have  this data we will be able to reopen the export registries."  Barcellos added that "there were an overwhelming number of  export license requests during the weekend." Showing  indignation, Robalinho said: "These were stupid requests." He  added that "within four to five days we will have reports on the  extent of the damage." Earlier, Robalinho had met with leaders  of the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febrae).    To avert abuse and speculation, the government today issued  two decrees that will be published tomorrow (28 June) in the  DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO. The first decree temporarily suspends  export licenses for soluble coffee that had been granted on the  basis of the 24 June prices (Friday), and turned down all  petitions submitted today to export coffee at today's prices.  The second decree suspends the export of coffee beans and  cancels all export licenses issued on the basis of prices  prevailing on 24 and 27 June.    To contain price increases on the domestic market, the  government plans to sell part of its coffee buffer stock, which  is estimated at 17.5 million sacks. It is estimated that the  1994-95 coffee harvest will yield 22 million sacks.</p>

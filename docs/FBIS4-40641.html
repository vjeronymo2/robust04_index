			<p>BFN     [Text] Stage two of a large-scale border operation,  codenamed Putina (Fishing Season), has got under way in the  Pacific.    As Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov, a spokesman for the Russian  border troops, has told INTERFAX, the action aims at curbing  border infiltration, halting trawling in Russia's territorial  waters and export of illegally caught sea products, as well as  safeguarding the environment.    Units of the North-Eastern Border District and Pacific  District resumed the operation on Sunday. Taking part will be  up to 60 percent of the border district's ships and aircraft,  and about 10 percent of its arms have been set aside for reserve.    During Putina's first stage that lasted from April 20 to May  10, four Japanese and 16 Russian boats were detained for border  violations. The sum of imposed fines amounted to 202 million  rubles and 15,000 dollars. Legal proceedings were initiated  against two Russian captains.    The prevented damage is estimated at 120 billion rubles.</p>

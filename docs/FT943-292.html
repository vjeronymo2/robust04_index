			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UN asked to rethink sanctions on Haiti US Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday asked the United Nations Security Council to lift all remaining sanctions against Haiti as soon as ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has returned to his country. Mr Christopher voiced 'cautious optimism' over the political developments in Haiti since a US force landed two weeks ago. Although other Security Council members have shown some reluctance to lift the UN sanctions until Haiti's military leaders step down, US officials said the council might vote on the resolution as early as yesterday afternoon. In Port-au-Prince, the US military began taking over responsibility for civilian utilities and infrastructure. The lights were expected to come on in a number of districts last night as the US brought two of the city's thermal electricity plants back into operation. US officials yesterday also predicted that the multinational operation in Haiti would look to rejuvenate water supply, trunk roads and telecommunications. Until yesterday, the city had only 13MW of electricity after dark, and 26MW during the day. But the US army has provided engineers to restore the Carrefour and Varreuf petrol-fired plant, shut down as a result of the fuel embargo. This should bring the energy supply to over 50MW. Although army officers were celebrating the achievements yesterday, they insisted that US support was temporary. Officials would not say how long the US would provide fuel and technical assistance, nor how the programme would be financed. They expressed hope, however, that Haiti would resume responsibiliy for the grid as soon as possible. Mr Evans Paul, the mayor who was forced into hiding, was reinstalled in the town hall yesterday.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / BAe freezes management pay BRITISH AEROSPACE has frozen the pay of its 2,500 management staff this year, it was disclosed yesterday. It has also emerged that directors' pay was reduced last year. The management pay freeze was disclosed by Sir Graham Day, the outgoing chairman, at the company's annual shareholders' meeting. It reflects the continuing difficulties the group faces in several of its main business activities including commercial aircraft, cars and property because of the slump in these markets. Sir Graham told shareholders the company felt it was appropriate in the circumstances to freeze the pay of executive staff. The pay freeze coincides with continuing large-scale rationalisation and restructuring at the company. In the past year, 10,000 jobs have been lost and, in February, an additional 2,750 job cuts were announced. The company's annual report for 1991 also shows that directors' pay has been cut. The highest paid director, believed to be Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive, saw his pay reduced by 18 per cent to Pounds 338,110 last year from Pounds 414,211 in 1990. Jet subsidies, Page 6</p>

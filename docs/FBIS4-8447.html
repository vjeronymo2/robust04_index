			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The parties of the  coalition government disagree on the powers the bodies of the  higher local administrative units should have, Premier Vaclav  Klaus told journalists today.    The government therefore decided to limit the bill on the  competence of the higher administrative units to their powers.  He said while there were not significant differences of opinion  between the coalition partners on the matter of the competence  of the higher administrative units, there were "fundamental  discrepancies" between them concerning the competence of the  bodies of these units.    The government was concerned that the powers of higher  administrative units might expand in the future, he said. "It  would be naive to assume that competence can be determined once  and for all time, since higher units are living organisms," he  said.    Klaus said the government would debate the narrowed down  bill  on the constitutional law on April 27 and submit the definitive  form of the bill to parliament on April 30.</p>

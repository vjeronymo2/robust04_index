He  was condemned to 18 years of imprisonment for his participation  in the robbery of a Lautaro bakery.    Marin Correa, one of nine political prisoners still jailed  in  the Santo Domingo prison, was not informed of the decision until  22 February despite the fact he was scheduled to travel this  morning. He told the press that he disagreed with his banishment  because in one year he could have obtained his freedom under  probation or night imprisonment.    Despite pleading innocent, he reaffirmed his support for the  struggle against the military regime. Aylwin still has six  pending pardon requests, including the most contentious ones  related to Hector Maturana Urzua, Juan Ordenes Narvaez, and  Hector Figueroa Gomez, who were sentenced to life imprisonment  for their participation in an attack against General Pinochet.  Miguel Angel Colina, Marco Antonio Mardone Villarroel, and Jorge  Escobar Diaz also are awaiting pardons.</p>

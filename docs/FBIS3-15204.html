			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Karen Baburyan, acting chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, expressed concern due  to Azerbaijan's wish to join the NATO program Partnership for  Peace. In his letter to NATO General Secretary Manfred Werner,  sent Tuesday, Baburyan asks to take into consideration the fact  that "Azerbaijan's leadership does not intend to reject its  aggressive policy" while considering this issue.    As Baburyan said, Baku's torpedoing of the CSCE peaceful  initiatives and other peacemaking efforts aimed at the  settlement of this conflict testifies to this fact. "We are  especially concerned over Baku's attempt to internationalize the  conflict, involving extremist forces into it," emphasizes the  letter. Azerbaijan's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace  program without the policy of this state changing can discredit  noble goals, aggravate the situation in this region, and could  lead, in general, to undesirable consequences, concludes the  message.</p>

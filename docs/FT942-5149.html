			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Canada suffers in spite of itself - Capital &amp; Credit Investing in a country with almost no inflation, a healthy trade surplus and one of the highest returns in the world should be a one-way bet. But if the country is Canada, you bail out as fast as you can. Canada has suffered in spite of itself - to the dismay of Treasury managers in the Canadian provinces, which are among the biggest borrowers in the Eurobond market, and to the bemusement of City economists. As one investment banker puts it: 'Investors in the Canadian market have lost on the currency, lost on the spread and been killed in the bond market.' At end-1991, the Canadian dollar was CDollars 1.12 against the US currency. By last January it had fallen to CDollars 1.31 and late last week was Dollars 1.3850, a near eight-year low. At the long end of the Canadian government bond yield curve, spreads against US Treasury bonds have widened dramatically in recent months. Wild volatility in the markets has pushed the yield on Canadian 10-year government bonds as far as 168 basis points above Treasuries compared to a low of 63 basis points in February. Spreads on debt issued by the provinces are even wider. Also, the yield on the Canadian benchmark government bond maturing in 2004 has risen by 166 basis points to 8.8 per cent compared to a rise of 140 basis points for the equivalent UK government bond yield over the same period. All this turmoil comes at a time when, in some respects, Canada has never had it so good. According to Mr Randall Powley, senior economist at ScotiaMcLeod, brokers, the purchasing power parity of the Canadian dollar is 13 per cent better than the current exchange rate would suggest. Headline inflation was 0.2 per cent in April, and real rates of investment return are the highest in the Group of Seven industrialised countries. He cites 8 per cent bonds maturing in 2023 as offering a real return of 8.79 per cent. 'Clearly the spreads have widened but it has nothing to do with fundamentals,' he says. The Canadian government is sufficiently concerned by the negative attitude towards the currency that on Friday it is expected to publish its own estimate of the Canadian dollar's purchasing power parity for the first time. To understand the market's worries, one has to go back to the national budget in February. The newly-elected Liberal party upset international investors by estimating the deficit for fiscal 1993 at CDollars 45.7bn against the previous government's forecast of a CDollars 32.6bn deficit. Disappointment turned to concern as the drive for separatism in Quebec snowballed. A recent visit to France by Lucien Bouchard, the leader of the federal Bloc Quebecois, focused the attention of European investors on the possibility of a split. Opinion polls show the regional Parti Quebecois (PQ) as most likely to win the provincial elections later this year and then call a referendum on secession in May next year. Many international economists believe a win for the PQ will be merely a reaction against the governing Liberals and that secession is improbable. But the uncertainty has caused the spread on Quebec's bonds to widen recently. 'If Quebec has to borrow in the markets it will cost a lot more money,' says one syndicate manager. 'Spreads have widened by 10 to 15 basis points in the past week. When you translate that into dollars and cents, for an extra 10 basis points each Dollars 100m borrowed costs Dollars 100,000. The additional annual interest payment on Dollars 500m is between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 750,000.' The fact that 40 per cent of Canada's debt is held by foreign investors has exposed it to sudden changes in investment strategies. Late last year, international investors had bought Canadian bonds in the hope that the yield spread with US Treasuries would narrow. 'However, in bear markets, credit spreads always widen out,' says Mr Powley. In spite of the assault on their bonds, the provinces' Treasury managers are keeping their cool. Mr John Madden, deputy finance minister for Canada's biggest province, Ontario, says he has no funding worries. 'It has been a volatile market but we issue in various markets around the world,' he says, noting that the yen market has been the most attractive lately. 'We have a borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn and expect to pre-borrow a further CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn for next year.' The Quebec Treasury is confident. It has raised CDollars 1.5bn of its CDollars 4.2bn programme for the year and says a further CDollars 2.7bn will come from sources other than public bond issues. 'Of course funding is more expensive than three months ago but we are not concerned,' says a senior Treasury official. Many economists argue that Canada has been treated too harshly by the markets and by the credit rating agencies which have downgraded the foreign-currency ratings of the sovereign and some of the provinces. Recent research on the Canadian provinces by Salomon Brothers says: 'Provincial credit is stabilising: in some cases it is improving from the fiscal deterioration of the past three years.'</p>

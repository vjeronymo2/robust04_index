			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris gains ground as it nears end of account Sandwiched between two sets of Wall Street gains, bourses mostly kept their nerve, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS gained ground, with the CAC-40 index rising 11.16 to 1,952.05, after a high of 1,956 and a low of 1,935. Turnover was heavy on the last day before the end of the December account at FFr5.7bn. James Capel downgraded Lyonnaise des Eaux, off 90 centimes at FFr474.10, to hold. The broker said that it had altered its opinion following the company's recent announcement that it was seeking to expand its cable television activities, after it had failed to win the concession for the country's third mobile telephone licence. Capel was worried over the group's strategic focus, and feared that it would 'see further heavy expenditure offering inadequate returns,' which could result in a deterioration of previously stable debt levels. 'The Lyonnaise share has outperformed by 3 per cent over the last twelve months,' the broker concluded, 'and it is now on a 30 per cent premium to the market in 1996. Although we expect 20 per cent per annum earnings growth in 1997 and 1998, we feel that the current rating reflects this.' Elsewhere, Accor rose FFr14 to FFr570 and Michelin continued to be well supported, gaining FFr3.10 to FFr199.10. FRANKFURT switched its attention from chemicals to steels, engineers and retailers as the Dax index added to Wednesday's post bourse gains, closing the session 13.99 higher at 2,100.65, and the post bourse at 2,102.25. Turnover rose from DM4.4bn to DM5.2bn. Bayer and Hoechst, in the spotlight on Wednesday, were less than a percentage point better. The hope that higher product prices would be established in 1995 moved to the metal-based industries, said Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt: Linde was up DM10.50 at DM899, Preussag DM6 at DM448 and Thyssen DM5 at DM289.50. Traders were probably more excited about Thyssen's plans for carving itself a 10 per cent slice of the German telecommunications industry, said Mr Wodniok, who rated this a long term prospect; he saw recovery prospects in retailing in the same light, and thought that the gains of DM9 to DM574 for Karstadt, and DM20.50, or 4.4 per cent to DM483 for Kaufhof were too early for an industry which may still have problems to face in 1995. MILAN accepted the news of the resignation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister with a slight improvement, while investors began to speculate what the next course of action would be. The Comit index was up 3.24 at 627.30. Although the resignation had been expected all week, Mr Berlusconi's action opened up fresh political problems. The Italian president, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, asked Mr Berlusconi to remain in office while he decided the next step in the constitutional process. Mr Berlusconi, who was due to make a televised address to the nation last night, has insisted that new elections take place; but the president could ask for the formation of a new government, possibly led by a non-political leader for which there is recent precedent. With investors, brokers and analysts concentrating on the political arena, corporate activity was limited. Stet gained L70 to L4,630, while Telecom Italia slipped L80 to L4,095; Fiat lost 1.4 per cent to L5,890 and Olivetti 1 per cent to L1,953. ZURICH followed Wall Street higher in late afternoon, the SMI index closing 13.70 higher at 2,649.8. The higher dollar promoted stocks of companies with a substantial proportion of their sales denominated in the US currency. Alusuisse rose SFr8 to SFr655 as it followed the recent rise in US aluminium stocks, and denied rumours that it might sell its own aluminium business. Ciba-Geigy put on SFr17 to SFr795; the shares broke through a resistance level as Ciba bought Rhone Poulenc Rorer's proprietary pharmaceutical business in the US and Canada. Elsewhere, Union Bank of Switzerland led the advance in the banking sector, advancing SFr18 to SFr1,095 amid reports of year-end window dressing. However, Holderbank, the building group, led active stocks as it fell SFr14 to SFr1,042. AMSTERDAM was firmer in subdued trading. The AEX index put on 2.00 to 415.35. While activity was generally patchy, interest continued in KPN and Philips, whose shares were the most heavily traded. The telecoms group lost 80 cents to Fl 58.40 as some profits were booked after recent strength. Philips added 30 cents to Fl 52.50 on news that its lighting joint venture with Siemens of Germany had been cleared by the European Commission. Further strength was seen in Unilever, up Fl 2.10 to Fl 204.30 and Akzo Nobel, up Fl 2.60 at Fl 197.70. MADRID fell yet again, with Telefonica prominent among the losers. The general index closed 0.39 lower at 291.20 with Telefonica down Pta40, or 2.5 per cent at Pta1,535 in 2.3m shares. COPENHAGEN heard an analysts' poll say that the KFX index would rise by some 20 per cent next year; the same poll, noted Reuter, predicted a 15 per cent gain for 1994 but, by yesterday morning, the market was 14 per cent down on the year so far. Yesterday the KFX index bridged some of the gap with a rise of 1.70, or 1.8 per cent to 94.12. Novo Nordisk rose DKr23, or 4.2 per cent to stock on plans to reorganise and streamline the pharmaceutical company.

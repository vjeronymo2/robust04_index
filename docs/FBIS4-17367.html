			<p>BFN     [Text] A decision by the IMF to grant Russia a regular  credit of $1.5 billion shows that the world economic and  financial community supports our government's line of reforms,  Russian Vice Premier and Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told  Radio Moscow correspondent Konstantin Garibov in an exclusive  interview. He explained that the credit would be used to back  the budget through noninflationary means, modernize, and raise  the competitiveness of industry and agriculture.    Aleksandr Shokhin noted that the IMF decision was important  for Russia also because it paved the way for the speediest end  of the talks with official creditors on the repayment of  Russia's foreign debts in the current year. This decision  offers an opportunity for talks with the IMF over a new credit  of $4 billion.    According to the Russian vice premier, Russia has normal  relations with all international organizations, as well as the  group of the world's seven most industrially developed  countries. Mr. Shokhin believes that the main thing for today  is to create a favorable climate for foreign investments. He  says he thinks that a system of guarantees should be developed  but not at the expense of the federal budget or government.  Guarantees shall be created at a joint projects level. The  schemes of mortgage guarantees and guarantees of a stable tax  regime throughout the implementation of each investment project  should be used. Such favorable conditions for foreign investors  will enable Russia to handle the problem of recession more  effectively than money borrowing.    Speaking about Russia's participation in the forthcoming  meeting of the IMF and the World Bank Board of Governors due in  Washington on 22 to 27 April, Aleksandr Shokhin said Russia  planned to launch a number of new initiatives aimed at further  developing equal and mutual advantageous credit and financial  cooperation. He expressed hope that they would be approved just  like a previous Russian proposal to establish special credit  programs for countries with a transitional economy. Russia has  already obtained $3 billion in credits for structural economic  changes within the framework of this program.</p>

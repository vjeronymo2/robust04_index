			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Liberia signs peace deal Liberia's warring factions signed a peace deal in Benin yesterday paving the way for multi-party elections early next year, Reuter reports from Cotonou. The ceremony at the presidency building in Cotonou came after three days of talks on details of an accord reached last weekend in Geneva.

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: CCA to buy Polish interests of Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), the quoted Australian soft drinks group which is 51 per cent-owned by the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company (CCC), is to expand its presence in central and eastern Europe by buying out its parent's interests in Poland in a cash deal. No financial details have been disclosed. CCC made its first direct investment in Poland three years ago. It is one of three franchise owners for Coca-Cola brands in the country - the others being Ringes, a Norwegian bottler, and Brau, an Austrian brewer. Ringes also owns a 51 per cent interest in a Warsaw bottling joint venture, with CCC holding the rest. CCA declined to say how much it expected to pay for its parent's interests, which cover brands such as Fanta, Sprite and Bonaqa as well as Coke and Coke Lite. It said only that total investment in the Coca-Cola 'system' in Poland had amounted to around Dollars 300m, of which Coca-Cola had contributed 'a fair amount'. CCA said the purchase would give it access to 22.4m consumers, plus a further 6m through the 49 per cent interest in the Warsaw joint venture. CCA has been steadily amassing Coca-Cola franchises in Austria and eastern Europe, as well as the Asia-Pacific region. The company said it expected further overseas expansionary moves - which could involve either parent-owned or independent franchises and would not necessarily be in eastern Europe.</p>

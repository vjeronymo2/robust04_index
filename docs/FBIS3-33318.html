			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico will advocate the elimination of the U.S.  blockade of Cuba because it feels the measure is prejudicial to  our population. During a private appearance before the foreign  relations board of the standing committee of the Congress of the  [Mexican] Union, Mexico's designated ambassador to Cuba briefly  discussed the principal objectives of his work program in Cuba.  In this connection, he emphasized that it is necessary to  increase commercial and financial relations between the two  nations, especially in sectors that are priority sectors for  Mexican investment, among which are: basic industry, health,  communications, construction, foodstuffs, and the hotel  industry. The designated ambassador said the Mexican Embassy  will need to stimulate, create, promote, and manifest projects  for joint activity in whatever promotes sources of reciprocal  exchange and consolidates and expands Mexico's presence on the  Cuban market.</p>

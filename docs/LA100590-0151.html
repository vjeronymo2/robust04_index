			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART MUSEUM REJECTS CONTROVERSIAL WORK;  </P> <P> EXHIBIT: THE DISPLAY 'FLAGS' IN LAGUNA BEACH WILL INCLUDE 19 OF THE 20 WORKS OF  POLITICAL ARTIST MARK HERESY. THE 20TH, A STARS AND STRIPES MADE FROM  PORNOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE PHOTOS, WON'T BE SHOWN.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum, whose director has vowed to "abide by the rules" to  secure a hefty sum of National Endowment for the Arts grants, has excluded a  potentially controversial work from one of its current installations.  </P> <P> The exhibit, "Flags," includes 19 of 20 American flags that political artist  Mark Heresy has fashioned out of such materials as bullets and buckshot shells,  cut currency and human hair. But the 20th flag, "Freedom of the Press," a Stars  and Stripes replica constructed of photos from porno magazines, has been left  out.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum is Orange County's largest NEA grantee this year, having  been awarded six grants totaling $222,500. Recipients of 1990 grants have been  required to certify that they will not produce or present work that the NEA  might consider obscene.  </P> <P> Museum Director Charles Desmarais on Thursday angrily defended the museum's  omission of the flag and insisted that its exclusion was "absolutely not"  influenced by fear of losing NEA funding.  </P> <P> He said the museum's decision to display all but one of Heresy's flags was "a  matter of selection" and that the excluded work was not specifically singled  out. "I don't care if there were 50 flags," he said. "It's the job of the  museum to make choices. . . . We didn't omit things. We select what we believe  to be valuable and important to include (in any exhibit) for our public."  </P> <P> Asked whether he considers "Freedom of the Press" to be not valuable and  important, Desmarais responded, "You can draw your own conclusions."  </P> <P> Heresy said his flag works are an attempt to illustrate his view of America's  bent toward censorship, militarism and materialism by infusing artifacts  representative of those attitudes into the fabric of the nation's symbol of  freedom.  </P> <P> The exclusion of the pornographic magazine flag, he said, underscores the  message he hopes to portray in the piece -- that America pretends to stand for  freedom of expression yet institutionalizes censorship.  </P> <P> "It just reinforces what the piece says," said the 25-year-old artist from Los  Angeles. "It's very much about hypocrisy. It's a very cynical piece."  </P> <P> Heresy said, however, that he doesn't fault the Laguna museum for leaving out  the flag. Instead, he said, he is "encouraged" that the rest of the exhibit was  accepted at all by a museum in a predominantly conservative county.  </P> <P> He credits Bolton T. Colburn, the museum's curator of collections. Colburn  "really stuck his neck out on this," Heresy said. "It gives me hope that we can  still do art and say something without (being censored) too heavily."  </P> <P> Some arts groups throughout the country have rejected NEA funding this year  because of the obscenity stipulation, which they have criticized as  government-sponsored censorship. Desmarais has ardently defended his museum's  acceptance of the grants, contending that refusing the money would be to  acquiesce to the pressure of conservatives whose criticism of a handful of  works they consider sacrilegious or obscene prompted the anti-obscenity pledge.  </P> <P> Museum officials recently sent to the NEA an acceptance form for a $150,000  grant along with a letter that objected to the certification but said "we will  abide by the rules," as Desmarais put it last week.  </P> <P> The "Flags" installation is scheduled to remain on display at the museum  through Dec. 16. "Freedom of the Press" remains at the Zero One Gallery in  Hollywood, where the other flags had been before they were moved to the Laguna  museum last month.  </P></p>

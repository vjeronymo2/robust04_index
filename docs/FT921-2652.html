			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Red sweater and kippers v Elgar on the cliffs  -No adventure in the Tory political broadcast 'What you see is what you get' is the PR slogan we have grown used to as a description for John Major. In John Schlesinger's campaign film for the Conservatives, The Journey, what you see is what you quickly forget. The film's unshowy style is merciful in one way. There are no shots of John and Norma walking hand-in-hand along Elgar-haunted clifftops. But the hidden message may be equally strident. The matter-of-fact footage of the PM in a car revisiting his natal Brixton, interspersed with footage of him sitting on a verandah recollecting his humble origins in tranquillity (he craftily wears a red sweater), is so low-key it is almost hectoring. The message is clear and loud: a man born poor need not grow up to be a socialist. The manner is clearer and propagandistically louder: this is a soft-spoken Mr Nice Guy and he might knock on your door for a cup of tea at any moment. The PM is filmed buying kippers and tomatoes in a street market. From his or Mr Schlesinger's moving car he peers out at his childhood addresses, in awe that the houses still survive. (he has not visited them since?) He points down a street saying that that was where he used to put up soapboxes and make speeches as a youth. 'Some people used to engage in badinage,' he comments, a locution only Mr Major could produce. Cunningly the man in the red sweater keeps chipping in, emphasising the message behind all the childhood recall: that absolutely everything is safe in Conservative hands. The economy, education, health, Britain, the world. He shows us the very house in whose back garden he played cricket, he says, for hour after hour. And he is shown putting those hands to good use in the film's climactic montage (music, please, Mr Purcell) where he shakes his manual extremities - I am trying to catch the Major style - with the likes of Bush, Mandela and Yeltsin. A statesman; for our times; a man for all seasons; a bloke from Brixton; a safe pair of hands. The country is reassured, which is a small triumph for Mr Schlesinger; but I am still worrying about what the Number 10 chef is expected to cook with the tomatoes and kippers.</p>

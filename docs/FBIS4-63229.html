			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Visits" rubric: "Boris </F> Yeltsin and Martti Ahtisaari Have `Coordinated Positions.' The  Finnish President's First Official Visit to Moscow Ended  Yesterday"]    [Text] At a dinner in honor of the eminent Finnish guest,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin noted that the present leaders  of Russia and Finland not only value the positive undertakings  of their predecessors but also "intend to build on them." It  was thus stressed that Russo-Finnish relations are a  "significant factor for stability in northern Europe and the  Baltic region," and consequently it is necessary to "constantly  coordinate positions."    As ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has learned, no joint documents were  signed on the basis of the results of the talks. But the fact  that President Ahtisaari was accompanied on his trip by a large  group of Finnish entrepreneurs is indicative. The two  countries' businessmen did not waste time on protocol matters  but sought to use the top-level talks to consolidate their  economic positions in Russia. Especially since both President  Yeltsin and President Ahtisaari regarded with approval the  development of direct contacts not only between state  enterprises but also at the level of private firms. The figures  are as follows: In 1993 Russo-Finnish trade turnover was more  than 40 percent up on the previous year and totaled almost $2.5  billion. Furthermore, cooperation is developing not only at  state level but also between firms and individual enterprises.  Finnish companies are showing greatest activeness in Russia's  border regions -- St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Leningrad and  Murmansk oblasts. Special energy-saving and rational forestry  use programs have been prepared for those regions. Projects for  the development of mobile radio telephone systems, the  modernization of highways and railroads, ports, and border  transport crossings are being developed. A program of  cooperation in the assimilation of oil and gas deposits in the  northern regions of Russia is justn one of those being prepared.    It is to be presumed that President Ahtisaari's visit to  Moscow and his talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin  will give fresh impetus to mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>

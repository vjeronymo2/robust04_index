			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc is main LME bright spot as others consolidate - Market Report ZINC was the strongest of the London Metal Exchange contracts yesterday as prices responded to good fourth quarter consumption prospects and the fact that tight supplies of concentrate (an intermediate material) would induce a natural control over production levels in the not too distant future. Trade and speculative buying, coupled with short-covering, prompted an early rise to Dollars 1,000 a tonne for three months delivery, a level last seen five weeks ago. Profit-taking appeared at that level and the price fell back to Dollars 995. But the buyers were quickly back in the driving seat and by the end of after hours (kerb) trading it was quoted at Dollars 1,002 a tonne, up Dollars 14 from Wednesday. Most other LME markets attempted to consolidate gains made earlier in the week. Following Wednesday's Dollars 32 rise, three months COPPER retested resistance around Dollars 2,420 a tonne before slipping back to Dollars 2,411. But it ended the kerb at Dollars 2,416, up Dollars 1. Traders suggested that it might not be until after the UK's long holiday weekend that a further serious attempt would be made on resistance around Dollars 2,430. Three months positions for LEAD and NICKEL met effective resistance at Dollars 600 and Dollars 6,020 a tonne respectively. Last business in lead was at Dollars 595, down Dollars 4 a tonne from Wednesday, while nickel touched Dollars 6,050 before ending the day at Dollars 5,990, up Dollars 65 a tonne. ALUMINIUM succumbed to some trade selling and profit-taking after Wednesday's strong performance and the three months prices fell back to Dollars 1,512 a tonne before ending at Dollars 1,513, down Dollars 11. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended down but well off lows as industry and trade buying supported a thin market pressured by tight supplies and threats of further damage to Brazilian crops resulting from the continuing dry weather in growing regions, dealers said. The November futures position closed at Dollars 3,553 a tonne, down Dollars 20 on the day, after a steeper downturn had been stemmed by considerable industry buying, according to one trader. 'It should have gone down much more - in a range of Dollars 60 to Dollars 70 (lower) - based on New York's close,' he said. Dealers also said lower production estimates for Brazil made by German commodity statistics agency FO Licht had supported the market, which was generally pulled down by trade liquidation and profit-taking following the strong rises of Monday and Tuesday. In its report Licht said it had cut its 1995-96 Brazilian crop estimate by 8.5m bags (60kg each) to 18m and attributed the drop, in part, to the recent Brazilian frosts. Compiled from Reuters</p>

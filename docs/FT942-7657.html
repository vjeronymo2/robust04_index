			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / N Korea 'replaced fuel rods' South Korea said yesterday North Korea might have already replaced up to 15 per cent of fuel rods at a nuclear reactor without supervision by international inspectors, Reuter reports from Seoul. 'The exchange of fuel rods at the 5MW reactor in Yongbyon is believed to have been 10 to 15 per cent complete so far,' Yonhap news agency quoted Mr Lee Hong-koo, unification minister, telling parliament. The agency said there were a total of 8,100 uranium fuel rods at the reactor, which could hold vital evidence on whether Pyongyang has developed a nuclear bomb as suspected by some western governments and intelligence agencies. A team of nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to arrive in the North today for talks on the refuelling. Mr Kim Dai-ho, a former official at North Korea's Yongbyon reprocessing plant, told the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun the North had secretly extracted 12kg of plutonium from spent fuel in 1988 despite its public denials. North Korea, which denies trying to develop such weapons, insists the only plutonium it ever produced at Yongbyon was 'a tiny amount' reluctantly owned up to in 1992.</p>

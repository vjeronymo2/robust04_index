			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bellwinch in financing talks Bellwinch, the south of England housebuilder, said yesterday it was in negotiations for an injection of capital to 'strengthen its position.' The company, which had been due to announce results for the half-year to end-December yesterday, said it hoped the negotiations would be concluded satisfactorily in the near future. It would then announce interim results. At yesterday's 10p share price, Bellwinch was valued at Pounds 3.3m. The company reported a taxable deficit of Pounds 4.85m, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.22m, for the year to end-June 1990. Gearing at the last balance sheet date stood at 77 per cent. That was after taking account of Bellwinch's acquisition last September of the remaining shares, and the debt, in Basingshire, a former associated company which owns the freehold to a parcel of land at Millwall.</p>

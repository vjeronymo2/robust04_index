			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KNEE TAKES CORNERBACK OUT OF BRONCOS LINEUP FOR REST OF YEAR  </P> <P> Cornerback Tyrone Braxton, a leader in the Denver Broncos secondary, has been  lost for the season with a torn ligament in his right knee.  </P> <P> Braxton, who was injured Sunday in the Seattle game, was scheduled to undergo  surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament at St. Luke's Hospital.  </P> <P> Team officials said Monday that the surgery will require a six- to eight-month  rehabilitation period.  </P> <P> Braxton had been a starter for only one season, but already he had become one  of the team's most vocal and inspirational players.  </P> <P> Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said he has not decided who will start in  Braxton's place. Possibilities are Alton Montgomery and veteran Randy Robbins,  but Reeves said the Broncos also would explore the trade market in search of a  cornerback.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "The Last Emperor," last year's big winner at the Academy Awards, was named  best film Sunday night by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Two  stars from the offbeat comedy "A Fish Called Wanda" won acting awards: John  Cleese (best actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor). Best actress awards  winners were Maggie Smith, for her starring role as a spinster piano teacher in  Dublin in "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne," and Dame Judi Dench, for her  supporting role as the pushy mother in "A Handful of Dust." Best original  screenplay went to "A World Apart," while "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"  won best adapted screenplay. Louis Malle took directing honors for "Au Revoir  Les Enfants." This year's best picture Oscar nominees were ineligible because  they were not released in Britain during 1988. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

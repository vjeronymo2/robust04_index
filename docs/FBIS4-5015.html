			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  introduced his proposal for an interparty policy study group  involving all coalition parties. The proposal provoked friction  among the coalition parties, and, in the end, Hosokawa had to  drop it. Nevertheless, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa  has again proposed an interparty "conference on basic policy  issues" (tentative name). On 4 April, Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who has just returned  from Europe, will join a coalition leaders' meeting to restart  discussions on the interparty consultative body. Shinseito and  Komeito are still eager for an early merger of all coalition  parties, and the controversy is likely to again threaten the  coalition government's unity.    It appears Hosokawa and Ozawa are impatiently seeking a  coalition merger. Now that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  is intensifying its stance in urging the Hosokawa cabinet  resign, these coalition leaders want to rehabilitate the  multiparty coalition's unity, which was weakened after the  enactment of the political reform legislations. Hereafter, the  coalition government will have to grapple with such pending  issues as tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear weapons  development program, and these controversies may trigger serious  internal discord in the government. A senior Shinseito official  said that, "if the coalition's framework is left as it is, each  party may go its own way until the coalition breaks up."    Yet, the turmoil over Hosokawa's policy study group proposal  clarified that Ozawa's real intention is to merge all coalition  parties into one under his control. In this sense, proposals  for the policy study group and the unified floor group were made  to discourage the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and  Sakigake [Harbinger] from opposing a coalition merger.  Commenting on this, the senior Shinseito official said, "in  fact, that was a tricky action."    However, every coalition party is aware that some sort of  interparty tie-up is needed for the coalition government's  survival after the next general election. The senior Shinseito  official stressed "everybody knows the need for multiparty  candidates or joint campaigns." At a coalition leaders meeting,  even SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo acknowledged the need  for selection of multiparty candidates.    Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda insists joint  election campaigns are possible without a coalition merger,  saying: "Even under the new electoral system, it would be  better to seek selection of multiparty candidates." However,  Ichikawa stresses that a policy accord is an inevitable  prerequisite for joint election campaigns, saying "interparty  cooperation in election campaigns is impossible without  narrowing policy gaps among parties."    Ichikawa explained the "basic policy issue council" is  intended for "narrowing policy gaps" among election partners on  security and defense affairs. But Shinseito intends to demand  the SDPJ and other leftist groups review their political stances  to pave the way for tie-ups in election campaigns. On the other  hand, the SDPJ intends to separate policy debates from  multiparty cooperation in elections. For the time being,  coalition parties are likely to confront each other over the  issue.</p>

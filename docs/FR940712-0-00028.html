			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit established for the CVOA is taken, NMFS will close the salmon savings area to all vessels using trawl gear through November 12, 1994_the expiration date of this emergency rule. The salmon savings area historically has accounted for a large proportion of ``other'' salmon bycatch and a relatively small proportion of groundfish harvest. The recommended 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit represents 50 percent of the 1991, 1992, and 1993 average of ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA. The 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit approximates the 1991 and 1992 bycatch, while providing some buffer to accommodate slight increases in bycatch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is intended to prevent a recurrence of the high 1993 chum salmon bycatch experienced during the BSAI pollock non-roe season. The bycatch of ``other'' salmon appears to be a function of the time of year, distribution of fishing effort, and spatial distribution of salmon. Historical data indicate that ``other'' salmon bycatch is reduced generally during the winter months and elevated during the months of July through October. Approximately 67 percent of all ``other'' salmon bycatch in observed hauls during 1991 was taken during August, and 40 percent and 62 percent of the 1992 and 1993 ``other'' salmon bycatch, respectively, was taken during the month of September. Starting in 1993, the opening of the pollock non-roe season was delayed from June 1 until August 15 (58 FR 30997, May 28, 1993). This delay was implemented to achieve increased revenues from the harvest of BSAI pollock during the non-roe season and to provide participants in the pollock non-roe fishery increased opportunities to fish in other groundfish fisheries. Although the delay of the pollock non-roe season until August 15 was expected to increase chum salmon bycatch, the magnitude of the 1993 bycatch amount was not anticipated. Spatially, the number of ``other'' salmon appears to be highest south of 57 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; N. lat. and east of 168 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; W. long. Consistent with historical data, about 80 percent of the 1993 BSAI ``other'' salmon bycatch was taken in the CVOA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of historical observer data relative to the 1993 pollock non-roe season chum salmon bycatch was not available prior to the Council's April 1994 meeting. Therefore, the recently discovered circumstances surrounding the 1993 chum salmon bycatch problem provided little opportunity for the Council to respond through normal rulemaking before the opening of the 1994 pollock non-roe season on August 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council considered seven different alternatives for time/area closures to limit chum salmon bycatch during the 1994 pollock non-roe season. The recommended area was chosen as a minimum closure area that would provide the most consistent protection to ``other'' salmon during the pollock non-roe season, but would still allow access to productive pollock fishing grounds. During the period July through October, the recommended salmon savings area accounted for 1.0, 0.8, and 7.0 percent of the total annual observed groundfish catch in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod trawl fisheries during 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. During the period July through October of 1991, 1992, and 1993, this area accounted for 38, 40, and 54 percent, respectively, of the total annual ``other'' salmon bycatch. During the period July through October 1993, the salmon savings area had the highest ``other'' salmon bycatch rate of the areas analyzed_approximately 1.2 ``other'' salmon per metric ton of groundfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Increased Observer Coverage and Electronic Transmission of Observer Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS must rely on data collected by NMFS-certified observers to manage the 1994 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit of 42,000 fish. Currently, one observer is required on each mothership processor vessel participating in either the inshore or offshore component of the pollock fishery. Under a regulatory amendment effective May 20, 1994 (59 FR 18757, April 20, 1994), all salmon taken in BSAI trawl operations must be retained until the number of salmon is determined by a NMFS-certified observer. NMFS intends to use these observed counts to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit, unless other information indicates that these numbers do not provide the best information available on salmon bycatch. To monitor the chum salmon bycatch limit effectively and to prevent the 42,000 fish bycatch limit from being exceeded, NMFS must receive daily reports of salmon bycatch numbers. NMFS typically receives weekly reports on groundfish catch and on prohibited species bycatch to monitor the fisheries. The time required to process these reports results in a delay between the receipt of reports and determination of overall catch statistics that provide the basis for determining whether a closure is required. If the ``other'' salmon bycatch in 1994 were to proceed at the 1993 rate (i.e., approximately 39,000 fish in week 1; 26,000 fish in week 2; and 47,000 fish in week 3), weekly reporting would not be sufficient to prevent the 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit from being exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective monitoring of the bycatch limit requires a second observer on each mothership processor vessel that receives fish from catcher boats fishing in the CVOA during the pollock non-roe season. This is necessary to ensure accurate and timely counts of salmon bycatch, without compromising the other groundfish sampling duties of the observer. Observers onboard mothership processor vessels currently sample approximately two out of every ten hauls. The time required to count salmon bycatch under the May 20, 1994, regulatory amendment, and to transmit these data on a daily basis, places an extra burden on observers stationed on mothership processor vessels. According to 1993 records, the salmon bycatch rate was greater for mothership processor vessels (0.813 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish) than for shoreside plants (0.343 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish). NMFS will require the additional observers to remain onboard the mothership processor vessels until either (1) the salmon savings area is closed, or (2) the salmon bycatch rates are sufficiently low such that daily observer reports are no longer needed to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit established for the CVOA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

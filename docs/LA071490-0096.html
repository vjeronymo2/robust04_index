			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ARIZONA;  </P> <P> MECHAM MAY RUN AGAIN, COURT RULES  </P> <P> Evan Mecham may run for governor again this fall despite being impeached and  removed from the office in 1988, Arizona's Supreme Court ruled in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Voters, not the courts, should decide whether the former governor is worthy of  holding public office again, the high court ruled in unanimously rejecting a  challenge to Mecham's comeback bid. "Impeachment, essentially a political  process, is not subject to judicial review," the justices said. Mecham is one  of five candidates seeking the Republican nomination in the Sept. 11 primary.  </P></p>

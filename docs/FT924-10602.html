'We are using the computer and the paper back-up system so that nothing can be missed. Calls are not getting lost any more,' said Mr Webster. Nupe is still not happy about using the 'part and part' system, which has been in use since March. Mr Chris Humphreys, Nupe regional officer for London, said: 'It is by no means a secure system.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Danes head for clash with EC over treaty DENMARK appears to be on a collision course with its European Community partners by calling for Maastricht treaty changes which may make a second round of Community-wide ratification necessary next year. The scale of Maastricht amendments proposed by a majority of parties in the Danish Folketing (parliament) suggests that some renegotiation of the treaty may be required. This would directly oppose the line taken by the other 11 states after Denmark rejected the treaty in its referendum in June. The rest of the EC then decided to press ahead with the ratification process, hoping to regain Danish support for Maastricht in a second referendum next year. A first reaction to latest Danish thinking could come today when Prime Minister Poul Schluter and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, meet President Francois Mitterrand in Paris. During the last few months, support for a hard-line approach to the problem caused by the Danish No has increased in the Danish parliament. This policy is supported above all by three non-government parties, the Social Democrats (SDP), the Socialist People's party (SPP) and the Radical Liberals. Together the three have a majority of the seats in the Folketing. Spokesmen for all three parties say that special arrangements for Denmark must be built into the treaty with a legally binding character. Mr Holger Nielsen, leader of the SPP, which looks certain to play a crucial role in any Danish compromise on Maastricht, says he 'cannot imagine' a solution which will not involve a new ratification process for other member states. Mr Nielsen is pressing for changes above all in the treaty's language on defence and monetary arrangements. He also wants to slow the drive to European union in other areas such as police co-operation. Arguing that significant alterations will be needed to make the treaty palatable to the electorate, Mr Nielsen says: 'We cannot just have the same text and some candy-floss. If we just have candy-floss, the Danes will not be in favour.' 'It is difficult to see how a result can be achieved which will not require new ratification by the other states,' commented Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, European market affairs spokesman of the Radicals, after a meeting of the Folketing's market affairs committee.</p>

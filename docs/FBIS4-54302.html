			<p>BFN     [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday welcomed a  statement by a senior United States official that Washington  would consult Thailand in deciding whether or not to provide  military assistance to Phnom Penh to fight the Khmer Rouge.    "It's good that the US will also consult us," Gen Wichit  told  reporters at Government House.    He was responding to a statement made by Mr Kent Weidemenn,  US deputy assistant secretary of defence, during a visit to the  Thai- Cambodian border last Tuesday to assess the Cambodian  war's impact on Thailand.    Gen Wichit said he did not personally meet with Mr Weidemenn  and so did not have the chance to exchange views with him.  However, he was briefed on Thailand's position that military  assistance to the Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge  would only perpetuate the war in Cambodia.    He also said Mr Weidemenn's visit to the border was useful  in  providing first hand information about the impact of the  fighting inside Cambodia on Thailand.    France, Australia and the U.S. are considering a request by  the Cambodian government to provide military assistance to fight  the Khmer Rouge.</p>

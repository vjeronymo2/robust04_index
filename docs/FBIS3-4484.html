Sun said that the Taiwan businessmen were impressed by their  prospects in the Hungarian market, mainly because of the low  rate of inflation here. But he admitted that the Hungarians  were reticent to do more business because of their concerns  about the relatively high cost of Taiwan products and the time  it takes for them to be delivered, which can be up to three  months.    He said that until the Taiwan companies feel assured of the  reliability of doing business with the Hungarian importers  through Hungarian banks, the time of delivery would be a  sticking point between the two sides.    Another group of Taiwan business representatives will visit  Hungary in June, Sun said. That delegation will include Taiwan  importers as well as exporters, he stressed. In reciprocation,  Hungarian manufacturers will have a chance to sell their wares  in Taiwan when they participate in the Taipei International  Trade Fair in October.</p>

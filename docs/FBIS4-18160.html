			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geir Salvesen: "EU Clarification on Agriculture"] </F>   [Text] "All doubts have now been removed," Agriculture  Minister Oyangen said after the EU's [European Union]  clarification regarding northern agriculture.    The dispute after the remarks from the EU commissioner  responsible for agriculture, Rene Steichen, is now over -- at  least as far as the Norwegian authorities are concerned. At the  end of last week Steichen told several Norwegian newspapers that  the criteria applying to northern agriculture would only remain  in force for a transitional period. He also claimed that  support for farmers south of the 62d parallel would only apply  to farms at least 800 meters above sea level.    In its presentation of the results of the negotiations the  Agriculture Ministry, headed by Gunhild Oyangen, has given the  impression that national support for "northern agriculture" can  be provided for large areas south of the 62d parallel as long as  these are affected by special growing conditions.    Norway asked for a clarification of the EU's position after  Steichen's remarks. Yesterday evening his press spokesman  issued a short statement on the view taken of the results of the  negotiations.    The notes states, for example, that "Nordic agriculture"  will  apply to regions north of the 62d parallel. In addition "it  will be possible to include similar regions with mountainous or  hilly terrain south of this line of latitude, with a low  population density, a low agricultural profile, and where  proportion of land devoted to food growing is small" (unofficial  translation). The note also states that there is no time limit  on agricultural support for these regions. It states that  national support can be given to these regions where the EU  Commission has given the go-ahead.    Agriculture Minister Gunhild Oyangen is now interpreting  this  as a satisfactory clarification after the row surrounding  Steichen: "It clarifies what we have said are the results from  the negotiations, in a situation in which many people have  questioned more or less every aspect of this agreement. In this  respect it was a much needed clarification," she said.    But is there not still a difference in interpretation about  how far south of the 62d parallel the "northern regions" can  stretch?    "No, we do not think so. Nothing that we have heard  indicates that the EU side is working on the basis of facts  different from those we have."    But if everything is settled, why is it necessary to  continue  looking at this in further negotiations after Easter?    "We will make available more detailed information about  these  regions, and that is what we will be putting forward. We have  taken 20-30 years to develop a system of differentiated support  in Norway and in the light of this I am hoping for patience for  a few weeks more."    One sigh did, however, escape the agriculture minister: "At  some point or other we must start to look at areas for new  developments in agriculture, and not just at what subsidies  people can receive."</p>

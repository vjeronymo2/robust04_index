			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JOHS URGES USING COUNTY FOR FIRE, POLICE SERVICE;  </P> <P> OXNARD: THE COUNCILWOMAN SAYS THE FINANCIALLY BELEAGUERED CITY WOULD SAVE MONEY  BY ELIMINATING ITS OWN PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS.  </P> <P> Faced with trying to resolve Oxnard's financial problems, Councilwoman Ann Johs  said Tuesday that the city should consider eliminating its police and fire  departments and turning those services over to the county.  </P> <P> Johs said she believes that the financially beleaguered city will be able to  save a considerable amount of money by hiring the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department and Fire Protection District, as other cities have done.  </P> <P> The city, which is projecting a $2.8-million deficit in the fiscal year  beginning July 1, had hoped to raise $5 million a year with a 5% utility tax  increase on the June 5 ballot. The tax was defeated by a 3-to-1 ratio.  </P> <P> Johs' recommendation to study how much money the move would save the city was  supported by Councilwoman Geraldine (Gerry) Furr. But it sparked immediate  criticism by one council member and top city police and fire officials.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said she would be reluctant to approve a transfer of  police and fire services to the county. "It would have to be a very compelling  reason to make me want to change my mind about police services," she said.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi declined to comment until next week, when Johs is expected  to explain her proposal in detail to the council.  </P> <P> Police Chief Robert Owens said despite Oxnard's current fiscal crisis, the city  can continue to provide more police services than the county Sheriff's  Department. He added that Oxnard police officers will not be happy to hear of  Johs' proposal.  </P> <P> "Oxnard police officers are fiercely proud that they work for the city," he  said.  </P> <P> Assistant Fire Chief Ted Christensen said that a transfer of fire services to  the county may save the city money but would probably reduce the level of  service provided to Oxnard residents.  </P> <P> "Service level has to be the determining factor, not dollar value," he said.  </P> <P> The Fire Department now has an average three-minute response time to emergency  calls, he said. If the county were to take over fire services, Christensen  said, several fire stations could be closed and the response time could  increase.  </P> <P> But Johs said she recommended the study because she is worried that the city  will be forced to reduce its police and fire services to dangerously low levels  due to current financial problems. City Manager David Mora has recommended that  the city cut 64 positions -- including 16 police officers and eight  firefighters -- to help avoid a $2.8-million deficit next year.  </P> <P> Johs said she realizes that her recommendation would be criticized by police  and fire officials. "I know they are not going to be happy campers, and I'm not  a happy camper for suggesting it," she said.  </P> <P> A Sheriff's Department spokesman said he believes that Oxnard would save money  by contracting with the agency.  </P> <P> "In cities that we contract, our per capita costs are certainly lower than some  other cities," Undersheriff Larry Carpenter said.  </P> <P> When the Sheriff's Department took over police services for Fillmore about  three years ago, Carpenter said, the city saved about $250,000 from its  $1-million Police Department budget.  </P> <P> Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell said the Sheriff's Department has provided  his city more law enforcement services than the city provided at a higher cost.  </P> <P> "I'll bet you they'll save a lot of money on sheriffs," Campbell said.  </P> <P> However, Carpenter said taking over Oxnard's police services would be a  "monumental task" and could take more than six months to execute. Typically  when a city contracts with the county to take over police services, many of the  city's police personnel, including administrators, are hired by the Sheriff's  Department to continue serving the city, he said.  </P></p>

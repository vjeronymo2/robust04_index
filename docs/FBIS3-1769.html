Following the continued growth of bilateral trade and  improvement of the imbalance in trade, both sides agreed at the  meeting to make all-out efforts to promote a more balanced  development of bilateral trade.    The two sides agreed to hold the second meeting in Brussels  in June 1994 to continue discussions on some problems that still  exist in bilateral trade and economic cooperation, concerning  mainly agriculture, intellectual property and financial services.    Both sides also agreed to hold an industrial cooperation  meeting in the nonferrous metal sector, to conduct technical  discussions on alcoholic beverages, to organize a seminar on  antidumping in China, and to explore the possibility of  cooperation to ensure the safety and hygiene as well as to  conduct inspections of import and export commodities.    The Joint Committee meeting reaffirmed the implementation of  the minutes of the meeting held last year on intellectual  property and sea transportation, and reaffirmed that both sides  would continue to apply the principle of nondiscrimination.    At the meeting, the two parties also exchanged views on GATT  and the prospects of bilateral cooperation. Both sides were  satisfied with the progress made in bilateral cooperation in  various areas, and also agreed to continue bilateral cooperation  in such areas as the environment, industry and training of  Chinese experts concerning trade policy, economics, law,  management and telecommunications.    Both sides hoped to further enhance business cooperation, to  increase direct contacts between enterprises with a view to  bringing about more investment as well as other forms of  industrial and trade cooperation between the two sides.    The two parties also agreed to set up a China-Europe  international business school, and signed a memorandum at the  conclusion of the meeting.    After the meeting, Wu Yi and Brittan jointly held a news  briefing, and answered questions from reporters.    This afternoon, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing met  with Brittan and his party; and they exchanged views on issues  of common concern.</p>

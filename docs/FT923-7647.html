			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Angolan parties register The former foes in Angola's recently ended civil war are among 18 political parties registered to contest the country's first free elections next month, AP reports from Luanda. The elections result from peace accords last year that ended the 16-year war between the leftist government and the US-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). Unita and the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party are expected to be the leading contenders in the September 29-30 election.</p>

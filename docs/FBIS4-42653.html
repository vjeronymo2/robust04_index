			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the  Republic of Cyprus will ask to participate in an international  conference in Cyprus, if such a meeting is held. The spokesman  clarified that among the alternatives being discussed include  convening an international conference and the visit by  representatives of the five UN Security Council permanent  members.    The Cypriot Government welcomed the reference to the Cyprus  issue, which is contained in the final resolution of the  Nonaligned Movement foreign minister's meeting, held in Cairo.  The spokesman said the resolution contains a series of positive  points for Cyprus and noted the specific reference to UN  Security Council Resolutions 365, 541, and 550 and the request  for an international conference.    Commenting on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' statement  about signing a nonaggression pact between the two communities,  the government spokesman said this would be meaningful if a  similar treaty would also be signed between Cyprus and Turkey.  He added that the fear and danger comes from Turkey, which  holds part of Cyprus, not from the Turkish Cypriot community.</p>

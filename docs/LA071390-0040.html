			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: RAIDERS TRY THEIR HAND AT SOFTBALL IN BENEFIT GAME  </P> <P> They haven't left for Oakland or any other locale, so various members of the  Raiders will participate in a benefit softball doubleheader on Saturday on the  baseball diamond at Recreation Park off Grand Avenue in El Segundo.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the doubleheader, which starts at 10 a.m., go to the El Segundo  High athletic program.  </P> <P> Various Raider players, along with a few members of the administrative staff  and front office, will play a men's squad from the El Segundo firm of  Information International.  </P> <P> The 1 p.m. game will feature the the Raiderettes against a team of the Stick  and Stein Sports Bar, Information International and an assortment of  professional women wrestlers. Admission is $3.  </P> <P> Life's a Beach -- If you live in the South Bay, you are never far away from a  major professional volleyball tournament.  </P> <P> Last weekend, Manhattan Beach Pier was the site of a pro men's tournament. On  Saturday and Sunday, starting at 9 a.m. each day, the Women's Pro Beach  Volleyball Tour comes to the same courts for the John Shaw Open.  </P> <P> The prize money -- starting at $6,000 to the first-place team -- isn't near  what the men competed for in their event. The crowds won't be quite as large  either, making it another great opportunity to watch some of the best women  players from around the world compete in an ever-growing sport.  </P> <P> "Cycling Out" the Opponent -- It is six years since Los Angeles played host to  the Olympic Games, but one of the facilities built for the Games, the Olympic  Velodrome, is as busy as ever.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7:30, as well as every Friday through Oct. 12, about 10 bicycle  races of varying distances will be featured in the Golden State Grand Prix held  at the velodrome adjacent to the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus.  </P> <P> Many of the Olympic-caliber racers are away at a national competition this  weekend, but they do train and race at the Carson facility regularly during the  Grand Prix series.  </P> <P> Admission is $5. Information: (213) 516-4000.  </P> <P> If your preference is motorized sports racing, Ascot Park is the place to go.

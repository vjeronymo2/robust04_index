The sources revealed new details about the fighting that  took  place Monday morning in the al-Qall area near the village of  Kanoua'. An eyewitness who smuggled his report out of the  country says that before dawn on Monday a military group entered  the al-Tars [as transliterated] area near al-Qall and set up a  roadblock, halting the traffic. Cheikh 'Ali Kebir (60) happened  to by passing by with two other people in a truck driven by him.    The military group, the sources said, continued to move into  the area, and at about 1030 hrs it was ambushed in an area  called Mahafir al-Baghlah [as transliterated]. The ambush had  been set up by gunmen belonging to the Armed Islamic Movement.    The sources added that the gunmen attacked the group with  their automatic weapons, and that the elements manning the  roadblock knew about the incidents, so they killed Kebir and his  two companions.    Armed Islamist sources put the number of dead among the  security forces at 500 [as published], among them three officers  holding the rank of first lieutenant.    Furthermore, Front sources say that 'Ayn al-Na'jah military  hospital in the capital is overstreched during the month of  Ramadan, noting that the focus is on liquidating those  collaborating with the authorities, who are described as  informers by a report on military operations.

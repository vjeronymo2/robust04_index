After comparing DE MORGEN's articles  with her own records based on numerous parliamentary questions,  Senator Maes claims that the data perfectly match her  information. [passage omitted]    In her opinion, some blatant samples of hypocrisy are the  delivery of mortars to Zaire on 4 December 1991, the delivery of  guns and munition to Angola on 3 April 1991, or the export of  808 crates of kalashnikovs to Saudi Arabia on 19 July 1991.

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Pearls plucked from the CD flood - Among this year's pleasures for David Murray was a literary song-cycle by Alexander Goehr BEING IN no position to declare 'Best Records of the Year", I shall simply catalogue some happy finds. Doing even modest justice to the annual flood of CDs would be a full-time occupation in itself, let alone trying to sample everything that is released. The situation is made no easier by the big record companies' current preference for putting their money on Great Performing Names (and a handful of the most popular operas), while the smaller companies pursue exciting new artists and the under-explored stretches of the repertoire. So, first: Alexander Goehr's 1990 song-cycle Sing, Ariel, on Unicorn-Kanchana DKP (CD)9129, with Lucy Shelton's principal soprano abetted by Eileen Hulse and Sarah Leonard, and with Oliver Knussen conducting a curious little ensemble of top-class players - two strings (top and bottom), piano, tenor sax/bass clarinet and trumpet. Goehr exploits his quintet for an astonishing range of colour and weight, from intimate to declamatory. The trick of enlisting shadow-sopranos (an inspiration from Janacek's Diary?) enhances the dramatic variety further still. Characteristically, Goehr asked Sir Frank Kermode to recommend texts for this ambitious, extended cycle; characteristically again, Kermode presented him with a rich but unobvious haul from Shakespeare, Campion and Spenser to Auden, Wallace Stevens and Paul Hollander, from suggestive fragments to whole poems, grouped so as to hint at underlying themes. (Goehr has long been a conscientious academic, properly respectful of experts in other subjects.) The collaboration has had a wonderful outcome: I doubt whether any other Goehr project has answered so beautifully to his best strengths. From his stern serialist beginnings, Goehr has always yearned after the expressive potential of tonal harmony - not to retreat to Bruckner and early Schoenberg, but to tap the power of tonal functions without pretending to return to major / minor keys. Sing, Ariel at last does that with perfect assurance, and no sense of compromise. Its harmonies are translucent (the dissonance-factor is low: nothing to frighten the horses), and superbly imagined for its peculiar ensemble. The vocal line switches easily from sub rosa confessional tones to conversational ones and to public passion, and invariably it carries the words with sharp musical sense. I look forward to much closer acquaintance with this cycle, which for nearly an hour marries Goehr's fastidious musicianship to exact feeling, mature and complicated. Nothing really comparable comes to mind but David Blake's Heine cycle, From the Mattress-Grave (still gravely under-noticed). Other listeners owe it to themselves to discover Sing, Ariel; those who think their defences proof against all music in Schoenberg's wake may be disarmed and won over. Quicker notices: Michael Tilson Thomas and the LSO have recorded the fullest and best-ordered version yet of Debussy's music for Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien, d'Annunzio's deeply unhealthy 1911 theatre-piece (homoerotic, sado-masochistic), on Sony SK 48 240. With Leslie Caron as narratrix, it conveys the shape of the score and the drama as never before, while paring the spoken text to a point where non-French-speakers need not be impelled toward the fast-forward button. Le Martyre inspired Debussy's last nakedly 'lush' music - with further inspiration from Parsifal; it was a turning-point, which you need to know in order to hear his later, more astringent pieces in proper perspective. Hand on heart, I should have to say that Tilson Thomas's three attractive sopranos are less androgynously 'white' than Debussy would have expected, and that some Puccini-conductors can wring more unmanning magic from his divisi string-writing than TT does here. He captures the visionary breadth of the whole score nonetheless. Sony SK 48093 offers 'Discovered Treasures' from the Horowitz legacy: ie never-published takes from recording sessions between 1962 and 1972 when the great pianist was still in his late prime, not in his elderly, wobbly years. The 'programme' here runs from a half-dozen captivating Scarlatti sonatas through Bach-Busoni and Clementi to Medtner and Skryabin, and every part of it bears the inimitable Horowitz stamp, high-definition and huge vitality. More Medtner, the 2nd and 3rd Piano Concerti, flows magisterially from Nikolai Demidenko's fingers (Hyperion CDA66580). There is an authentic virtuoso crunch in Marc-Andre Hamelin's extraordinary performance of Alkan's monster Concerto for solo piano, too (Music &amp; Arts CD-724). The young Siberian violinist Maxim Vengerov rises to feats of the same breathtaking order, though serenely musical, in a concert-programme with Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic on Teldec 9031-73266-2.</p>

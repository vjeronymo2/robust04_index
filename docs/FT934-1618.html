			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: SCA finalises Pounds 250m UK deal SCA, a leading Swedish forestry group, said yesterday it had finalised an agreement with the South African-linked Minorco and Mondi Paper groups to build a Pounds 250m (Dollars 370m) paper machine at Aylesford in Kent in the UK. The machine will be able to produce 280,000 tons of newsprint a year, lifting the plant's total capacity to 390,000 tons a year after an existing machine has been upgraded. The raw material will be recycled paper. SCA Graphic Paper and Mondi European Holdings will each hold 50 per cent in a new company, Aylesford Newsprint, which will have a share capital of Pounds 130m and total capitalisation of around Pounds 300m. Part of the funding will come from a Pounds 20m UK government grant. Both Minorco and Mondi Paper are shareholders in Mondi European Holdings, which was formed in 1990 to invest in the European pulp, paper and packaging sector. Mondi Paper is a subsidiary of Anglo American. SCA said it expected continued growth in the European newsprint market and increased demand for paper made from recycled fibre. It says its raw material and distribution costs will be much lower near to a big population centre such as London, which is only 30 miles away from Aylesford, than if it built the same machine in Scandinavia. The Swedish group recently raised SKr1.4bn (Dollars 166m) in a rights issue to help fund the cost of its UK investment. It has been anxious to proceed with the project since it acquired Reedpack in 1990, but wanted a partner to reduce its risk.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST WHEN THE RAIDERS START TO WIN AGAIN, FANS END UP BEING LOSERS  </P> <P> I have been a season ticket-holder of the Raiders since they arrived in Los  Angeles and have been witness to all too many fights in the stands.  </P> <P> Then I read the quote from Coliseum spokeswoman Alisa Spillman, who said: "We  really don't see it like it's going to erupt into this huge rash of problems.  It was an isolated incident."  </P> <P> When will the officials at the Coliseum sober up? More security is not the  answer. They should follow the lead of the Rose bowl and ban the sale of all  alcohol, not just in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> JOSEPH W. SULZINGER, Palos Verdes  </P></p>

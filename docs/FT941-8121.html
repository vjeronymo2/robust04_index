			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bikuben returns to the black but cuts payout Bikuben, the savings bank, has cut its annual dividend to DKr5 from DKr6 a share despite moving back into profit after two years of losses. The group made a pre-tax profit of DKr193m (Dollars 28.7m) last year compared with a 1992 loss of DKr1.17bn. Financial income increased to DKr5.54bn from DKr3.67bn and costs were down to DKr2.78bn from DKr2.87bn. But after bad debt provisions, which rose to DKr2.69bn from DKr1.75bn, there was an operating loss of DKr132m against a 1992 loss of DKr1.09bn. Only extraordinary income of DK325m enabled the savings bank to report a small profit. Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive, described the result as 'not satisfactory'. Total assets increased to DKr100m from DKr95m and the group said the capital adequacy ratio was 11.1 per cent compared with the Danish minimum level of 9 per cent.</p>

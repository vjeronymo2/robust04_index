			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE AND SOUND NO MORE  </P> <P> Thank you for "Safe and Sound No More," by John Doyle (April 23). I am a mother  of a 2-year-old. My house is baby-proofed, my 6-foot wrought-iron fence around  my pool is locked, and I never let my child out of my sight in public places.  These are things I was told to look for to keep my child from harm. Now I know  from Doyle's very painful article to look for more than the obvious.  </P> <P> I'm very sorry this happened to his children -- but I am so thankful he shared  this story that other children may be spared.  </P> <P> MRS. ROBERT SCHILLER  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

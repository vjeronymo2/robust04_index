			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Post Office flotation hints prompt anger HINTS that privatisation of the Post Office as a single unit is becoming an increasingly favoured option in Whitehall have prompted angry opposition from Labour and trade unions. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday confirmed that a series of proposals for the Post Office's letter delivery, counters and parcel businesses is under consideration at the Department of Trade and Industry. The government is so far committed only to selling the parcels division. Other options include selling the letters and counters businesses separately or retaining them. But Mr Heseltine said on BBC radio: 'There would be very strong arguments put to me . . . that the Post Office should remain as a single unit.' He said discussions were at a preliminary stage. 'I have not got papers in front of me that I could put to my colleagues,' he added. 'They have therefore not been consulted or involved.' Downing Street confirmed there was no timetable for considering the issue at cabinet level and that decisions were 'some way off'. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'Mr Heseltine is contemplating selling off more than 150 years of a universal letters service to pay for five weeks' worth of his government's debt. 'I would have thought this government was in sufficient difficulty over the pit closure programme and British Rail to get into another bruising confrontation with the public over privatisation of the Post Office.' Mr Alan Johnson, general-secretary-designate of the Union of Communication Workers, said there was no public mandate for privatising the Post Office. 'Politicians who are embroiled in the difficulties caused by the coal fiasco and rail privatisation would be sensible to avoid tampering with a popular, successful service which has been publicly owned for over 350 years,' he said. 'Selling off a public asset may raise a quick buck, but at the expense of a postal service widely acknowledged to be the best in the world.' The Treasury will push strongly for the maximum revenue to be raised from the sale, and so might favour the Post Office being sold in one piece. The Post Office has been profitable without subsidy for 16 years, and last year made a net profit of Pounds 152m on turnover of Pounds 5.1bn. A conventional share flotation could raise Pounds 2bn. Mr Heseltine said he would have to take into account the extent to which the Post Office's employees could have greater involvement, and the need for competition and value for money. He reaffirmed his commitment to a nationwide delivery service and a uniform affordable price structure. The Post Office's management has stayed out of the argument over privatisation, saying only that Royal Mail should stay in one piece. It is thought to favour privatisation on the grounds that it would gain access to outside finance for expansion. Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen, in whose name the Royal Mail operates, had been advised of the options under review by the government. It indicated that she would not attempt to block any sell-off. The Queen acts on the advice of her ministers, an official said.</p>

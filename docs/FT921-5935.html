			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Ucatt unveils survival package UCATT, the construction union, yesterday unveiled a package of organisational changes and a recruitment drive in an attempt to remain an independent union, Catherine Milton writes. The survival package, which the union's officials are considering at a conference this weekend, includes a move to appoint officials instead of electing them. If the change is approved the only large union left electing officers will be the AEU engineering workers' organisation. In the past year Ucatt has been dogged by allegations of ballot-rigging. Mr Albert Williams, the union's former general secretary, was suspended and reinstated and finally took early retirement. About a dozen officials have resigned. Mr George Brumwell, who became general secretary last week, said: 'We have survived this onslaught and I am confident that Ucatt can now begin to grow again.' Mr Brumwell said he aimed to keep the union independent, but did not rule out a merger as long as it was dictated by industrial logic rather than political or financial expediency. Ucatt has been been badly affected by the loss of construction workers' jobs in the recession. It has run a deficit for several years and believes the deficit for last year will be about Pounds 1.2m. The union's membership has fallen from 240,000 to 203,000 during the recession. Most officials are elected by local branches. The union said this gives a small number of branch secretaries disproportionate influence and the system is open to abuse.</p>

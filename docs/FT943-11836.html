			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: The task for Mr Berlusconi If it is true that revolutions devour their children, then Italy could be preparing for a rather indigestible feast. In elections four months ago, Mr Silvio Berlusconi gained the prime ministership at the helm of his Forza Italia movement with a mandate that included cleaning up corruption. Following signs this week that Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company may have been involved in malpractice, doubts are increasing whether he has the ability or will to achieve this mandate. With some justification, Mr Berlusconi has been seeking to accelerate the wearisome judicial process affecting politicians, functionaries and business executives implicated in corruption inquiries. Some people detained on suspicion of bribery during the last two years have undoubtedly suffered from miscarriages of justice. Earlier this month, Mr Berlusconi introduced a decree limiting magistrates' powers of arrest in corruption cases, but quickly withdrew it after a public outcry. Accelerating the judicial process - and limiting abuses of judicial power - may well be desirable. The problem is that Mr Berlusconi cannot be regarded as impartial. In his two months in office, for example, he has shown insufficient readiness to resolve the basic conflict of interest caused by Fininvest's dominant media position. The admission this week by lawyers acting for a Fininvest executive that the company paid bribes to the country's financial police has further damaged Mr Berlusconi's credibility. More urgently than ever, Mr Berlusconi must now separate his interests as a businessman from his duties and responsibilities as Italy's prime minister. Ideally, he would make a clear-cut public statement detailing any past Fininvest impropriety, combined with a firm commitment to divest his holding. Without such action, any government attempts to influence the bribery investigations, for instance by bringing in milder treatment for less severe misdemeanours, would increase suspicion that the prime minister is simply protecting his business interests. Further, the fall-out of the corruption dispute risks undermining the broader programme for Italian renewal. Sharp divisions in Mr Berlusconi's coalition are lowering the chances of implementing the rigorous budget the country needs. Additionally, political uncertainty has damped prospects for further privatisation, a pivotal part of economic reform. If Forza Italia's popularity starts seriously to wane, the Northern League, Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partner, could grow bolder in underlining its own anti-corruption credentials, perhaps to the extent of bringing down the government. Early elections would do little to increase the chances of stability, and might bring fresh political fragmentation. Mr Berlusconi was elected in part to remove the conditions under which corruption and malpractice flourished in the past. Unless he puts himself above suspicion, his chance to perform that task will soon slip away.</p>

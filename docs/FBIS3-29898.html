Commenting on the President's remarks at a  news conference on 18 February after a cabinet session, Hiroshi  Kumagai, minister of the international trade and industry, said:  "American negotiators have often criticized the Japanese  bureaucracy at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but  their criticism stems from misunderstanding. Japan's huge trade  surplus with the United States has long continued unabated. We  have to understand the President's irritation and to work to  reduce Japan's current account surplus."    At the news conference, the minister also said: "We do not  mean that Japan cannot reduce its trade surplus with the United  States and Japan should work to do voluntarily what it can do  for the reduction of its trade surplus. I am convinced that the  private sector is thinking of measures to reduce it." In this  way, Minister Kumagai stressed the need for the private sector  to make its own independent effort to break the current impasse  in the Japan-U.S. relations.</p>

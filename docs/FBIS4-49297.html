Statistics reveal that the volume of business transactions  at  the city's technology market amounted to 1.088 billion yuan over  the past three years.    According to local officials, large and medium-sized  enterprises of the city have become the main clients of the  technology market.    For instance, last year these enterprises took 61.4 percent  of the city's total technology transactions, said the officials.

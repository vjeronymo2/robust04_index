It called on the  international community to pressure Israel to immediately  implement the clauses of the resolution and provide  international protection for the Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem.    The Arab League Council called on the two cosponsors of the  peace conference to shoulder their responsibilities to guarantee  the safety of the Palestinian people and their property in the  occupied territories and to prevent recurrence of the criminal  acts committed by Jewish settlers and conspirators. The Arab  League Council's 101st session hailed the Palestinian people's  steadfastness under the occupation and their insistence on  obtaining their freedom and continuing their steadfastness until  the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from all the occupied  Arab and Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem. The  statement noted that the Arab League Council heard numerous  statements and speeches regarding the ugly crime committed in  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron by Israeli settlers in  suspicious collusion with Israeli Army units.</p>

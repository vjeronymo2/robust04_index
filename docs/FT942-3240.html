			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Benign CPI data bolster Dow rally Wall Street US shares rallied yesterday on economic news which suggested that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to tighten monetary policy again in the next few weeks, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.71 higher at 3,814.83, its first close above 3,800 since March 24. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.27 ahead at 462.37. New York SE volume came to 288.5m shares and advances outpaced falls by 1,269 to 820. The American SE composite gained 1.46 at 442.65 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.28 at 735.98. The catalyst for the morning's sharp upturn was the May consumer price index, released by the Labor Department just before the markets opened. The CPI showed a benign 0.2 per cent increase for the month, or a 2.5 per cent gain on an annualised basis. When the volatile food and energy sectors were excluded, consumer prices were up 0.3 per cent. Both figures matched the consensus forecasts of economists, relieving anxieties over a potential sell-off in bonds. In the event, Treasuries posted moderate gains, as news of a 0.2 per cent slide in May retail sales reinforced the conviction that the economy was not overheating. Still, the gains made in the equity markets overshadowed the progress made by bonds during the morning, as stocks continued to assert a measure of independence. Equity investors viewed the morning's news as favourable because it increased the odds that the Fed would wait until the end of the summer before lifting rates again. Such a scenario was particularly supportive for stocks most vulnerable to a slowing economy. The same group was in the vanguard of Monday's rally. Caterpillar, which had led the Dow industrials during the winter, showed fresh signs of vigour, jumping Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 109 3/8 . United Technologies rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Allied Signal advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37 5/8 . The Big Three car makers also powered ahead on the favourable fundamentals. In telecommunications, Sprint dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 after announcing that France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had agreed to take a 20 per cent stake in the company. Analysts said possible regulatory obstacles to the deal may have scared away investors. In addition, there was some concern over the dilutive impact of Sprint's proposed issue of 85m new shares under terms of the agreement. Exxon continued to feel the repercussions of Monday's court ruling which may allow plaintiffs to pursue an estimated Dollars 15bn in punitive claims for damages arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Analysts were divided in their recommendations following the decision. AG Edwards lowered its rating on the issue from buy to hold, but Prudential Securities urged its clients to add to their holdings. In the cross-current, Exxon slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 and led the NYSE's most active list on volume of 4.9m shares. Canada Toronto stocks closed lower as the 'Quebec malaise' continued to hound equities. Analysts said mounting uncertainty over the future of the French-speaking province is pushing Toronto shares into a downward spiral. In contrast to Wall Street buoyancy, the TSE 300 index ended 8.2 lower at 4,198.6 and falls led rises by 394 to 351 after volume of 56.2m shares. Eight of the 14 stock groups showed increases, however, led by golds, up 1.39 per cent. Mining and banking fell 1.34 and 1.91 per cent respectively. Mexico Equities finished slightly firmer after a roller coaster session, with investors still showing signs of nerves. The market had tumbled 4 per cent on Monday following the rejection by the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas at the weekend of the latest peace initiative. The IPC index was finally ahead 9.8 points yesterday at 2,300.9 and volume was a moderate 1.18bn new pesos on 107.7m shares traded. Brazil Sao Paulo saw high volume ahead of today's futures index settlement; equities closed 2.4 per cent up in local currency terms after a 4 per cent gain seen around noon. The Bovespa index was up a net 704 points at 30,173. Traders said turnover was unusually large at Cr447bn due to a high volume of option deals.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER'S CONVICTIONS LED HIM TO BECOME PUBLIC DEFENDER;  </P> <P> THE LAW: KENNETH I. CLAYMAN'S OFFICE DEFENDS POOR CLIENTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS. HE CLAIMS INSPIRATION FROM TELEVISION'S PERRY MASON.  </P> <P> In the 1940s, Kenneth I. Clayman was a skinny, argumentative kid, the son of  Russian immigrant grocers in New Rochelle, N.Y. By 1949, Clayman and his  parents had moved to San Diego to operate an egg ranch and to ease his father's  asthma.  </P> <P> And as Clayman got older and more argumentative, his friends began picking on  him.  </P> <P> "I was . . . a little on the obnoxious side," said Clayman, 48. "They'd say,  'Why don't you become a lawyer?' "  </P> <P> Maybe it was that wiseacre suggestion. Maybe it was all the teasing he took for  his beanpole frame, which eventually grew to 6 feet, 5 inches. Maybe it was all  those episodes of "Perry Mason" he watched on television.  </P> <P> But something drove Clayman to become a criminal defense lawyer. And something  made him take one of the most difficult, low-paying jobs a lawyer can have --  deputy public defender in Los Angeles -- and eventually take what may be one of  the toughest jobs for a defense lawyer in California -- public defender in  Ventura County -- where prosecutors last year won 82% of jury trials and 87% of  trials before judges.  </P> <P> Now Clayman oversees 37 lawyers, who represent poor clients charged in simple  traffic offenses to complex murder cases. During six years in the post, he has  earned respect as a diplomatic administrator and staunch defender of  constitutional rights.  </P> <P> "Defending criminals is not the most popular thing in Ventura County, and it's  a difficult job to begin with -- it's kind of like being Scrooge at  Christmastime," said Supervisor James Dougherty. "Everybody wants to put the  bad guys in jail, and he's doing his best to make sure their constitutional  rights are protected. Not everybody appreciates that."  </P> <P> Public defenders are unpopular because "they have to stand up for the underdog,  who many times is a somewhat unpopular if not despicable individual," said Mark  S. Borrell, president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Bar Assn.  </P> <P> And by all accounts, Clayman's deputies must handle a bigger caseload and work  under far more pressure than their predecessors did under former Public  Defender Richard Erwin.  </P> <P> Defense attorney George C. Eskin has watched the public defender's office  operate under both administrators. Eskin, who has served as assistant district  attorney in Santa Barbara County and chief assistant city attorney in Los  Angeles, was an assistant to Ventura County Dist. Atty. Woodruff Deem from 1967  to 1970, while Erwin was public defender.  </P> <P> Eskin praised both men as hard-working, competent public defenders, but he said  Clayman and his deputies must work much harder.  </P> <P> He noted that Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's policy against plea bargaining,  instituted soon after he took office in 1978, has forced the public defender to  take more cases to trial. While defendants often are able to negotiate guilty  pleas to lesser charges in Los Angeles County courts, Eskin said, defendants in  Ventura County often have two choices: plead guilty as charged or go to trial.  </P> <P> Clayman said that 5% to 7% of criminal cases go to trial in California, but 12%  to 15% go to trial in Ventura County.  </P> <P> But sometimes a client is best served by pleading guilty, Clayman said. "The  judges like to demonstrate . . . that if you go to trial and lose, you're going  to do worse than if you plead," he said.  </P> <P> No records are kept on the success rate of the public defender's office. But to  Clayman, victory comes when one of his deputies is able to persuade a jury to  convict a client of a lesser charge. He cited the case of Peter Michael Bergne,  who was convicted of second-degree murder and acquitted of first-degree murder  and rape in the strangulation death of Linda Anderson.  </P> <P> And sometimes the public defender's office wins a trial, as in the 1989 case of  a Vietnamese client in his 50s who was defended by Deputy Public Defender  Alison Ayers. The man's car failed to stop at a stop sign and plowed into  another driver, killing him. Ayers said her investigators were able to prove  that the car's brakes failed and win an acquittal on a vehicular manslaughter  charge.  </P> <P> Clayman graduated from UCLA Law School in 1966 and worked 11 months on medical  malpractice cases at the Los Angeles law firm of Leo Gelfand after passing the  bar exam in 1967. But yearning to handle trials, he applied for a job in the  Los Angeles County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "That night when I went home, I couldn't sleep all night," Clayman said. "I  realized I could not be a D.A. My heart was on the other side of the rules of  evidence, of illegal search and seizure."  </P> <P> So he joined the public defender's office in Los Angeles, where "training was  anathema," Clayman said. "The only way we got training was they'd throw us into  the fire."  </P> <P> Clayman's former colleagues remember him as affable, hard-working, and a little  tentative:  </P> <P> "I think he was like all lawyers," said Charles R. English, now a Santa Monica  defense attorney. "When you start, you second-guess all your decisions, and I  think the biggest thing that's matured in Ken over 20 years is he's more  comfortable in his decisions."  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, a troublesome client made Clayman realize why he chose to be  a public defender.  </P> <P> "To say he gave me grief is an understatement," Clayman said. The man was  "spitting on me, grabbing my tie and trying to choke me out. He cursed me with  every word in the book, he ran out on me, he tried to fire me constantly. You  know, that thing that everybody says: 'I don't want a public defender, I want a  real lawyer.'  </P> <P> "All of a sudden I realized . . . that this was exactly the kind of client who  needed me most."  </P> <P> And Clayman remembers visiting the defendant in jail every Saturday morning  until he finally earned the man's trust and cooperation.  </P> <P> Clayman rose through the ranks in the public defender's office in Los Angeles,  spending nine years defending juveniles. In 1975, he became assistant chief of  the juvenile division, then chief in 1977. In 1981, he was appointed chief of  the misdemeanor division.  </P> <P> Then, in 1984, Ventura County supervisors Dougherty and Susan K. Lacey  nominated Clayman from among dozens of candidates to become public defender, a  job that now pays $94,260 a year.  </P> <P> Clayman had to fill a huge pair of shoes. Erwin, Ventura County's first public  defender, had held the post since 1966. Erwin was both respected and criticized  by the district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "Dick Erwin was a flamboyant semi-showman . . . charismatic to the point of  using the country boy image a lot to cover up the fine legal mind that he had,"  Sheriff John V. Gillespie said. Erwin "had a reputation for getting in the  district attorney's face," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> "Ken Clayman is more of the kind of person who can work things out in  negotiation," Gillespie said.  </P> <P> Bradbury remembers Erwin as a friend, but "kind of bombastic." The two often  quarreled publicly.  </P> <P> Clayman airs his differences quietly in closed-door meetings and has "brought  the office into the 20th Century," Bradbury said. Under Clayman, deputy public  defenders have become more professional and are better trained, making the  public defender's office "a much more formidable opponent in court," Bradbury  said.  </P> <P> Erwin "basically defined what the public defender was," said Lacey. "So when  the choice came and we were able to review the three finalists, we needed an  extremely strong person who could walk in and realize he or she was following a  legend, and yet create a climate he could work in."  </P> <P> While most officials admire Clayman's personal style, many do not always see  eye-to-eye with him.  </P> <P> Gillespie said he disagreed with Clayman's proposal to tighten rules governing  conference rooms in the main jail after a sheriff's deputy overheard a  conversation in April between a public defender and murder suspect Gregory  Scott Smith.  </P> <P> "I sometimes think the defendants are overly defended," Gillespie said. "I  would much prefer over-prosecution, but that's typical cop talk."  </P> <P> Bradbury observed that he and Clayman have a similar philosophy -- that their  deputies should be tough. "We're here to see that justice is done, and it takes  both of us to do that."  </P> <P> But Clayman has a ready sense of humor, particularly about the work to which  the Perry Mason character helped drive him years ago. "I'm still waiting, after  23 years in the practice, for somebody to stand up in the back of the room and  say, 'I did it!' "  </P></p>

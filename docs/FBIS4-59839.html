			<p>BFN     [Text] A report from Mazar-e Sharif says that a foreign  country provides military supplies to Dostam's militias.  Recently, 20 passenger aircraft delivered Kalashnikov  ammunition and RPG-type missiles to Mazar-e Sharif airport.  Sources close to militias say that Dostam-Golboddin's militias  faced a shortages of arms and ammunition in the recent fighting,  and that is why they are supplied from abroad. At the present,  mojahedin of Balkh Province have the airport of Mazar-e Sharif  under the pressure by heavy weapons in order to prevent the  airport being used as a means for the continuation of  foreigners' military interference.    Also, the security officials say that a system that was  guiding the aircraft was fired at by the air forces of the  Islamic Army in the heights of Pul-e Khomri and was destroyed.  The destruction of this system fully paralyzes the militias air  power. Recently, militias had used training aircraft instead of  fighter planes, and with the destruction of this system they  have now been deprived of this as well.</p>

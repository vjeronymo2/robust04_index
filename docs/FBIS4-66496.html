			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahim Qawsini: "Visions on Future of </F> Press Freedom Under Coming Palestinian Authority"]    [Text] What is the future of press freedom in the coming  phase when Palestinians take over the reigns of government?    Is there fear that the move will be from the Israeli  military  censor to a Palestinian censor controlling our domestic press?    These are notions and questions that occur to the mind of  the  occupied territories' press workers who hope that the coming  phase will be a phase of openness and free expression that  compensates Palestinians for the deprivation they have endured  in the preceding phase. Here, I will record the visions and  expectations of a number of specialists and workers in the  Palestinian press.    Journalist Majid 'Aruri, from Sanabil Press Bureau in  Ramallah, believes that the Palestinian press has been  restricted, even before the arrival of autonomy. In addition to  the Israeli military censor's control, Palestinian organizations  have experienced control over most of the press publications  issued in the occupied territories. The Palestinian journalist  has not been able to offer press analyses and reports  conflicting with the tendencies of the existing political  organizations. The other papers (AL-QUDS and AL-NAHAR) have been  characterized by their neutral presentation, which imposes  restrictions on any critical press material, especially material  addressed to the official circles. Despite the liberalism it has  displayed in the past two years, AL-NAHAR does not allow any  articles it publishes to criticize Jordan.    Therefore, any paper controlled by the party that finances  it  during the occupation era will continue to experience the same  problem under the autonomous authority, which will also take  control of censorship and of issuing permits to publish papers.  Thus, autonomy will employ its authority to prevent the  emergence of any voices that criticize autonomy. This task will  be easy in the absence of a press union body capable of  confronting this policy. The union body (i.e., the Journalists  League) is controlled and dominated by the tendency supporting  self-rule, even though it incorporates other parties. However,  these parties' role is ineffective and not influential.    Journalist 'Ali Jiddah from AL-QUDS newspaper has said:    "Very regrettably, I say that in the coming phase, the  Palestinian press will not be in a better condition than its  current condition, not to say that it will be in a more  difficult condition. I say this by virtue of my full awareness  of the Palestinian forces' miserable history of democratic  action. Moreover, the coming government will focus its efforts  on cementing and entrenching the mainstays of its rule, which  necessarily means that it will try to curb the voice and echo of  the forces that are likely to pose a threat to this government  and to its authority.    "I assert that this is what will happen in the future,  especially since the statements of some Palestinian officials  point in this direction. I will particularly note Hakam  Bal'awi's statements on how the opposition will be dealt with in  the future."    Dr. 'Abd-al-Sattar Qasim, from the Political Science Section  of al-Najah University, has said:    "Future press freedom is tied to the Gaza-Jericho accord,  i.e., it is tied to the degree of freedom permitted by the  accord. Freedom is restricted by the provisions of the accord.  For example, it isn't permissible to incite against Israel. The  Palestinian government will have to respect this tendency. Else,  it will violate the accord.    "Therefore, there will be a Palestinian censor. If one  doesn't exist, Israel will insist on his presence, keeping in  mind that a Palestinian censor is operating now while the  occupation exercises its own censorship. So, how will the  situation be in case a government overseeing daily life is  established!"    Journalist Hani al-'Isawi from Jerusalem has said:    "I don't believe that there will be an independent  Palestinian government if the accord is implemented. What will  be there is a civil administration controlled by the occupation.  At best, it will be the authority of one individual who  establishes laws compatible with his interests and plans. This  is why one cannot talk about any form of freedom under the  canopy of a self-rule like the rule projected currently.    "I believe that the current military censor watches press  material from the security angle. But if there is press under  self-rule, it will be a yellow press, i.e., government press  solely. It is feared that whoever violates this [rule] will be  pursued. Therefore, there will be no need for a special press  censor, because all agencies under autonomy will be in the  service of government propaganda solely."    Journalist Ghazi Bani 'Awdah has said:    "I don't believe that press conditions under the self-rule  government will be fundamentally different from the current  conditions. All signs indicate in one way or another that  oppression and persecution will be the lot of any voice or pen  that writes about real issues and that doesn't sing the praises  of autonomy and doesn't applaud the cardboard feats and  accomplishments of the coming leadership. Let us learn a lesson  from the recent expulsion of Hijazi, a journalist, from FILASTIN  AL-THAWRAH and from numerous other incidents.    "As for censorship, there is no doubt that the coming  Palestinian authority's censor will `capably' replace the  Israeli censor, even though materials affected by this `censor's  scissors' will be different at times from materials affected  under the occupation."    Journalist Amin Abu-Wardah from AL-QUDS PRESS AGENCY  believes  that "the Palestinian people's hardship in all fields dictates  that any authority that takes control of the reigns avoid  whatever can touch the wounds of all Palestinian people and  whatever undermines the sanctity of the individual who has taken  part in the ceaseless struggle to attain his rights and who has  made great sacrifices for these rights.    "This is why I expect, optimistically, great openness in the  press. But there is a founded fear of the future because of the  numerous experiences of the Arab world where authoritarianism  prevails despite all the raised slogans that have been proved to  be a failure by reality. However, it is my hope that the  Palestinian experiment will be distinguished by giving the  opportunity to everybody to express his positions and opinions  democratically."</p>

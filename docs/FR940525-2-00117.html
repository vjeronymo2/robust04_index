			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP, on an interim basis, will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the stored spent fuel since the existing thermal-hydraulic analysis confirms that sufficient cooling capability exists to accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies in the Unit 1 SFP. As for fuel criticality, the existing analysis also confirms that the stored fuel assemblies will remain sub-critical under normal and abnormal conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the SFP structure or SFP liner. The existing structural analysis confirms that the SFP structure has adequate margin to prevent overstressing and meets the code requirements. Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the spent fuel storage racks during design basis events based on the existing seismic/structural analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the on-site spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the FPCC system. The FPCC system will continue to function as designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The probability of a malfunction of fuel handling equipment will not be increased since increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP, as proposed, does not affect fuel handling equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity does not increase the consequences of a spent fuel assembly failure since the failure of one (1) assembly will not result in additional spent fuel assembly failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of spent fuel storage rack failure, since the existing racks have been designed/qualified to limit the consequences of a failure. A failure of, or damage to one (1) storage rack, will not result in failure or damage to another storage rack.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of the failure of fuel handling equipment since the maximum expected number of fuel rods damaged by a fuel handling equipment failure remains as evaluated in the LGS UFSAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the LGS Unit 1 SFP to permit an interim increase from 2040 fuel assemblies to 2500 fuel assemblies will not create the possibility of an accident of a different type. The Unit 1 SFP has been analyzed for criticality effects, structural effects, radiological effects, and thermal-hydraulic effects. The increase in spent fuel storage capacity will be achieved by relocating six (6) existing spent fuel storage racks from the Unit 2 SFP to the Unit 1 SFP. The spent fuel storage racks are of identical design and are passive components; therefore, the possibility of creating a new accident does not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No new operating schemes or active equipment types will be required to store additional fuel bundles in the SFP. Therefore, the possibility of a different type of malfunction occurring is not created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

But a North Korean Foreign Ministry official accused the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of 'wanton encroachment' on the North's sovereignty. The spokesman was quoted as saying a resolution passed by 72 IAEA member nations last Friday calling on Pyongyang to open up its suspect atomic sites for inspection was 'an offspring of a political plot' aimed at impeding any negotiated solution.</p>

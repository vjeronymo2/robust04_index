			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going out to dinner / New York Deciding what to wear for dinner at a friend's home does not trouble most New Yorkers. This is because eating out in the city almost always means eating out at a restaurant - there are approximately 25,000 to choose from (more per head than anywhere in the world), and Manhattan apartments are famous for their tiny kitchens. Dinner parties are as rare as a yellow cab in a Fifth Avenue rainstorm. Power eating, while not what it was in the 1980s, is still alive and well in New York, so power dressing should not be far behind. Well, not exactly, because when it comes to dining out, New Yorkers choose their restaurants more carefully than they choose their clothes. Whether you are eating at Daniel Boulud's new Upper East Side restaurant, at Bouley in Tribeca, or upstairs at Cafe Tabac with Barry Diller and Jack Nicholson, what you are wearing is not so important as where you are seen wearing it. Thus, while eating out at New York's best restaurants can still be one of life's more glamorous experiences, New Yorkers do not generally make too much of what they wear to dinner. People just want to be fashionable, and comfortable. For women, sophisticated but simply-cut fashions from Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Jill Sander are popular, with Comme des Garcons, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Giorgo Armani favoured by the younger crowd. Flares, like the city's cockroaches, are unfortunately everywhere. Three colours dominate - black, black and black. Men are more conservative when it comes to dinner wear, and prefer the suits or jacket-and-trousers combinations they would wear to the office. The styling, however, can be funkier and looser. Only a handful of restaurants still insist men wear ties, so tieless buttoned-up shirts under a sharp sports jacket are common, especially among pony-tailed ad executives. The most New York of styles for dining out, however, remains what can only be described as the 'contrarian' look. Contrarian dressing allows you to wear a Dollars 3,000 Armani suit when dining at a cramped downtown bistro, and jeans and leather jacket when eating out at a swanky uptown restaurant. The idea behind it is simple - you stand out from the crowd, but still look great.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Demirel prospers as Kurdish rebels fall out: A look at the alternatives for Ankara as the threat from guerrillas weakens MR Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, was careful not to reject it out of hand, but many Turks privately dismiss last week's ceasefire declaration by Apo Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the rebel Kurdish Workers party (PKK), as yet another ploy to gain time. There is, however, an important difference from earlier ceasefire offers, beyond the fact that Mr Ocalan wore a suit and tie for the first time anyone can remember. Unlike other occasions, Turkey has a chance to offer reforms for its 10m-strong Kurdish minority without being accused of caving in to extremism. Both on the military front and to some extent with western opinion, the perception from Ankara is that the tide is fast turning in Turkey's favour at the expense of the PKK. The generals will no doubt be counselling the prime minister to press home the military advantage. The alternative course is to push on with far-reaching legal and cultural reforms, which western diplomats believe is the only way to win over moderate Kurdish opinion and resolve the problem. Mr Demirel appears in no mood to enter negotiations with the PKK or even the Kurdish deputies in the Turkish parliament. It will be particularly difficult to convince his hardline colleagues of the need for magnanimity. Nonetheless, there is clear relief that this weekend's Kurdish new year celebrations passed off relatively peacefully, unlike last year, when more than 90 people died after government forces used tanks and armoured personnel carriers to reassert control in a string of towns on Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria. Since that crisis, the Turks have fast improved their counter-insurgency tactics against a weakly armed and inexperienced guerrilla force. The purchase of US Black Hawk helicopters has provided a new, fast reaction capability. Turkey's army, while mostly made up of conscripts, has officers with a wealth of experience, many of them having spent all their professional lives fighting the PKK. The security forces have played on divisions in the Kurdish community already strained by the revival of an earlier wave of bloody rivalry between hardline Kurdish Islamic groups. All of this has served further to weaken the PKK's support among the people. Diplomatically, the Turks have made important gains. For all his wife's campaigning for the Kurdish cause, French President Francois Mitterrand has openly declared his opposition to the PKK's methods and aspirations for a separate state. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, made much the same pronouncement. Even some of Germany's politicians, despite the attractions of the Kurdish cause as a domestic issue, have moved to condemn the PKK as a terrorist force. The PKK's ability to sustain the conflict has long depended on being able to to infiltrate trained fighters across Turkey's borders. Today the PKK's Syrian backers, increasingly isolated since the end of the cold war and the withdrawal of Soviet patronage, are keen to improve ties with Ankara. Iran too seems less inclined to foment the crisis. The real test came in tacit co-operation with Iraq's Kurdish peshmerga rebels, whose increasingly close ties with Ankara reflect an anxiety not to alienate the Turks, who control the vital aid lifeline and provide air bases for the allied air umbrella. The PKK was forced from its bases in northern Iraq; even now the peshmerga leadership is still reluctant to elaborate on its role in this. In the wake of the Gulf war, Turkey's western allies were rarely comfortable explaining to their public why they condoned Ankara's heavy-handed repression of its own Kurdish minority while the west offered support to the Kurds in Iraq. Diplomats now say that, more than any other issue, the sight of Kurds fighting Kurds has served to change the way that western public opinion views the Kurdish cause.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the President of the Republic of Latvia </F> Guntis Ulmanis"]    [Text] On April 6 of this year, I received an ITAR-TASS  report that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has agreed to a  Russian Ministry of Defence proposal to establish Russian  military bases on Latvian territory. The report states that the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Russian  Ministry of Defence and other ministries, is to begin  negotiations on this issue and to draft the appropriate  agreements.    The obviously contradicts the agreements initialed by the  government delegations of both states, and raised doubts about  the true intentions of the Russian Government delegation in the  process of drafting the agreements. This statement caused  justified concern for the planned meeting between the presidents  of Latvian and Russia and the development of potential political  dialogue. It does not assure domestic and foreign political  stability, and diminishes trust in Russia as a partner state in  agreements. The building of Russian military bases on Latvian  territory would be a real threat to Latvian sovereignty and  security and would destabilize not only the Baltic region, but  also Western Europe.    Over the last few hours, I have repeatedly attempted to  contact the commander-in-chief of the Russian North-West  Military Group General Mayorov and President Yeltsin's  administration in order to obtain an explanation. As yet, I  have not received an answer, which points to deliberate evasion  from providing an explanation.    Latvia will never allow the building of a Russian military  base on its territory.    [Signed] Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic of  Latvia.</p>

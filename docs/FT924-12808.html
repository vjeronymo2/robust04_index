			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Costain to dispose of Australian coal offshoot COSTAIN, the troubled UK construction group, is expected to announce details in the next few days of the sale of its profitable Australian coalmining subsidiary. Favourite to acquire the business is Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson Group. Costain is expected to raise Pounds 120m-Pounds 130m from the sale, after taking into account the transfer of some Pounds 40m worth of local debt owned by the Australian subsidiary. Costain needs the cash to reduce net debt of Pounds 292m, including Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet loans due on the Spitalfields commercial property joint venture in central London. Total debt represents gearing of more than 100 per cent based on shareholders' funds of Pounds 276m at the end of last year. The sale is expected to reduce gearing to between 50 and 70 per cent depending upon how the deal is structured and what further property provisions the group decides to make at the end of this year. Costain, which has been hit hard by the collapse of UK residential and commercial property markets, incurred a Pounds 69.2m pre-tax loss last year. It has already sold its UK commercial property portfolio for Pounds 101m in a bid to reduce borrowings. Originally it had planned to retain 51 per cent of the Australian coal mining business, after floating the company. It has now decided to sell the whole subsidiary. Peabody became part of Hanson when the conglomerate acquired Consolidated Goldfields at the end of the 1980s. The attraction of Costain's coal mines in New South Wales are their long term supply contracts with local electricity generators.</p>

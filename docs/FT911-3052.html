			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Rental and service side bolster Xerox A STEADY stream of rental and service fees has sheltered Xerox from the recession's impact on sales of its more expensive copying and duplicating products. The Connecticut-based company yesterday reported virtually unchanged first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 106m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, compared with Dollars 113m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. The 1990 figures exclude a Dollars 367m loss on discontinued financing and real estate businesses. Total revenues were virtually unchanged at Dollars 4.2bn, but masked significant differences among individual businesses. Lower sales of electronic typewriters and large copiers were offset by a modest rise in demand for less expensive duplicators and copiers, and fax machines. Profits from document processing matched last year's levels, thanks mainly to growth in income from services, rentals, supplies and financing of equipment. Xerox said it has a good response to its new DocuTech product line, launched last October, which combines several different functions in a single high-speed machine. It noted that all 28 customers who tested the equipment have ordered permanent installations, and some have placed further orders. Mr David Nelson, analyst at Shearson Lehman, predicted DocuTech shipments will further boost Xerox's sales later this year. He noted demand for office copiers had been relatively unscathed by the recession as the volume of copying keeps on rising, while the cost of lower-end machines had fallen to the point where they were no longer a major capital investment. Xerox's financial services business, which includes the insurance group Crum and Forster, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m, despite a 9 per cent fall in revenues to just over Dollars 1bn. The company said improved insurance underwriting income, helped by an 'aggressive' effort to withdraw from unprofitable business, offset lower pre-tax capital gains.</p>

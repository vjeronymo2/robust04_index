			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Law lord urges cheaper justice CHEAPER access to justice and a bill of rights to prevent governments nibbling away at individual freedoms were called for yesterday by Lord Woolf. Speaking for the first time since he prompted controversy by attacking government policies to get tough on crime as short-sighted and irresponsible, the law lord said he believed British justice was basically sound. Lord Woolf, who carried out the official inquiry into prison riots in the early 1980s, warned there were dangers in justice being too expensive. A system of justice was fatally flawed if private citizens and the corporate sector could not afford to invoke it, he said in a lecture to the Association of Jewish Ex-Service Men and Women. Pointing out that this year's bill for legal aid would approach Pounds 1.3bn, he said efforts should be made to make justice available at an affordable price within existing resources.</p>

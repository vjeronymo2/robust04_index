			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 27 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  coalition parties intend to submit amendments to the election  law and the law on the conflict of interests to the May  parliamentary session, Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told  journalists after a meeting of the Coalition Council of the  governing parties today. The Coalition Council is to discuss  these questions in detail at the beginning of next week, he said.    The coalition should take stand on two proposed changes in  the election law. One concerns the proposal to increase the  number of candidates on each party's slate from forty to fifty  to ensure a sufficient number of substitutes are available when  deputies get appointed to the cabinet suspended [as received]  and when the as yet non-existent law on the conflict of  interests is implemented.    It is well known that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar has found itself in such a  situation in parliament that if the law on the conflict of  interests is passed the HZDS would have fewer substitutes from  Central Slovakia than necessary.    "A proposal was also raised for a change in the number of  constituencies. While the HZDS has one slate for the whole of  Slovakia, other political parties, on the contrary, want to have  more constituencies," Kovac said.    According to observers, the increase or decrease in the  number of constituencies could, to a certain extent, influence  the outcome of early parliamentary elections to be held in  Slovakia at the turn between September and October. The idea of  Slovakia to be perceived as one constituency would enable the  HZDS to submit one slate headed by Meciar as the most popular  Slovak politician. A well-known name at the head of the slate  would certainly influence many voters. On the contrary, in case  of the increase of the number of constituencies (from the  current four) the absence of well-known politicians such as  Milan Knazko, Jozef Moravcik, and others from the HZDS might  result in the HZDS' failure.    According to the latest public opinion polls, the HZDS leads  in the election preferences with 32 percent of supporters. The  April poll showed that the HZDS in the coalition with the Slovak  National Party (SNS) would receive up to 36 percent of the vote,  if elections were held today. The left-oriented parties would  get 18 percent, parties on the right from the center 22 percent,  and Hungarian minority parties 7 percent of the vote. The  current government coalition would thus retain its majority in  Parliament. Nevertheless, according to the polls, one in two  Slovaks are convinced that Meciar's HZDS would win the elections.</p>

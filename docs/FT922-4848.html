			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Mortgage rescue measures take effect THE NUMBER of house repossessions is expected to fall sharply this year as a result of lenders' initiatives introduced six months ago, but the suspension on stamp duty will not be extended, the government said yesterday. At a meeting with representatives of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he was encouraged by the progress in cutting house repossessions. After the meeting - called to review the housing rescue scheme set up to try to ease the problem of repossessions - Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the council, said the underlying position on rents and arrears had not improved. 'However, lenders are confident that the measures they have taken, in particular greater counselling of borrowers and restructuring of loan arrangements, will lead to a significant reduction in possessions compared with the peak figures recorded in the middle of last year,' he said. The chancellor rejected building society calls to extend the suspension of stamp duty on most house purchases, due to expire on August 19. Under the initiatives, the building societies pledged more than Pounds 800m for mortgage-rescue schemes, intended to save at least 16,000 borrowers from eviction. During the meeting the council told Mr Lamont that, on previous trends, the number of repossessions would have risen by 120,000 this year, but the combination of lenders' initiatives and the direct payment of DSS benefits to the lenders would reduce the number to about 65,000.</p>

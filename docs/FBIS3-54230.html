			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Eran Klein] </F>   [Text] The defense establishment will receive a special  allocation of 325 million shekels to finance the redeployment in  Gaza and Jericho. An agreement to this effect was reached this  week by top Finance and Defense Ministry officials.    The source of the allocation has not been established yet,  but Finance Minister Avraham Shohat announced yesterday that he  will refuse to approve a supplementary budget and that the funds  will have to be created by changing the present budget  priorities.    Under the agreement, 250 million shekels will be allocated  for the evacuation and the construction of new headquarters, for  new fences and roads, and for other evacuation-related expenses.  Approximately 25 million shekels will be allocated for  settlement security in the current year and about 25 million  shekels for settlement security next year. The settlements in  question are those situated in the territories and along the  Green Line.    The Finance Ministry has rejected the demands for additional  allocations from the defense establishment and other elements.  It is believed in Jerusalem that the top Finance Ministry  echelons may decide at some stage to finance some of the  expenditures from the budget that had been earmarked for  fighting the intifadah.</p>

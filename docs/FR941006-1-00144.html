			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA revoked the nitroglycerin packaging and labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in 1985 because action taken by FDA and the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., after publication of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, had made them unnecessary and duplicative (50 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7584, February 25, 1985). When it proposed to revoke the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, FDA observed that the U.S.P. monograph for sublingual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitroglycerin tablets duplicated most of the packaging and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling requirements that initially had been set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule (49 FR 24031, June 11, 1984). In addition, FDA found that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the suitability of any packaging not in conformance with the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the monograph under CGMP regulations would have to be shown to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA by adequate data (id.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like the nitroglycerin regulation, this proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding iron-containing products is intended to address a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health problem that, FDA has tentatively concluded, can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alleviated by requiring specific packaging. As was the case with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitroglycerin before FDA required specific packaging, iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products are not safe as currently packaged. FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively determined that it is necessary to prohibit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repackaging by pharmacists in order to protect product integrity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to provide the greatest assurance that iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products will be used safely and as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that pregnant women can receive their iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements by way of third-party reimbursement, which generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that a health care professional prescribe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements. These women present their prescriptions to pharmacists who, often, repackage iron dietary supplements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacy vials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes the vital importance of iron supplements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prenatal health care and emphasizes that the proposed rule should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not diminish the availability of iron tablets to pregnant women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or to any other patient population. FDA expects that pharmacists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will dispense the tablets in their original unit-dose packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, pharmacists would be free to dispense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing products in the manufacturer's box, or in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other outer container, as long as the original unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging remained intact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not believe that the proposed mandatory packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and labeling regulation will encroach upon the practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacy. Under the proposed requirement, products will reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pharmacy in unit-dose packaging with a warning statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> printed directly on the immediate wrapping or container. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that such a requirement, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representing an encroachment on the practice of pharmacy, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure that consumers receive adequate warning about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the serious dangers associated with the use of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Formulation and Appearance of Iron-Containing Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AG petition recommended that FDA prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture and sale of adult formulations of iron-containing products that look like candy or contain a sweet outer coating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAPCC petition asked FDA to urge the industry to voluntarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulate iron-containing products containing 30 mg or more of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron per dosage unit to be in less attractive dosage units,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically avoiding resemblance to popular candies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NDMA asked FDA to reject the recommendation from the AG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition for several reasons. First, NDMA stated that ``candy can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be_and is_made to look like just about any other consumable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product. Once a supplement manufacturer decides on a shape,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size, color_of which there are limited selections_for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement product, a candy manufacturer could choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently to introduce a candy that looks like that dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement.'' Second, NDMA stated that it is not known what a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pill looks like to a very young child. ``A very young child puts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> everything into his or her mouth, and in fact there are no hard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to say that candy-like appearance is why a very young child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to investigate a consumable consumer product. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quite likely that it may be even more important that the very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> young child sees his or her mother take that pill every day.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, NDMA asserted that candy-like appearance is in the eye of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beholder and is simply too subjective a standard. It would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be impossible to have an objective measure of candy-like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance. Thus, NDMA stated that any provision for ``no candy-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> like appearance'' would not be practical and would be difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer because of the subjective nature of assessing candy-like appearance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

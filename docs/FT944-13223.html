			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Observer: Noble Swiss Believe it or not, a former Swiss cabinet minister is refusing to accept the juicy SFr190,000 pension to which he is entitled. Rudolf Friedrich, who is best known for a 1982 law that bears his name and which restricts the sale of Swiss property to foreigners, says he does not need the money. The 71-year-old Friedrich says he also feels uncomfortable because he had to resign for health reasons after being in the cabinet only 22 months. Not so much sleazing as pleasing.</p>

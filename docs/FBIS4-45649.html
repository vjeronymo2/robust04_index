			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental </F> Security"]    [Text] When the Russian Federation Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources begin developing  a draft "Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security"  in February 1992 it recruited the assistance of more than 50  scientists and specialists from the Russian Academy of Sciences,  the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and the science sections  of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian  Ministry of Health and other ministries. The project's  scientific director was V. G. Gorelov, doctor of medical  sciences and deputy chief of the Russian Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Main  Administration for Environmental Security.    When (on 8 February 1993) a draft version of this  Concept was approved in its entirety by the ministry board, a  recommendation was made by A. V. Yablokov, Russian presidential  advisor for ecology and health care, that the draft Concept be  sent to regional environmental protection agencies so that they  could examine it, interpret it, discuss it and formulate their  comments and suggestions...    The Main Administration for Environmental Security  under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources [Minprirody Rossii], taking the numerous  comments into consideration, further edited the draft in the  spring of last year and, as is customary, sent it out for  consultation with regional environmental protection agencies and  affected ministries and agencies. We should note that an  absolute majority of the 46 responses (41 from environmental  protection agencies and five from ministries and other agencies)  received by the framers of the draft Concept expressed support  for the main points in the Concept.    All comments and suggestions of a primarily editorial  or clarifying nature were taken into consideration in the  version of the draft Concept being published in ZELENYY MIR  today under the heading "A Document --Let Us Discuss It..."    Do the Concept's authors agree with all the comments?  No -- they contested all comments that were purely directed  toward a single department (the Russian State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor Rossii] and  the Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense,  Emergency Situations and Liquidation of the Consequences of  Natural Disasters [GKChS Rossii]). But compromises were reached  on those points as well in the course of further editing.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H8>  Table of Contents </H8> <H5>  Introduction </H5> <H5>  1.

The current scale of environmental changes is creating a  real  threat to the public's life and health. The necessity of  compensating for losses due to major accidents and natural  disasters will require that economic resources be shifted away  from performing strategic tasks in connection with the formation  of a new economic structure toward fruitless attempts to  maintain the economy in its current state.    The greatest environmental threat is due to chemical  factors,  protection against which should be regarded as a priority  objective. A faulty method of neutralizing emissions and  discharges now predominates -- i.e. their dispersion and  dilution to "safe" levels, levels that were established without  consideration for the possibility of secondary concentration of  eco-toxins at points in the environment, or their transformation  into more toxic compounds. Particularly dangerous are the  super-toxins, pollution by which is increasingly rapidly. There  is a tremendous environmental threat from radioactive  contamination, and one that is rapidly increasing in proportion  to the accumulation of radioactive waste from spent atomic  reactors from nuclear power plants, submarines, nuclear-powered  surface ships, etc. There is a great danger of changes in the  biological balance, particularly the correlation between  pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms and undesirable  mutations in them.    The speed with which the intensity of the adverse effects of  external factors is increasing has surpassed limits on the speed  of living systems' capability of biological adaptation to their  environment. Destabilization of the environment is directly  linked to a decline in public health. Russia ranks fifty-first  in the world in terms of average life span, and its infant  mortality rate is high. If these negative trends are not halted,  then by the middle of the 21st century scarcity of food, water  and oxygen, coupled with the genetic burden, will significantly  accelerate the degeneration of populations and their gradual  extinction.    The basis for the creation of an environmental security  policy is the creation of an adequate organizational, legal and  sociopolitical economic mechanism for the management of natural  resource use that is based on modern quantitative data regarding  the possibility of counteracting anthropogenic and  naturally-occurring biosphere destruction.    In order to solve these urgent problems it is essential to  formulate a general Concept of Russian Environmental Security  and develop a methodology for its implementation.  <H8>  1. General Principles </H8> <H5>  1.1. Fundamental Concepts and Definitions </H5>   The environmental threat is the probability of  destruction of the human habitat and the plants and animals  connected with it as a result of uncontrolled economic  development, outdated technologies and anthropogenic accidents  and disasters which result in disruption of living systems'  adaptation to the conditions under which they exist.    Environmental security is the process of providing  protection for the vitally important interests of the  individual, society, nature and the state against actual or  potential threats created by human or natural influence on the  environment.    An environmental security system is the aggregate  of legislative, technical, medical and biological measures aimed  at supporting the balance between the biosphere and both  anthropogenic and natural external burdens.    The subjects of environmental security are the  individual, society, the biosphere and the state.    The objects of environmental security are the  vitally important interests of the subjects of security --  rights, the individual's physical and intellectual needs,  natural resources and the natural environment -- as the physical  foundation of state and social development.    An environmental security policy is purposeful  action by the state, public organizations and legal and physical  persons to ensure environmental security.    Environmental risk is the probability of  unfavorable effects on the environment as the results of any  anthropogenic changes in natural sites or factors.    Maximum permissible environmental burden is the  maximum level of effects by anthropogenic factors at which the  functional integrity of ecosystems is maintained.    An environmental emergency zone is a section of  territory where as a result of commercial or other activities  there occur persistent negative changes in the environment,  resulting in disruption of public health or disruption of the  balance among natural ecosystems, in particular damage to the  genetic stock of plants and animals.    An environmental disaster area is a section of  territory where as a result of commercial or other activities  and/or natural disasters irreversible changes have occurred in  the environment, resulting in a rise in the rate of diseases and  mortality among the population and destruction of biocenoses.    Health is a state of complete physical, mental and  social well-being, not simply the absence of the incidence of  disease or disability (World Health Organization).  <H5>  1.2. Specific Economic and Social Features of Russia's </H5> Development    From the standpoint of environmental security one must  delineate the following specific economic and social features of  Russia's development:    -- extensive development of the economy coupled with  single-purpose use of natural resources, huge volumes of raw  materials extraction and sales, the absence of a system for  processing household and industrial wastes, and development of  new agricultural land and abandonment of previous agricultural  areas;    -- a distorted economic structure with a prevalence of  natural resource-intensive types of production that create a  constant and excessive overload on ecosystems;    -- a militarized economy;    -- unreliable technical systems and inadequate training of  personnel at enterprises with heightened environmental risk;    -- outdated and ineffective environmental protection  equipment at the final stages of technological processes;    -- biological hazard -- danger to human beings, produce and  natural ecosystems as a result of activity by living organisms;    -- increasing urban population and an increasing supply of  goods and services in the state-owned and private sectors of the  economy, resulting in greater consumption of natural resources;    -- natural and anthropogenic accidents, disasters and  catastrophes;    -- transportation-related effects;    -- a distorted system for assessing environmental benefit  and  environmental losses, resulting in unprofitable natural resource  use;    -- a lack of institutions and experience with environmental  regulation of commercial activities;    -- a lack of a well-designed national system for  environmental education and training and cultivation of an  environmental world view;    -- a lack of unity in the state's administration of  environmental security.  <H5>  1.3. Laws, Principles and Regulations Pertaining to </H5> Biosphere Function  <H5>  Laws </H5>   "Internal dynamic balance": the matter, energy,  information and quality of individual natural systems and their  hierarchy are interconnected to such an extent that any change  in one of those indices causes accompanying  functional-structural qualitative and quantitative changes,  maintaining the total amount of matter and energy and the  informational and dynamic qualities of systems and their  hierarchies.    "All or nothing" (Kh. Boumech [sp?]): weak  influences may not cause reciprocal reactions in natural systems  until such time as they accumulate and result in the development  of a turbulent, dynamic process.    "The minimum" (Yu. Libikh): opportunities for life  are delimited by environmental factors, the number and quality  of which is close to the required minimum for an organism or an  ecosystem, and further reduction thereof will result in the  death of the organism or destruction of the ecosystem.    "Evolutionary and environmental irreversibility":  an ecosystem that has lost part of its elements cannot return to  its original state.    "The irreplaceability of the biosphere" (V. G.  Gorshkov): reduction of the natural biota in an amount  exceeding a threshold level deprives the environment of  stability that cannot be restored through the use of treatment  facilities or a transition to no-waste production.  <H5>  Principles </H5>   The Le Shatelier-Braun Principle: in the event of  an external influence that brings a system out of stable  balance, the balance shifts in the direction in which the  external influence becomes weaker.    Remoteness of events: a phenomenon that is distant  in time or space appears less significant. In the field of  natural resource use this principle is especially frequently the  basis for incorrect practical measures.    Sudden intensification of pathogenicity:  unexpected intensification of pathogenicity occurs upon mutation  of a disease-producing organism, upon introduction of a new  disease-producing organism into an ecosystem which has no  mechanisms to regulate its numbers, or upon a very sharp change  in the ecosystem's environment.    Reasonable sufficiency and acceptability of risk:  expansion of any human activities should not result in  socioeconomic or environmental disasters.  <H5>  Rules </H5>   Mutual adaptation (K. Mebius and G. F. Morozov):  species in a biocenosis are adapted to each other to such an  extent that their community constitutes an internally  contradictory yet unified and interconnected systemic whole.    Integral resource: competition between economic  sectors with regard to the use of specific natural systems is  inevitable, and they harm each other more in proportion to how  significantly they change their jointly exploited environmental  component or the entire ecosystem.    Measures of natural system transformation: in the  course of utilizing natural systems there are certain bounds  that must not be overstepped if those systems are to maintain  their self-supporting capacity (self-organization and  self-regulation).    Correspondence between environmental conditions and an  organism's genetic predisposition: a species of an organism  can exist only so long as the natural environment surrounding it  is in line with that species' genetic adaptation capacity  relative to the environment's variations and changes.    Chain reactions from "strict" management of  nature: "strict" and, as a rule, technical management of  natural processes is fraught with the possibility of chain  reactions, a significant portion of which will prove  environmentally, socially and economically unacceptable.  <H5>  1.4. Fundamental Principles of Ensuring Environmental </H5> Security    The fundamental principles of ensuring environmental  security  consist of the following:    -- social and economic development of society in the course  of which people are ensured an improving quality of life coupled  with a reduction in or stabilization of negative effects on the  natural environment, and in which the laws of development for  the biosphere and natural climate zones are observed;    -- compliance with permissible levels of effects on the  natural environment and on human beings as established by the  state and the components of the Federation;    -- non-depleting natural resource use in which the resource  supply satisfies the interests of current and future generations  equally;    -- the obligation to compensate for damage done to the  health  of human beings and nature, and mutual responsibility of  territorial administrative units for the state of the  environment and cross-border transfer of pollutants;    -- timely identification and restoration of disrupted  territories (or bodies of water), ecosystems and natural  complexes;    -- preservation of biological diversity;    -- the applicability of international law and compliance  with  bilateral and multilateral treaties regulating natural resource  use and quality of life.  <H5>  1.5. Goals of the Concept of Environmental Security </H5>   The goals of this Concept are:    -- development of conceptual foundations for an overall  strategy in the field of environmental protection and efficient  use of natural resources for the purpose of our country's  sustainable economic and social development;    -- definition of achievable mid-range and long-range goals  and tasks in the field of environmental protection;    -- definition of the structure and tasks of and mutual  relations between components of the system for Russia's ensuring  environmental security;    -- identification of specific goals and tasks involved in  the  planning of policy and programs that must be adopted and carried  out by the Government and regional administrative bodies.  <H8>  2. Environmental Problems and Trends </H8>   The current state of the environment attests to the fact  that  environmental problems are due to two basic factors: wasteful  natural resource use, which reduces the biosphere's  productivity, and pollution, which threatens all living things  and in particular human health and well-being. It would be  appropriate to consider critical environmental problems within  the framework of the following sections: the atmosphere, inland  surface and underground waters and seas, soil protection and  land use, forests, wilderness and genetic resources, wastes and  toxic chemicals, social factors, energy, industry and  transportation.  <H5>  2.1. The Atmosphere </H5>   The principle pollutants in the air and precipitation are  sulfur oxides, nitrogen, carbon, airborne organic substances,  suspended particles, bonded heavy metals and organic compounds.  These all have an adverse cumulative effect on human health,  animals and plants.    Also alarming are pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons,  halogens, and nitrogen and carbon oxides, which alter the  distribution and concentration of ozone, affect the thermal  balance and change climate.    Environmental problems connected with the cross-border  transfer of atmospheric pollutants over great distances are  acute.  <H5>  2.2. Inland Waters and Seas </H5>   The priority environmental problems in the field of water  protection are:    -- diversion of water from a number of river basins and  underground sources in excess of environmentally permissible  levels;    -- depletion of small rivers;    -- large water losses as a result of water system disrepair  and imperfect technological processes;    -- discharge of polluted waste water into bodies of water;    -- cross-border water pollution.    The greatest contribution to surface water pollution comes  from enterprises in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals,  chemical, petrochemical, oil, gas, coal, timber and paper  industries, as well as agricultural enterprises and municipal  services enterprises.    Russia's sea basins are beings polluted by petroleum  products, phenols, copper, zinc and chrome compounds and  chloro-organic pesticides, with a trend toward increasing levels  of pollution.  <H5>  2.3. Soil Protection and Land Use </H5>   The following types of pollution and soil degradation are  most widespread in various regions:    -- planar and channel erosion;    -- gully erosion;    -- accumulation or depletion of specific chemical elements;    -- rise or fall in underground water level;    -- salination;    -- solonetzization;    -- loss of organic substances and humus;    -- loss of nutritive elements and increasing soil acidity;    -- accumulation of toxic substances; etc.    Large-scale use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides  has  resulted in contamination of surface waters and alteration of  aquatic ecosystems.    As a result of erosion processes, the spread of excessively  wet, salinated or swampy land, and overgrowth by forests and  shrubs there has been a decrease in the extent of arable land.    Soils for a distance of several tens of kilometers around  cities and industrial centers are contaminated by petroleum  products, heavy metals and toxic organic substances.    Large sections of land have been removed from agricultural  use by development of oil, gas and coal fields, iron ore  deposits and other minerals. The mining industry is one of the  largest sources of environmental degradation and pollution.  <H5>  2.4. Forests </H5>   Degradation of forests results from gaseous air pollutants,  precipitation of acidic components and heavy metals, changes in  climatic conditions, etc.    As a result of intensive commercial activity and losses due  to forest fires, stands of mature timber are declining in  evergreen forests in the European part of Russia. Forests are  protected against fires on just 65 percent of Russia's total  forest area.    Deforestation creates environmental problems such as rapid  sedimentation of bodies of water, soil erosion, reduction in  water supply, etc.  <H5>  2.5. Biological Diversity </H5>   The present state of the environment permits one to define  the principal negative phenomena in the environmental life cycle  as:    -- decreasing biological diversity;    -- smaller populations of a number of species;    -- accelerated aging of populations;    -- disappearance of individual species from biocenoses;    -- impoverishment of flora and fauna, particularly in areas  with a high concentration of industry and population.  <H5>  2.6. Wastes </H5>   Russia currently has more than 50 billion metric tons of  wastes stored on an area of 250,000 hectares. A significant  portion of this waste is classified as toxic substances of  industrial origin. Russia lacks appropriate environmental  standards for enterprises with regard to the neutralization and  storage of toxic industrial waste.    Approximately four billion curies of radioactive waste have  accumulated in special containers, uncovered pools, other bodies  of water and near-surface burial sites.    Each year more than 130 million metric tons of solid  household waste is created and transported to dumps and  landfills. Industrial and household wastes place a major burden  on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and present a serious  threat to the health of human beings and the environment.  <H5>  2.7. Energy, Industry and Transportation </H5>   Approximately 25 percent of all substances that pollute the  air in Russia enter the environment as a result of the  combustion of fuel in power-producing, heating and industrial  boilers.    The degree of environmental pollution in areas where heavy  industry is concentrated is horrifying.    Motor vehicle exhaust fumes pollute the air with  hydrocarbons, lead and oxides of sulfur, nitrogen and carbon,  and also contribute to acid rain.  <H5>  2.8. Social Factors </H5>   The social environment may be envisioned as being comprised  of subsystems such as demography, economics, education, social  structure and culture, as well as dependent factors -- stresses  on human beings.    In this period of economic transition to a market economy  the  following events have become critical:    -- loss of our country's intellectual potential due to  emigration by scientists and specialists;    -- changes in nutrition;    -- a decline in the birthrate;    -- lack of access to medical care among certain segments of  the population;    -- vocational reorientation;    -- inaccessibility of recreational sites due to their high  cost;    -- a state of heightened personal and social stress.  <H8>  3. A System of Long-Range Goals </H8>   The following may be defined as strategic goals:    -- creation of an environment favorable to human health;    -- assurance of rational, non-depleting natural resource  use,  biosphere balance, preservation of the genetic stock as well as  species and landscape diversity, and balance between the  processes of reproduction and utilization of renewable natural  resources.  <H5>  3.1.

The Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) </H8> <H5>  4.1. Goals and Tasks </H5>   The components required for compliance with environmental  security requirements are guarantees of chemical, radiation,  biological and industrial safety throughout Russia.    Involved in the implementation of measures designed to  achieve, maintain and monitor compliance with environmental  security requirements are various Russia ministries, agencies,  institutions and organizations. A real effect from such measures  can be achieved only if they are applied in a comprehensive  manner, which in turn will require the application of a  clearly-defined mechanism for organizational management of all  participants in this process. A Russian Environmental Security  System (RosSEB) [Rossiyskaya sistema ekologicheskoy  bezopasnosti) will have to be established to provide that  mechanism.    RosSEB's principal tasks will be:    -- organizational management of the process of achieving  target indices of environmental security throughout all of  Russia and in its individual territorial administrative units;    -- organization and implementation of monitoring of  compliance with environmental security requirements;    -- interaction with other state systems working to support  the life of society and the public, in particular with the  Russian Council on Emergency Situations;    -- prevention and elimination of the environmental effects  of  industrial and natural accidents and disasters;    -- prevention of the emergence of environmental problem and  disaster zones or environmental emergencies, as well as  participation in the organization of efforts to eliminate their  effects when they do emerge;    -- assessment of the state of environmental security in  Russia, and projection of its dynamics;    -- provision of a unified state policy that will formulate  guarantees for the reliable existence and sustainable  development of the objects of environmental security;    -- planning and coordination of compliance with  comprehensive  programs for environmental protection and efficient natural  resource use;    -- creation, development and equipping of personnel and  means  for ensuring environmental security in Russia;    -- coordination of international agreements on ways to  ensure  Russia's environmental security.  <H5>  4.2. RosSEB Structure </H5>   RosSEB will consist of macrosystem administrative bodies,  personnel and equipment which will support systems and perform  the tasks assigned to RosSEB, as well as means of information  support for the decision-making process. All these elements of  the macrosystem should be interconnected in a single system for  information transfer and command-and-administrative actions.    Establishment of the RosSEB should occur on principles of  organizational unification of the individual functional elements  and structures which currently exist within ministries and  agencies for the purpose of resolving individual environmental  security issues.    The principal organizational support mechanisms should be:    -- directed state programs in the field of environmental  security;    -- unified environmental security requirements;    -- unified targeted indices of environmental security and  unified regulations and procedures for achieving them;    -- unified state monitoring of compliance with environmental  security requirements and compliance with target indices;    -- information interaction in support of organizational  management. Performance of these functions should be assigned to  the state administrative agency that is responsible for  implementation of policy in the field of environmental security,  i.e. the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources (see chart).    The functional subsystems of environmental security  administration include:    -- a subsystem for regional administration of environmental  security;    -- a subsystem for administration of the environmental  security of potentially hazardous sites;    -- a subsystem for management of industrially-produced and  other environmentally hazardous and toxic wastes;    -- a subsystem for nuclear and radiation security;    -- a subsystem for recovery from the effects of  environmental  emergencies;    -- a subsystem for management of environmental security in  connection with military activities (with the exception of a  special period);    -- a subsystem for management of the state of public health;    -- a state monitoring system (environmental monitoring,  industrial monitoring, etc.).    The state monitoring system:    environmental monitoring (EGSM [Unified State Monitoring  System], EGASKRO [expansion unclear]);    medical and biological monitoring (the AIS "Zdorovye"  [Health  Analysis and Information System], etc.);    monitoring of industrial, energy-related and transportation  facilities;    monitoring of nuclear power facilities;    monitoring of potentially hazardous sites;    monitoring of sites where hazardous chemical, radioactive or  biological wastes and substances are stored or buried;    monitoring of production- and consumption-related wastes;    monitoring of shipments of hazardous substances and  materials;    monitoring of hazardous natural phenomena;    Monitoring of global natural phenomena and processes;  monitoring of agricultural production;    monitoring of soils and land.    The federal information and analysis system:    the information and analysis system (IAS) for environmental  security under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection  and Natural Resources;    territorial (regional) information and analysis systems  under  the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources;    the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight  [Gosgortekhnadzor] IAS;    the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation  Safety  [Gosatomnadzor] IAS;    the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] and Ministry of Health IAS;    the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and  Environmental Control [Rosgidromet] IAS.    The Environmental Security Automated Information and  Control System [AIUS "Ekologicheskaya bezopasnost"]:    a consultation and administration system under the Russian  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (the  Ministry's central apparatus);    a consultation and administration system under regional  agencies of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection  (the Ministry's regional committees);    administrative systems under the Russian State Committee for  Emergency Situations, Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight,  Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the State  Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the Russian  Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and  Environmental Control.    The means of achieving environmental security are:    a normative legal foundation;    environmental programs;    state environmental monitoring;    licensing of activities;    environmental impact assessment;    regulations and standards;    environmental education and training;    international cooperation.    The personnel that will ensure environmental security are:    subordinate divisions of environmental assessment and  inspection agencies;    Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection emergency  environmental aid personnel;    subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense,  the  Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Ministry of  Security;    subordinate divisions of the Russian State Committee for  Emergency Situations, including Civil Defense units;    medical services;    services for the protection of plant and animal life;    subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of  Transportation, the Russian Ministry of Railways, and other  specialized units and divisions which carry out measures and  actions to protect the public and the natural environment.    The objects of administration are the ministries and  agencies  which carry out state administration of environmentally harmful  and hazardous types of activities, in particular the Russian  Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry  of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Railways,  Ministry of Agriculture and State Committee for Architecture and  Construction.  <H8>  5. The Mechanism for Ensuring Russia's Environmental Security </H8>   The mechanisms for achieving this goal are:    -- a legislative and normative legal basis for activities in  the field of environmental security;    -- an organizational basis for administration of efforts  with  regard to ensuring environmental security;    -- economic mechanisms;    -- a technological basis for environmentally safe  development  of industry, energy production and transportation;    -- state monitoring of activities by ministries and agencies  in the field of compliance with environmental security  requirements as they go about implementing Russia's state  environmental policy;    -- use of scientific-technical and production potential in  the defense sectors of industry.  <H8>  6. Conditions Essential for the Implementation of </H8> Environmental Security Strategy    Environmental security must become an inseparable part of  efforts by the state and its organs in the field of ensuring the  overall security of society and the state.    Environmental protection efforts must become one of the most  important functions of the legislative, executive and judicial  branches of government.    Environmental protection is based on integration of  environmental, economic and social policy.    Economic development is based on development of low-waste  and  no-waste technologies and minimizing of the social and  environmental cost of economic activity.    There must be active participation in compliance with  international conventions on the environment.    Current and pending Russian Federation legislation regarding  environmental protection and the rational use of natural  resources as well as the Statute on the Russian Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources are to be based  on this Concept.    Materials from annual Russian Federation state reports on  the  state of the environment, the United Nations Environmental  Program (UNEP) and materials from the International Labor  Organization, UNESCO, the European Economic Community and the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were used  in the preparation of this Concept.    Individual environmental security concepts submitted to the  Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources by scientists from various institutions were also  analyzed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-015-39A>      Figure </FIG></p>

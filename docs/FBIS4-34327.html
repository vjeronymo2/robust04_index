Upon his arrival in this city, Xu Yicong  was extensively briefed by Juan Carlos Robinson, member of the  central committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and first  secretary of the party in the province, on social and economic  developments in the province. Robinson informed Xu Yicong of the  efforts that the population is making to eliminate, as soon as  possible, the consequences of the May rains, which caused  damages estimated at 90 million pesos.    Xu Yicong expressed satisfaction with his visit to  Guantanamo  and highlighted the similarity of ideas, principles, and paths  chosen by the peoples of Cuba and of China to build socialism,  aside from the different characteristics of the two countries.</p>

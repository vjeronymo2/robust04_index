			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The nursing home reform provisions of OBRA '87  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconfigured the way in which HCFA and the States would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track nursing home compliance with Federal requirements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach enforcement remedies. The survey and certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, set forth at sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, require implementation of a flexible survey cycle for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities so that standard surveys are conducted at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals not later than 15 months after the date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous standard survey with a statewide average interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that does not exceed 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history of OBRA '87 and the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine (IoM) study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1986) are plain in their stated reasons for this change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the rigid, time limited system of having surveys for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all facilities follow a 12 month cycle. First, a flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey cycle provides less predictability to the scheduling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of surveys, thus reducing the opportunities for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers, by anticipating the survey, to achieve only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary compliance for the short term period around the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of survey. Second, flexible survey cycles allow survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to better allocate their limited resources by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the frequency of surveys for problem facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while allowing other facilities with a better record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance to be less rigorously monitored. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because time limited agreements have automatic cancellation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clauses, a significant paperwork and recordkeeping burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results from the frequent need to conduct resurveys as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means of avoiding provider agreement expirations. Third,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enforcement provisions of nursing home reform, set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, are designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work in the context of provider agreements that do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fixed ending date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act speak to the ability of the Secretary to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for up to 6 months after the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies if certain criteria, described in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections, are met. Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act require the Secretary and States to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denials of payment for new admissions should deficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities fail to achieve compliance within 3 months after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they have been determined not to comply with Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. In both cases, these remedies make sense only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where a facility's provider agreement has no set expiration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We reach this conclusion because under a time limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement survey system in which surveys are typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted shortly before the expiration of provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements, facilities would have only the shortest period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time to correct deficiencies if they are to be entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to renewed agreements. The statutory remedies described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, however, contemplate periods of time that far exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what would be available under a time limited agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system for providers to achieve compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For HCFA and the States to attempt to fit this survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system into the procedures described in sections 1819(h) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h) of the Act would require the wholesale revamping of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys so that they occur no later than mid-way through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term of the 12 month provider agreement. Such a radical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> departure from more than 20 years of practice would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the kind of massive reallocation of survey resources that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not possible under a time limited agreement survey system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would likely cause many facilities to go unsurveyed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time their time limited agreements are scheduled to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expire. Of equal significance, we do not believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress would approve of a survey system in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions about renewal of a provider agreement are made as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> far as 6 months prior to the expiration of that agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since determinations of compliance made so far in advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be reflective of the degree of facility compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time the agreement is set to expire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

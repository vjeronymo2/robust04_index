			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman (AP)--Defence lawyers Sunday [2 January]  rested their case in the trial of 10 Jordanians accused of  plotting to kill King Husayn, rejecting pretrial confessions and  demanding the conditional release of the defendants.    Defence lawyer 'Umar Damrah, reading a 150-page summation,  argued that the confessions were extracted under torture and as  such could not be admitted as evidence.    He demanded that the court return an innocent verdict and  release the defendants.    The State Security Court, a three-man military tribunal,  will  hold a "final review" of the case Jan. 9 and set a date for  issuing the verdict, prosecution sources said.    Under standing orders of the court, the defendants and  witnesses could not be identified by name in media reports. Two  of the accused are being tried in absentia.    Five military cadets, a member of a guard unit of King  Husayn  and four others, including the two fugitives, are charged with  plotting to assassinate the Monarch and pave the way for a  take-over of power by the illegal Hizb al-Tahrir group.    Hizb al-Tahrir, a puritan group established in the early  50's, does not recognise any of the existing Arab governments  and calls for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.    The prosecution charges that the five cadets, students at  Mu'ta University, a military college in south Jordan, were  enlisted by Hizb al-Tahrir to open fire at the King during a  guard of honour at a Mu'ta graduation ceremony on June 26.    The students were told that as soon as the King was killed,  pre-positioned Hizb al-Tahrir members were to take over radio  and television stations and seize power, according to prosector  Muhammad Hijazi, an army major.    Mr. Damrah and other defence lawyers who addressed the court  last week summed up that the accused were subject to "severe  physical torture and psychological duress" to force them into  signing the confessions.    The statements, given by the eight accused during three  months of detention at the intelligence department, are one of  the pillars of the prosecution's case.    All the defendants in court retracted the confessions and  entered innocent pleas at the outset of the trial, which began  in September.    The defence has also argued that Hizb al-Tahrir did not  espouse violence as a means to achieve its objective, and as  such the prosecution charges based on the group's ideology were  invalid.    Prosecution witnesses have testified that the five cadets  were devout Muslims who resented the pro-western "un-Islamic"  policies of the government.    They also told the court that the five were ardent admirers  of Lieutnant Khalid al-Islambuli, who assassinated Egyptian  president Anwar al-Sadat Husni Mubarak [name as published]  during a Cairo military parade in October 1981.</p>

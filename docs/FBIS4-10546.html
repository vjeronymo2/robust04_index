			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources  reported today that the deficit in the Argentine trade balance  increased by 328.6 percent during January of this year as  compared to January of 1993. In January imports added up to  $1.5321 billion while exports exceeded $946 million.    The figures released by the National Institute of Statistics  and Census (INDEC) of the Finance Ministry shows that the trend  that began in the middle of last year has increased.    Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach announced these  figures during a news conference. He said the trade deficit  increased during January because of climatic problems that  affected export- quality agricultural products and postponed  agricultural exports.    Llach stressed the importance of the growth in capital goods  imports, which increased by 98.8 percent compared to the same  month last year.    Llach said that the figures also show an increase in  investments, which is positive for the economy.    According to the INDEC report, the purchase of fuels  increased by 140.6 percent, the purchase of intermediate goods  by 26.4 percent, spare parts and accessories for capital goods  by 36.5 percent, consumer items by 23 percent, and passenger  vehicles by 46.5 percent.    The figures confirm that Brazil is the main purchaser of  Argentine exports, with a total of $188.9 million. The United  States comes second with $108 million.    The United States, in turn, heads the list of countries that  sell to Argentina. Argentina imported a total of $410 million  worth of goods from the United States. Brazil is second on the  list, selling for a total of $285.4 million worth to Argentina.    The United States, Brazil, Germany ($113.4 million), and  Italy ($102.6 million) account for 59 percent of the country's  total imports during January.    Argentina's trade exchange (exports plus imports) with its  three Common Market of the South (Mercosur) partners -- Brazil,  Uruguay, and Paraguay -- reached $615.1 million in January, or  23.8 percent of the country's total, and a 29.8 percent increase  compared to the figures registered in January of 1993.    The exchange with the United States, Mexico, and Canada --  the three NAFTA partners -- also increased by 61.3 percent,  reaching a total of $554.3 million during January.    The export of Argentine products to NAFTA member countries  increased by 31.1 percent during January compared with the same  period of 1993, while imports from the United States, Mexico,  and Canada increased by 72.6 percent.    The INDEC report says that Argentina's exports to Mercosur  member countries increased only by 9.5 percent, while imports  from these countries increased by 50.2 percent.</p>

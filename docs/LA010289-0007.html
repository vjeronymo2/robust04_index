			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CLEANING UP THE BALLOT'  </P> <P> I was pleased to read in The Times Dec. 26 editorial "Cleaning Up the Ballot"  that you support initiative reform in California. The Times printed my  initiative reform proposal "Keep the Initiatives but Reinvolve Legislators" on  Nov. 27 (Op-Ed Page).  </P> <P> While the indirect initiative process proposed by the League of Women Voters  and supported by The Times sounds similar to my idea, there are some  differences. According to the editorial, the League's proposal would allow  initiative proponents to avoid the legislative process by requiring the  signature gatherers to meet a higher signature quota than if they submitted it  to review. This seems to me to subvert the very idea of indirect initiatives,  i.e., to involve the governor and the Legislature in the process.  </P> <P> My initiative reform solution would require the involvement of the governor and  Legislature on any ballot initiative for which at least half the required  signatures had been gathered. The governor would be required to appoint a  three-member commission to make recommendations to him within 60 days. The  Legislature would then have 90 days to deal with the governor's  recommendations.  </P> <P> We have had a plethora of initiatives lately because the governor and the  Legislature have failed to deal with pressing problems facing California  residents. My proposal would involve them in the process. That's what they are  paid to do.  </P> <P> As The Times points out, the initiative process provides an important "safety  value" for the people of California, but as important as this process is, it  can and should be improved.  </P> <P> EDMUND D. EDELMAN  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors  </P> <P> County of Los Angeles  </P></p>

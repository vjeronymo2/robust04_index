			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CLEAN-AIR RULES CALLED A ROADBLOCK  </P> <P> County officials complained Friday that the three planned tollways, the Santa  Ana Freeway widening project and other local transportation improvements could  face lengthy delays due to "red tape" generated by proposed clean-air  regulations.  </P> <P> The Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency, and  the South Coast Air Quality Management District are adopting rules that would  subject new transportation projects to additional public hearings and reviews  to determine their conformance with regional clean air and traffic goals, said  Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation  Commission.  </P> <P> "We don't want to reopen environmental impact reports or go through another  layer of bureaucracy on projects that are almost ready to go," he said.  </P> <P> "The proposed rules are a disaster," said Orange County Supervisor Thomas F.  Riley. "We're looking at delays possibly as long as six months to a year."  </P> <P> SCAG and AQMD officials, however, said Friday that the situation is not as bad  as it may first appear.  </P> <P> SCAG spokeswoman Cindy Krebs said: "We have grandfathered in all transportation  projects for which an environmental document has been circulated prior to March  1. I think we have alleviated many of Orange County's concerns."  </P> <P> Orange County officials disagreed.  </P> <P> For example, they said that the three planned tollways in South Orange County  could run into problems with the new regional air quality and mobility plan  because the agency building them does not want to install car-pool lanes until  the tollways have been open for a few years.  </P> <P> While the new regulations do not require car-pool lanes, they give preference  for projects that have them and require documentation explaining why they are  not included.  </P> <P> Oftelie said he will ask the county Transportation Commission on Monday to  approve a letter to SCAG outlining Orange County's objections.  </P> <P> Under the new procedures contained in the regional Air Quality Management Plan,  transportation officials must document how their project fits into SCAG's  so-called regional mobility plan and affects air quality, how other  alternatives also would affect the air, and why car-pool lanes, mass transit or  other transportation-demand management tools have not been included.  </P> <P> The regional traffic mobility plan includes four strategies for attaining  federal clean-air standards. They include improving the balance of housing and  jobs, travel demand management, better transportation systems management, and  capital improvements such as new roads and rail lines. JEFFREY A.

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Israel to sell 20% of Bank Leumi stake THE Israeli government yesterday announced the sale of 20 per cent of its shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second-biggest bank. The move comes less than two months after it sold 16.5 per cent of its shares in Israel's biggest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The Bank Leumi sale, approved by the Knesset finance committee yesterday, is due to take place this month. The offer is expected to raise between Shk850m and Shk1.1bn (Dollars 298m to Dollars 386m). The Hapoalim sale was 120 times oversubscribed, and analysts believe the Leumi offer will also be heavily oversubscribed. Indeed, several finance committee members initially expressed opposition to the offer, arguing that the sale price was being set too low, and senior management were being offered overly generous share purchase schemes. The sale emphasises the Labour-led Israeli government's commitment to divesting the state of its majority holdings in all Israel's major banks, acquired after the October 1983 bank shares collapse. In a second privatisation plan unveiled yesterday, Israel Aircraft Industries said it would this year be offering 25 per cent of the shares in its wholly-owned Elta electronics subsidiary for sale on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. IAI, one of Israel's largest companies, has been hit hard by the worldwide downturn in defence spending. It has failed to make an entirely successful transition into non-military alternatives, and recently said it would have to cut 1,500 of its 16,100 staff. Elta develops, manufactures and markets radar, electronic warfare, communications and information systems and is one of the jewels in the IAI crown. Sales in the first quarter of 1993 amounted to Dollars 72m, following 1992 sales of Dollars 257m.</p>

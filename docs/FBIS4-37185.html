			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Kamal Hamid in Khartoum and Nizar Daww-al-Na'im </F> in London: "Garang Announces Formation of Executive Council To  Run the `Liberated Areas'; Al-Bashir: Washington Deals With Us  Positively for the First Time"]    [Excerpts] Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's  Special Envoy Melissa Wells' visit to Sudan, Sudanese President  'Umar al-Bashir said that "for the first time, the White House  is dealing with Sudan directly and positively."    Meanwhile, Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese  People's Liberation Movement [SPLM], has announced the formation  of a "National Executive Council" which has 27 members and has  the task of running the areas under SPLM control in the south of  the country.    Al-Bashir described Wells' visit, which was concluded  yesterday, as "evidence of U.S. President Bill Clinton's special  interest in what happens in Sudan." He added in press  statements during his weekly meeting with the media that  "Washington is dealing with Khartoum positively for the first  time." [passage omitted]    Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Dr. Ghazi  Salah-al-Din has told AL-HAYAH that "Wells explained her mission  of boosting the peace efforts and ensuring relief for the  victims of the civil war, but she did not broach relations  between the two countries." But Salah-al-Din, who held a long  meeting with the U.S. envoy, said that "some other points over  which the United States had been critical of the government"  were also raised.    He saw the visit as "a new development in relations between  the two countries replacing the policy of attack, accusation,  and pursuit we felt in the past."    Meanwhile, SPLM sources have stated that the new 27-member  "National Executive Council" has been entrusted with "the role  of actual civilian authority in the areas under SPLM control."  They added that the announcement of the council marked the  beginning of changes "which are fundamental in the context of  the New Sudan" declared by the SPLM's first conference last  March.    They added that the Council will administer "the liberated  areas." Garang kept the defense portfolio for himself in  addition to the chairmanship of the council. Commander Silva  Kir, his deputy, got the foreign and interior portfolios, Deng  Alore the state's affairs portfolio, Dr. Justin Yak the health  portfolio, Commander Yusuf Kuwa the affairs of Kurdufan  (district), Daniel Kudi environment and tourism affairs,  Laurence Wall education affairs, Arthur Queen human affairs, and  Dr. Peter Nute Cole legal affairs [names as transliterated].  Five governors were also appointed for the provinces of  Kurdufan, Upper Nile, Equatoria, Bahr al-Ghazal, and Blue Nile.  [passage omitted]</p>

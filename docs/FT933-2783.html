			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Defiance over the role of Frankfurt WITH two weeks to go before he steps down as president of the Bundesbank, Mr Helmut Schlesinger yesterday painted a positive picture of the state of the German economy and the impact of the controversial monetary policy pursued by the German central bank over the past year. Mr Schlesinger, who will chair his last meeting of the Bundesbank council next Thursday before he is succeeded by Mr Hans Tietmeyer at the beginning of next month, said he was sure that the low point of the German recession had been reached following the small 0.5 per cent growth in western German gross national product in the second quarter. He predicted that pan-German gross domestic product for the year as whole would drop by 1.5 per cent, comprising a 2 per cent fall in the west offset by 6 to 7 per cent growth in the eastern Lander. This was in line with internal Bundesbank assumptions which were made last year when formulating monetary policy, he said. Mr Schlesinger, a 69-year-old Bavarian, took over from Mr Karl Otto Pohl as president in the summer of 1991 after nearly 40 years working at the German central bank. The last year of his term has been highly controversial as Germany's interest rate policy - starting with the decision to raise rates last July - has prompted one crisis in European currency markets after another. He was in defiant, je ne regrette rien frame of mind yesterday, restating his view that the currency turbulence of last September was caused by governments treating the ERM as if it were a fixed-rate system, ignoring the option to devalue. He said the recent widening of the bands in which ERM currencies were allowed to fluctuate was not the end of the ERM. He also reiterated the message which accompanied the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates last week: that pressures leading to price rises were calming down and that the rate of growth in money supply, a key determinant of future inflation, was more subdued than in recent months when growth in broad money or M3 has exceeded the central bank's target range. 'The position is not satisfactory but we are moving in the right direction,' he said. 'Monetary conditions have to a large extent come back to normal.' He said that long-term capital market interest rates were 'appropriate for the recessionary environment', hinting that further cuts in short-term interest rates are not to be expected soon.</p>

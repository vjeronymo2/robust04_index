			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: 3i floats as others founder - John Gapper analyses the prospects of a venture that is looking to the long term Like a large ocean liner sailing calmly onwards while smaller vessels founder in increasingly choppy seas, 3i announced the terms of its long-promised flotation this week. Despite heavy falls in the London market, the bank-owned venture capital company refused to be diverted. Retail investors are to be offered up to Pounds 178m of equity from its Pounds 711m flotation at 272p a share. The company and its advisers are not too worried about whether they take it up, since the institutional funds which are buying the other Pounds 533m are prepared to soak up any excess. It was difficult to find too many sceptics about the value of the 3i offer this week. The company, which is the largest European investor in unquoted companies, has attracted a lot of interest from professional investors. The shares were priced at a 13.5 per cent discount to net assets. This is a little more expensive than other quoted investment trusts, the sector it is joining for tax reasons, but advisers say its portfolio is worth more than others because of its bias towards smaller, unlisted UK companies. Since institutional funds bid for Pounds 1.2bn at the offer price after being canvassed on a range of prices, 3i's advisers are confident of a good 'after-market' in the shares. In other words, they are expecting at least an initial rise above the offer price when dealing starts on Monday July 18. The institutional funds have been attracted by several aspects of 3i: Because it is so large, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn at the offer price, it is likely to enter the FTSE 100 (Footsie) index later this year. This gives it an automatic appeal, because most funds need to have 3i shares to give them a weighted holding of the index. 3i's range of investments in 3,500 small and medium-sized unquoted companies gives investors a rare chance to make an indirect investment in the sector, which tends to outperform the overall growth rate as the economy recovers. The company appears to be managed effectively and, unlike the seven high street banks which have owned it until now, has not made any significant lending blunders. These factors have helped to attract significant interest among the more affluent individual investors (whom 3i's advisers have dubbed 'Jeremies' in contrast to the more down-market Sid who was targeted for the British Gas privatisation). Some 385,000 individuals pre-registered for details of the offer. Unlike BG and other utility privatisations, though, 3i does not offer the same possibilities for making a quick profit. 'This is not a stagging issue,' says one analyst. Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive, adds: 'We are looking for investors who know what they are doing and are buying for the long term.' In its Pounds 2m marketing push, 3i targeted people who would hold shares as part of a portfolio. The 'Jeremies' it seeks will have to spend at least Pounds 1,020 on a 3i stake - the value of the 375 shares which have been set as the minimum investment - but the company has estimated there are 1m such investors. Arguing that an investor in the UK small company sector is taking no risk might seem odd, given the wave of small company failures early in the 1990s. Yet, 3i's risk is less than might appear, given the spread of its investments across regions and industrial sectors. Academic studies have found that 3i's portfolio is less volatile than any individual industrial sector or quoted company. Nonetheless, the gearing effect - under which small companies perform better than the average in recoveries and worse in recessions - should be taken into account. One analyst argues that there are two possible approaches to 3i for an individual investor. One is to treat the shares as a long-term investment through rough and smooth. A more adventurous one is to buy in recovery and try to sell at the point when an economic downturn is about to strike. The implication of either approach is that 3i is floating at a good time for investors. The biggest gains from economic recovery are past - but 3i points out, in its note on prospects, that the health of its British portfolio 'has stead-ily improved in the past year', a trend which is continuing. Share applications are available from Lloyds Bank, the registrar, and must be submitted by July 6. The allocations of shares will be announced on July 8, and share certificates will be sent on July 15. This week's other new issue, Eurodollar, is examined in UK Company News.</p>

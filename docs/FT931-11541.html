			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Compromise may emerge on HDTV EUROPEAN Community member states will press on with attempts to find a compromise over the development of cinema-quality television despite the announcement by Philips at the weekend that it was suspending plans for mass production of high-definition television sets. Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson, the French electronics manufacturer, have invested heavily in HDTV technology and the Dutch company's decision underlines the uncertain future of the European HDTV programme. In December, Britain blocked approval of European Commission plans to inject Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) into the development of HDTV over five years, saying other technologies might overtake the standards promoted by the Commission. Philips said at the weekend there was no point producing sets to the most advanced standards if the EC did not fund production of HDTV programmes. But a spokesman for the industry commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann, said yesterday there was no question of abandoning the programme at this stage. Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, will try to break British opposition with a new compromise proposal before the May meeting of EC telecommunications ministers. The Philips decision was 'obviously not a positive decision,' a Commission official said yesterday, but he added Philips was completing research into HDTV and would be ready to produce sets if funding was made available. Some senior Commission officials are sceptical about the prospects for the HDTV strategy, once seen as the flagship of an active EC industrial policy, and believe Philips' decision could hasten its demise.</p>

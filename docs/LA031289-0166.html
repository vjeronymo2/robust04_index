			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THE GAME'S OLD MEN STILL GIVING IT A GO  </P> <P> In the autumn of their careers, a few major leaguers arrived in Florida and  Arizona this year looking for one more spring.  </P> <P> Ron Guidry and Tommy John, a part of the New York Yankees' past, would like  another chance at the future.  </P> <P> Darrell Evans, 41, is back in West Palm Beach with the Atlanta Braves. In Plant  City, Pete Rose is the manager and Tony Perez a coach for Cincinnati. One of  their old teammates on the Big Red Machine, Ken Griffey, wants to play one more  year at the age of 39.  </P> <P> Shortstop Dave Concepcion, another part of the Big Red Machine, is trying to  make it with the Angels at 40.  </P> <P> "What will I do if I don't make it?" John, 45, said in response to a question.  "I'll probably go home and play with my kids. I haven't had a summer free for a  long time."  </P> <P> Last week, Ben Oglivie got his chance to go home sooner than expected.  </P> <P> His comeback with the Milwaukee Brewers ended with a knee injury and  arthroscopic surgery.  </P> <P> John, Guidry, Evans and Griffey have survived the first full week of spring  training. They hope to make it to another opening day, but there are no regrets  if they don't.  </P> <P> They have made their mark in baseball and have the numbers to prove it.  </P> <P> Evans, a non-roster player with the Braves, has been a major leaguer since 1970  with Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroit. He has 403 career home runs, including  40 in 1985 with the Tigers at the age of 38.  </P> <P> "I just wasn't ready to say I couldn't play anymore," Evans said. "I had 22  home runs and 64 RBI last season."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Evans stood behind home plate talking to New York Mets manager  Davey Johnson.  </P> <P> As teammates with Atlanta in 1973, Evans hit 41 home runs and Johnson had 43.  </P> <P> "I never really put a timetable on playing," Evans said. "When it ends it  ends."  </P> <P> If the Reds keep Griffey, he could be part of history. His son, Ken Griffey  Jr., has a shot at making the Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> If they both stick, it would be the first time in baseball history a father and  son have played in the majors at the same time.  </P> <P> "I must be old if my son is about to become a major leaguer," Griffey joked.  "I'm not the only old guy here."  </P> <P> Also trying to win a spot on the Reds are Manny Trillo, 38, Joel Youngblood,  37, and Kent Tekulve, 42.  </P> <P> After the Yankees acquired Dave LaPoint, Andy Hawkins and Jimmy Jones, it  seemed unlikely John and Guidry would be back.  </P> <P> New Manager Dallas Green thought the Yankees needed to go with younger  pitchers, but agreed to give them a chance this spring at George Steinbrenner's  behest.  </P> <P> "I know I can throw," Guidry, 38, said. "But I have to find out if I can still  pitch."  </P> <P> In a 'B' game last weekend, Guidry pitched two scoreless innings against  Baltimore.  </P> <P> If Guidry makes it, the left-hander will be used as a middle-inning reliever.  </P> <P> In the same game, John also pitched two shutout innings.  </P> <P> "People know what I can do," John said. "I know I throw the ball well enough to  still pitch in this league."  </P> <P> John needs 14 victories for 300 in his career.  </P> <P> "I can't say I haven't thought about getting to 300," John said. "It would be  special."  </P> <P> Guidry has a career record of 170-91. "I think I reached the things that I  wanted to do," Guidry said in his soft southern drawl. "Now, I started thinking  about going home. Who wouldn't mind retiring when he is 38 years old?"  </P> <P> Apparently, however, a few do mind.  </P></p>

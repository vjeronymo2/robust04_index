			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Toy town Meanwhile, Edwina Currie, ex-Tory minister and sometime author, has been causing a bit of a stir. Will she turn up at Bournemouth with the new love of her life, her 'toy boy called Otto'. Apparently, the object of her affections has a 'very sexy' behind. Don't panic. It's not another scandal sloshing across the bows of tugboat Tory. Otto is Currie's new car, a blue Toyota MR2. She told the newspaper Scotland on Sunday that Otto 'is my treat to myself as I've worked hard for my money and (is also) my consolation prize for not winning the European election in June'. Any other Tories planning to follow her example? Given current poll performances, Toyota sales could do very well indeed in 1997 . . .</p>

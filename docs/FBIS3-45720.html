			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By David Wallen in London] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten last night spelled out for  the first time that if the Legislative Council refuses to pass  his democracy blueprint for the 1995 polls he might either  revert to the 1991 formula or put forward entirely new  legislation.    Mr. Patten was at his most forthright yet in a marathon  two-hour 20-minute grilling before the Commons Foreign Affairs  Select Committee -- ruling out a referendum, insisting  legislators voted in in 1995 would not be a "Trojan horse" for  Britain and fiercely, while succinctly attacking both China and  his British adversary Sir Percy Cradock. In a sometimes emotive  performance he praised the people of Hong Kong.    "I do get angry sometimes at the contempt shown for the  people in Hong Kong who have created one of the most successful  economies in the world and who have shown remarkable  sophistication in every aspect of life and who are expected to  continue to create one of the most successful economies in the  world in a political vacuum.    "They say of the people of the 10th most successful economy  in the world that it contains a population who aren't capable of  deciding who should collect their dustbins."    Mr. Patten told the all-party committee investigating  relations between Britain and China that it was his "firm,  sincere hope" that discussions could be resumed although time  was very short. "I still hope that the negotiations can be  resumed at any time and when the Chinese side give us the nod  our officials will be on the plane to Beijing."    He explained that if Legco refused to pass either of two  tranches of his democracy package then he would face  difficulties constitutionally. "You can't legislate on very  close terrain to that on which you have lost the battle.    "The options would be either to try a different approach and  put forward different legislation or to decide that we have to  settle for existing arrangements in a re-run in 1995."    Asked by Tory MP David Sumberg whether or not a referendum  was viable, Mr. Patten insisted that opinion polls over and over  again had shown support for his package. A referendum would not  resolve the issue because Legco would still have to pass  legislation.    He added sternly: "It is an issue completely neuralgic to  the Chinese side and I am not in the business of trying to tweak  Chinese tails. China regards it as the ultimate sin and I don't  think it is very sensible to take on more arguments in a day  than is absolutely necessary."    The MPs questioned Mr. Patten in detail over the whole gamut  of Hong Kong issues. The Governor revealed that soon he would  have to go ahead with the localisation of laws unilaterally  because of the lack of progress in the JLG. He insisted he  would continue to press "with great vigour" for UK passports for  both the 52 war widows and the 7,000-strong ethnic community.  The Governor meets Home Secretary Michael Howard today to take  up these issues.    He also disclosed that before he goes ahead and tables the  second set of democracy legislation he will publish the full  details of how the talks progressed and finally broke down. "I  think it would be very difficult to justify further legislation  without filling in that background," he said.    The Commons committee room was crammed with more than 70  diplomats press and members of the public, including four  officials from the Chinese Embassy for the hearing: Those who  could not fit in heard Mr. Patten give evidence through a sound  system to an overflow room.    The Governor admitted as he began his evidence that his was  "a difficult job all round and no one should be too surprised or  too censorious that it is occasionally a more bracing or  bruising experience than any of us would like". Even before he  arrived the relationship with China had not been blessed with as  much co- operation as Britain would have liked.    "We have not been arguing with China about increasing the  pace at which the legislature is democratised, though some think  we should have been.    "What is at issue is whether those arrangements are fair or  unfair. That is the nub of the argument.    "Should it not be possible to reach agreement with China on  this issue then we will have to proceed with legislation.    "We will work with and through the legislature, not going  further than the community wishes, but not going less far  either."    Mr. Patten pulled few punches in his description of the  Chinese approach. "I think it has been pretty irrational,  largely rhetorical and usually devoid of argument," he said.    He detailed to the MPs the talks with Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen in New York, prior to his first  announcement of the democracy package and how this was passed on  to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office by the British Embassy  in Beijing.    Mr. Patten said Sir Percy Cradock's suggestion that Britain  had refused consultations at that stage was "completely untrue".    He accused the Chinese of using traditional tactics in  trying  to personalise their attacks on him and isolating individuals  they did not agree with.    It was "ludicrous" to suppose that any governor could  conduct  policy which produced this degree of controversy off his own  back. He was a politician and very sensitive to public  accountability-- more so than others might have been.    Tory MP Sir John Stanley asked why he had gone for a policy  of defiance, as it was described by Sir Percy. But Mr. Patten  accused the former ambassador to Beijing of not saying what he  would settle for. Mr. Patten said the 17 rounds of talks had  "reached the end of the elastic" when they were called off.    Asked why he had not gone to Beijing prior to announcing his  package, he said that if he had that would make "lame ducks look  pretty agile".</p>

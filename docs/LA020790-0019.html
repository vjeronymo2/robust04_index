			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALING GESTURE  </P> <P> I would like to thank you for the words of encouragement I read in your  editorial ("Parents' Touch Helps the Healing," Jan. 31).  </P> <P> In it you praised the generosity of Giusto and Evelyn DeMaiti for setting up a  foundation to grant college scholarships to minority students as a way of  easing the racial tension created by the tragic circumstances of their  daughter's death in Boston. The final sentence read " . . . Decent people  determined to do the right thing can make a difference, however long the odds  against them."  </P> <P> You're right, of course, but I needed to be reminded. I feel renewed and ready  to continue my efforts for the pro-life cause. Thank you.  </P> <P> LINDA SNIDER  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

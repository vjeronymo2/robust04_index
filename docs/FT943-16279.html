			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Packer to merge his TV and media companies Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, yesterday unveiled plans to merge his two quoted companies - Nine Network, the television group, and Australian Consolidated Press, the magazines and publishing business - into one listed entity with an estimated market capitalisation of more than ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.4bn). The deal will be effected by schemes of arrangements, between Nine and its shareholders, and between ACP and its investors. These will give ACP shareholders one preferred share in Nine for each ACP share held, and allow ACP to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nine. Once the transaction is complete, Nine will comprise three divisions - ACP, Nine Network, and investments - and have shareholders' funds of about ADollars 1.7bn. Mr Packer will become chairman, and Mr Brian Powers managing director. Mr Bruce Gyngell will continue to head the television business, while Mr Nick Falloon will be finance director for the combined group. The Packer companies yesterday estimated that market capitalisation of the combined group would be about ADollars 2.3bn. The deal is conditional on approvals from ACP and Nine shareholders, other than Mr Packer's privately-owned Consolidated Press group which has substantial minority stakes in both groups. Mr Packer claimed that the merger would bring joint marketing opportunities and that the increased size of the group would allow it to pursue acquisitions more easily. Shares in the combined group would also have greater liquidity: 'With Conspress holding substantial stakes in both ACP and Nine, the restricted size of the public shareholding . . . has been a concern in the marketplace,' he commented. ConsPress will hold 45.7 per cent of the combined group. The new preferred shares in Nine will have the same rights as existing ordinary shares in Nine, but will also carry a preferential right to a minimum annual dividend of 24 cents for the 1994 and 1995 financial years. Nine's current annual dividend is 14 cents. ACP shareholders will also receive a 10 cent final dividend making a total of 24 cents for 1994.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER COURSE BROADENS HORIZONS OF COLLEGE FRESHMEN  </P> <P> This summer has shown Elizabeth Grounds that her hometown of Barstow, although  only 120 miles from Los Angeles, seems as far away as a distant planet.  </P> <P> The 20,600 or so inhabitants of her hometown are predominantly white and when  Grounds, a 17-year-old college freshman, got A's all through Barstow High, she  did it largely without thinking about people of other cultures.  </P> <P> She had never known any black people. In fact, she had misgivings about even  approaching them.  </P> <P> Now while taking part in Occidental College's Multi-Cultural Summer Institute  for incoming freshmen, she's not just approaching blacks, she's attending  classes with them as well as with Latinos and Asians. She's surprised at what  she's finding.  </P> <P> "It's like we're the minority," she said. "It's a different feeling, and it's a  good feeling."  </P> <P> Made up of under-represented minorities and whites from rural backgrounds, the  summer institute combines writing and American culture courses with workshops  and field trips for 36 students from around the country who have been accepted  to the small private university. Students earn credit for the course work.  </P> <P> The aim of the program, which was first proposed in the early 1980s by  Occidental's minority caucus, is to acclimate students from diverse backgrounds  to being on campus and in dorm rooms together. The first summer institute was  conducted in 1987.  </P> <P> Freshmen who come from rural Alaska and Arkansas and the inner cities of  Baltimore and Philadelphia are spending five weeks together in classrooms and  dorms, picking up information in class and out.  </P> <P> "Some of them have never even shared a room before, much less shared a room  with someone who's different than them," said David Morgan, Occidental's  associate director of admissions and co-director of the institute.  </P> <P> Behavioral scientist Ann Schell, an Occidental College faculty member, is  studying the institute's effectiveness. In her study, she is comparing the  college performances of past institute participants to those of Occidental  students who were invited to take part in the institute but did not.  </P> <P> Early and unofficial results indicate that the students who attended the summer  institute are less likely to drop out of college than those who did not, she  said.  </P> <P> One reason that the program may work is that it teaches students to balance  work and play. The teen-agers are expected to participate in a full slate of  activities.  </P> <P> On Monday, students arose early to ride to Tujunga and view its half-mile-long  historical mural of California. Most of the sleepy students took with them a  copy of a Flannery O'Connor short story to be discussed in an afternoon class,  notes on an upcoming lecture or both.  </P> <P> "It's hard because it's academically intense, and you're supposed to be social  at the same time," said Sonya Ramirez, a San Fernando High School graduate.  </P> <P> It takes students time to adjust to the differences between high school and  college academic work, teachers said.  </P> <P> "They hear that it's demanding and hard," said Manuel Pastor, one of three  teachers of the culture course. "But they have no idea what that means."  </P> <P> Perhaps the most important lessons the program has to offer are learned after  class.  </P> <P> Standing before the chain-link fence separating the students from the mural's  depiction of scientist Charles Drew in a lab, Kristie Robinson, a black student  from Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, talked about race relations.  While she spoke, Elizabeth Grounds, her new friend from Barstow, arrived.  </P> <P> "Some people were saying there were no blacks in their hometown," said  Robinson, 18. "I could tell (that)."  </P> <P> "I see a lot of change in myself," Grounds said, gesturing to Robinson. "Like  Kristie. Kristie is one of my closest friends. And I never had any black  friends before."  </P> <P> Kristie rolled her eyes. "I'm a novelty," she said half in jest.  </P> <P> "I had had preconceptions in the past," Grounds said. "And now I see them  crumbling away."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Lunch Hour Break" program] </F>   [Text] A few days ago the people of Maritime Kray were  literally shocked by the prices for electricity proposed by the  central government. As Natalya Vstovskaya, press secretary of  the kray administration head, reported before the beginning of  the program, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko took part in a meeting of the  Federal Assembly while in Moscow and signed the Agreement on  Civic Accord in Russia. I am prepared to welcome any chance  aimed at stabilizing our society and establishing peace and  order, he said over the telephone. However, the governor  expressed deep concern over the situation in connection with the  increase in prices on electricity.    As you know, according to the 22 April decree, the  government  is rescinding preferential rates for Maritime Kray set down in  decree No. 1001. This document was not coordinated with  Maritime Kray, and I am categorically opposed to such measures,  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko declared. The head of the administration  has departed for Vladivostok to deal with urgent kray issues.  Immediately on arrival he plans to visit the agricultural fair  and fish market being held today.    As was reported earlier, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko was invited to  the United States for the presentation of the president's book.  However, he declined the offer. During an audience with Yeltsin  in Moscow in connection with the publication of the book, I  explained the necessity for my return to the kray, and I think I  was understood, the head of the kray administration said.</p>

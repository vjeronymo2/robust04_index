			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Mowlem to seek bids for airport stake: London City expected to suffer operating loss of Pounds 3m this year JOHN MOWLEM, the UK contractor and housebuilder, plans to sell part of its 90 per cent stake in London City Airport, the loss-making airport in London's Docklands. Mowlem said yesterday it had received a number of approaches from potential UK and foreign investors interested in acquiring a stake in the airport. The company would not disclose the names of possible new investors. Mr Roger Sainsbury, a director of Mowlem, said there had been 'pretty detailed conversations' with one group of investors and expressions of interests from other parties. Mowlem, which has appointed Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, to evaluate the offers, said it would be prepared to sell a controlling interest or a large minority stake in the airport. But it intended to keep a sub-stantial stake of its own in the venture. The decision to consider selling a large stake in the venture coincides with what Mowlem considers a turning point in the fortunes of the Docklands airport. It follows the introduction of jet services at London City in April. The completion of a Pounds 5m extension of the airport's runway expanded the range of aircraft able to use it. The airport had earlier been restricted to small turbo-prop aircraft. Improvements in road access to the airport have also made London City more attractive. The airport is still operating below its break-even point of 400,000 passengers a year. Mr William Charnock, the airport's managing director, said about 200,000 passengers were expected to use the airport this year, but traffic was forecast to increase sharply in the last quarter with the introduction of new jet services. Mr Charnock said the airport expected to reach its break-even point next year. It was expected to make an operating loss of about Pounds 3m this year. Mowlem has invested about Pounds 37m in the airport, which opened in October 1987. The asset is currently valued at about Pounds 20m in Mowlem's books. The company estimates the replacement value of the airport at about Pounds 50m. Mr Sainsbury said the decision to consider selling a stake in the airport was not driven by balance-sheet needs. A sale would not take place unless a satisfactory price was agreed, he said. Mowlem, while not forced to sell, would welcome the cash. The group, like many construction companies, has been hit hard by the recession in UK residential and commercial property markets. Pre-tax profits last year fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m, leading the group to reduce its total dividend by half from 21p to 10.5p. Its financial position has improved following a Pounds 46m, one-for-five rights issue at 265p a share in April last year. Yesterday the group's share price closed at 66p, up 2p. At the end of December Mowlem had net debt of just Pounds 60m, representing 28 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 215m. Gearing, however, is expected to rise this year due to poorer trading conditions. Lex, Page 20</p>

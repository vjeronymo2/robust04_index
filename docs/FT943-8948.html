			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Sun Life to end commission-only pay for staff Direct sales forces paid entirely on commission seem increasingly likely to become a thing of the past in the financial services industry, with Sun Life about to join a growing band of companies paying a salary to sales staff. The life assurance group, which is jointly owned by Transatlantic Holdings and Union des Assurances de Paris, is set to move its 240 direct sales staff to a new remuneration system under which they will be paid a salary as well as commission on sales. They are currently paid on commission only. In another move that reflects the growing pressure upon financial services groups to reform their sales methods, Nationwide Building Society has confirmed plans to cut the number of staff authorised to offer financial services advice from 1,300 to 650. The change in Sun Life's remuneration is partly to meet new industry regulations, due to take effect in January, under which sales staff will have to disclose to clients the charges and commission they earn. Commission-only payment has also been criticised for inclining staff to use high-pressure selling techniques, although this is disputed by some companies. Mr Colin Kelsey, Sun Life's director of training and management development, said a change to salary plus commission would happen in the 'not too distant future'. 'It is a positive way of doing business and there is definitely a trend towards it,' he said. Barclays Life, which was censured last month by the Securities and Investments Board for shortcomings in training and managing its sales force, has said that by next year it will include a salary in the pay package for its 1,100 sales agents instead of paying them on commission only. Allied Dunbar, one of the UK's biggest insurance companies is also moving towards salaries, albeit on a limited scale. In May, it changed the contracts of its 350 sales managers from mainly commission to a salary and bonus system to encourage them to take greater responsibility for the 4,000-strong sales force, although sales agents will continue to be paid on a commission-only basis. Last month, Norwich Union, another large insurer, announced that as part of a restructuring of its direct sales operation it would no longer pay its sales agents on commission-only. In March, regulators forced it to suspend its life and pensions sales force for a month of retraining. Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, which has withdrawn staff from offering financial services advice, has concluded that those who give advice only part of the time - such as branch managers - should no longer be authorised as sales staff. The society, has implemented an extensive retraining programme for the 650 staff who will concentrate on selling regulated financial services products. Nationwide is linked to Guardian Financial Services but is to launch its own life subsidiary next year. Banks 'see value of private investors', Page 7</p>

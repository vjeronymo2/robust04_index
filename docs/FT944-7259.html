			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A sound message If Europe's competitiveness problems could melt under sheer outpouring of words, most of the continent's economic woes would by now have disappeared. In contrast to many previous reports on the issue, including the European Commission's own white paper 12 months ago, yesterday's document from the European Round Table of Industrialists has the virtue of pithiness. By underlining structural shortcomings compared with the US and Asia, and concentrating on a few priority measures which even weak European governments might be able to deliver, the industrialists have made a sound contribution to the agenda for next month's European summit in Essen. Their conclusions should help concentrate the minds of the new European Commission. First, Europe must use faster than expected economic recovery to correct imbalances in public sector finances that are weighing increasingly on the private sector. Second, priority must be given to completing the single market and ensuring that it works. Third, a tougher attack on state aids, powerful deregulatory reform and sensible infrastructure investment are needed to lower costs in energy, telecommunications and transport. Above all, the Commission and Council of Ministers should test their actions against the need to avoid unnecessary burdens on industry. The business leaders wisely avoid lecturing trade unions about flexible labour markets. Because recovery is generating so few extra jobs, employment rigidities are softening even in Europe's most closely regulated economies, while real take-home pay for most people in work is still falling. Few bosses have had to face such sacrifices. Along with a willingness to share burdens, Euro-industrialists need to show more evidence of another virtue: humility. The Round Table's credibility would be enhanced if it drew attention to industry's own part in Europe's declining performance. Europe's poor record in innovation, for example, cannot be blamed simply on failures in education. Along with undue government regulation, lack of flexibility in the big businesses represented on the Round Table is partly to blame for Europe's low employment growth. A majority of 1,500 European business leaders in a survey last week termed as inadequate their own investment in research and development and in training. In areas like this, self-analysis would shed useful light on industry's own ills. The Round Table's underlying message, however, is clear. Failure to correct the continent's structural faults will drive Europe's larger corporations to shift a growing proportion of capital investment outside the EU during the next decade. If this happens, Europe's companies might continue to prosper; Europe would not. As they prepare for their trip to the Essen summit, that is a sobering thought for the EU's leaders.</p>

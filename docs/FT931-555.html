			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Rome cools expectations of state group changes THE Italian government yesterday damped expectations of imminent boardroom changes at the country's biggest state-owned companies, despite the weekend appointment of a new board at the Eni energy and chemicals concern. Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister, said further appointments would only come ahead of shareholders' meetings at Iri, the biggest state holding company, the Ina insurance concern and Enel, the electricity generating authority. However, he gave no indication of when these meetings would take place. Businessmen have been keenly awaiting details of the new boards. Their size and composition will be important indicators of the determination of the government to prepare for privatisation and reduce political influence on the state sector. The boards were slimmed down to three members last year when all four state groups were transformed by the Amato government into joint stock companies as the first step towards privatisation. However, the mini-boards, comprising a managing director and senior civil servants, were seen as temporary pending the appointment of bigger boards including senior company executives and outside specialists. It is widely expected that Mr Franco Nobili, Iri's chairman, who has been told by magistrates he is under investigation in the country's political corruption scandal, will be replaced. Less clear are the positions of Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman, and Mr Franco Viezzoli, the chairman of Enel. On Saturday, the government named Mr Luigi Meanti, a former managing director of Eni's Snam natural gas subsidiary, as its new chairman. Mr Franco Bernabe remains as managing director, while the four others nominated included a senior academic and the chairman of IBM's Italian subsidiary. However, last night the latter, Mr Renato Riverso, said he was unable to accept because of current commitments. The changes at Eni followed this month's arrest of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, its former chairman, and the chairmen of four leading subsidiaries. Though some of those arrested have since been released, Mr Cagliari is still being held in Milan's San Vittore prison on allegations of illegal political funding. The new appointments at Eni, to be confirmed by a shareholders' meeting this week, will be mirrored by similar changes at its subsidiaries, which include the EniChem chemicals concern, the Agip petroleum group and Snam. Their sizeable boards, sometimes comprising a chairman, deputy and up to three managing directors, are likely to be replaced by six-member bodies. The number of managing directors is likely to be reduced to one, or at most two, individuals, while political appointees will be excluded.</p>

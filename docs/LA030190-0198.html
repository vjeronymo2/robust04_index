			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' DERIVES ITS POWER FROM OBJECTIVITY ABOUT SUICIDE;  </P> <P> DRAMA: IS A DAUGHTER'S DECISION TO KILL HERSELF A SELFISH ACT OR THE BEST  OPTION TO PRESERVE DIGNITY? A GARDEN GROVE PLAY LOOKS INTO THE VICTIM'S HEART.  </P> <P> Marsha Norman's " 'night, Mother" raises two opposed dynamics: Is Jessie's  decision to kill herself an act of existential dignity or the worst retreat, a  selfish step that ignores the consequences left behind?  </P> <P> It's a credit to directors Michelle and Tim Bagley that their Garden Grove  Community Theatre production does not fudge on either of these questions. This  is a clear, steadily acted treatment of Norman's 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning  drama.  </P> <P> In Jessie (Nancy Smeets), we find a young woman exhausted by her days; she  moves wearily around the tidy home (Walter Brown's set is suitably  unpretentious and suburban) she shares with her mother, Thelma.  </P> <P> It's been a troubled life -- Jessie's an epileptic with a bad marriage and a  wayward son -- and in her mind, the time is right to end the disappointment and  pain. Smeets is methodical, restrained, direct.  </P> <P> Thelma (Sheri Savage) is disbelieving when Jessie announces her plans, but she  soon realizes her daughter's seriousness. She pleads, demands, threatens,  cajoles, trying to get her to go on, but she knows that Jessie is "already  gone." Savage is emotional, confused, guilty.  </P> <P> The ending, as it usually does, stuns, even though we know it's inexorable.  Jessie locks herself in the bedroom while Thelma convulses outside. The gun  goes off. Now it's time for Thelma to call her son, and then the authorities.  Jessie's decision lives beyond her as the family, especially Thelma, will deal  with it: What could they have done to prevent it? What signs did they miss?  </P> <P> Norman doesn't take a position one way or the other. Both sides have strong  voices: We hear Thelma tell her daughter of the options, and Jessie agrees but  adds that death is one option she knows will work. Thelma argues that her love  for Jessie makes it impossible to accept her choice. Jessie says love is what  should allow her to accept it.  </P> <P> Much of " 'night, Mother's" validity is rooted to its steadfast, objectifying  distance. We understand that suicide is a waste, but until we understand the  heart of the victim, it's impossible for us to judge.  </P> <P> " 'NIGHT, MOTHER'  </P> <P> A Garden Grove Community Theatre production of Marsha Norman's drama.

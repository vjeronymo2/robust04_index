			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel: No surrender on the ski slopes - Arnold Wilson previews the new season and finds that bookings are up in spite of sterling's woes WE HAVE seen this extraordinary syndrome before and this autumn we are seeing it again: although as a result of the free-falling pound the British may consider sacrificing their summer holiday, come hell, high water, or Helmut Kohl, they will not retreat from the ski slopes of Europe . . . or the US, come to that. After the most consistent snow for a decade in Europe last winter, tour operators are reporting remarkably brisk early bookings - excellent in some cases, and traditional worries about the possible lack of snow at Christmas and New Year seem to have evaporated. With the ailing pound and dollar entwined in a trans-Atlantic embrace in which they seem set to sink or swim together, bookings to the US are looking even better than last year in spite of an indifferent winter for snow in the Rockies. However, Vail is no longer automatically the most popular destination. Some British skiers seem keen to explore more exotic destinations such as Jackson Hole and Telluride. Ski Solutions (081-944-1155) the specialist ski 'travel agent', provides a barometer of this British preoccupation with skiing at all costs. 'We are 30 per cent up on last year in terms of people, but 64 per cent up in money,' says Lizzie Norton, managing director. 'A lot of people are choosing holidays that are at least 25 per cent more expensive. The general feeling is that people scrimped last year and many had bad experiences. For the sake of spending a bit more, they really do get more comfort and service. 'Last year they also tended to leave booking too late and were frequently disappointed. They often had to take second or third choice of hotel or chalet as their first choice was already booked. However, in the top resorts like Courchevel, Zermatt and Verbier, people do seem to be prepared to stay in accommodation that is further away from the slopes, and therefore cheaper, in order to have access to good skiing.' The French are hoping to overhaul their rivals, Austria - which traditionally attracts more British skiers than any other country - and may even end up neck and neck. With frontiers virtually removed in 1993 the French are planning to bring back heliskiing direct from French resorts for the first time since 1975. Thus - ironically during a recession - specialist ski schools like Top Ski and Evolution de 2 in Val d'Isere/Tignes hope once again to be offering skiing encounters of the most expensive kind. They will still have to land just over the border in Italy because of environmental pressures, but they will no longer have to fly to Aosta or La Phuile first. * * * The Albertville Olympics may be over but the French, anxious to keep the Olympic flame burning in hearts and minds, are offering a new Olympic lift pass enabling skiers who book a full-price six day ticket in any of the major Olympic areas to ski in two others. For this purpose, the Trois Vallees resorts of Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens will be dubbed l'Espace Trois Vallees. La Plagne and neighbouring Les Arcs will form another 'Espace'. The Val d'Isere and Tignes common skiing area has long been christened 'l'Espace Killy.' Skiers in any of the three Espaces will now be able to spend one day in each of the other two. Thus, if you buy a six day pass in Val d'Isere , for example, you can use it to ski for a day in the Three Valleys and a day in La Plagne or Les Arc at no extra cost. It is well worth noting - especially for larger families and groups - that by pre-booking your lift pass from many tour operators (those whose current brochures promise 'no surcharges') you can still take advantage of pre 'black Wednesday' prices, which are now substantially cheaper than the price you will pay in the resort next winter. A six day pass costing FFr1,870 for the Espace Killy is still available at the old exchange rate of 9.71 francs to the pound recommended by ABTA earlier this year, so you can still pre-book your lift pass for under Pounds 90. At the present exchange rates, you would have to pay more than Pounds 107 in resort. Skis and boots are also worth pre-booking at the old rate. Crystal, which cleverly uses the word 'approximate' to describe its brochure prices, have now upped the cost of a lift pass in l'Espace Killy from Pounds 86 to Pounds 92 and ski and boot hire from Pounds 46 to Pounds 55. But Touralp (Pounds 89 lift pass, Pounds 37skis and boot hire) and Nielson (Pounds 91 lift pass, Pounds 46 skis and boot hire) honour their brochure prices. Market leader Ski Thomson, which pre-books equipment but not lift passes, also sticks to its ski and boot hire rate of Pounds 47. With some tour operators already toying with reprinting their brochures with higher prices, booking now makes sense. There are only just over 60 booking days till Christmas.</p>

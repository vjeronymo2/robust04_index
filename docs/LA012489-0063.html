			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Africa named a special envoy to Namibia and said it is willing to remove  2,300 police officers from the territory as it prepares to grant independence  to Africa's last colony. South Africa has ruled neighboring Namibia, also known  as South-West Africa, for 74 years but has agreed to begin implementing a U.N.  independence plan in April. South Africa has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in  Namibia, but under the U.N. plan, the force is to be reduced to 1,500 by June.  Willem Retief, South Africa's ambassador to West Germany, has been named  special envoy to serve as a liaison between Namibia's current transitional  government and the U.N. special representative to the territory.  </P></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Zimbabwe faces austerity budget ZIMBABWE'S finance min-ister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, is expected to present a tough budget tomorrow, with cuts in public spending and higher consumption taxes. As part of its second structural adjustment loan agreement with the World Bank, Zimbabwe has promised to cut its budget deficit from more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992-93 to less than 6 per cent this year. Government revenue and expenditure estimates, prepared months ago when officials were predicting 7 per cent economic growth this year, point to a 9.5 per cent budget deficit of some ZDollars 3.1bn (Pounds 310m), but growth forecasts have since been downgraded to no more than 2 per cent. As a result, economists expect the deficit to exceed 10 per cent, though they expect Mr Chidzero to carry forward parastatal losses of some ZDollars 350m into the current year's budget, thereby keeping the 1992-93 deficit in single figures. Government forecasts suggest that revenue will increase to 34 per cent of GDP from 29 per cent last year, when tax income was cut by drought. But with the economy likely to remain flat for the first half of the 1993-94 fiscal year (to June 1994), these projections look optimistic. This means that if Mr Chidzero is to meet the 6 per cent deficit target in the current year, he will have to cut spending drastically as well as raise new revenue. The government is already committed to reduce income and company tax rates, but may seek to dilute these cuts by abolishing some exemptions. Mr Chidzero is also under pressure from business organisations, and especially farmers, to reduce import taxes on productive inputs. Petrol and diesel prices will go up, and drink and tobacco taxes will rise. Higher duties on luxury goods are possible. In addition, subsidies to parastatals and defence spending could be cut.</p>

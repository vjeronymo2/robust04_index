			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ahmed Jabril, leader of a group suspected of bombing Pan Am Flight 103, denied  in an interview with ABC News that his organization had any role in the attack  that killed 270 people in December. But Jabril acknowledged that his group  routinely used the same kind of bomb investigators say was used to blow up the  jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Jabril said a confederate, Hafez Dalkamoni,  commonly built and used the type of device, a bomb-rigged radio-cassette  recorder, that downed the Pan Am jet. Dalkamoni is in a West German jail after  a police raid last October that netted three devices like the one used to blow  up Flight 103. Jabril heads the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation  of Palestine-General Command.  </P></p>

His company, Hesperia Arts Auction Ltd., is  staging its first sale on Tuesday night at the Park Lane Hotel in New York. The  most expensive of the 316 items to be offered are an ancient Greek mirror,  valued at up to $1 million, and "The Pasquino Group," a marble fragment from a  Roman copy of a Hellenistic sculpture, which is expected to sell for at least  $400,000.

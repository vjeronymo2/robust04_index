			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-ENERGY DISPUTE  </P> <P> Regarding "Fear of Fusion," I haven't heard such astounding drivel since the  Carter Administration.  </P> <P> The quote attributed to Paul Ehrlich: ". . . like giving a machine gun to an  idiot child," actually came from one of his articles, "An Ecologist's  Perspective on Nuclear Power," published in Public Issue Report from the  Federation of American Scientists, May/June 1975. Ehrlich's specialty is not  energy, but population control, which, he has stated, should be accomplished  through coercive means if necessary.  </P> <P> Barry Commoner, a one-time presidential candidate, is a self-avowed Marxist. I  quote from his article on the energy crisis ("A Reporter at Large; Energy III,"  the New Yorker, February 16, 1976): "Economists and other students of  capitalism will recognize that the basic ideas I have discussed are among those  first put forward by Karl Marx."  </P> <P> What these two, and others that you didn't include, have in common is not that  they are ecologists; they are not. Neither are they particularly concerned  about mankind's survival as a whole. They are anti-energy activists dedicated  to the development of the industrialized free world so as to achieve their  bucolic vision of Utopia.  </P> <P> If this seems extreme, imagine Commoner explaining to a throng of  famine-stricken citizens of any Third World nation you choose that they will  continue to die by the thousands while a bunch of elitist limousine liberals  withholds the solution to their problems. Tell them, Mr. Commoner, that they  must die so that we can pursue your Weltanschauung. Mr. Ehrlich, tell the young  mother with the infant struggling against acute malnutrition that her child and  millions like him must die because you don't trust any government with a cheap,  abundant source of energy.  </P> <P> JAMES R. ADAMS  </P> <P> Sierra Madre  </P></p>

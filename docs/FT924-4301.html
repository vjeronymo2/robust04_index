			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Lego plans to open attraction on Windsor Safari Park LEGO, THE Danish toys group, plans to open a DKr600m (Pounds 63.4m) family amusement attraction on the site of the Windsor Safari Park, which closed in October, Hilary Barnes and Michael Skapinker write. The 24.7-acre park, which will open in 1996, will be modelled on Lego's successful Legoland amusement park in Jutland (above). The Windsor park will be the first Lego amusement park outside Denmark, but Lego plans other parks in Europe and the US. Themes International, the private leisure concern that owned Windsor Safari Park, went into receivership in January. Several leisure groups, including First Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and tourist attractions group, are thought to have been interested in the park. Lego expects the Windsor park to attract about 1.2m visitors a year, requiring the employment of 500 to 600 people during the April to October season. The Danish Legoland park is the most visited tourist attraction in Denmark outside Copenhagen, attracting about 1.2m people a year. It is built up around model villages and models of well known monuments built in Lego bricks. The Windsor park will not be a straight copy of Legoland. The company said: 'There will be a degree of adjustment to its British surroundings and further development of the Lego philosophy in relation to high-quality family experience, with a focus on imagination, creativity, safety and educational values.' Lego, a family-owned company, is one of the world's leading toymakers with a published turnover of about DKr4.4bn last year, but its world-wide turnover, which is not published, is significantly higher.</p>

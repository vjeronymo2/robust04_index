			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Armed Forces Information </F> Directorate Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata by RPC anchorman  Christian Nielsen -- live]    [Text] [Nielsen] At this point, we can supply our viewers  official information about this morning's deployment of armored  vehicles from Cerrito to the 4th Cavalry Regiment base. We have  Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata from the Armed Forces  Information Directorate on the phone. Good morning, colonel.    [Medina] Good morning, Mr. Nielsen and the same to your kind  viewers. Mr. Nielsen, first, I would like to thank you for this  chance you have given us to keep the people informed about the  deployment of armored vehicles from the 2d Cavalry Regiment  headquartered in Cerrito.    The deployment's purpose is to bring our material closer to  the capital city so as to be able to comply with any order to  help out the National Police if they are overwhelmed by violent  actions related to ongoing events. The purpose of this  information is to assure the citizenry that the Armed Forces  will leave its barracks only if ordered to do so and only if it  becomes absolutely necessary.    [Nielsen] Was this deployment part of the plans drawn up in  advance to deal with today's situation?    [Medina] That is correct; the Armed Forces are always ready  and prompt to help re-establish public order -- provided, I  repeat, they are ordered to do so -- and help out the National  Police if they are unable to carry out their mission because  they are overwhelmed.    [Nielsen] For the time being, you are not contemplating  having to deal with disturbances bigger than those that have  been taking place so far?    [Medina] From what we could see and hear through the news  media, no serious disturbances are taking place. For the most  part, they seem to be rather unimportant. Thus, we believe that  everything that is taking place is in keeping with the law, but  this does not mean that we should not be ready and prepared to  help -- if ordered to do so -- the National Police.    [Nielsen] Thank you very much, colonel, for this official  information, the first we have had since the deployment of  armored vehicles was first spotted this morning. Thank you for  your kindness.    [Medina] Thank you, Mr. Christian Nielsen.</p>

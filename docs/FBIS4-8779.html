			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gavin Cordon] </F>   [Excerpt] An off-duty British soldier serving with the  United Nations has been shot dead in Sarajevo, the UN said today.    A spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the  Bosnian capital told Reuters the man, who was believed to be in  civilian clothing, was killed at a checkpoint manned by the  mainly Muslim Bosnian government army.    The incident, which happened early today, is being  investigated by UNPROFOR and the Bosnian military police. A  Ministry of Defence spokesman said they were seeking further  details.    According to a BBC report, Bosnian forces manning the  checkpoint opened fire after the soldier failed to stop. He  reportedly started to run and was hit in the head.    He is the fourth British soldier to die while serving with  the UN in Bosnia. A British Sea Harrier pilot ejected safely  after Serb forces shot down the helicopter over the besieged  town of Gorazde yesterday, and a British SAS man acting as a  forward observer in the town for UN aircraft was killed and a  second injured on Friday.

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Airliner subsidy deal model for Gatt THE European Community and the United States yesterday offered their hard-won accord limiting subsidies to civil aircraft as a model for a new international agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The bilateral accord, reached on April 1 after six years of wrangling over government aid to the European Airbus project, will come into effect next week after endorsement by EC finance ministers last Monday. It limits direct government support for new aircraft programmes to 33 per cent of total development costs. Indirect supports, for instance through military contracts, are limited to 4 per cent of a company's turnover. Both the EC and the US are long-standing critics of Gatt's civil aircraft code, drawn up in the Tokyo round of trade talks that ended in 1979. The code, which has 22 signatories, eliminates import duties on civil aircraft and the bulk of aircraft parts, including engines. But its references to subsidies and competitive practices are vague, leaving the door open for conflicting interpretations. The US, overriding EC objections, has instead chosen to use Gatt's subsidies code as the vehicle for attacking state assistance to Airbus. It alleges that Germany, France, Britain and Spain have spent Dollars 13.5bn-Dollars 26bn on subsidising the consortium, while the EC says US manufacturers have received similar amounts indirectly through military programmes. Gatt's civil aircraft committee yesterday agreed in principle to renegotiate the code. This will most probably be based on the US/EC agreement. However, Gatt cannot simply adopt the agreement.</p>

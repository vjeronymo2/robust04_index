			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE INSURANCE CONSUMERS AN ADVOCATE  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has finally begun hearings to determine  whether individual insurers should be required to roll back their rates as  directed by Proposition 103. These hearings will also determine the size of the  refund checks that consumers will receive from insurers for excess premiums  charged during the past year.  </P> <P> In evaluating insurers' petitions for exemptions from the rollbacks, Gillespie  will hear abundant assertions from legions of lawyers and actuaries working for  the insurance companies. But she will hear little from insurance experts for  consumers. That's because consumers lack their own team of actuaries and  lawyers to scrutinize the thousand-plus exemption petitions. Instead, consumers  will have little recourse but to cross their fingers in the largely vain hope  that Gillespie, a former insurance-company executive, will act in good faith to  implement the Proposition 103 rollbacks.  </P> <P> It doesn't have to be this way. The authors of Proposition 103 knew full well  that consumers would have to be empowered to safeguard the initiative from  subversion by the industry and its official allies. So when they drafted the  measure, they included a provision to establish an independent consumer  insurance organization staffed by insurance experts to intervene on behalf of  consumers in regulatory proceedings before the commissioner. This is exactly  what consumers need.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the California Supreme Court ruled that such a provision  technically violated a state institutional prohibition against naming a private  corporation in a ballot initiative. But the court did made it clear that the  Legislature was free to pass a law creating the rate-payer organization.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, Senate President David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles)  introduced such legislation. Taken verbatim from Proposition 103, the Roberti  bill has been approved by the Senate but faces an uncertain fate in the  Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee, where a vote has been scheduled for  Tuesday.  </P> <P> While the measure has thus far received scant attention from the media, it is  the most innovative consumer protection legislation given serious consideration  by the Legislature in years. If enacted, California policyholders will be the  first consumers in the country to have an institutional, yet independent, role  in their state's insurance rate-review process.  </P> <P> Here is how it would work: Whenever an insurance company mails out its bills,  it would be required to enclose a notice inviting policyholders to join an  organization that would fight for their rights and interests before the  Insurance Department, the courts and the Legislature. After voluntarily paying  a modest membership fee, member policyholders would elect a board that would  then hire a staff of professional insurance experts. Because these experts  would be accountable to consumers only, there would be no danger they would be  co-opted by special interests (as frequently happens with government consumer  protection agencies). In addition, the Consumer Insurance Organization would  involve no expenditure of taxpayer money, nor any out-of-pocket expense for  insurance companies.  </P> <P> While those legislators who front for the insurance industry argue that  consumers are already well enough represented by existing consumer groups, they  know full well that on the regulatory battlefield these groups are badly  outnumbered by an infinitely larger and wealthier insurance industry. The fact  is that the half-dozen or so consumer groups in California that are active on  insurance issues simply do not have the staff or technical capability to  challenge more than a few of the thousands of exemption petitions and rate  filings that the commissioner will rule on over the next few months.  </P> <P> After being trounced by consumers at the polls last fall, insurers must find it  very comforting indeed to know that when it comes to implementing the rollbacks  and rate regulation ordered by Proposition 103, consumers have their hands tied  behind their backs. For the industry, the next few months of hearings before  the Insurance Department represent an opportunity to seize the power to  determine prices that it lost to the voters last November.  </P> <P> For consumers, the inevitable domination of the upcoming hearings by  insurance-industry lawyers represents a serious threat to their victory last  fall. Like other consumer protection measures, Proposition 103 is an instrument  rather than a result. Unless it is applied aggressively and by government  officials who are serving their rightful masters, it will not produce the  intended result. And the only way for consumers to make sure that officials  such as Gillespie act in the public interest is to be there, watching over her  shoulder every step of the way.  </P> <P> After being written off by insurance consumers as cowards, the Legislature has  unexpectedly been given an opportunity by the state Supreme Court to join with  consumers in standing up to the industry and ensuring that Proposition 103  works for consumers. The Legislature must seize this opportunity by passing the  Roberti bill to establish the Consumer Insurance Organization.  </P></p>

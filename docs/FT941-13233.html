			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Central Americans boost coffee plan Central American coffee officials hope their decision to set a minimum export price of 80 cents a pound, fob, will add a more aggressive edge to the 20 per cent export retention plan already in place. The move, agreed last Friday at a meeting in Guatemala City, followed a similar decision by neighbouring Colombia, the world's second biggest coffee producer after Brazil. Colombia's minium export price is set at 92 cents a pound. Under the retention plan adopted by the world's major coffee exporters on October 1, 20 per cent of arabica coffee is withheld from the export market while the International Coffee Organisation's composite indicator price remains under 75 cents a pound. The Guatemala City meeting which was attended by officials from Colombia and from other Central American countries, was called to assess progress on the retention plan, which was introduced at the beginning of the 1993-94 coffee year. In a bullish mood delegates said that all the countries present, which represented the bulk of the world's arabica exports, were complying with the retention scheme, the effect of which would soon begin to be felt in the market. 'The plan is meeting its objective,' said Mr Herbert de Sola, El Salvador's chief coffee negotiator. 'In three months consumer stocks have dropped by 4m bags (60kg each).' In the three months from October 1, Central American exports reached 1.1m bags, with a further 250,000 bags retained in bonded warehouses in the region, he said. According to Mr Rene Montes, Guatemala's ambassador to the International Coffee Organisation, the preliminary estimate of Central America's exportable crop for this year was 8.5m bags, down sharply from the 11.8m bags exported in 1992-93. But the final export figure would be under 7m bags if retention was applied at 20 per cent throughout the year.</p>

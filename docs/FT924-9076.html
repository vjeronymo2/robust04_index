			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Project still stuck on the shelf: The British Library's new building has a troubled history Dr Brian Lang, the eloquent Scottish anthropologist who is chief executive of the British Library, is a frustrated man. The delay announced this week to the opening of the library's controversial new building beside St Pancras station in north London has led to a reprise of stories about the project which portray it as another great British disaster. Cost overruns, bad project management, architectural design criticised by the Prince of Wales, protests from users who are reluctant to leave the historic British Museum reading room in Bloomsbury - it has a familiar ring. Now problems with the paint finish of 300km of moveable shelving will delay the opening of the library - set five years ago for March 1993 - by at least 18 months. But while Dr Lang describes himself as 'desperate' to get into the building, he is equally frustrated by the negative publicity for the new library. 'The building is a bold project, imaginative and full of flair,' he says. 'It will be a centre of excellence when it is opened, and one that the nation can be proud of.' Yet almost since its inception, the new British Library has been dogged by controversy and financial problems. Conceived in a 1971 white paper, the plans have repeatedly fallen victim to pressure on public expenditure. No sooner had the then education secretary Shirley Williams given the go-ahead to the first phase in 1978, than a change of government and intense pressure on public spending led to delays and budget cuts. When work eventually started in 1982, money was so short that only half of the first phase was begun, creating a building that would have been all but useless had the other half not been completed. Each year thereafter, the Office of Arts and Libraries (OAL), doled out whatever money it had managed to wring out of the annual public expenditure round. Hardly surprising, then, that a 1990 report on the project from the National Audit Office suggested that this annual drip feed had wasted resources. The same report also found that the early stages of building had been dogged by a bizarre project management system which could only have been tolerated in a non-commercial environment. The money for the new library came from the OAL budget, but was spent by the Property Services Agency, the government's property maintenance and building wing. The OAL and the Library were supposed to be involved in managing the project through a committee which did not meet for more than three years - leaving the OAL with little authority or control over the project. This was not an unusual arrangement for big public works at the time, but the inevitable consequence was steeply mounting bills. The first phase had originally been costed at Pounds 116m, but no overall budget was set for the project. By 1986, the government was sufficiently worried about the cost to set up a review which for the first time set a ceiling on the whole project of Pounds 450m. Of this, Pounds 280m was for the first phase, 140 per cent more than the 1979 estimate. Much of this increase, according to the National Audit Office, was caused by rising building costs in the London property market (some of which might have been curbed if the whole project had been put out to tender at a fixed price from the outset). The NAO found that the real increase in the cost of this phase of the project was just Pounds 25m - a 20 per cent increase in real terms which stands comparison with cost overruns in other big civil engineering projects. Following the review, new management structures were put in place, including the appointment by the OAL of a project manager from the private sector. Responsibility for accounting for spending on the project was shifted from the Property Services Agency to the OAL, to strengthen client involvement and accountability (a change now extended to all large building projects). But just as the government began to get a grip on the management of the project, two new rows created public relations disasters for the move to St Pancras. The first was a broadside from the Prince of Wales against the design of the new building by architect Colin St John Wilson. In the BBC Omnibus documentary, A Vision of Britain, the Prince said that the new reading room looked like 'an assembly hall of an academy for secret police', while the Victorian Gothic wonder of St Pancras station next door looked more like what a library should be. The second was a campaign by a vocal group of academics and writers to retain the magnificent reading room in the British Museum, used by Karl Marx, W B Yeats and Bernard Shaw among others. The Bloomsbury reading room is only one of nine in London offering access to the library's users, and the desire to concentrate all activities under one roof had been a strong motive for relocating the 18m books to a single building. This cuts little ice with aficionados of the British Museum's vast dome, such as Professor Ben Pimlott, whose biographies of Hugh Dalton and Harold Wilson were largely researched under it: 'I have yet to meet a consumer who is in favour of moving. The bureaucrats don't realise that study requires an ambience as well as machinery. But it's not just the forced move from the great rotunda into an oversized public lavatory: the service and facilities in the British Museum are more than adequate.' Dr Lang disagrees strongly, citing the superior service which the library will be able to offer at the new St Pancras site. Users will have computerised access to all the library's stock in one place, with delivery of books to the user's desk within 30 minutes, rather than the 90 minutes now typical at the museum reading room. While plans to triple the number of reading room seats have been considerably scaled back by the need to find economies, there will be ample space, he says, for all who need to use the library. More important, the new building offers much better conditions for conserving the stock, which includes valuable heritage items such as the Magna Carta. The current storage facilities are often unsuitable for preserving the printed word, with condensation running down the walls of some rooms. 'We are showing thousands of people around the new building each year,' says Dr Lang, 'and the reaction is invariably that it is a marvellous building which greatly exceeds their expectations of what it would be like.' All the more frustrating, then, that problems with the shelving should have led to this week's delay in opening. For, once the new building is opened - probably at the end of 1994 - much of the criticism can be expected to melt away. Until then, Dr Lang must reconcile himself to further bouts of frustration as this long-running epic moves to its final act.</p>

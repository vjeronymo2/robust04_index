			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the banning of the activities of the  Hungarist Movement, the operations of the World National  People's Rule Party [VNP] have also been declared illegal.    With its first degree ruling, the Budapest Metropolitan  Court  has effectively dissolved the VNP. The court established that  the activity of the party led by Albert Szabo offends the rights  of people to live in dignity, which are enshrined in the  Constitution. It also offends the rights of the individual and  breaches regulations that determine the rights of association.  The court's ruling is not absolute.</p>

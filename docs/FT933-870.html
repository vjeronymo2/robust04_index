			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / People: Price Waterhouse Jermyn Brooks (above) has been elected chairman of Price Waterhouse in Europe in succession to Sir Geoffrey Bowman, who announced his retirement earlier this year. Brooks, 54, was partner in charge of PW in Germany, and is currently joint managing director of PW in Europe. He has been a member of the PW European management board since 1989. As chairman, he will have responsibility for helping shape the future direction of the firm, though he said yesterday he was still determining his three or four main priorities. The PW European organisation was formed through the combination of all the firm's European operations, including those in the UK, which contribute about half total fees. There is some degree of cost- and profit-sharing within the firm's 138 different offices in 28 countries across the continent; revenues were Pounds 775m in the year to June 30. Brooks joined PW in 1962 and transferred to Frankfurt in 1967 where he became a partner in 1973. He was in charge of the Iran practice during 1977-79, set up the firm's operations in Turkey in 1981-85, and then led the audit and management consultancy operations in Germany. He has both English and German accountancy qualifications.</p>

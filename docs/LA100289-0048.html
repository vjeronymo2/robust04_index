			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN LION  </P> <P> The Wildlife Protection Initiative would indeed prohibit trophy hunting of the  California mountain lion, but would not restrict hunting of any other species.  </P> <P> In fact, the initiative would protect extensive areas of habitat for a wide  variety of wildlife, specifically including deer.  </P> <P> The dramatic decline in the numbers of deer in California is largely a  reflection of habitat loss. This decline can only be stopped if enough deer  habitat is acquired to protect remaining deer (and mountain lion) populations.  </P> <P> The hunting community should support the initiative, since it offers the only  real hope that deer habitat will be preserved for generations to come in both  Northern and Southern California.  </P> <P> Anglers should also support the initiative, since fishing streams throughout  the state would also be improved.  </P> <P> GERALD H.

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DON'T SEND BROOKE, SAUDIS TELL U.S.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia has asked the organizers of celebrity visits to the American  troops to withdraw a visa application for Brooke Shields, an informed source  said today.  </P> <P> The reason was not immediately known.  </P> <P> But the planned appearance of Shields, known in the West as an actress and a  model, may have offended Saudi authorities who have strict rules governing the  appearance of women.  </P> <P> Most women in the country appear in public completely veiled, and the sexes do  not mingle outside private homes.  </P> <P> The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Saudi Embassy in  Washington had conveyed the request to the U.S. government and that Shields  would not visit U.S. troops in the kingdom.  </P> <P> Even 87-year-old comedian Bob Hope, expected here just before Christmas, is not  scheduled to perform. Shields has been a staple on recent Hope shows.  </P></p>

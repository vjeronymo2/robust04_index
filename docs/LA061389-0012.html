			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS FOLLOW GIBSON'S NEW LEAD, 9-2  </P> <P> Was putting Kirk Gibson in the leadoff role an inspired move? Only time will  tell.  </P> <P> For the present, however, the Dodgers can't help but be inspired by it.  </P> <P> In joining with Willie Randolph to form a team within a team at the top of the  lineup, Gibson provided a catalytic punch Monday night as the Dodgers made it  two in a row over the Cincinnati Reds and salvaged a split of the four-game  series, 9-2.  </P> <P> A Dodger Stadium crowd of 28,161 saw Gibson single to open a two-run first  inning, triple to open a one-run third and single with one out in the fifth to  put the fourth run in scoring position.  </P> <P> He also walked in the seventh, when Randolph delivered his second double of the  game, driving in two runs.  </P> <P> Gibson went from first to third on the first of those doubles and from first to  home on the second, running out from under his helmet and waving his right arm  as he crossed the plate -- a scene reminiscent of last summer.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who had scored only three runs in the last 30 innings and  collected only 14 singles in the first three games of the series, got a triple,  three doubles, eight singles and a two-run homer by Dave Anderson in a  continued awakening that will put Manager Tom Lasorda back in the third-base  coaching box for the third consecutive game tonight.  </P> <P> And if the remodeled lineup has truly revitalized the offense, the test will  come tonight when Mike Scott, 10-3 overall and 3-0 against the Dodgers this  season, pitches the opener of a three-game series for the sizzling Houston  Astros, who have won 10 consecutive road games and are coming off a 10-1 home  stand.  </P> <P> Mike Morgan, who had lost three of his last four decisions, was the beneficiary  of the rare onslaught Monday night, but Ricky Horton and John Wetteland  provided flawless relief as the Dodgers inched to within 6 1/2 games of the  idle Astros, who lead the National League West.  </P> <P> The Reds trailed only 4-1 and had the bases loaded with no outs when Horton  relieved Morgan in the seventh, got Jeff Reed to ground into a run-scoring  force play, popped up Luis Quinones and then yielded to right-hander Wetteland,  who struck out Joel Youngblood and went on to retire the next six Reds,  striking out three as he registered his first major league save.  </P> <P> Morgan, who allowed a first inning homer by Todd Benzinger, gave up only two  more hits before the Reds loaded the bases in the seventh on three in a row.  </P> <P> Morgan's league-leading earned-run average climbed from 1.47 to 1.59 and his  record went to 5-4.  </P> <P> Gibson led off for the first time in Sunday's game. He went 0 for 3, but walked  and scored the first run of a 3-1 victory after Randolph's hit-and-run single.  </P> <P> Now, after only two appearances as leadoff hitter, Gibson has scored four runs,  providing a fresh approach for his team and himself. He was one for 17 before  Monday night's three hits and two walks.  </P> <P> "Gibson plays one way and that's to win," Red Manager Pete Rose said, adding,  however, that he has some doubt that the Dodgers can win with Gibson in the  leadoff role.  </P> <P> "It really seems to have helped him batting leadoff," Rose said, "but he's not  a leadoff hitter. He got things going for them tonight, but he'll have to hit  some home runs for them to win."  </P> <P> Said Lasorda: "I hate to have him bat leadoff as well, he really should be in  the No. 3 position, but we needed a spark. What more can you ask for from the  numbers one and two hitters?  </P> <P> "I mean, we scored nine runs. Did it matter that Gibby didn't hit a homer?"  </P> <P> Of course, who's to say Gibson won't homer as the leadoff hitter. Gibson  wouldn't say it.  </P> <P> "My approach is the same if I'm hitting first or third," he said. "I'm trying  to get on, be aggressive, make things happen. We're looking for the right  chemistry and I'm not a stingy player."  </P> <P> Randolph, meanwhile, has raised his season's average to .291 by batting .342  over his last 36 games. He is also batting .433 when in the No. 2 spot, and  said that in the last two games he is "definitely seeing better pitches" with  Gibson on base and a threat to run.  </P> <P> "I still think he's an ideal No. 3 hitter, but we needed him up there, we  needed to get something going," Randolph said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers got it going against Rick Mahler (8-6). Alfredo Griffin had two  singles and scored twice. Mike Davis had a 395-foot sacrifice fly and single.  Anderson scored one run with a squeeze bunt single and then powered his first  home run since Aug. 21.  </P> <P> The Dodgers lifted their .226 batting average two points and their spirits  considerably more.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> The Dodgers brought infielder Mariano Duncan off the disabled list and put  outfielder Chris Gwynn on the 15-day disabled list with a stress fracture in  his right foot . . . Gwynn believes that he suffered the injury during the  recent series in Houston but isn't sure how. An X-ray taken in Atlanta was  negative, but continuing discomfort led to a bone scan Monday and disclosure of  the fracture.  </P></p>

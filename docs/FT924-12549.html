			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hafslund Nycomed buys Spain's Laboratorios Leo HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its X-ray imaging products, has announced the acquisition of family-owned Spanish pharmaceuticals company Laboratorios Leo for NKr171m (Dollars 28.45m). The acquisition was made through its Nycomed Imaging subsidiary, which intends to build a sales and distribution network in Spain. Nycomed Pharma, another Hafslund subsidiary, will utilise Laboratorios as a channel through which to sell its products. 'The Spanish company gives Nycomed Pharma a presence in an important European market for pharmaceuticals, which enables a future introduction of (Nycomed Pharma's) proprietary and/or in-licensed products in the Spanish market,' Hafslund said. In 1992, Laboratorios expects to achieve good profitability on estimated sales revenue of NKr120m, Hafslund said.</p>

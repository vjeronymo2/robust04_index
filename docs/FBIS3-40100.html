Could the mainland civil  service system really be implemented on schedule? Does the  mainland have the fiscal ability to support the system? What are  the special characteristics of the mainland civil service  system? There are countless questions and discussions. This  writer called on the relevant agencies responsible for  implementing the civil service system in China to answer these  questions. I will first lay out the views of the relevant  authorities, in hopes of allowing our friends overseas to  understand the strengths and weaknesses of the mainland's civil  service system.    Deng Xiaopeng's speechmaking on his inspection tour of the  South in 1992 opened a new page in the history of reform in the  mainland. At the end of that year, the leadership of the Chinese  Government discussed and passed in principle a draft proposal  submitted by the Ministry of Personnel on the implementation of  a civil service system. In 1993, the relevant agencies launched  even more enthusiastic publicity to hasten the legislative  process on a civil service system and finally pushed through the  "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System." When  this regulation appeared in the headlines of the mass media, it  indicated that the time was ripe for the implementation of a new  personnel management system in national administrative organs  and demonstrated that the mainland had increased the strength of  the political system reform.    What is the significance of China implementing a civil  service system? Perhaps its like the often heard saying "an  outsider can see more clearly." The comments of some foreign  analysts are quite insightful. One Western scholar says China is  in the middle of a reform of basic systems. They understand that  if the government does not reform the personnel system, it will  not be possible to solidify the achievements of economic reform.  How true this is. Chinese communist policy makers soberly  recognize that to intensify the reform of the economic system,  they must also proceed with corresponding reforms of the  political system and must establish a scientific personnel  management system. The implementation of a civil service system  is an important "move."    Some friends worry that with fiscal difficulties in the  mainland, the government will not be able to muster enough  capital to raise salaries for civil servants. It is reassuring  that the highest policy making regime in the mainland has made  appropriate arrangements. According to disclosures, this  salary increase for functionaries will be on a greater scale  than any previous increase, to gradually correct the problem of  relatively low wages for government workers. It was also decided  that every agency and every area would begin calculating wages  based on the new salary rates on 1 October 1993, regardless of  when they complete the reform.  <H5>  Eight Years of Exceptionally Difficult Work </H5>   The cadre personnel system currently in use in the mainland  began during the war years and developed gradually after 1949.  Workers in party and government organs, enterprise management  personnel, scientific and technical personnel, teachers,  doctors, performers, and athletes were all called "national  cadres" and were managed in the same way. This type of  management method is well-suited to a highly centralized and  unified planned economy and served a positive function in the  past. With reform, however, in the economic system and in the  fields of science and technology, education, and culture, the  traditional personnel system is less and less suited to the new  circumstances and its drawbacks are more and more serious.  Mainly, the concept of "national cadre" is too broad and lacks  scientific categorization. The delineation of management  authority is too centralized, the management methods are  antiquated and unvaried, and the personnel assignment system is  not sound. As a result, talented individuals are not able to  shine, and corrupt practices are difficult to avoid. As early as  1980, Deng Xiaopeng, the chief architect of opening and reform,  raised the issue of reforming the personnel system. He called  for the "courageous breakdown of old conventions and of  organization and personnel systems not suited to reform"; and  the establishment of new systems for the election, admission by  examination, appointment and removal, assessment, impeachment,  rotation, tenure of office, administrative retirement, and  retirement of cadres. In keeping with the arrangements made by  the State Council, in 1984 the relevant agencies began drafting  regulations on a national civil service system. In 1987, the  13th National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party  formally decided to implement a civil service system. In 1989,  the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System"  were circulated nationwide for comment. In early 1990, all 29  provinces, autonomous regions, and directly ruled municipalities  (with the exception of Taiwan) of the entire nation, 14 cities  with individual plans, and 66 central government agencies  submitted feedback to the Ministry of Personnel. At the 14th  National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in  October 1992, Jiang Zemin called for the "earliest  implementation of a national civil service system." After eight  years, the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service  System" have finally emerged, fusing together the painstaking  efforts of numerous people.    To test the feasibility of the "Temporary Regulations on a  National Civil Service System" and to seek experience with the  implementation of the civil service system, in early 1989, six  organizations including the State Auditing Administration, the  General Administration of Customs, the State Statistical Bureau,  the National Environmental Protection Agency, the State Tax  Bureau, and the State Administration of Building Materials were  designated as pilot agencies for the new system. In 1990,  Harbin, a city in the North and Shenzhen, one in the South, were  also selected as pilot locations. During the past five years,  the pilot locations have produced laudable results. The main  indicators are:    Government organs have once again become a priority choice  for people seeking employment. The civil service system hires  personnel via public examinations for those seeking to enter  government organs. Just this provision alone touches the hearts  of young people in their prime. They are clearly aware that life  in a government organ is spartan but they still list employment  in a government organ as a priority choice. From 1989 to 1991,  six government agencies under the State Council held three  examinations to recruit staff to fill gaps in non-leadership  positions. A total of 4,585 registered for the examinations to  fill 401 positions. After a written examination, oral  examination, physical examination, and assessment, 327 people  were hired. The ratio of examination registrants to hirees was  as high as 14.7 to 1. The layers of government are the nerve  system of the nation. A nerve system must be of top quality in  order for the nation it leads to have top quality administrative  efficiency, top quality economic benefits and top quality labor  productivity.    The system also promotes the development of honest  government  in government organs. Certain policy errors committed in the  past by government organs were, no doubt, related to the  thinking and work style of officials, but the organization  system and work system were also important factors. The hiring  system for civil servants can overcome unhealthy practices in  personnel assignments. The systems of assessment, discipline,  and rewards and penalties can inspire cadres to actively seek  self-improvement. The anti-nepotism system can avoid the  detrimental effects of family relationships and interpersonal  relationships. The top leadership at the State Statistical  Bureau led the way on eliminating nepotism in work assignments  and transferred relatives of two of the Bureau's Assistant  Directors out of the Bureau. The customs system implemented  anti-nepotism in official duties. When workers are carrying out  official duties which involve a relative, they must voluntarily  explain and practice avoidance. The National Environmental  Protection Agency had planned to add 30 personnel before  entering the pilot program. As soon as the word was out, the  officials in charge received over 200 letters seeking favors on  behalf of others, thus creating much difficulty for this effort.  In 1989 and 1990 this agency held two public examinations to  recruit personnel and not a single person asked for favors.    The system enhanced the vigor of the cadre ranks. In  carrying  out the civil service system, the pilot units and pilot cities  broke through the long-standing practice of cadres winning  promotion but never demotion and entering but never exiting the  system. Within their authorized hiring limitations, the six  pilot agencies chose a total of over 300 superior individuals.  Among these, most were from enterprise and commercial units. Due  to the intense competition, the newly hired personnel usually  have superior political and substantive qualifications and the  distribution of ages and fields of expertise are also more  reasonable. After being hired, they quickly fill positions and  quite a few have become key workers. In keeping with the  regulations in the civil service system on promotion and  demotion, the pilot units promoted superior civil servants and  demoted, relieved of duties, dismissed or transferred out the  small minority of civil servants who did not perform well.  Because there is a law, references, and procedures, promotion  and demotion is all done smoothly. Everyone feels that there is  a future and value in working in a government organization but  they also feel the pressure where "public meals are not that  easy to eat." The mainland's civil service system, is not only  developed out of China's national characteristics as a bold new  creation, but also borrows from advantageous methods used by  foreign nation's personnel management systems, which reflect  modern personnel management patterns. It really is a system  which is suited for the socialist market economy system and will  gradually develop into a scientific, legalized system of  government organization personnel management. Its main  characteristics are:    One is that it reflects the principle of differentiated  management. The national civil service system is primarily used  in government organizations and is different from the personnel  management system used in enterprise and commercial units. This  is a change from the previous method of using a single model for  management.    Two is that it includes scientific mechanisms for  encouraging  competition. The hiring method for functionaries uses public  examinations, with strict testing and hiring of only the best  candidates. The system uses procedures prescribed by the law to  assess civil servants and to use the assessment results as the  primary basis for awards and penalties, promotions and demotions.    Three is that it includes mechanisms for normal turnover of  employees. These include normal retirement, exchanges,  appointments, maximum age limits on tenure of office,  resignations, and relief of duties. Civil servants can enter and  leave the system and the civil service ranks will remain full of  vitality.    Four is that it has mechanisms for guaranteeing diligent and  honest government. Diligent and honest government is a  fundamental requirement for civil servants and is a constant  thread in a civil service's obligations and rights, discipline,  hiring, promotions, assessments awards and penalties and other  systems and stages. At the same time there are nepotism and  other specific regulations which also promote honesty and  self-discipline in civil servants.    Five is that it is a complete system of laws and  regulations.  The "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System"  is the general law on the civil service system. The Ministry of  Personnel and other agencies under the State Council have  already, or are in the process of, formulating individual laws  and regulations and implementation rules to form a more complete  system of laws and regulations and provide a legal basis for  civil service management. Some overseas friends mistakenly  believe that the civil service system which China is now  implementing is similar to the civil service system in western  countries. Actually this is a great misunderstanding. The  mainland's civil service system adheres firmly to that which  suits China's national characteristics and China's special  style. It continues and carries forward well the Chinese  government's experience and tradition of effective cadre  management, and it has basic differences with the West's civil  service system. A contrast of the similarities between the  Chinese and foreign civil service systems can best explain the  issue. The laws and regulations in England and the United States  on the promotion of civil servants are closely linked to work  quality, quantity and ability. The regulations in the mainland's  "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" not  only include the above elements but also adhere to specific  requirements for individuals to have both ability and integrity  and that people be appointed on their merits.    Now, China has the "Temporary Regulations on a National  Civil  Service System" which suits China's national situation, five  years of pilot project experience, and many individual systems  which are practical, clearly focused, and very operable (such as  hiring by examination, anti-nepotism, and others which are  already in use throughout the nation). There is a group of  backbone elements from the top to the bottom. It is especially  true that with the support of the highest leadership of the  Chinese Government and of the masses of the mainland, the  implementation of the civil service system in the mainland had  several advantageous conditions. Thus, one can believe that from  1 October 1993, with organization reform as a foundation, in  three years or a little more time, the civil service system will  be basically established in the entire country, and later it  will gradually be perfected. This clearly can be accomplished.    In his speech during his inspection tour of the South in the  Spring of 1992, Deng Xiaopeng said "Whether China's affairs will  be handled well, whether socialist reform and opening up can be  maintained, whether the economy can be developed quickly, and  whether the nation can live for a long time in peace, in a  certain sense the key is people." The implementation of a civil  service system in China has grasped this key concept at a  fundamental level. The strengthening of this reform action has  important practical and historical significance in the  establishment of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

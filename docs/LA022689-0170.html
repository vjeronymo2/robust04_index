			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLISH PAPER PRINTS RARE ACCOUNT OF '81 SHOOTING OF 9 MINERS  </P> <P> An official Polish newspaper Saturday published a rare account of the police  shooting of nine miners in 1981, the bloodiest confrontation during a crackdown  that suppressed the Solidarity trade movement.  </P> <P> The killings near the southern city of Katowice have become a symbol of the  brutality of the effort to suppress the Soviet Bloc's only independent trade  movement.  </P> <P> "In order that wounds could cure completely, it is necessary to expose them . .  . ," said the article in the weekly Odrodzenie, or Rebirth.  </P> <P> The battle began when miners went on strike to protest authorities' attempts to  quash Solidarity.  </P> <P> The article quotes witnesses who described how police entered the Wujek mine in  a tank and armored personnel carriers and attacked the miners with tear gas,  water cannons and grenades.  </P> <P> "We saw the tank enter the mine's ground, breaking the barricade we had  erected," the article quoted Kazimierz Rembilas, a former mine employee, as  saying. "Then shots were fired. In the noise and chaos one could not see who  was shooting and from which direction. There was a moment of shock. I heard  cries: 'They are killed.' Even then I could not believe they were shooting at  us."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Overview Comparison of Booster NPRM and Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule adopts most of the proposed amendments, with the following changes. The rule makes minor changes to the definition of a booster seat for clarification purposes. The rule corrects errors in the specification of the test apparatus used for belt-positioning booster seats, and does not require metric units on the child seat label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Amendments for Belt-positioning Seats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate the manufacture of belt-positioning seats and to distinguish those child seats from other types of seats for testing and labeling purposes, NHTSA amends Standard 213's definitions in three ways. The first amendment is to include belt-positioning booster seats in the present definition of ``booster seat.'' NHTSA defines a belt-positioning seat as a type of booster seat because belt-positioning seats and present booster seats serve similar functions, i.e., both function to bridge the transition of the child from toddler or convertible child restraints to the vehicle belt systems. (A convertible restraint is specially adjustable so that it can be used rear-facing by an infant or a very young child, and forward-facing by a toddler. A ``toddler'' child restraint positions a child forward-facing only and is not capable of being adjusted to face an infant rearward.) It is also advantageous to place belt-positioning restraints in the same category as present (shield-type) boosters, because both types of child restraint systems appear to pose similar potential misuse problems. That is, both could be inappropriately used by children who are too small to be adequately restrained by a child booster seat. Similar countermeasures, such as labeling and instructional information, can be developed to address those misuse problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second amendment defines a belt-positioning seat. ``Belt-positioning seat'' is defined as:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A child restraint system that positions a child on a vehicle seat to improve the fit of a vehicle Type II belt system on the child and that lacks any component, such as a belt system or a structural element, designed to restrain forward movement of the child's torso in a forward impact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This definition is the same as the one proposed in the NPRM. Commenters were generally supportive of the definition. Volvo asked for clarification that the definition applies to both add-on and built-in belt-positioning seats. The definition so applies. Volvo's uncertainty appears to have resulted from several proposed requirements that were worded in such a way that they were appropriate for add-on seats, but not for built-in ones. (E.g., as proposed, S6.1.2.1.1 stated that a belt-positioning seat ``shall be secured to the standard vehicle seat'' using a lap/shoulder belt.) NHTSA has reworded those sections to clarify the distinction between add-on and built-in seats to avoid any suggestion that the definition does not apply to built-in belt-positioning seats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third amendment slightly revises the definition of ``booster seat.'' Standard 213 defines a booster seat as ``a child restraint which consists of only a seating platform that does not extend up to provide a cushion for the child's back or head.'' (S4 of 49 CFR &sect;571.213) The NPRM would not have changed that definition except to add ``or a belt-positioning seat'' to the end of it. Ms. Weber of the University of Michigan Child Protection Program (UM-CPP) said that such a change would be confusing because it implies_contrary to NHTSA's intent_that belt-positioning seats must not have seat backs. She suggested Standard 213 should better distinguish between the traditional shield-type booster, which may not have a back, and a belt-positioning booster which may, by naming the former a ``backless child restraint system.'' ``This will help clarify the fact that a Belt positioning seat can have a back.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA concurs that naming the backless type of booster seat will help distinguish the two types of child seat. As a result of today's amendment, ``booster seat'' encompasses two types of restraint system for older children who are still too small to sit directly on a vehicle seat and use a vehicle belt system. One type is the traditional shield-type booster used with a Type I belt; the other is the belt-positioning seat used with a Type II belt system. The commenter's suggestion will help clarify that a belt-positioning seat can have a back, and a child booster other than a belt-positioning seat cannot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The absence of a seat back for boosters other than belt-positioning seats is one of the main features that distinguishes a booster seat from a convertible child seat. The distinction is important for Standard 213 testing. The standard specifies that most restraints are to be anchored with only a lap belt during agency compliance testing. However, the standard permits a booster seat designed with a top anchorage strap (tether strap) to be tested at 30 mph with the tether attached. NHTSA permitted attachment of a tether for boosters to facilitate the manufacture of boosters that provide a harness system, rather than a short shield, for upper torso restraint. Some child safety researchers believed a harness system was superior to a shield in terms of abdominal loading, head and neck loading, submarining and ejection. (51 FR 5335.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cosco raised a concern about NHTSA's proposal to simply add ``or a belt-positioning seat'' at the end of the present ``booster seat'' definition. Cosco believed that the change would be inadequate because it would not allow shield-type boosters to have a seat back. (As explained above, under Standard 213's present definitions, a child restraint cannot have a seat back and be considered a ``booster seat.'' This restriction is to limit the numbers and types of child restraints that can be tested in Standard 213's 30-mph dynamic test with their tether attached.) The commenter said that safety data do not show a need to prohibit seat backs on booster seats. Cosco requested that the definition be reworded either to allow both types of boosters to use a seat back or to prohibit both from doing so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

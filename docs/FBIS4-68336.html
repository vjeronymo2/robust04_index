			<p>Plane   Project   <F P=102> 937Q0191 Moscow ROSSIYA in Russian No 9, 24 Feb-01 Mar 93 p  11 </F>  <F P=103> 937Q0191 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ROSSIYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Natalich, Chief Designer of NPO Molniya] </F>   [Text] The general trend in the improvement of space  vehicles is evident--to create aerospace systems which use more  economical winged flying vehicles for putting into space  payloads on the order of 5 tons.    Among the more promising projects for multipurpose, reusable  aerospace planes--MAKS "VTB+OS," "Interim-Khotol," and "Khotol  M,"--those which have the best chances for realization are the  ones which answer the set of requirements for a more complete  fulfillment of power-engineering specifications.    The projects for aerospace planes envision the use of liquid  hydrogen as fuel, and this substantially limits the  possibilities of their use for a number of reasons, but  particularly because of their low parameters of reliability and  safety. The general lack of experience in operating aerospace  systems on liquid hydrogen fuel casts doubt on the axiomatic  assertions about the high priority of the systems. The technical  director and supporter of the use of hydrogen fuel naturally can  boldly construct the simplest fuel tank in the world, and one  which is also the most complicated in its aerodynamic aspect and  technical utilization. But imagine to yourself the psychological  state of the crew of a MAKS or an AN-225-"Interim-Khotol" system  which is carrying on board a "hydrogen bomb," ready to explode  with the slightest leak in the tank of liquid hydrogen. It is a  known fact that in the case of mixture with air, detonation  takes place in a wide range (from 4 to 75%) of hydrogen  concentration.    However the need for reliable and inexpensive space vehicles  remains urgent.    A group of specialists, who have substantiated the  possibility of creating practical space aviation, have developed  an alternative project for an aerospace plane--"Promethues,"  which operates on hydrocarbon fuel. It most fully achieves power  engineering specifications, thus essentially differing from the  planes mentioned above. In calculating ballistics, strength,  engine characteristics, and other features, the generally  accepted methods were used and assumptions were based on real  and statistical data, taking into account the technical level  which has been attained to date.    A comprehensive analysis of various concepts on aerospace  planes according to other questions demonstrated that, as  compared to flying vehicles using hydrogen fuel, aerospace  planes on hydrocarbon fuel, which have minimal mass and  dimensions as a result of the high density of the fuel, when  combined with the lighter artificial earth satellites of the new  generation are preferable for the near future, since they are  superior in terms of all crtiteria without exception--economic,  technical, commercial, operational, technological, efficiency of  use, reliability and safety, building time, etc.    It should not be forgotten that attempts to use hydrogen  fuel  in aviation have proved to be ill-founded. A calculation of  technical economic indicators (in the prices of 1990) confirms  that, at present the world prices for putting into orbit a unit  of mass of a commercial payload, the expenditure for the  development of an aerospace system with aerospace planes on  hydrocarbon fuel at a rate of 40 launches a year will pay for  itself within two years. With improvement of operational  qualities and an increase in the number of launches to 80 per  year a profit of $ 13.8 billion can be expected over a five-year  period.    The saving in funds as compared to the carrier-rocket Soyuz  in combination with the space vehicle Progress amounts to 15.3  billion rubles. In this context one carrier-plane and four  aerospace planes can put into orbit a payload which is the  equivalent of the payloads of 800 Soyuz carrier-rockets with  Progress space vehicles.    In addition to this, aerospace systems with aerospace planes  using hydrocarbon fuel make it possible to economize on metal,  fuel, alienated lands, and other resources, which are becoming  ever more expensive.    The delay in starting the development of aerospace systems,  while financing non-priority activities and launches of  carrier-rockets with Progress space vehicles, is bringing  irrretrievable yearly losses of 0.6 billion rubles, or 1.6  million rubles per day.    The changes which have taken place make it necessary  basically to reformulate Russia's policy on the use of  circumterrestrial space, and to determine the most important  directions for research efforts in this area.    In this context it is necessary to take the following facts  into account:    1. The production of a considerable number of  carrier-rockets, (whose volume will correspond to the previously  planned program for space activities of the USSR for the period  1996-2010), with analogous aerospace planes and payloads will be  the task of enterprises in the Ukraine.    2. The The Baykonur Space-Launch Complex, which provided for  a significant portion of the launches of carrier-rockets of the  USSR, is now located in a foreign country.    3. The economic situation which is taking shape in the  Russian Federation is forcing a reduction of financing for space  programs, yet at the same time it is necessary to save the  aerospace industry from complete destruction and to provide  employment for the many factories which are connected with space.    In these circumstances the proposed concept for aerospace  systems offers the only realistic prospect for the develolpment  of practical astronautics for Russia in the near future,--and to  be specific:    1. Production facilities for an aerospace system are located  within the territory of the Russian Federation.    2. In the territory of Russia there is a sufficient number  of  the airdromes necessary for basing aerospace systems.    3. In Russia the infrastructure (production facilities, test  base, etc.) which is necessary for the production of  liquid-propellant rocket engines on hydrocarbon fuel, aerospace  planes, equipment, etc., has already been created.    4. Russia posseses trained cadres which have invaluable  practical experience in the development, production, and  operation of this type of technology.    5. The main features of the proposed aerospace system are  based on a level of technology which has already been attained  in Russia.    6. There is a backlog of uncompleted work in the creation of  reusable orbital spacecraft, in the development of new  construction materials and of more perfected hydrocarbon fuels,  with improved power and operational charcteristics.    7. As compared to other concepts, the builidng times, amount  of necessary financing, and technical risk are minimal.    To generalize what we have discussed above, we shall note  that with competent leadership in the field and the correct  allocation of funds (both state and private) Russia has a unique  opportunity to take up a leading position in the field of  inexpensive and reliable space vehicles for the delivery of  payloads into circumterrestrial orbit, and to capitalize on this  position in the form of concrete political and economic gain.</p>

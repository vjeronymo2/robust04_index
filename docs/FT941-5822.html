			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Observer: Odd omission Lady Thatcher was in fighting form yesterday as she lashed Europe's protectionist policies at the 'World Trade after Gatt' conference chaired by her old chum, Lord Parkinson. Europe, she said, should follow the example of the Asian tigers whose economies had thrived on international competition. Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea all got a plug as economies challenging the industrial supremacy of Europe and the US. But no mention of the fast-growing Malaysian economy. An odd omission, as was the sudden cancellation of Lady T's planned question and answer session.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> INFOMERCIAL TRADE ASSN. FORMED  </P> <P> Makers of infomercials, the program-length commercials of off-hour TV,  announced the creation of their industry's first trade association Thursday,  hoping to reduce regulators' scrutiny and ease consumers' fears.  </P> <P> "It gives us legitimacy in the eyes of Capitol Hill and consumers, and it  establishes us as a long-term industry," said Greg Renker, whose Palm  Desert-based Guthy-Renker Corp. markets self-help and motivational courses.  </P> <P> The "infomerchants" will be known as the National Infomercial Marketing Assn.  and will work with Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to develop  advertising standards for the industry, Renker said.  </P> <P> The industry, born in the mid-'80s, has attracted widespread publicity and  thousands of consumer complaints about false and deceptive advertising,  especially concerning infomercials that pose as talk shows and news specials.  </P></p>

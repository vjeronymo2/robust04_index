			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Elswick moves ahead 18% as margins improve MARGINS improved at Elswick, the packaging, paper and printing concern, as pre-tax profits expanded by 18 per cent from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 2.04m for the six months ended July 31. Turnover rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 31.6m, compared with Pounds 28.5m. The directors considered this a satisfactory outcome against the background of 'continued difficult trading conditions prevailing on most of our markets.' They added that because of the seasonal nature of some of these markets, profits would continue to be weighted towards the first half of the year. And that progress would be maintained. Pre-tax surplus for the period was after lower interest of Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 511,000) and subject to Pounds 510,000 (Pounds 431,000) tax. Undiluted earnings per share were 0.74p (0.63p) while the interim dividend is held at 0.15p. The directors stated, however, that they intended the final to represent a larger proportion of the total.</p>

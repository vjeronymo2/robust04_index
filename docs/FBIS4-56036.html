			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Konrad Sadurski: "NBP's Mandatory Empire"] </F>   [Text]The National Bank of Poland [NBP] has invested  over 4 trillion zlotys in savings banks that almost went  bankrupt. That amount was enough to enable NBP to take control  of several privately-owned banks, which is the reason  shareholders in those banks are suing NBP, and why some  politicians are critical of the central bank.    So far, NBP has invested over 1.650 trillion zlotys in  savings in the Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin. Then, NBP  supported the bank with an additional 150 billion zlotys, to  enable it to take over the Poznan-based Merkury bank.    Saving the Lodzki Bank Rozwoju cost NBP at least 1.152  trillion zlotys, for Prosper Bank the figure was 950 billion,  and for Interbank -- about 130 billion zlotys. NBP also  provided financial assistance to Warsaw-based Gecobank for its  takeover of Baltic Bank.  <H5>  Anti-Bankruptcy Nationalization </H5>   "Instead of privatization of the banking sector, we are  dealing with the repeated nationalization of some banks,  conducted by NBP. In addition, these NBP expenditures are  outside the control of parliament and the government,"  politicians say. Some of them also stress that this way, NBP is  spending taxpayers' money. But NBP refutes the accusations by  saying that the money for saving the banks comes from issuing  additional money.    Politicians also hold it against NBP for having persisted so  vigorously in its position that the money supply should not  exceed 150 trillion zlotys this year; NBP also refused to lend  more than 35 trillion zlotys to finance the budget deficit, and  given all that, it still decided to devote about 3 trillion  zlotys to save banks without much hesitation.    "Will this not cause an over-the-plan price increase?"  politicians ask. NBP says definitely not, because it had taken  the amount into account while planning on inflation levels. It  explains that making an application for declaring bankruptcy by  a large bank, could lead to a classic run on banks which would  cause a domino effect and bankruptcies by more banks. /The  first symptoms of a run on banks could be observed after the  submission of an application for bankruptcy by Interbank and  Baltic Bank,/ NBP reminds. It hopes that by taking over  financially "sick" banks, it will succeed in protecting the  entire system from customer panic.    NBP assures that after bringing a bank back to health, it  will sell its shares, maybe even through the stock market. It  admits that the process of bringing a bank to health may last a  few years, but -- according to NBP's expectations -- perhaps  someone will agree to invest in a bank which currently brings no  profit but will in the future.  <H5>  Clouds Over Empire </H5>   NBP's measures are supported by the Association of Polish  Banks of which almost all the country's banks are members. The  association admits that it has itself tried to convince the  central bank to financially support Interbank, and also to  facilitate Gecobank's takeover of Baltic Bank. But some bankers  are amazed at the fact that NBP -- as the supervisor of the  banking sector -- also controls those banks in which it is a  shareholder itself. "Regardless of the factual circumstances,  this casts a shadow over supervisory activities," bankers say,  and they suggest that supervision over banks be taken out of  NBP's structures.    Also shareholders of the banks which are taken over, are  critical of NBP. They do not like that NBP devotes almost the  whole share capital of a bank which is subject to takeover, to  cover the bank's losses. Despite the fact that -- as NBP  assures -- such utilization of share capital is in accordance  with the Code of Commerce, shareholders of the Lodzki Bank  Rozwoju and of Lublin- based Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank, have  filed a law suit against NBP.    NBP assures that takeovers of banks facilitate the regaining  of credits. In both cases of the mentioned banks, about 100  billion zlotys each were regained from shareholders and the  management so far.</p>

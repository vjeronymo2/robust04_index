			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WON'T BUDGE FROM PARK, GROUP SAYS;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: VOLUNTEER GROUP THAT FEEDS HOMELESS IN WEST HOLLYWOOD WILL FIGHT CITY  ORDER EVICTING THEIR PROGRAM FROM A PARK.  </P> <P> A West Hollywood volunteer group that has served food to the homeless every day  for the last three years says it won't budge, despite a recent order from city  officials to move the program out of city-owned Plummer Park.  </P> <P> Volunteers for the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, which is partially  funded by a $29,000 grant from the city of West Hollywood, said the city can  cut off the money, but cannot constitutionally prevent the group from serving  food to homeless people on public property.  </P> <P> "We have decided we are not going to leave, are not going to be treated this  way," said volunteer Ted Landreth. "We are citizens of this country, and the  homeless are too. This is a public park."  </P> <P> City staff on Oct. 17 sent a letter to coalition president Mike Dean telling  the group it would have to leave the park by Nov. 1.  </P> <P> City Council support for the program has slowly eroded in recent months after  reports of violence, intimidation and unsanitary conditions began to trickle in  from city park staff.  </P> <P> "A worse element of the homeless has come to make up the larger segment of the  total population they are serving. I have heard about some incidents of  violence among the people who come there for food," said City Councilman Paul  Koretz, who until recently had supported the giveaway. "The fact that the  coalition does not do any kind of screening and does not adequately supervise  the homeless has made this too dangerous a situation."  </P> <P> But volunteers at the program that serves as many as 200 meals a day scoffed at  "paranoid" reports to the City Council and maintained that their program is  clean, well-run, and even helps prevent violence. They said Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies have only been called to the site twice in the last two  years.  </P> <P> "We are a clean-running organization. We are putting people back on the streets  with a full belly instead of hungry," said coalition vice president Chip  Ermish. Ermish said turning some people away, such as those intoxicated with  alcohol or drugs, as suggested by City Councilman John Heilman, amounts to  "using food as punishment. We will not turn anybody away."  </P> <P> Ermish and volunteer Landreth criticized council members for relying on what  they said was second-hand information about the program.  </P> <P> "I have been a volunteer since we started, and what is astonishing to me is  that since 1986 only one member of the council has ever been around to see what  we do, much less to investigate complaints," Landreth said.  </P> <P> Councilman Steve Shulte, who has consistently supported the meal kitchen, has  visited the food giveaway on several occasions, at least once in Plummer Park.  Shulte said evicting the program from the park may complicate the problem, but  acknowledged  </P> <P> that some undesirable things are going on at the giveaway.  </P> <P> "It has a kind of rag-tag image. But after all, we are serving homeless people  who are very desperate, not Beverly Hills housewives," Shulte said. "Now I'm  afraid that not only are we going to have these homeless people out here, but  they are going to be hungry."  </P> <P> Shulte said he favors moving the giveaway from site to site to avoid  concentrating a problem in a single location, but said the program should  "tighten up so there are not going to be people who abuse others."  </P> <P> Though the program was originally slated to end Nov. 1, the council approved an  ambiguous resolution at its Oct. 16 meeting that coalition members interpreted  as extending the deadline to Nov. 6, which would have allowed them to come up  with alternative sites.  </P> <P> Coalition president Dean said he had understood that the food group would be  allowed to plead its case one last time at the council's first November  meeting. But on Oct. 20 he received a letter telling the group the council's  resolution had been "clarified," and that the group would have to be out of the  park by Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Koretz said he believed the food coalition "has an extension until Nov. 6, but  it is possible that because the resolution was so vague that staff could have  made the decision," to cut off the program as originally scheduled.  </P> <P> Coalition volunteers said they held last-minute negotiations with city Human  Services department officials, including director Lloyd Long, but that their  proposal to move the giveaway from site to site was rejected late last week.  </P> <P> But even if the city's order to vacate stands, food giveaway supporters believe  they are on firm legal ground for refusing to leave the park, even if they do  lose use of a city kitchen. One volunteer has even spoken to the nation's  leading homeless advocate, Mitch Snyder, about the city's order.  </P> <P> Snyder is the fiery, controversial, Washington activist who in recent years has  become an outspoken critic of the way local governments handle their homeless.  Snyder was the subject of a 1986 television movie, "The Mitch Snyder Story,"  starring actor Martin Sheen and praising his activism.  </P> <P> "Snyder knows these issues backwards and forwards, what one's rights are. They  (the city) have absolutely no right to throw you out of a public park," said  volunteer Landreth.  </P> <P> The food giveaway has been operating out of the park on the east side of West  Hollywood since August, 1988. The program was originally run from the Crescent  Heights United Methodist Church on Fairfax and Fountain Avenues, but was  ordered to move by the City Council last year after neighbors complained about  the program.  </P></p>

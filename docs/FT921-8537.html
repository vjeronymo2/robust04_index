			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Optimism in retail sector offers hope for economy A GLIMMER of light for the UK government over the economy comes with a Confederation of British Industry report out today, which indicates an increase in sales volumes in the hard-pressed distribution industry. The sector - retailers, wholesalers and car dealers - thinks sales volumes this month will be well up on a year ago. It also expects to order more goods from suppliers as the economy picks up. Although sales volumes in the sector remain depressed, the increased optimism will cheer government ministers who, ahead of the election, are looking for pointers that the economy is on the turn. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday said falling inflation and interest rates were increasing real earnings and would 'boost spending in high streets up and down Britain'. About 2.5m householders, whose mortgages are fixed annually, were due for substantial cuts of up to 3 percentage points, he said. The distribution sector - which reflects the fortunes of both manufacturers and consumers - has been among the industries worst hit by the 18-month recession. The CBI's latest report on the sector is cautious about predicting an upturn. Even so, its tone is more upbeat about growth prospects for the economy than recent government statistics, which have painted a picture of the UK stuck in deep recession. According to the survey, sales volumes for the industry rose unexpectedly last month compared with a year ago. However, the impact on company finances may have been diluted by the sharp price cuts introduced to spur demand. In the survey, covering 15,000 trade outlets, 40 per cent of distributors said they expected sales volumes this month to be higher than a year ago, with 24 per cent looking for a fall. Government figures due this week are thought likely to support the tone of the CBI study, and show that retail sales volumes showed a small increase last month on December's depressed levels. Other statistics are expected to indicate that the recession has so far lasted for six quarters. The CBI survey failed to impress the Labour party, which said signs of recovery were 'as remote as ever'. Clothing and shoe shops - which marked down prices drastically in January - saw a 'sharp turnround' in sales last month compared with a year before, according to the survey. The CBI said retailers of electrical household goods saw only modest increases. Business optimism 'declines', Page 6</p>

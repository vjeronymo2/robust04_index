			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Russian statement lifts aluminium CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM returned to the London Metal Exchange aluminium market this week after a Russian diplomat suggested that the flood of metal from his country that had been weighing down prices was over. Russia 'did not supply even one tonne of aluminium in January', Mr Pavel Smirnov, counsellor at the Russian mission to the European Community in Brussels, told the Reuter news agency. 'It is not in our interests to supply the market at low prices,' he added. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at the Ord Minnett trade house commented that this confirmed observations of significantly reduced rises in LME warehouse stocks of aluminium so far this year. Late last year, he noted, rises in the exchange's twice weekly stocks reportings had been running at between 15,000 and 32,000 tonnes a time, but in January the rate had slowed to a little over 6,000 tonnes. 'It would seem,' he said, 'that the metal which has been coming onto the exchange represents vestigial 1991 material in the pipeline.' Mr Moore also found comfort in Mr Smirnov's observation that 'it is hardly possible to imagine exports (of aluminium) rising (in 1992) because of many problems with raw materials supply'. While counselling caution, 'because rhetoric can often belie future actions', he said: 'This latest view, the announcement. . . about Norilsk (the biggest Russian smelter of nickel) more sensitively marketing its nickel in 1992 and other factors such as de-stocking, demilitarisation etc. do lend weight to our view that CIS shipments of metal to the west in 1992 will prove to be lower and less debilitating than the 1991 experience'. The market's response to Mr Smirnov's statement was to lift the cash aluminium price from the low of Dollars 1,207 reached in mid-week to Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, up Dollars 28 on balance. The Norilsk factor has also helped to get the nickel market back on its upward course late in the week. News that a compromise had been reached in the German steel industry dispute lifted values on Monday, although traders had already been playing down the likely impact of the threatened stoppage on overall European nickel demand (steel-making is the main end use for nickel). But a renewed retreat took the cash price to a low of Dollars 7,615 a tonne on Wednesday before it rallied to close yesterday at Dollars 7,895 a tonne, up Dollars 230 on the week. At the London bullion market the star performer was platinum, which re-established its price premium over gold. Once again the prospect of production cuts at Norilsk, where platinum is produced as a by-product of nickel, played a part in the rise, which took the price to Dollars 369 a troy ounce, up Dollars 20.75 on the week. Further impetus was provided by speculative activity at the New York Mercantile Exchange, encouraged by bullish chart patterns, and by talk that Impala of South Africa, the second biggest producer, had been buying platinum to cover supply commitments. Some traders were dubious, however, about the prospect for further gains, arguing that the market was overbought and that 'stale bull liquidation' was likely to emerge on any approach to the Dollars 380-an-ounce level. At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices continued to fall early in the week as any lingering hopes of real progress at this week's International Coffee Organisation meeting in London evaporated. Assessment of the market situation and consideration of possible measures to improve it has been left to a working group. The group ended its meeting yesterday morning and will meet not again until April 3, when it will prepare a report for presentation at the ICO meeting scheduled for April 6-10. Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombia's permanent London representative yesterday dismissed the meeting as 'an intellectual gymnastic excercise on a static bicycle'. Prices steadied in mid-week but were on the retreat again yesterday, when the May robusta price ended Dollars 12 lower at Dollars 886 a tonne, down Dollars 20 on the week. Cocoa prices were also under pressure and the May delivery position finished Pounds 48 down on the week at a five-month low of Pounds 713 a tonne. Dealers blamed persistent trade selling and investment fund liquidation encouraged by reports of higher-than-expected arrivals of Ivorian beans and bearish chart patterns.  ------------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS     (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------ tonnes Aluminium  +6,950 to 1,070,150 Copper     +1,625 to   310,225 Lead         +300 to   130,850 Nickel       +246 to    18,744 Zinc       +5,850 to   174,925 Tin          -630 to    13,010  ------------------------------------</p>

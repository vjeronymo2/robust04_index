			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A PONDEROUS SPOOF OF ARTIST-AS-INSIDER LEGEND;  </P> <P> BOONE BY BROOKS HANSEN AND NICK DAVIS SUMMIT BOOKS $19.95, 362 PAGES  </P> <P> To paraphrase the original, which I can't recall: the heavy-duty ostrich is a  hummingbird designed by a committee with cost overruns.  </P> <P> "Boone," a novel, is also designed by a committee. It is a committee of two;  and if novels are hardly ever written in tandem -- the two-man Ellery Queen and  Nordhoff's and Hall's "Mutiny on the Bounty" are all I can think of -- this new  example is altogether unlikely to start a trend.  </P> <P> Brooks Hansen and Nick Davis, according to a note at the end, were friends from  birth and graduated from Harvard together three summers ago. They have had the  notion of doing a fictional "Edie." This, for those who have forgotten, was an  account of the life and death of Edie Sedgwick, a rich waif who destroyed  herself young following the entourage of Andy Warhol. "Edie" was told by  patchwork snippets in the words of those who knew her. It was touching because  it was true, and because at least some of the witnesses were gifted and  observant.  </P> <P> "Boone" uses the same device, only the protagonist and the two dozen witnesses  are made up. It is not in the least touching, or gifted or observant . . . or  much else except 362 pages long, including a fictional chronology and two pages  of thanks to imaginary sources and real friends, editors, agent, and perhaps a  dedicatory inside joke or two.  </P> <P> Eton Boone is set up to be not a waif but a blazing comet, of the  beautiful-and-damned persuasion. His track is through the arts. He is a cabaret  comic, author of the blackest and most corrosive social commentary, a super  Lenny Bruce. He is an actor of rare gifts, a daring filmmaker, a talented  playwright, and a novelist who excites his editor.  </P> <P> None of these endeavors excites any wider public, outside of a circle of  friends, lovers, and intellectual cognoscenti. The cabaret act -- Boone does  what he calls "exposures" of political and entertainment figures -- does sell  out for a while, but it has to close owing to an excess of corrosiveness that  eats through its container.  </P> <P> The reader, who gets transcripts of the "exposures," descriptions of the film  and the play, and excerpts from the writing, is part of the wider and excluded  public. The stuff is terrible. How do you generate excitement around the search  for a bad artist?  </P> <P> Perhaps, though, he was a fascinating personage. So the two dozen witnesses  suggest. A number of them are lovers, both carnal and heavy-breathing Platonic.  The two categories include Hugh, a brilliant and taste-making professor; John,  a bookseller; Hilary, a step-brother; Harry, a journalist; Erin, a model, and  others. There are friends who are just friends, though also overwrought, as  well as mentors, critics, editors and impresarios.  </P> <P> It's all paean and no proof. The Boone that comes through is oversexed,  narcissistic, exploitative and vapid. He had a mother-fixation, and he  witnessed his father's adultery and took an unwitting part in it. This is the  key to the damned part; Boone ends up crashing a motorcycle and dying. As for  the beautiful, there are no signs of it.  </P> <P> It is possible, of course, for excitement to be generated around an empty  figure. It is the doughnut principle. But this requires that the witnesses  themselves possess qualities of passion, allure, and a gifted tongue. What  makes "Boone" a pretentious and turgid chore is that none of its witnesses have  anything to say, and they say it badly. We are at a party with nerds and  babblers praising someone who hasn't showed up. Even Hugh, the professor who  enchants his students, is a babbler.  </P> <P> "Oh," he tells us, "it's the kind of tragedy that leads one to believe in some  sort of divine being, that a man such as he be so targeted for pain."  </P> <P> At the back of the chum-authors' minds, "Boone" seems likely to be intended as  spoof, a parody of the artist-as-insider legend, and of the artist-insider,  legend-celebrity industry. But a ponderous, badly written 362-page spoof? A  knobby-legged, non-flying, 362-pound hummingbird?  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews Melissa Lentricchia, "No Guarantees" (William  Morrow and Co.).  </P> <P> </P></p>

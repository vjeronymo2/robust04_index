			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / People: In Shops settles its succession in-house After almost two years without a managing director, In Shops, the Birmingham-based property group specialising in retail centres and serviced offices, has appointed Derek Hine, 40, to the position. Hine joined In Shops in May 1991 as managing director of its main subsidiary, retail centres, but also took over running its executive centres last year, and was appointed to the board last December. After waiting until it was sure it had the right candidate, In Shops has now decided to name Hine group managing director, in succession to John Hoesli, who died in 1991. He will be responsible for day-to-day running of the group, while Tim Brookes, chief executive, will oversee strategy. Hine has 23 years of retail experience, firstly with Fine Fare, where he started as a Saturday boy in 1968 and rose to become buying director of meat and poultry. He spent a year with Dixons financial services division before being approached in 1988 to be director of Ranks Hovis McDougall Retail, running 300 cafes and bakery shops across the UK. He says his main challenge at In Shops will be trying to protect clients on the retail and office side from the effects of recession, which pushed In Shops' interim pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 903,000 last December. 'Times are tough but we are certainly not lying down and crying into our hands about how terrible the recession is. If the cake is diminished, we need to get a bigger share of the cake.'</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Russian turmoil halts oil slump POLITICAL turmoil in Russia helped produce a dramatic change in oil market sentiment this week, something desperate efforts by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries had previously failed to achieve. On Wednesday the price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery dropped by 30 cents to Dollars 17.70 a barrel - its lowest level since March. The following day, as thousands of supporters and opponents of Mr Boris Yeltsin held rival protests near Moscow's Red Square after the Russian premier's call for a referendum, the price rebounded by 50 cents, or nearly 3 per cent, Dollars 18.20 a barrel. It continued to move up early yesterday and reached Dollars 18.70 at one point in London but after news came in that Mr Yeltsin and representatives of Russia's legislature had agreed to resolve the crisis 'in strict accordance with the constitution', it dropped back again to Dollars 18.12. Russia is the world's biggest oil producer and it exports about 2m barrels of oil a day (b/d) to the west. Traders said they were worried that a deepening political crisis there might disrupt export supplies. Russia's output has already been falling dramatically. The change in sentiment was also aided by Iran's indication on Thursday that it was ready to cut production below the level allocated to it by Opec if prices remained weak. Then the US was hit by storms, which first swept through the mid-west. Yesterday the north east of the US was assailed by what forecasters suggested was one of the worst winter storms in recent years. They said the extremely cold weather would continue for at least a week. Wind, rain and snow stopped many traders getting to New York's commodity exchanges on time yesterday and business was very thin at the start of the day. Another of life's necessities - coffee - seems set to go up in price in retail outlets following a strong surge on world markets which took roasters by surprise. Reuter reported yesterday that European coffee manufacturers were considering increasing retail prices because the present rally might be the start of a long-term trend. Coffee's recovery since May, when the London Robusta price was Dollars 670 a tonne - its lowest since the early 1970s - to a 13-month high of Dollars 1,037 a tonne at one stage yesterday, has been helped by expectations of lower crop levels in Brazil and Colombia and the fact that the International Coffee Organisation is still hoping to negotiate a new price-support pact by the end of March. This would take effect when the present administrative accord expires in September next year. On the London Metal Exchange yesterday zinc prices were sent plummeting to Dollars 1,055 a tonne by the revelation that stocks in the exchange's authorised warehouses had risen by an astonishing 37,325 tonnes to a record 432,175 tonnes. This followed a 15,800-tonne rise reported by the LME on Tuesday and indicated a 14 per cent jump in one week. Traders said it was probably physically impossible for so much metal to have been delivered in such a short space of time so the zinc must already have been in warehouses for several weeks but not previously been registered as LME stock. They suggested the stock explosion resulted from the long-running series of squeezes on the LME's zinc market which caused the exchange's executive several times to warn traders it was closely monitoring the market. At one time in the summer the LME imposed a limit on zinc's daily backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery). After the initial shock yesterday, traders said investment fund buying emerged and the price recovered. Zinc for delivery in three months ended yesterday at Dollars 1,0975 a tonne, up Dollars 6.75 on the day but down Dollars 9.75 in the past week. Worries about Russian supplies also buoyed up the price of palladium, a precious metal which is part of the platinum group 'family' and is used by the electrical and dental industries and by car catalyst producers. Russia is the world's biggest supplier of palladium. The price rally, which has taken the palladium from Dollars 98 a troy ounce to last night's Dollars 112.50 in London - a 28-month peak - was started by private speculators in Tokyo. One trader suggested: 'Someone is squeezing the hell out of the market. If this was one of the London Metal Exchange metals, someone would be having his knuckles rapped for doing some naughty manipulation.'  --------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +6,475   to   1,493,775 Copper     +4,025   to     332,850 Lead       +1,675   to     205,700 Nickel     +1,320   to      66,276 Zinc      +37,325   to     432,175 Tin          +310   to      14,680  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

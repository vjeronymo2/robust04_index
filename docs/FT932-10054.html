			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Solving an art problem The idea of giving Lord Gowrie, boss of Sotheby's Europe, the chairmanship of the Arts Council when Lord Palumbo's term expires next March, sounds rather persuasive at first sight. During his time in government Gowrie, 53, was one of the few arts ministers who knew anything about the arts and as a published poet and former dealer in contemporary pictures he would enjoy mixing with his own kind. The stumbling block is whether he can square chairing the council and still keep his well-paid job at Sotheby's. Although Lord Palumbo turned it into a full-time post, it doesn't have to be so. His predecessor, Lord Rees-Mogg, got by with popping in twice a week. The difficulty is that the chairmanship of the Arts Council is unpaid and Gowrie is not rich, so he would probably want to keep his Sotheby's pay packet. This shouldn't pose much of an obstacle for Sotheby's. True, recent management changes have undermined Gowrie's role in the firm. However Sotheby's New York, which calls the shots, loves having a Lord on its letterhead, especially one with a high-profile job at the heart of the British establishment. The real problem may be concerns in Whitehall that Sotheby's, rather than the council, would gain most from any such appointment. The hunt for Palumbo's successor may not be over.</p>

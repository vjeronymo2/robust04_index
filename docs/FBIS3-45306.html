China agreed to  allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to investigate suspected  factories under certain conditions and to adjustments for  natural growth in some principal textile quotas proposed by the  Americans, while the U.S. side agreed not to impose the quota  reductions from 25 to 35 percent and not to send a fact-finding  mission.    An official of the China Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation said: Since the third Sino-U.S. textile  agreement expired on 31 December 1993, the two sides began talks  in September last year on renewal of the bilateral agreement.  But the two sides failed to reach agreement in the previous  three rounds of talks, so a fourth round was held in the last  three days. Under the principle of consultation on the basis of  equality and mutual understanding and accommodation, the two  sides made concerted efforts and finally reached a new agreement.    He pointed out: To reach agreement the two sides have made  concessions. China made concessions as follows: 1) China  agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to accompany  Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile factories on  the mainland suspected of engaging in illegal transshipment of  textiles, given approval of the Chinese side and the factories  concerned; 2) China agreed to major adjustments of the annual  natural growth in some principal categories of the textile quota  proposed by the U.S. side; and 3) if it is amply proven that  individual Chinese enterprises have engaged in illegal  transshipment and have done so once and again, China agreed to  accept some quota reduction but no more than three times the  amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally  transshipped. While the Americans agreed: 1) Not to imposed  the quota reductions from 25 to 35 percent demanded earlier; and  2) not to apply the anti-corruption random clauses [fan wu bi di  sui yi xing tiao kuan 0646 5294 1705 4104 7151 1942 1840 2742  2949], which allow the U.S. authorities to send special  fact-finding missions to China to investigate enterprises  suspected of violating the agreement.    The official added: Apart from the foregoing, the two sides  also made corresponding concessions on a number of important  issues. The concrete contents of the agreement and of the  concessions will not be published until later.    He continued: The key problem of the current negotiation  concerned the investigation of and cracking down on illegal  transshipments. Illegal transshipment refers to the practice of  some illegal businessmen, who transshipped textiles to the  United States by taking advantage of the balance quota of third  countries to avoid quota controls exercised by importing and  exporting countries. Such illegal transshipments only helped  those "intermediaries" and illegal businessmen to make a  windfall but damaged the interests of both countries.    He further pointed out: The illegal transshipment  jeopardized the normal order of textile trade between the two  countries and also led to chaos in the market. Therefore  measures must be taken to ban and crack down on the illegal  activities. As exporters in China, importers in the United  States, and middlemen in third countries were involved in the  illegal transshipment, which made the situation very  complicated, the two countries must join force to effectively  stamp out the illegal activities. The two countries have common  positions, interests, and objectives on this matter.    Regarding China's measures against illegal transshipment,  the  official said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation has formulated many laws and regulations and begun  to investigate relevant illegal activities in light of the  information collected by itself and supplied by the Americans.  In the last two years, China's relevant departments have taken  action against 17 enterprises and a foreign office in China.  China will reduce the quota of enterprises found guilty, revoke  their right of export, ban them from serving as middlemen, and  even withdraw their licenses. In the meantime, China will take  legal action against those people engaged in the illegal  activities. In the future, China will try to enforce relevant  laws in a more effective way and intensify cooperation with the  United States including exchange of information and joint  investigations.</p>

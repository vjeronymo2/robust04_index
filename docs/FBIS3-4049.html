Puqung stressed: We must cultivate new ideas compatible with a  socialist market economy, take bold steps to explore and  practice, earnestly carry out the responsibilities entrusted to  us by the Constitution and other laws, resolve problems  encountered in legislation with a reformist spirit, bring the  legislative work in step with reform and opening up, and push  forward Tibet's socialist democracy and legal construction to  help win new victories in reform and construction.</p>

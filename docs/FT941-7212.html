			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (6): No escaping the call of duty - Hong Kong They have been formally banned from cinemas, and top-ranking restaurants will remove them before the aperitifs arrive. But in all other daily activities - on the buses and underground trains, in the gyms and at the noodle stalls; in banks and post office queues - there is no escaping the call of the mobile phone. Telephones and staying in contact appear to be as embedded in the Hong Kong culture as eating and karaoke. Last year the colony's 6m population spent 1.31bn minutes on (outgoing) international calls, some 40 per cent of which were to China. More than 65 per cent have telephones; and analysts reckon around 5 per cent have cellular phones. According to Hongkong Telecom, there are 1.24m pagers on the streets, alerting people to messages as well as stocks and racing information. 'A lot of local people are entrepreneurs, and they have to keep in contact with others while on the move. Second, there is a strong fixed line infrastructure in Hong Kong which has cultivated a strong telecommunications culture,' says Mr Carl Wong, telecoms analyst with Wardley James Capel. The fixed line infrastructure, courtesy of Hongkong Telecom - which next July loses its monopoly to provide local telephone services - is so strong that analysts reckon the scope for head-on competition will be pretty thin. Not surprisingly, the competitors-elect disagree. Hongkong Telecom, 57 per cent owned by Cable and Wireless, charges residential users HKDollars 59.30 a month for the line rental plus HKDollars 9 a month for the rental of the equipment itself. But after that, everything  -bar international calls - comes free of charge, including all local calls. Further undermining the argument for commercial competition, anyone setting up in the local loop network generating international calls has to pay Telecom 92 per cent of the international revenues for delivery of the international part. Hongkong Telecom retains its monopoly on international services - the area which generates the bulk of its profits - until 2006. Mr Peter Howell-Davies, deputy chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, says early market research suggests the company's plans to launch a video on demand service will be well received. Telecom is launching a pilot scheme in July this year: all being well, a full service will be rolled out in early 1995. The company has also applied for a cable TV licence with effect from June 1996, when Wharf's exclusive franchise expires. Liberalisation of the fixed wire telecoms market first beckoned in 1992, sparking off a lengthy review. The government believes that competition will reduce costs for consumers, who will be able to save HKDollars 1.7bn in real terms over the next 10 years. Last December it unveiled the names of those whose bids to operate competitive local services against Hongkong Telecom had been successful: Hutchison Whampoa, Wharf Holdings and New World. All three are big conglomerates, better known for their involvement in property than telecoms. Hutchison Whampoa - barely a month before the government announcement - decided to write off its ailing UK CT2 business and clarify its exposure to the Personal Communications Network, a digital cellular-based service for two-way mobile communications. The write-off cost Hutchison HKDollars 1.42bn - which was coincidentally offset by profits made earlier in the year on the sale of Star TV - and the company vowed to plough some HKDollars 4bn capital into its PCN operations over the next three to four years. All three companies plan to enter the market with big budgets to fuel their proposals for large-scale fixed-line networks, and have hooked up with big-name partners to assist them in cashing in on the new market. Hutchison Communications is a joint effort with Telstra, Australia's state-controlled telecommunications giant; Wharf Holdings has teamed up with Nynex (US) to create New T&amp;T Hong Kong, and New World Development has a 65.5 per cent stake in a consortium made up of Infa Telecom Asia, US West and Shanghai Long Distance. Wharf is spending HKDollars 6bn on top of the HKDollars 5bn for Wharf Cable; Hutchison has earmarked HKDollars 3.5bn and New World Development's initial investment is around HKDollars 2bn. The companies themselves believe there is money to be made by competing head-on with Hongkong Telecom, and are looking at all the non-international services provided by the existing provider as fair game for competition. The switch from monopoly must be approved by China, which regains sovereignity in 1997, and all three companies plus their partners are now awaiting the green light from the Joint Liaison Group. Ironically, the government says the JLG should be discussing the issue of licences to the newcomers around March - the time when Mr Chris Patten, governor, is due to lodge the so-called controversial parts of his democracy bill to the Legislative Council. The four cellular operators - Hongkong Telecom CSL, Hutchison, Pacific Link and Smart Tone - are augmented by some 15 participants in the paging network and three CT2 operators. For Hong Kong's movers and shakers, spending around USDollars 1,00 to USDollars 1,500 on a piece of equipment that will ensure they can always be reached and stay in touch with their office is a small price to pay.</p>

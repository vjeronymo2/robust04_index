			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WYOMING GETS UPBEAT NATURAL GAS REPORT  </P> <P> Natural gas production in Wyoming could increase tremendously within a few  years, said a report Wednesday by the state Geological Survey.  </P> <P> Many favorable signs for increased production are cited in an article by Rodney  DeBruin, Oil and Gas Division head with the Geological Survey of Wyoming. The  report appears in the publication "Wyoming Geo-Notes No. 22."  </P> <P> The article points out that the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission  granted Union Pacific Resources' application to drill 100 additional gas wells  in the Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming. Union Pacific plans to drill and  evaluate 40 wells initially. The company estimates that each new well will  produce 3.5 billion cubic feet of gas.  </P> <P> Another favorable sign is the recent announcement by Enron Oil and Gas to  double production from the Big Piney Field in western Wyoming. Enron has  letters of intent for the transportation and sale of 50 million cubic feet of  Big Piney gas per day this year, increasing to 100 million cubic feet daily by  1992.  </P> <P> DeBruin's article indicates Wyoming is in a good competitive position for a  proposed natural gas pipeline to Kern County, Calif. A report by the California  Energy Commission rates Wyoming's pipeline as the best among several  alternatives. California could gain $14.6 billion from the pipeline, the report  said.  </P> <P> A proposal by Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. to build a Wyoming-to-California  pipeline was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Approval of  two other such proposals appears probable.  </P> <P> Another positive sign for increased natural gas production is that Southern  California Gas has lifted its opposition to the proposed Kern River pipeline.  It is estimated that a pipeline from Wyoming to California would increase  Wyoming's natural gas production by 180 billion cubic feet annually.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday, DeBruin said the preliminary estimate of Wyoming's  1988 natural gas production is 793 billion cubic feet, but he noted that as  much as 120 billion cubic of that is carbon dioxide from Exxon's plant in  southwest Wyoming.  </P> <P> A pipeline to California would help diversify Wyoming's markets for natural  gas, DeBruin said. The current markets for Wyoming gas are other places outside  Wyoming. "A lot of it goes back to the Midwest," DeBruin said. "Some of it goes  to the Pacific Northwest. Not much of it stays in Wyoming because there's no  (large) market for it."  </P></p>

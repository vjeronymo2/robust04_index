			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past six months, Israel has been involved  in solving local crises in foreign countries. Israelis are  currently in a CIS country on a mediation mission. Several  months ago, Israelis were engaged in a similar mission in  another country. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen  reports on this new Israeli involvement:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] In Jerusalem today, the widow of  late Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst was given the  peace award. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, the man who  conceived the Oslo track, today discussed a new reputation  Israel has been gaining: selling peace.    [Beilin] Two countries approached us after the Oslo  agreement and asked if we at the Foreign Ministry would be  willing to help them handle problems within their boundaries  involving disputes between the government and a violent  opposition element. In both cases, we were willing to offer our  good services. We were even glad to do it.    [Rosen] Beilin would not name the countries in question.  This activity is taking place under a thick veil of secrecy,  and even the Prime Minister's Office is not familiar with all  the details. We have learned that one of the countries is in  Latin America. The other is in Europe, where these very days  Israelis are shuttling back and forth in an attempt to mediate  between two rival camps engaged in a bloody and violent  struggle. So, after having been engaged in selling arms, are we  now selling peace?    [Beilin] First, I am not certain that the gains are  comparable. These services are given voluntarily. I certainly  hope that in the future, Israel will be able to really help  other places in the world that are involved in conflicts.    [Rosen] The deputy foreign minister also said today that he  would support the participation of Israeli soldiers in UN  peacekeeping forces.    [Beilin] I would not rule out the possibility that one day  -- certainly after peace prevails here -- while we would still  want to have a strong army of a considerable size, we could have  units of volunteers who would be willing to serve in  peacekeeping forces.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["P.St." report: "Eastern German Economy Experiencing </F> Further Upswing"]    [Text] Berlin -- Industrial production and orders received  in the new laender are on their way up and increased further in  March. Compared with the previous month, industrial output went  up 20 percent and orders received by 6.3 percent. This data was  announced by the Economics Ministry in Bonn on Thursday [26  May].

The construction sector, which is particularly susceptible  to  weather conditions, reported to the ministry the strongest  production growth compared with the previous month, namely 47.1  percent. Compared with the same period last year, the  construction sector grew by 16.2 percent. The processing  industry and electricity and gas supply increased their  activities by 13.8 and 5.1 percent respectively compared with  the previous month, and by 21.7 percent and 8.8 percent  respectively compared with the same month last year. Mining, on  the other hand, reduced its production by 7 percent. Compared  with the previous year, mining activities went down by 15.1  percent.    Compared with the same period last year, orders received  were  up 10.4 percent. Foreign orders clearly increased by 32.5  percent, while domestic orders experienced an increase by 2.9  percent.

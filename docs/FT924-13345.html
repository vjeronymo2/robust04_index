			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Pentland halts Adidas talks PENTLAND, UK-based sporting goods distributor, has withdrawn from negotiations with Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) over the purchase of Adidas, the sports-shoe maker. Pentland said it had found 'serious problems' during a three-month study of Adidas's books, but said it could not be specific owing to a confidentiality clause. Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said: 'There were fundamental problems we discovered which no company, public or private, would have taken on board.' But Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman who founded BTF and bought Adidas in a highly leveraged deal, challenged Pentland's version of events and said the company had tried to renegotiate the price and seek extensions. 'Pentland says things that do not correspond with the truth,' Mr Tapie said. Pentland took a 20 per cent stake in Adidas last year and in July this year agreed to raise its holding to 95 per cent, in a deal which valued Adidas at FFr3.1bn (Pounds 365m). About 58 per cent of the shares were to be bought from BTF while certain French banks and insurance companies agreed to sell a further 20 per cent. Negotiations broke down on Wednesday with the expiry of an agreed extension to the period for Pentland to examine Adidas. Mr Farrant said Pentland pulled out when it became clear BTF would not grant reassurances on the outstanding difficulties. But advisers to BTF blamed Pentland's chairman, Mr Stephen Rubin, for being too cautious and delaying the due diligence period unnecessarily. The apparent breakdown in talks leaves the future of Adidas uncertain. Analysts said Pentland, which has net cash of more than Pounds 250m from the sale of its investment in Reebok, the US sports-shoe maker, was a natural fit for Adidas. Adidas needs fresh investment to enliven its brand name and to source more products from the Far East, where Pentland is particularly strong. BTF said yesterday it would inject between FFr500m-FFr600m into Adidas although it was not clear how Mr Tapie would fund his portion. Pentland criticised, Page 26</p>

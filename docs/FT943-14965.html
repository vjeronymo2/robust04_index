			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / MR Data shares fall 19% on sales delays at Memex Shares in MR Data Management fell by 19 per cent yesterday, after the group warned that delays in sales orders for its Memex software subsidiary and higher than expected reorganisation costs meant full year profits would be below expectations. The shares closed down 33p at 144p after the data transcription and document image processing group issued a trading statement. However the statement added that the second half would show an improvement over the first half. When it reported a 34 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.66m in early March MR Data blamed reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in the Memex software. At that stage, the company said it was awaiting 'significant sales decisions' from police forces on both sides of the Atlantic for its Crime/Criminal Informations Management System developed by Memex. Yesterday Mr Mike Elliott, chief executive, said these orders had still not been received by the end of June. However he emphasised that they had not been lost or withdrawn. 'We are still in the official tendering process and still confident we will be successful.' It is understood that two orders have been delayed because of the European Union's lengthy tendering requirements for public contracts. A third order is expected to be confirmed shortly from the US. After appointing independent consultants to review Memex's business and prospects, MR Data's board said it was 'confident that Memex is well placed to take advantage of the increasing emphasis on law enforcement in the UK and US and other markets for its unique text retrieval products'. In addition, the board said the cost of reorganising the group's document management and geographic information systems businesses was 'higher than expected and had adversely affected the results for the year to end-June, but will lead to significant ongoing savings'. In an apparent attempt to reassure investors, the board added yesterday that the group's core business was now performing well. It intended to recommend at least a maintained final dividend for the year ended June 30, resulting in an increase in the total payment of 6.7 per cent.</p>

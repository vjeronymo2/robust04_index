			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak foreign bourses undermine equities Wall Street LOSSES ON overseas equity markets, weaker domestic bond prices and continued consolidation of recent gains left US stocks lower across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.96 at 3,414.58. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.52 to 445.33, the American SE composite receded 2.16 to 415.00 and the Nasdaq composite retreated 6.23 to 692.21. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 240m shares. Picking up where they left off late on Monday, US investors began selling stocks yesterday. News of weakness in foreign markets, including Tokyo, Frankfurt and, especially, London, set the tone for a downbeat opening. Lower US Treasury prices - a nervous reaction ahead of the week's big auctions of government securities - and some profit-taking in the wake of last week's record-setting gains only exacerbated the downward trend. Among individual stocks, the last batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports trickled in. Whirlpool moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 in busy trading after the company unveiled final quarter 1992 net income of Dollars 62m, up from Dollars 40m a year ago, in spite of a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 18m. Whirlpool also announced that its financial unit would be withdrawing from its aerospace and most of its commercial financing activities. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 after news of a small improvement to Dollars 102.8m in fourth-quarter income, before extraordinary items. After accounting for the early retirement of debt, however, Goodyear's net income dropped from Dollars 105m seen a year ago to Dollars 87.5m - in line with market expectations. Sears Roebuck firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 in solid two-way trade after the retailing group reported a net loss of Dollars 1.8bn in the fourth quarter in the wake of a number of significant special items. If the impact of those items was ignored, Sears' income from continuing operations rose from Dollars 433.6m posted a year ago to Dollars 504.2m. News Corporation advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 39 7/8 on news that the multinational media and entertainment group's operating income for the second fiscal quarter had risen from the 67 cents a share recorded a year earlier to 91 cents a share. IBM bucked the trend, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 3/8 in volume of 3.6m shares. Other big computer stocks were also firmer. Canada TORONTO moved higher in heavy trading as a surge in gold stocks helped to extend the market's February rally. The TSE 300 index ended 19.3 ahead at 3,414.1 and rises outnumbered declines by 337 to 303 after volume of 53m shares valued at CDollars 479m. Eight of the 14 stock groups gained ground, led by the golds sector, up 3.7 per cent. The spot price for gold in New York rose 40 cents to USDollars 328.45 an ounce, but the day's excitement among precious metals came from a surge in platinum, USDollars 5.50 stronger at USDollars 366 an ounce. American Barrick rose CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 40 7/8 to lead the gold group. On Monday the company declared a two-for-one stock split and lifted its dividend by about 23 per cent.</p>

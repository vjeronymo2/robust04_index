			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Polish sell-off hits snags at the workplace THE Polish government's latest attempt to persuade parliament to accept a modified mass privatisation plan is taking place against the background of an increasingly complex response to the issues involved. A banner draped across a wall at the Goradze cement works near Opole catches the mood in many factories. 'We say No to a majority share for foreign capital,' it reads. Inside the plant Mr Andrzej Balcerak, the managing director, finds himself caught between the Privatisation Ministry, which wants to sell his factory, and the Belgian cement producer, CBR, which wants to buy. Mr Balcerak says he no longer notices the banner put up by the unions last autumn. But he admits to understanding the union's concern over the future of this relatively modern, profitable plant which is running at full capacity of 2m tonnes a year. 'A major effort has been made over the past two years by management and workers to bring the plant up to scratch,' he says. 'So the questions arise  -why sell, and if so, who should reap the benefit?'. A compromise being hammered out, with the International Finance Corporation advising the government, will probably see the Belgian company take a minority share, leaving a significant part of the equity for management and employees. Mr Balcerak will be relieved when it happens as he recognises that the plant needs an owner. But the drawn-out process, which has lasted for over a year, is becoming typical of most privatisations in Poland. Dr Bernd Venohr from Bain and Co, the consultants who sold the Pollena Bydgoszcz detergents plant to Unilever in four months in 1991 but took another year to sell the Pollena soap factory in Wroclaw to Cusson's last month, confirms the process is taking longer. 'This time we put most of our effort into negotiating with the employees at Pollena Wroclaw, going back and forth between the unions and the investor and doing a lot of talking to the employees calming their fears about their future.' Dr Venohr likens the process to a takeover negotiation with the shareholders of a company rather than its employees. 'But that's the way it has to be if sales are to come off,' he says. Around one-third of respondents in opinion polls accept privatisation as beneficial. But when it comes down to the fate of a specific plant resistance grows, largely because of fear of unemployment. A recent study showed that 51 per cent of state sector industrial workers wanted their enterprises to stay in state hands while a further 25 per cent thought their plant should be owned by the workers. Only 11 per cent thought it should be bought by fellow Poles while a mere 3 per cent thought it should belong to a foreign company. Mr Balcerak underlines that resistance is greater in profitable plants, which are most attractive to investors, while employees of factories on the verge of collapse, and therefore least attractive to potential investors, are the most amenable to investors of all stripes. The government's Mass Privatisation Scheme, with its plan to hand over some 600 state sector enterprises to foreign-managed National Investment Funds (NIF), represents the government's attempts to address some of these problems. The plants selected for the scheme by the privatisation ministry headed by Mr Janusz Lewandowski, are mainly medium-sized and profitable. As such they are unlike the bulk of companies privatised to date. Most of the 800 or so employee and management buy-outs thus far have been mainly small enterprises and service industries while most foreign investors have been multinationals which have bought strategically into sectors such as food processing, paper and pulp, tobacco, detergents and power engineering where plants tend to be big and capital-intensive.</p>

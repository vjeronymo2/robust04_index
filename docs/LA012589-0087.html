			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The government of the Netherlands said it is planning to release the last two  surviving Nazi war criminals imprisoned in the West immediately after World War  II. Franz Fischer, 87, a sergeant-major in the Nazi SS (elite force), and  Ferdinand aus der Fuenten, 80, a captain in the SS, were found guilty in 1949  of rounding up and deporting at least 13,000 Jews from The Hague and Amsterdam  to concentration camps. The two former Nazis were condemned to death, but their  sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment. In a letter to Parliament,  Dutch Justice Minister Frederik Korthals Altes said it makes "no sense" to keep  the two men in prison any longer.  </P></p>

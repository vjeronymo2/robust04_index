			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Rosehaugh cuts loss but warns of difficult year ahead ROSEHAUGH, the ailing property developer, yesterday announced an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 31.93m and warned that trading conditions would remain difficult throughout the year. 'The prospects for new lettings in the London office market have deteriorated in recent months and the commercial property market as a whole has continued to trade only at a low level,' it said. The loss, for the six months to the end of 1991, compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 49.66m the previous period. It reflected a deterioration in the company's trading position, tempered by fewer provisions against falling property values. The company made a loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 27.8m, compared with a profit of Pounds 3.44m a year earlier. Its turnover fell from Pounds 89.37m to Pounds 23.13m and its interest charge increased from Pounds 10.32m to Pounds 16.19m. The provisions, which related to the write-down of stocks in subsidiaries and investments in associates, totalled Pounds 4.1m, compared with Pounds 53.1m a year earlier. Rosehaugh said that although trading conditions were difficult, there had been signs of renewed activity in the residential markets. 'We are pleased to have the support of our bankers and continue to make every effort to progress property realisations in an orderly fashion, to contain overhead and other expenditure wherever possible, and to progress the core actives for the long-term benefit of the group,' said Mr Leonard Kingshott, chairman. Administrative costs fell from Pounds 7.95m to Pounds 7.76m. A further 90 staff have left the group since June 30. The group realised Pounds 95m from trading and other sales, including the sale of Rosehaugh Copartnership Developments and a 40.3 per cent shareholding in its former associate Rosehaugh Greycoat Estates Holdings. Rosehaugh said that discussions were taking place with potential tenants at the office complex at Ludgate that is being built by Rosehaugh Stanhope Development, its joint venture. It has already let 80,000 sq ft. The loss per share fell from 38.84p to 25.07p. No dividend was proposed. Lex, Page 22</p>

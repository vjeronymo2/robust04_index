			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G achieves 9.5% improvement to Pounds 19.9m M&amp;G, the fund management group, yesterday announced a 9.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits in a period when it launched two substantial investment trusts. The two trusts - Income and Recovery - attracted Pounds 376m of investors funds. However, heavy marketing costs of Pounds 10.4m for the launches meant that the contribution to operating profit from the trusts was just Pounds 600,000. Funds under management at March 31 were Pounds 8.64bn - down some 4 per cent from Pounds 9.01bn at September 30 - largely reflecting poorer stock markets. The FT-A All-Share Index fell 7.4 per cent over the period. Unit trust sales were poor, with redemptions of Pounds 203m outweighing sales of Pounds 158m. However, some potential demand may have been diverted into the investment trust launches, according to Mr Paddy Linaker, managing director. Total sales of personal equity plans were Pounds 258m of which Pounds 31m related to unit trusts and Pounds 227m to investment trusts. Sales of single premium life and pension policies were Pounds 71m, compared with Pounds 53m in the first period of 1990-91. New annual premiums were Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 7m). Group operating profits in the six months to March 31 were Pounds 17m (Pounds 14.9m) and after reduced interest receivable of Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 3.27m), pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 18.2m). A slightly higher tax charge resulted in earnings per share advancing only 8.5 per cent to 18.27p (16.84p). The interim dividend goes up from 8.25p to 9p. COMMENT If anyone doubted that fund management is a low margin business, they should look at M&amp;G's figures. Profit from raising Pounds 376m of new investment trust money was just Pounds 600,000. although the group can look forward to the management fee on that business for the next decade. There are unlikely to be any further trust launches in the near future and judging by the first half, sales of the group's unit trusts are proving a struggle. Perhaps the recent performance figures have not been good enough; certainly the recession has hit the group's high-yield/recovery stock-picking style. M&amp;G's philosophy should come back into fashion as the economy picks up but even so the shares, on a prospective p/e of 17 on a forecast of Pounds 41.5m, look high enough for the moment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian team to  the peace negotiations, has called for setting up a joint  Jordanian-Palestinian committee in permanent session as an  alternative to occasional visits and periodic meetings. The  task of such a committee would be to specify, in detail, the  frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation.    In an exclusive interview with the Jordanian news agency on  arriving in Amman en route to occupied Jerusalem tonight,  al-Husayni added that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination should  be at the highest levels and that all details should be  discussed. He said: If we do not proceed in this direction, the  Israelis will seek to isolate the Palestinians in order to move  the occupied territories from the Israeli occupation to limited  self-rule. To prevent Israel from achieving this objective,  Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation should be enhanced.    Al-Husayni asserted that the current phase requires maximum  coordination. Palestinian-Israeli relations have reached a  phase in which Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is an  inevitable necessity. Without such coordination, we would give  Israel an opportunity to tamper with our cause and plan and make  whatever decisions it pleases, he said.    Al-Husayni added that Palestinian-Jordanian coordination  should bring us to the point where the Jordanian and Palestinian  sides would be almost one party. He asserted that the Israeli  settlements should be removed, and that there is no room for the  settlers in the occupied territories because they are an  obstacle to peace. He added that he visited London and Paris  where he held talks with several officials dealing with the  Palestine question and European support for the Palestinian  people. He also met with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat in  Tunis.</p>

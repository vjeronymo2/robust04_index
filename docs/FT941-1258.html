			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool prices showed a very slight overall rise this week taking the market indicator 4 cents up to 558 cents a kg., having touched 560 cents on an intervening day. If anything the week ended a little softness among finer merinos but not enough to disturb market sentiment unduly. Some stockpile wools sold quite well in Melbourne, the first to be sold by auction, with larger offerings next season a possibility. Australia is now closed for auction purposes until after Easter. Business in wool textile products generally is not as active as strength in wool markets indicates. Prices are intensely competitive and stocks of tops are heavy enough to prevent buyers from getting too concerned about rising prices. Only in the carpet sector have developments led to pressures further down the trading line.</p>

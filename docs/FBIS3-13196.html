			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After nearly 100 hours of debate in the Majles open  sessions on the state budget bill for 1373 [year beginning 21  March 1994], the second reading of the bill was completed and  the bill was referred to the Guardian Council for review.    According to a report by a Central News Unit correspondent,  on the basis of the articles and notes appended to next year's  state budget bill -- approved in today's open session -- 50  billion rials will be put at the disposal of the fund for  interest-free loans for supporting employment opportunities, to  be spent on creating new job opportunities and maintaining  existing employment throughout the country.    Also all public and private establishments are to obtain a  certificate of the nonexistence of domestic production and  domestic know how from the Nuclear Energy Organization prior to  any purchase from abroad of radiation materials [mavvad-e  partowza] or equipment dealing in any way with ionizing or  non-ionizing radiation.    According to a Majles decision today, ministries, public  organs, establishments, and companies are empowered to pay a  maximum of 40,000 rials per day as mission allowance to those  sent on foreign missions providing the travel expenses incurred  are not personal. [sentence as heard] Any other payments, or  the receipt of any other payments, whether in rials or foreign  currency, is forbidden and shall be construed as illegal  appropriation of public assets.    Our correspondent adds: The 1373 budget bill was presented  to  the Majles on 21 December 1993 and since then it has been under  review by various Majles commissions, especially the Plan and  Budget Commission. The bill was debated and approved in Majles  open sessions in two stages: first the section on income and  then the expenditure section.    The Majles is to hold an open session on the morning of 12  March to discuss the Guardian Council's views on the 1373 state  budget bill.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP], gave a news conference on the morning of  29 May in Sapporo city, in which he discussed the possibility of  dissolving the Diet, and calling for general elections  immediately after the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget. He  said, "The ruling parties believe that holding elections under  the multiseat constituencies system means a sabotage of  political reform. This is aimed at creating confusion inside  the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan. It is  possible for all party heads to gather and decide on certain  necessary measures." This indicated that Mori believes that if  all parties agree to introduce the "heiritsu" system of  combining single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation in the election after the next one, it is also  possible to hold the next election under the multiseat system.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The stalled national reconciliation process in  Cambodia, which has not borne fruit so far, delayed the  Indonesian visit of Cambodian leaders Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen. The two leaders were only able to begin their visit to  Indonesia yesterday. After they had assumed the post of first  and second prime minister following last year's elections, they  only managed to visit the PRC and Thailand.    Even as they left Phnom Penh for Jakarta, the spark that  could trigger another outbreak of war was ignited after the  Khmer Rouge rejected an offer for cease-fire scheduled for the  end of this month.    As such, the elected Cambodian Government has not managed to  carry out economic reconstruction in the country ravaged by the  15-year-old civil war. Cambodia's economic reconstruction needs  the support of friendly countries, including Indonesia.    The visit to Indonesia by the two Cambodian prime ministers  accompanied by seven key ministers, is aimed at obtaining  Indonesia's commitment for economic and technical assistance.  Indonesia, which played a major role in the birth of the new  Republic of Cambodia [title of country as heard] and currently  serves as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, will pay special  attention to the challenges faced by the Cambodian Government  and people. Efforts to improve Cambodia's economy and  stability, which will in turn contribute to the stability of  Southeast Asia, have indeed become Indonesia's basic commitment  to that country. We are aware that any problem that arises in  any country will have a negative impact on other countries in  the same region.    Friendly relations between Indonesia and Cambodia in fact  have long cultural and historical roots. As a nation that once  suffered under long colonial rule, we fully understand the need  to extend assistance to Cambodia in its efforts to consolidate  national stability through continued economic development and  the improvement of the people's economic welfare.    Based on the historical friendship between the two nations,  we believe there are many forms of long-term and short-term  cooperation that can be developed. Such cooperation will be  discussed between President Suharto and his two Cambodian guests  at Jakarta's Merdeka Palace today. We hope the success of  Cambodia's economic reconstruction will lead to its stability  and national reconciliation. Our experience has shown that  without national reconciliation and unity, it is impossible to  carry out economic development smoothly.</p>

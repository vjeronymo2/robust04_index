			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Rivals mourn loss of Beaver: It was the company that did all the right things but in the end it was beaten by the recession LITTLE more than 11 weeks ago, Mr Tony Balding was greeting visitors to the Beaver Engineering stand at Birmingham's Mach'92 machine-tool show with a smile, a cup of coffee, and an enthusiasm for his products that is typical of the devoted family businessman. This week the devotion was still there but it was a little harder to smile. On Wednesday Mr Balding signed on at Norwich Jobcentre, a week after being declared redundant by administrative receivers who had moved in at Beaver. Mr Balding is now the ex-managing director of Beaver, one of the most innovative of Britain's machine-tool companies, and is wondering what to do with himself. 'Like every family businessman I can never separate myself from my work,' he says. 'Even when we go on holiday I am dreaming up new designs for vertical machining centres.' It has been a grim fortnight for the machine-tool industry. The Beaver receivership was followed on Thursday by news that Matrix Churchill, the Midlands based producer, had called in the receivers. The fears expressed by industry leaders - that some companies are being kept afloat only by the goodwill of their banks - are proving correct. The problem is that the support is now being withdrawn. Something about the Beaver receivership seems to have touched a chord in an industry that is becoming exasperated by its failure to get the message about its strategic importance across to the government. 'It's terrible news,' says one machine-tool builder. 'Beaver has done all the right things, but the orders weren't there.' Those outside the industry might wonder about the fuss over the receivership of a company whose workforce never reached 300, and whose peak annual sales were just Pounds 11.5m. The simple answer is that in the 41 years since it was founded by Mr Balding's father Victor - now 76 and, until last week, non-executive chairman - Beaver has become a beacon of excellence that even its rivals say deserves to stay alight. But there is a more complex answer. Beaver may be small but its collapse raises some big issues - the future of small-scale entrepreneurialism in competitive global markets, the attitude of banks and the government to industry, the decline of Britain's manufacturing base - and, ultimately, the UK's future as a serous participant in the world machine-tool industry. Beaver produced its first machine tool in 1954 and is no stranger to challenges. In 1978 when Mr Balding visited a Chicago show with his father, they discovered the Japanese were selling 'bed-type' machines - heavier, more rigid and more accurate than Beaver's 'knee-type' range - and for the same price. 'We recognised the implications,' Mr Balding recalls. 'We either had to accept the challenge or get out.' Beaver took the plunge, introducing models just as the UK went into the 1980-81 recession. The initiative saved the company as other UK machine-tool makers - notably the former world leader Alfred Herbert - went under. In the 1980s, Beaver did all that the Thatcher government was forcing industry to do, raising quality, boosting exports and developing new products. But, says Mr Balding: 'We did all this because it was the obvious thing to do, not because they told us to.' In the boom of the mid-1980s the company expanded, opening factories in Peterborough and Halesworth, Suffolk. By mid-1989 it had 289 employees, and a respected range of computer numerically controlled lathes and machining centres. Then everything went wrong. Orders dried up, the new factories had to be closed and Beaver battened down the hatches. But it has been a very different recession this time, says Mr Balding. The UK customer base has contracted by a third in 15 years, yet foreign competition in the UK market has intensified, mainly from Japan, but also from Taiwan and Germany. For Mr Balding, the support that foreign competitors have received to carry them through the recession has given them a crucial advantage. 'One way or another, funds are being made available. Many large Japanese companies have more than 1,000 machines in stock and one questions whether they are all funded from their own resources. 'When we went into receivership we had 10 machines in stock. If the funds had been made available to produce 60 machines for stock, we would have been able to run that business at break-even for at least the next 12 months.' However, Beaver's bank facility expired on July 3, and National Westminster Bank refused to renew it. Beaver did not have enough cash to carry it through the lean summer months, and after a last frantic search to find a partner, Mr Balding had no option but to ask for administrative receivers to be appointed. With the benefit of hindsight, he says he might have done things differently. The company probably stayed too long in family ownership and probably spent too much time and money developing its range when it should have been looking for an additional business leg or finding a new owner. Ideally, he says, Beaver should have become part of a larger group while simultaneously preserving its entrepreneurialism. 'It is an industry where scale is important.' Failing that, only a big boost to UK demand could have preserved Beaver in Balding family ownership. Looking back over the past few weeks, Mr Balding says: 'I have no reason to feel bitter, but I feel terribly empty, and a great sense of loss.' He does not blame NatWest - the banks have a job to do, he says, which is to make sure their money is safe - but believes neither the banks nor the government understand the industry. 'Between them, someone has to take more of a medium or long-term view - they can't both assume that people are going to come back into the industry when business comes back to something like a normal level of activity.' But he criticises the government both for cutting back on the support for research and development that helped Beaver fend off the Japanese 10 years ago, and for the high interest-rate policy of 1989 and 1990 which sucked the working capital out of the company, leaving it unable to afford a restructuring plan. Ironically, the plan that was vetoed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the bank's supervising accountant, is being used by its Cork Gully insolvency arm. It is a painful strategy, involving ending parts and components manufacturing, and concentrating on design, development and service and assembly. A total of 80 jobs have already gone, but the plan might be the only chance to preserve something from the debacle. Yesterday, Mr Mark Shires, a principal at Cork Gully in Norwich, said an advertisement in Tuesday's FT had prompted a number of inquiries, and Beaver had also secured new machine-tool orders in the past week. Mr Balding naturally hopes the company will survive - and not simply because the family are the main creditors. 'It would be nice to see the business continue in some form, with a new owner to carry it forward.'</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LAST TANGO: Leona Helmsley, who pleaded for mercy in a New York court Tuesday  (A1), cut a different figure in Orange County in March, dancing the night away  with husband Harry at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. . . . Here for a reunion of  award-winning hotel owners, Helmsley chatted airily that night with  Ritz-Carlton VP Henry Schielein, who avoided talk of her legal problems. . . .  "We just talked about California, about New York, about her hotel, our hotel,"  he said. "I would never want to touch that subject." Dana Parsons  </P></p>

Morken, who is the newly elected leader of the Europe  Movement in Telemark, has fired off a powerful warning to his  party. He points to an interview with Erik Solheim in DAGENS  NAERINGSLIV in which the SV leader says that he is "in favor of  pan-European cooperation in the CSCE, NATO, and also in the  relationship between the EU and East Europe."    "This argument is diffuse, to put it mildly. It sounds  completely contradictory to be in favor of  cooperation between the EU and East Europe and at the same time  to be against the EU," Morken said.    In the past the headmaster from Bo has been the leader of  the  Telemark SV. He is still a member of the party, but has  resigned from all party posts because of the way the party  leadership is tackling the EU issue.    [Borud] Erik Solheim has told the public that at present he  is thinking and reading books. Should the party leader now come  out of the isolation booth?    "Yes, he should come out of the isolation booth, and he  should be making statements to which people can react; whole  alternatives that place Norway in a European and international  context and that react to the real world and the fact that the  EU exists," said Morken, who hopes that the SV will follow the  Danish Socialist People's Party and change its stance on the EU  issue.    [Borud] There has been silence from the SV leadership since  the election.    "Yes, it seems as if the fiasco in the election -- which was  to a large extent due to the EU issue -- has made the leadership  uncertain about what arguments should be used now."    [Borud] Has the SV engaged in the debate on the Center  Party's terms to too great an extent?    "Yes, for a period to begin with, but then people realized  that no one can beat the Center Party when it comes to dogmatic  opposition to the EU. We as socialists must have completely  different arguments."    Morken has long been calling for alternatives to the EU, but  does not think that he has been given any satisfactory answers:  "I have reached the conclusion that the EU is the only body  that could be the start of something that could become  pan-European cooperation."    Morken has little sympathy with those who argue  for NATO membership, but against the EU: "This  weakens West European influence, and we will find ourselves with  a NATO that will be totally dominated by the United States. The  EU is the only supranational body that has the economic and  political weight to support the countries of East Europe.  Security policy is something much greater than military  capacity. The economy is of crucial importance when it comes to  stabilizing the situation in East Europe, and this is something  that only the EU can do," Morken said, adding a reminder about  his socialist point of departure.</p>

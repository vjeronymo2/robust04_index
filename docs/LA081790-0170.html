			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MUSCOVITES RUN INTO TRULY SPINE-CHILLING SHORTAGE: ICE CREAM  </P> <P> The Soviet capital, which often boasts of having the world's best ice cream,  has a shortage in these waning days of summer, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> Ice cream kiosks on street corners and city parks have been displaying "No Ice  Cream" signs, although they continue to sell souvenirs, marshmallows,  chocolates and other candies, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.  </P> <P> Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the Baskin-Robbins  stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat pedestrian mall, or the  Soviet-Swiss joint venture Pinguin.  </P> <P> But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have always taken  pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in paper-wrapped slabs or on  sticks, rather than in cones.  </P> <P> Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Mosgortorg, the Directorate for State-Run Trade in  Moscow, as saying two of the three ice cream-making factories in Moscow are  closed for repairs this summer. One might reopen early next month, it said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FOR SALE? Every day the federal government's Resolution Trust Corp. hangs onto  Irvine-based Lincoln S&amp;L, it loses money.  </P> <P> In the first 3 months of this year, it lost $133 million. Now that a federal  court has cleared the way for government to dispose of Lincoln (D1), what is  the likelihood of finding a buyer to take over the thrift? "About nil," says  Brea-based S&amp;L analyst Gerry Findley. "There is more prospect of them  dismantling it and selling off pieces." The feds won't speculate. Mark I.  Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

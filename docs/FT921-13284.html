			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Thai orders for Dollars 900m go to Foster Wheeler group CONTRACTS worth Dollars 900m (Pounds 502.7m) to expand a leading oil refinery in Thailand have been won by Foster Wheeler, the US-controlled engineering and construction group. Three Foster Wheeler subsidiaries have been contracted by Esso Standard Thailand to raise capacity of its Sriracha refinery from 63,000 barrels a day (b/d) to 145,000 b/d. The expansion will enable the refinery to produce unleaded petrol and low-sulphur diesel, allowing later expansion to 185,000 b/d. The contract is one of three won in Asia by Foster Wheeler in 16 months. In autumn 1990 it signed contracts for a Dollars 1.5bn oil refinery in Indonesia; in September last year, it was named project manager to expand an LNG plant in Bintulu, Sarawak, part of a Dollars 2.9bn investment programme by Petronas, Malaysia's state oil and gas corporation. The Sriracha expansion project, to be co-ordinated by Foster Wheeler's UK HQ and a new engineering centre in Thailand, includes building 16 process units. It is due for completion at the end of 1995, though conversion and desulphurisation units allowing output of unleaded fuel will be on stream in 1993. Foster Wheeler has been involved with Esso Thailand since it built the original Sriracha plant between 1968 and 1971, and the first expansion to the plant in 1983-85. The three subsidiaries working on the Thai project will be Foster Wheeler Energy, Foster Wheeler International in Thailand, and Foster Wheeler (Pacific).</p>

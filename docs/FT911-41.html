			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Stock lending The Bank of England has always encouraged the development of stock lending in London, arguing that the activity brings valuable extra liquidity and market confidence. In Thursday's Quarterly Bulletin, the Bank will provide new evidence for its case. In gilts, for example, daily lending volume has nearly trebled since Big Bang - to around Pounds 6bn. But the really fast-growing market involves the lending of international securities, where there is a problem. If London is to maintain its lead as a centre for the trading of international securities and related lending and borrowing, a solution must be found for the tax treatment of overseas lenders. The faster the Inland Revenue agrees a fair mechanism, the better. Otherwise, London will have shot itself in the foot - again.</p>

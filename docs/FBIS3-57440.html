			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 24 January carries an edition of the  "Details" program. The program's announcer, Nikolay Svanidze,  addresses two main issues relating to the government reshuffle:  Will an additional first deputy prime minister be appointed  alongside Oleg Soskovets? Who will be appointed to the key post  of finance minister? In the studio with Svanidze is one of the  main candidates for the post of finance minister, Vladimir  Ivanovich Shcherbakov, chairman of the Council of Directors and  president of the Interprivatizatsiya Foundation.    When asked by Svanidze about a possible nomination as  finance  minister, Shcherbakov says, "I hope I am not appearing here as a  candidate for the ministerial post. That is of little interest  to me. Speaking seriously about the finance minister post, it is  no accident that the name Valentin Pavlov is mentioned. What is  needed today is a man who can say yes or no pretty firmly, and  who can stick with it. I had a fairly lengthy talk today with  Boris Fedorov. My point of view is this: He should stay in his  post, that was what we were talking about."    Svanidze then asks Shcherbakov if he has persuaded Fedorov  to  stay on. "Well, yes, that was chiefly what we were talking  about," says Shcherbakov.    On the unification of Belarus and Russian currencies,  Shcherbakov says that the accord signed was more of a strategic  pointer than a practical document to be implemented urgently.  The accord was drawn up by the Central Bank, which is legally  responsible for regulating currency circulation, though it was  previously not the case, Shcherbakov says, for one government  department to draw up such accords. Asked whether the finance  ministry was bypassed on the decision, Shcherbakov says he  cannot comment on the situation, which he regards as "the  internal affair of the government".    Regarding inflation, Shcherbakov makes the proviso that "I  would not wish my words to be taken as being any claim to  becoming the finance minister," and says that he agrees with  Chernomyrdin. "Chernomyrdin was right when he said that  monetarist methods must be augmented by an arsenal of other  methods. I believe that is the right way to put it. First and  foremost, legislative measures: We must curb inflation using  legislative methods, and by further improving the laws governing  economic activity. Second, organizational measures: namely, for  instance, the transport infrastructure does not work; the  payment infrastructure does not work. We have simply stopped  payments, but not for economic reasons, rather for political and  organizational reasons." Shcherbakov concludes that he is  profoundly convinced that "inflation is engendered by the  non-market structure of our economy."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Travnik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 9 (AFP) -- If the  latest ceasefire in the Bosnian conflict comes into effect  Friday [10 June] as scheduled, it will force an end to one of  the Moslem-led Bosnian army's most successful offensives of the  war. For the first time, the Bosnian forces have broken through  several Serb defense lines following several weeks of  preparation, UN sources said.    In the north and west of the ex-Yugoslav republic, the army  is poised to capture one strategic road, are advancing toward  another, and are closing in on the town of Dornji Vakuf, which  the Serbs captured at the start of the war, UN military  observers in the field said. With the offensives underway, the  Bosnian military command has barred foreign reporters from  combat zones and tightened control on local media. It refuses  to confirm reports of territorial gains and has sealed off  entire sectors to UN peacekeepers and observers.    Analysts say the Bosnian army drive was made possible by the  end of fighting between the Moslems and Croats, who have  recently agreed to form a federation on territory under their  control. "At many points along the front, (the government  forces) are no longer the underdog or in a position of obvious  inferiority thanks to troops released under an agreement with  the Croats," a western military observer said. "They take the  initiative and have learned, after two years of war, the  importance of controlling information," he added. UN  peacekeepers rely on estimates, helped by satellite pictures, to  judge the success of the Bosnian army's first widescale  offensive.    In the past few days, the fiercest fighting has been waged  for control of what the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) call  "route Duck," a strategic road linking two mainly Moslem regions  in the northwest of the country and running through the Serb  enclave of Ozren. If captured, it would enable the Moslems to  link up the towns of Maglaj and Tesanj to Tuzla, Bosnia's second  city, reducing the time needed to travel between them to two  hours instead of the 12 it currently takes by a more circuitous  route. By Thursday, after several days of coordinated infantry  offensives to the west and east, the army had conquered several  of the seven kilometers of the road from Serb forces, UN  military experts estimated. "A victory on route Duck would have  little military significance but an enormous psychological  effect," a senior UNPROFOR officer in the region said.    Large contingents of Moslem troops have also been mobilized  for the past two weeks fighting for control of another road --  running from the town of Teslic, south to the western front.  Army shells have pummeled the road from surrounding crests for  several days and an offensive to descend into the valley is  probably underway. "We may well see a big effort by the Bosnian  army over the next 48 hours to make the most of its winning hand  before the ceasefire signed in Geneva comes into force -- that  is if they intend to respect it," a UN officer told AFP.    The Serbs, Moslems and Croats agreed Wednesday in Geneva to  observe a month-long ceasefire from Friday, under strong  pressure from the United Nations. Like Teslic, Dornji Vakuf,  also on the western front, appears on a list of seven towns that  army chief General Rasim Delic says he will be able to  "liberate" soon. On Wednesday the army had broken through Serb  front lines and clashes were underway in villages outside the  town.    Here in the nearby town of Travnik, a spokesman for  headquarters of the army's 3rd corps denied Dornji Vakuf had  fallen as troops just back from the front, carrying assault  rifles and dressed in chemical- and germ-warfare resistant  combat gear sat in groups on the sidewalks. In Sarajevo,  UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said fighting died down  somewhat along the main fronts in Bosnia as the truce agreement  was signed in Geneva Wednesday. The Gradacac and Ribnica fronts  in the north and Sapna, in the northeast, remained the most  active in Bosnia but "compared to last week, these areas have  shown a substantial decrease in the level of fighting," he said.</p>

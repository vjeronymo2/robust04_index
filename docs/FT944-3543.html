			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / A union rallying cry echoes in Europe: Robert Taylor reports on the TUC's break with tradition in advocating workplace rights for all Workplace rights for all workers looks likely to be the new rallying cry for Britain's trade unions as the TUC's new approach takes British unions into the mainstream of European thought on industrial relations. The new approach may offend some union feelings. Many have traditionally opposed the provision of rights for everybody, fearing that people would not feel the need to join a union to enjoy protection at work. But union leaders involved in the TUC's task group on workplace representation say that statutory representation for all should encourage unions to develop new strategies for growth and influence. They believe unions will retain a strong workplace presence as unions still do in Sweden and Germany, where such systems operate successfully. But the TUC is not simply copying mainland European practice. As Mr Bill Morris, the head of the task group, explained to German and Swedish union officials and employers, UK unions want to see how the voluntary principle of trade union membership can best be linked with satisfactory arrangements for statutory representation. This will require a complex balance between voluntarism and regulation, but it looks as though the TUC has achieved a remarkable degree of consensus among union leaders - from Mr Tony Dubbins of the GPMU print union on the left to Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU craft union president, on the right. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, has been helped in his efforts to win over sceptics in the unions by the government's almost wholly negative attitude to the European Union's social affairs agenda, symbolised by its opt-out from the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty. Recent decisions against the UK by the European Court of Justice have said that employees must have adequate information and consultation rights under EU directives covering collective redundancies and the legal transfer of undertakings from one company to another. The task group has accepted that what it proposes needs to be compatible with the directives as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, which means recognising adequate protection for all workers without undermining trade union influence and collective bargaining. The kind of process the TUC has in mind is based on how the new EU works council directive is likely to develop. This provides information and consultation rights in bigger trans-national enterprises. Although the UK may have opted out of the directive's provisions as applied to Britain, more than 100 British-owned companies are likely to have such councils in place in their businesses in the next three years. More important, the directive shows the TUC how to integrate the voluntary approach with statutory regulation. Once the works council directive comes into force representatives of either management or workers can establish a 'special negotiating body' to discuss what kind of works council the company will establish. Only if the employer refuses to do this, or negotiations fail for some other reason, is a legally enforceable fallback provision for councils applicable. The proposed negotiating body will be in line with national law and customary practice in each EU member state. The TUC says this should favour trade union representation in Britain and include full-time officials. The task group envisages a similar process for the creation of workplace committees in every company in the UK. The TUC position is a bold step forward but it is likely to arouse widespread opposition from employers. It is not a sharp break with the past, however. The task group has been ingenious in weaving together the regulatory and voluntary traditions. It provides a positive way forward by suggesting a voice for all employees in Britain's workplaces, where surveys suggest people are feeling increasingly insecure, and offers a chance for a trade union revival.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Cool relations warm to new challenges - Sponsorship Relations in the past between the Arts Council, the bastion of the subsidised arts, and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, created to encourage corporate investment, have not always been easy. They became particularly cool when the council set up an external relations department to offer its clients advice on sponsorship, and also to seek, with patchy success, business funding for its own conferences and publications. This mutual suspicion should change now that the new secretary-general of the council, Mary Allen, is an ABSA old girl, and the chairman, Lord Gowrie, was a committed believer in sponsorship when arts minister, and boasts the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme as one of his greatest achievements. ABSA will undertake assignments for the council, especially in advising arts companies how they can attract more sponsorship. This is already happening in a piecemeal way. ABSA works for the Scottish Arts Council on raising corporate funding and in April Elizabeth Ganney was drafted from ABSA to bolster South East Arts, with most of her salary coming from the regions. Her task is to instruct the many small arts organisations in the area, (not necessarily South East Arts clients) on how to fundraise more effectively. The region receives less subsidy per head than any other (because the council expects local arts lovers to go to London) and many organisations there struggle to survive. Fortunately, the south-east is attractive to business, and some new companies are embracing sponsorship. Nynex Cablecommunications, for example, has become a sponsor: it needs to improve its corporate image while digging holes throughout the area. It has backed the Brighton Festival and such small causes as the Reigate-based English Arts Chorale. The potential in the south-east is considerable: last year the region boosted its revenue from the BSIS (which encourages first-time sponsors) by 24 per cent, to Pounds 326,000. As ABSA extends its network of regional offices (Birmingham opened this week), it will work closer with the newly beefed-up arts boards.                            *      *      * Scotland swept the board at ABSA's Goodman and Garrett Awards ceremony at the Tate Gallery, which is unique in honouring individuals who have served the cause of arts sponsorship. Alex Clark won the Pounds 10,000 Goodman Award, for achievement by a volunteer, and Nina Havergal the Pounds 10,000 Garrett as a professional in the field. These imaginative awards have been sponsored for three years by Reed Elsevier.                            *      *      * BP was one of the large sponsors that froze its budget during the recession. By not renewing most of its 40-odd, Pounds 25,000 or so, touring and community-based commitments its expenditure almost halved, to around Pounds 750,000 a year. Now it is re-examining its position. The budget is unlikely to rise in the short term but BP has a strategy again. Community work will be left to local subsidiaries, which may, or may not, include the arts. HQ will concentrate on four or five prestige sponsorships. The annual re-hang of art at the Tate Gallery will be financed for two more years, and there is to be another year at least for the annual Portrait Award at the National Portrait Gallery. The Cardiff Singer of the Year, with the BBC, will continue in 1995, and then stay on hold until the murky relationship between the BBC and sponsorship is thrashed out. In July, BP sponsors its first production at the National Theatre, Chekhov's The Seagull. In the past BP backed the NT's educational programme, but it is switching about Pounds 60,000 to a more high-profile event.                            *      *      * Last month the most important exhibition of paintings in a generation by the American artist, Willem de Kooning, opened at the National Gallery in Washington. It will later go to the Met in New York before coming to the Tate in London early next year. The British end of the trip was entirely dependent on the American bank JP Morgan having invested more than Pounds 1m into the event. This will cover transportation and insurance costs. JP Morgan is slowly appreciating the benefits of sponsorship and its budget rises steadily. It exploits the opportunities for corporate hospitality - but is as much swayed by a feeling of responsibility towards the quality of life, and the fact that de Kooning, American and avant-garde, chimes in nicely with a bank that is trying to shed its traditional image of exclusivity.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Coal miners select targets THE United Mine Workers of America yesterday announced selective strikes against three US coal producers in an attempt to win job security rights in a new national labour contract, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The strikes target Amax Coal, the third largest coal producer in the US and a wholly owned subsidiary of Amax, the aluminium manufacturer, and the smaller Arch Mineral and Ziegler Coal. The union promised to broaden action until coal operators responded to its demands. UMWA coal miners have been working without a contract since May 3, when an extension to their contract expired. At issue is the union's insistence that new mines opened by members of the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association should automatically be staffed by union labour. While the selective strike hits just as the US enters its heaviest demand period for electricity - the summer air-conditioning season - observers say the stoppage will not have a noticeable impact for several months. 'Most electric utilities have fair coal stockpiles, and the US coal supply is not 100 per cent union,' said Mr Ralph Barbaro, an energy analyst. Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK, is not targeted. A month-long strike there in February ended when the union and mine owners agreed to the two-month contract extension with the BCOA which expired this month.</p>

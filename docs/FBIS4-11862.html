			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat, by Yoni Ben-Menahem on 1 April; place not given]    [Text] [Ben-Menahem] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, some reports have  indicated that the Cairo agreement also includes a special  clause relating to the repatriation of Palestinian deportees.  Is this correct?    [Al-Tibi] The fact is that the issue of Palestinian  deportees was raised during the recent meetings in Cairo. The  Israeli side agreed in principle to the repatriation of more  than 30 Palestinian deportees. This issue will be finalized at  the beginning of next week.    [Ben-Menahem] When will the deportees return?    [Al-Tibi] This hinges on the talks that will begin next week  in Cairo. The names of the returning brother deportees will be  announced after the Cairo meetings next week.    [Ben-Menahem] Do the deportees belong only to Fatah?    [Al-Tibi] The list agreed on by the Israelis includes  Palestinian deportees from various factions.    [Ben-Menahem] There are also reports indicating that Israel  has agreed to release a large number of security prisoners.    [Al-Tibi] This is an extremely important issue for the  Palestinian side. The Gaza-Jericho agreement cannot be signed  or implemented without a scheduled release of the brother  Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. This position has been  firmly raised with the Israeli side. The Israelis have agreed  to it in principle. Talks are to be held later on about the  timetable as well as on how and when the brother detainees will  be released. I can say that in our contacts we recently focused  particularly on the sick prisoners, because the number of sick  prisoners in Israeli jails has increased. This issue should be  given a very high priority. The Palestinian leadership is aware  of this issue, has raised it repeatedly, and it has been  accepted in principle. The details will be finalized in the  upcoming round of talks.    [Ben-Menahem] There is criticism in the Palestinian street  in Hebron as well as by the Palestinian opposition that the  international presence in Hebron does not provide the necessary  protection for the citizens.    [Al-Tibi] In fact, the international presence -- 160  international observers -- does not provide absolute protection  for the Palestinians in Hebron. Although this force does not  provide protection, it gives an important political meaning to a  multinational presence in Hebron in the occupied territories.  This is the first thing. Second, the issue is not over yet.  The more important issue is the evacuation of Jews from Hebron.  Settlement presence in Hebron is a time bomb. We will wait a  short while to see what the Israeli Government's next step will  be on this matter. We have to wait a short while and see this  step.    [Ben-Menahem] But what can you say to the man in the street  about his protection?    [Al-Tibi] As I have said, undoubtedly international presence  by itself does not provide the required protection for the  Palestinians in Hebron.    [Ben-Menahem] Then why did the PLO agree to this?    [Al-Tibi] Because this has been a political demand by the  PLO and the Arab side for scores of years. International  presence in the occupied territories means that the occupation  is about to end and that we are on our way to sovereignty.  However, with regard to reducing friction and providing  protection for the Palestinians, this will come by evacuating  Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron. We expect the Israeli  Government to take a step shortly in this sphere.    [Ben-Menahem] Have you obtained any agreement on this issue?    [Al-Tibi] We will wait a short while and see what step the  Israeli Government will take in this sphere.</p>

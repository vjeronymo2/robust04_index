			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed YR/NB: "Transit Traffic. Austria Seeks </F> Agreement With Switzerland by End of Year"; as released by Bern  ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Brussels, 8 Feb (ATS) -- Austrian Public Economy and  Transportation Minister Viktor Klima announced in Brussels on  Tuesday [8 February] that Austria wants to sign an agreement on  road transit traffic with Switzerland before the end of the  year. This agreement will subject Swiss trucks transiting  through Austria to the ecopoints [ecological points] system that  exists for all European Union [EU] countries.    A spokesman for the minister said that the number of  ecopoints granted to Switzerland will be calculated on the basis  of transportation statistics. He added that Austria expects the  discussions with Switzerland that are due to begin soon to go  smoothly.    The conclusion of an agreement between Austria and  Switzerland on transit traffic is one the Twelve's requirements  before Austria can join the EU. Currently, the only trucks that  are completely free to circulate in Austria are Swiss.    They avoid both the ecopoints system, to which European  Community trucks are subjected by application of the Austria-EC  transit agreement, and the quota system which is the rule for  other third countries. The Twelve consider that this situation  discriminates against Community trucks and they want it brought  to an end.    While the Switzerland-EC transit agreement is aimed at  protecting the environment and regulating transit traffic by  applying the 28 tonne limit, the Austria-EC agreement  established a system of ecopoints. The Twelve receive an annual  amount of ecopoints which are used up as the trucks enter  Austria and according to the pollution rating of the vehicles.  <H5>  Vienna Rejects Twelve's Other Proposals </H5>   While it is ready to end this discrimination favoring  Switzerland, on Tuesday Austria rejected the other EC demands  concerning road traffic. Negotiations will continue at the  ministerial level on 21 and 25 February.    The first point of disagreement concerns the future of the  transit agreement that came into effect a year ago. As far as  Vienna is concerned, this agreement applies for the whole of its  planned duration, that is until 2004, and is not to be abolished  three years after Austria joins the EU as the EU claims.    According to the Austrian government, the most important  thing is to reach the objectives of the transit agreement, but  these objectives -- the protection of the environment (reduction  of pollution emissions by 60 percent) and the orientation of  transport (creation of an effective alternative between road and  rail) -- will not have been achieved after three years.    The EU, however, maintains that no such bilateral agreement  can continue to exist after the country has become a member. At  most, its key points can be retained in a temporary arrangement  for a limited duration. After that, a solution would have to be  found at the Community level and this has yet to be debated.  <H5>  Traffic Diverted Because of Swiss Restrictions </H5>   Vienna also refuses to lift its 38-tonne limit, which allows  it to exert "a little pressure" in favor of rail. This means of  dissuasion would disappear with the harmonization with European  standards which already cater for an increase to 44 tonnes.    To defend its position, Austria points out the restrictions  imposed by Switzerland, namely the 28 tonne limit and the ban on  night driving. These restrictions mean that heavy goods  vehicles avoid the shortest route -- cutting through Switzerland  -- and instead take a detour through France and Austria. Vienna  calculates that 40 percent of the traffic transiting through  Austria is therefore "diverted traffic."</p>

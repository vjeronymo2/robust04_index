			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hispano Suiza attracts second bid THE remnants of one of the shooting stars of the Madrid bourse in the 1980s are to be fought over at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of the Hispano Suiza group in Madrid on Thursday with the sudden emergence of two bids for its remaining assets. Azkoyen, a Pamplona-based producer of vending machines, has bid for the 92 per cent of Hispano Suiza owned by a consortium of blue chip UK financial companies. The bid values Hispano Suiza at just Pta492m (Dollars 4.24m), a far cry from the Pta3bn it was once worth on the market. That bid may block one made a few weeks ago by a consortium led by Mr Juan Abello, a Spanish financier, with support from the Bonomi family of Italy, which controls the Saffa paper group. The Abello bid was worth Pta1.011bn but only included Hispano Suiza's profitable building materials companies. Thursday's meeting was called to approve the Abello bid but shareholders may now reconsider. 'The new (Azkoyen) bid is much better for the shareholders,' said Mr Charles Burdett, Hispano Suiza's chairman, yesterday. Mr Burdett built up the group into a mini-conglomerate with support from British institutions which still include, as shareholders, Kleinwort Benson, Hambros, Robert Fleming, M&amp;G and Henderson Administration. Hispano Suiza was undone by the recession in the Spanish construction industry which forced Ofirex, its construction machinery distributor, into receivership last year.</p>

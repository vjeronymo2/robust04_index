			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Green grow the profits: Book Review CHANGING COURSE By Stephan Schmidheiny and the Business Council for Sustainable Development The MIT Press. Pounds 20.50 hardback, Pounds 9.95 paperback. 355 pages The business world faces a dilemma over the environment. In only a month, political leaders from more than 100 countries will gather in Rio de Janeiro for the grandly named Earth Summit. The conference halls will be packed with thousands of environmental pressure groups agitating for action. And the whole world - or such is the organisers' hope - will be watching. Who knows what will result? At the very least, the politicians will want to avoid a wasted journey by signing a commitment to get the world economy on to a more sustainable path. But they might also agree to more concrete measures, like taxation or regulation, to tackle the specific ills of global warming, deforestation and pollution. The chances of that are rather small. The run-up to the summit has exposed a world deeply divided on green issues; it cannot even agree an agenda, let alone a plan of action. But it is easy to see why some business people view Rio as an ominous prospect. They may welcome the fact that environmental issues have finally got on to the global agenda. But Rio will not simplify their life; it could make it more difficult. Much of the trouble lies in business's poor image, and the widespread view that protection of the environment and the pursuit of profit are fundamentally at odds with each other. A group of 50 top businessmen has got together to try to deal with these issues, and this book is the result of their labours. It comes very late in the day, and a lot of it will cut little ice with Mr Greenperson, but it is unquestionably one of the more important contributions to Rio. The prime mover is Stephan Schmidheiny, a little-known but highly successful Swiss businessman who was invited by the Rio organisers to become their adviser. Rather than do the job alone, he formed a business council with the top executives of companies such as Shell, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Volkswagen, 3M, Nissan Motor and Dupont, and all have contributed from their experience. There are several strands to their message. The central ones are that business favours sustainable development, that it accepts the need for environmental policies, and that it recognises its responsibility to help the developing world out of its difficulties. In other words, greenery and profit-making can coexist. But these arguments are also highly qualified. Sustainable development must be achieved by means of free and open markets, environmental measures should be imposed through economic instruments (like taxes) rather than controls (which distort) or self-regulation (which encourages business cartels). And if business is to enrich the Third World with its technology, it must be on the basis of 'co-operation' (ie on commercial terms) rather than 'transfers' (terms mandated by government). None of this sounds specially surprising. But the book fleshes out these positions with 38 studies of businesses resolving conflicts with the environment. There is the case of New England Electric, the US utility which devised a system with its regulators that enabled it to profit if its customers reduced demand through conservation. Previously NEE's earnings had been based solely on the amount of electricity it had sold. Another case relates how Dow Chemical adopted a policy of eliminating harmful waste at source rather than by treating it at the end of the waste pipe, meaning that only a minimal amount now ends up in a landfill. In a quote that typifies much of this book, Dow's president, Frank Popoff, says: 'Surveys show that the public is sceptical of industry's efforts at environmental protection. If we fail to take the initiative, the result will be a regulatory crunch that costs us - and the public - dearly without achieving significant benefits.' Other cases show how Shell promoted local nationals in Nigeria, Henkel developed the phosphate-free detergent which eventually swept Europe, and Volkswagen designed the recyclable car. This book is undoubtedly well-intentioned, but the question is how much impact it will make. The case studies are rather predictable: the company always triumphs over adversity. This was a deliberate decision 'designed to provide positive examples to motivate others to take action', the authors say. But what a pity they did not develop a tantalising reference to 3M being forced to discard a water-based process for making audio tape because it was not good enough. This is not because, as the authors say 'too often the media focuses on errors and accidents'. It is because the world knows that business is having a tough time adjusting to environmental pressures, and it needs to be convinced that businessmen are acting out of genuine motives. As NEE chief executive John Rowe says in the book's most memorable quote: 'The rat has to smell the cheese.'</p>

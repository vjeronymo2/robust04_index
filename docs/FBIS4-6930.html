			<p>CSO     [Text] Outright sales of cellular phones were initiated in  Shizuoka Prefecture in April amidst lively competition between  NTT's Tokai Mobile Network (NTT Dokomo [Anywhere]) using digital  technology and Nippon Ido Tsushin (IDO) using Motorola's TACS  [total access communications system] technology. NTT Dokomo  systems are being promoted in terms of the applicability of  digital technology in the multimedia age, while the IDO Motorola  cellular units are being promoted based on instrument variety  and low price. Between this summer and next spring, two more  digital-based companies are scheduled to enter the market,  sharply increasing interest in cellular phones in Shizuoka  prefecture.    Yotaro Hoshiyama, director of NTT Dokomo's Shizuoka regional  office, displays enthusiasm as he says, "We intend to  aggressively stress the value-added aspects of digital  technology in that it is applicable to personal computer  communications." Connections for NTT Kodomo's digital services  network were completed in April for the northern Kanto, Tokyo  metropolitan, Tokai and Kansai areas.    Intraprefectural calling areas are now restricted to  Gotenba,  Numazu, Shizuoka, and Hamamatsu along the Tomei Freeway, which  is smaller than the area covered by analog systems, but it will  be extended to urban areas surrounding Hamamatsu and urban areas  of East Izu during fiscal year 1994. Director Hoshiyama states  that the digital network is being expanded beyond the areas  covered by the analogue system to "accommodate requirements of  urban area residents who have a frequent need to use cellular  phones while traveling on business or pleasure in the Shizuoka  area."    The reason NTT Dokomo is emphasizing digital technology is  that it can be connected to communication services using  integrated services digital network (ISDN) being installed by  the NTT group, while cellular phones will be one phase of an  overall high-technology communications network.    However, of the cellular phone orders received in the first  10 days of April, only 10 percent were for those using digital  technology. According to director Hoshiyama, "We need to suggest  effective uses of the technology to business firms," reflecting  the intent to continue with efforts in expanding use of the  technology.    On the other hand, IDO has expanded its analog network,  which  was the topic of U.S.-Japan friction, in Shizuoka Prefecture.  Shizuoka branch manager Tetsuji Nomura stresses, "Motorola  cellulars can be used any place in the country by connecting to  the Cellular Group. There are eight different models available  in terms of cellular phones and they are about 30,000 yen  cheaper than digital models." He is poised to compete head-on  with digital systems whose service areas are now limited to  Kanto and Kansai areas and whose cellular units are priced  higher.    IDO handles NTT analogue cellulars too, but manager Nomura  states, "We will sell the Motorola units aggressively in the  future." IDO's subscribers now total about 300,000 for the NTT  system and about 10,000 for the Motorola system, but manager  Nomura expresses determination as he says, "We hope to bring  market shares to a 50-50 point in two years."    New marketers of the digital system are preparing to enter  the foray. Two-Car Cellular Tokai of Nagoya city which is  scheduled to start operation in July, established branches in  Shizuoka and Hamamatsu cities at the end of March. It will also  appoint more than 30 dealerships which will serve as the direct  outlets to customers by the end of April.    Tokai Digitalphone of Nagoya city plans to commence services  in Shizuoka prefecture by the first part of the spring of next  year, while positioning its Shizuoka branch to begin sales by  June 1994.    As of the end of 1993, about 49,000 cellular phones were in  service in Shizuoka Prefecture. Market penetration stood at 1.3  percent, which was 0.3 percent lower than the national average.  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications estimates that the  units installed will increase sixfold by 2002, which means that  there is room for additional market participants. Late market  entrants have received approval for lower initial installation  rates than for NTT's digital rates and, as a result,  optimistically look for initial year new subscriber market share  of 33 percent in the case of Two-Car Cellular and 25 percent in  the case of Digitalphone.    According to the Shizuoka branch, IDO, whose market share is  running at 30 percent, is determined to take the initiative in  waging a successful sales campaign as sources say, "We hope to  corral as many new subscribers as possible before the new  competition comes on stream." The same source states, "Since  entering April the number of potential customers visiting the  sales offices have doubled to 50 a day," indicating a favorable  market trend.    According to the NTT Shizuoka branch, "Since March, 70  percent of the visitors to the sales offices have asked about  cellular services. There has been a definite increase in the  interest shown for cellular phones. According to IDO sources,  "Customers that appear at sales offices also have catalogues  from other vendors." It appears that users are being careful in  their evaluation of services available. Sales of cellular units  are not expected to take off until after summer, because it is  difficult to predict just how much prices will be falling in the  near future.</p>

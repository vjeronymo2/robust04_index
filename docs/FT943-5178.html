			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Knapp hits at BR plan to help Railtrack A move by British Rail to supply staff to help Railtrack keep trains running during strikes by signal workers was played down yesterday by Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union. Significant numbers of BR staff have been recruited and Railtrack said that more than half of services would be running during Thursday's 24-hour stoppage, the highest proportion so far achieved. Mr Knapp, pictured after his speech at the TUC conference in Blackpool, said BR was exaggerating the effect of its 'secondary action'. He told delegates that the signal workers were standing firm and would fight on. Report, Page 12; Union chiefs warn Blair, Page 22</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires Federal agencies to give special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small entities, which are small businesses, small organizations, and small governments. The major purpose of the RFA is to keep paperwork and regulatory requirements from getting out of proportion to the scale of the entities being regulated, without compromising the objectives of, in this case, the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a regulation is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the EPA may give special consideration to those small entities when analyzing regulatory alternatives and drafting the regulation. In the case at hand, the EPA considers that a regulation that is likely to affect 20 percent or more of small entities with MWC's is a regulation that will affect a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Definitions of small entities are flexible. For analysis of the regulations being proposed today, the EPA considers a small business in this industry to be one with gross annual revenue less than $6 million, and a small government to be one that serves a population less than 50,000. (A typical city of 50,000 generates about 90 Mg/day of MSW.) Most small governments dispose of their MSW by landfilling and, therefore, will not be affected by regulation of MWC emissions. In regard to small organizations such as independent not-for-profit enterprises, the EPA finds that they have no more than a very minor involvement with MWC's, and for that reason the EPA has not found it necessary to study potential direct impacts on small organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many MWC's exist that range in size up to 35 Mg/day. The EPA estimates that MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity except for MWI's, which are being regulated in a separate action, contribute a negligible fraction of total MWC emissions. Many MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity, and a few larger ones, are owned or operated by small entities. The EPA estimates that considerably fewer than 20 percent of small-entity MWC's would be affected by the standards being proposed today were those MWC's to be constructed in the future. The EPA projects that the relative proportion of MWC's that are small-entity MWC's combusting less than 35 Mg/day will remain the same in the future as it is today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the number of affected small entities is not expected to be substantial, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Nevertheless, the EPA has conducted an extensive analysis of potential regulatory impacts on households, small governments, and small businesses. The analysis is summarized above in the discussion of regulatory cost and economic impacts. The full analysis is included in the economic impact assessment in the docket and is listed at the beginning of today's notice under <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed standards for MWC's that applied to all sizes of MWC's. The proposal had no lower size cutoff. Small businesses, small governments, and groups representing small-entity interests commented extensively on the need to lighten the potential regulatory burden on small entities. Most commenters suggested a small size cutoff considerably smaller than the one now being proposed. The most frequently suggested levels were 5 to 11 Mg/day, 18 Mg/day, 23 Mg/day, and 45 Mg/day. The EPA has used these suggestions and the information submitted by these commenters, as well as information from other sources, to fulfill the intent of the RFA. The EPA has incorporated into the regulation being proposed today several features that will mitigate, and in most cases eliminate, any potential, adverse economic impacts on small entities. These features are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The regulation will apply only to MWC's with a plant capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. This cutoff eliminates from the purview of the regulation the overwhelming majority of projected new, very small MWC's (There will be a one-time requirement for MWC plants in the 25 to 35 Mg/day range to report for verification the capacities and locations of the plants, but this paperwork will impose no economic burden);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The regulation is ``tiered'' so that the stringency (and therefore potential economic burden) of the emission standards increases as the size of the MWC plant increases. Plants with capacities less than or equal to 25 Mg/day are not covered under the proposed NSPS. Plants with capacities of 25 to 35 Mg/day would have only the one-time reporting requirement of capacity and location. Plants with capacities of 35 to 225 Mg/day are not required to control NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Only plants with capacities larger than 225 Mg/day_plants not often associated with small entities_are subject to a full complement of rigorous standards; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The regulation consists predominantly of emission standards, as opposed to design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards. Emission standards give MWC owners and operators the freedom to select the most economical means of compliance with the standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the number of small entities affected is not substantial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air pollution control, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeeping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan Z.

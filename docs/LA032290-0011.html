			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SEA LIONS: IN SEATTLE, THEY HAVE DEVOURED PRECIOUS STEELHEAD TROUT. A FEDERAL  PROJECT RETURNS SIX OF THE MARINE MAMMALS TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. WILL THEY  STAY?  </P> <P> The state of Washington, where residents have bumper stickers complaining about  greedy Californians, went to extraordinary lengths Wednesday to get rid of a  few.  </P> <P> With the help of the federal government, the state stuffed six California  natives into a horse trailer, drove them nonstop to Santa Barbara and shipped  them 48 miles out to sea to one of the Channel Islands off the Ventura County  coast.  </P> <P> But the six would-be emigres -- all California sea lions with an insatiable  craving for Washington's steelhead trout -- may prove as difficult to get rid  of as the hordes of smog-weary Californians who have migrated north.  </P> <P> Officials are afraid the sea lions will swim from their birthplace in the  Channel Islands back to the Seattle area, where they've destroyed a large part  of a run of steelhead trout during their last five winter migrations.  </P> <P> "The sea lions were born in California and raised in California, but,  unfortunately for us, they decided to take a winter vacation in the Northwest,"  said Joe Scordino, a deputy chief with the National Marine Fishery Service in  Seattle. "We're just cutting their tourism a bit short."  </P> <P> The West Coast population of the sea lions, who once were hunted nearly to  extinction for their pelts, has virtually exploded since they became a  protected species in 1972, biologists said. These days, the creatures are  causing problems from Seattle to San Francisco, where they have damaged part of  a $2-million pier at Fisherman's Wharf, but are not threatening any fish.  </P> <P> In Seattle, the beasts have eaten so many steelhead trout on their way to spawn  in tributaries of Lake Washington that the run at the Ballard Locks canal has  shrunk from about 4,000 fish annually to only 2,000, Scordino said. Two Indian  tribes in Seattle, the Muckleshoot and the Suquamish, have federal treaty  rights to fish for the trout and have pressured the state and federal  government to do something about the massacre, he said.  </P> <P> "It's pitting environmentalists against animal activists against commercial  fishermen," said Susan Ewing, a spokeswoman for the Washington Department of  Wildlife. "And everybody has conflicting opinions about what should be done."  </P> <P> Working together for the past five years, state and federal officials have  tried detonating firecrackers underwater to scare the sea lions away. It worked  for a couple of years, but the animals grew accustomed to the loud noise, said  Gene Kruse, deputy regional director for the National Marine Fishery Service in  Seattle.  </P> <P> So, the officials turned to feeding the sea lions dead fish laced with a  non-lethal substance that makes them vomit, Kruse said. The wily marine mammals  simply stopped eating the chemical fare after a while, he said.  </P> <P> Shooting the beasts with rubber bullets has had some effect, Kruse said, but a  program that involved shipping them 200 miles south failed. About 29 of the 37  sea lions trucked south just swam back to their prime feeding ground in  Seattle, he said.  </P> <P> "They're just too smart for us," Kruse said.  </P> <P> So, as a last resort, about $15,000 in federal funds was budgeted to cart the  marine mammals farther south to their home ground in the Channel Islands. The  sea lions' annual mating season begins there in May, and officials are hoping  the animals will stick around to get an early start, rather than heading 1,000  miles north to Washington for lunch.  </P> <P> If the six creatures stay put, government officials said they will consider  trucking south the 30 or so remaining in Seattle as well. But the cost of  hauling the 400- to 700-pound beasts may be prohibitive, Scordino said.  </P> <P> The state of Washington is also exploring whether it has a legal right under  federal laws to kill the beasts based on the theory that they are hurting the  public welfare by destroying the fish run, Scordino said.  </P> <P> But Scordino said he would much prefer it if the sea lions would simply go  away. And he made this concession: "Californians are welcome in Washington --  as long as they are not sea lions."  </P></p>

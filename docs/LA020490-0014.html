			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT DICTATORS?  </P> <P> In your article on the three proposed dump sites in North San Diego County  ("County Urged to Buy 3 New Landfill Sites," Jan. 25), you erroneously refer to  a decision by the County Board of Supervisors on acceptance of a dump site.  </P> <P> Actually, the only member of the Board of Supervisors who will vote on the  sites is Supervisor John MacDonald.  </P> <P> We have already been told that the other board members will go along with his  decision, since it is his district.  </P> <P> Since this is the case, perhaps having a board of five members is an antiquated  idea. With each member making the decisions for his or her own district,  eliminate the board and install members as district dictators.  </P> <P> It would save a bundle of money, and eliminate the facade of a board.  </P> <P> JEANNE RAY  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

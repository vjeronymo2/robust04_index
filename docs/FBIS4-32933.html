			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On 31 May, Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina stated the main goal of the Nonaligned Movement  [NAM] is to promote the economic and social development of the  Third World. During his address to the 11th ministerial summit  of the NAM, Robaina stressed that an opulent North and an  impoverished South is the world's reality today. He added that  if we sit on our hands, we are condemned to disappear, which  would mean the disappearance of two thirds of mankind. Robaina  affirmed that Cuba believes that the best guarantee for a  permanent and lasting peace is the elimination of hunger. Only  then will human rights bloom for all people rather than for a  minuscule portion of mankind.    Robaina affirmed that despite the over 30-year-old blockade  against Cuba, the Cuban people will overcome this difficult  junction, thanks, above all, to the solidarity of the NAM.    Robaina continues to fulfill a busy schedule that includes  meeting with representatives of Libya, the PRC, Cyprus, Panama,  Zambia, Colombia, Italy, and Ecuador.</p>

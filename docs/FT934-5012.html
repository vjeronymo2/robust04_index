			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Profit-sharing schemes The chancellor yesterday put forward proposals to: Ensure that a man aged 60 or over who becomes chargeable to income tax in respect of shares allocated to him under a scheme will not be chargeable on a greater amount than a woman of the same age. This change will take effect from today; Enable trustees of a profit sharing scheme to retain in the trust qualifying corporate bonds (QCBs) received when the company whose shares are held by the trustees is reconstructed or taken over; and to distribute the QCBs, in due course, tax-free to participants. This change will take effect in relation to QCBs received on or after the date of Royal assent to the finance bill. The chancellor intends to remove inequalities of treatment in the approved profit sharing scheme legislation, and make the scheme more flexible.</p>

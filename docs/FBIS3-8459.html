			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 9 Mar (TANJUG) -- The foreign ministry of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] today informed all diplomatic  and consular missions in Belgrade about the major Croatian  offensive in the area of the village of Kozjan near Korenica and  Mali Alan on Mt. Velebit, near Gracac, ISKRA reports.    Following minor provocations on 4 March, the Croatian Army  intensified its activities and is bringing in reinforcements  with strong artillery backing, the information says.    The representatives of diplomatic and consular missions in  Belgrade have been requested to inform their governments about  these assaults by Croatia against the sovereignty of the RSK,  and to raise the issue in international forums, in view of the  fact that Croatia is violating all the cease-fire agreements  signed with the RSK so far.    The Krajina Foreign Ministry warns that the latest attack  against the RSK, if the Croatian offensive is not checked, could  have dire consequences and could result in the escalation of the  war in the region of former Yugoslavia.</p>

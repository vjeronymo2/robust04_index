According to sources inside Iraq, the  explosion took place on Saturday [5 February] night, causing  severe property damage and killing some of the ministry's  employees.    Tyrant Saddam's regime imposed a tight cordon around the  scene of the blast and desperately tried to prevent the news  from reaching news agencies abroad, but eyewitnesses have  described the explosion as breathtaking and said it was heard in  several areas of Baghdad.</p>

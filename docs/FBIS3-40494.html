			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  plans to form an information network for the material industries  of tools and die, molding, and casting, using personal  computers. Utilizing the capabilities of personal computer  communication networks such as electronic bulletin boards,  conferences, and e-mail, an information network will be  established. At the same time, questions and demands from the  businesses will be considered, and a system for information  exchange will be built. Operation will be managed by the  Material Manufacturing Center and plans call for start up in  April, 1994. This is the first nationwide information network in  Japan connecting the government and corporations  bi-directionally.    Although materials manufacturing in Japan is an important  pillar supporting the manufacturing sector, industrial reform is  needed because of the protracted bad economy and the rising yen.  For this reason, concerns over loan policies, taxation, and aids  to fund employment, as well as the establishment of policies and  suggestions for improvement have been increasing. However since  the opinions are expressed to the government indirectly via the  heads of organizations such as area business associations or  industrial unions in each prefecture, it is difficult for the  owner of a business to raise his voice and to be heard directly.    The network system based on personal computer communication  establishes a ``Parts and Products Production Salon,'' to which  public organizations of material related industries and  associations will input necessary information. Electronic  bulletin boards, electronic conferences, e-mail, and databases  are planned for this network. For example, at an electronic  conference, discussion of business concerns can occur. As a  concrete plan, multiple corners including ``Opinions to MITI,''  ``Requests to the Material Center,'' and a ``Technical PeopleUs  Salon'' will be created.    Also, past question and answer sessions will be stored as  examples, enabling small business owners to use them as a  reference, helping them to prepare detailed steps that they can  take for smooth action.    Although a personal computer communication network is  provided by the ``MPT Online Public Announcement System,'' a  bi-directional communication network between government and  businesses is a first this time.</p>

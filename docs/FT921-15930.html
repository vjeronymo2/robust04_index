			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Shevardnadze offers to help Georgia: Siege ends after desertion of troops prompts Gamsakhurdia to flee MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, yesterday offered to return to his native Georgia to help establish democracy after the overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Mr Shevardnadze, who was Communist party leader in Georgia from 1972 to mid-1985, called for national reconciliation and said: 'I am personally ready to take part in this complex process.' His offer came as citizens emerged to pick their way through the rubble in the main avenue of the capital Tbilisi, devastated by fighting in the two-week siege of parliament. Mr Shevardnadze, 64 later this month, once embodied Communist dictatorship over Georgia and it is not known how its people would react to his return. But one rebel leader yesterday described him as an able figure who could help build democracy. The siege of the Georgian parliament ended in the early hours of yesterday morning when Mr Gamsakhurdia fled in the face of further barrages from opposition troops who then overran the building, parts of which were ablaze. The catalyst for Mr Gamsakhurdia's decision to flee seems to have been the desertion on Sunday night of 60 highly-trained security troops - one of his few military advantages over the opposition. By midnight, Mr Gamsakhurdia is said to have told his supporters that the battle for the government building had been lost. There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of the president, who had been under siege in the parliament building in central Tbilisi. Officials in Azerbaijan said he was heading for Armenia, but Armenian officials denied they had offered him asylum and said he was thought to be making for Gyandzha in Azerbaijan. 'Wherever he is we will find and arrest him and bring him back to stand trial in Georgia,' said Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the leaders of the military council that now controls the republic. The jubilant opposition claimed a victory for its strategy of holding back from launching an all-out attack, instead putting the president under constant military and psychological pressure. Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, the joint leader of the military council, said: 'We were prepared for this a long time ago. We said earlier that we were sure Mr Gamsakhurdia would leave without bloodshed. Our psychological warfare has worked.' Mr Iosseliani said the military council was likely to remain in control of Georgia until the situation stabilised. The opposition leader warned of possible 'excesses' by remaining forces of Mr Gamsakhurdia and said the network of regional prefects who had bolstered his dictatorship was still in place. In the longer term, the military council intends to hold new parliamentary elections, possibly in April, and said it was organising a political forum of all parties to prepare for these elections. The position of president will cease to exist. When Mr Gamsakhurdia fled the parliament more than 200 supporters went with him in a convoy of two armoured personnel carriers, three buses and other vehicles. The convoy left through the unguarded streets to the south of the building and apparently met no resistance until it clashed with an opposition detachment at a nearby bridge over the River Kura. Opposition leaders said about 10 government soldiers and five opposition soldiers had died in the shooting. Shevardnadze warning, Page 2 Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

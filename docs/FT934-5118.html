			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Big business gives its verdict Peter Bonfield Chairman, ICL 'This was the most entertaining Budget in recent years. We hope the confident delivery will add to confidence in the UK economy. The reduced PSBR should improve international confidence in the UK, thus increasing the opportunity for lower interest rates. The overall package for small business will be helpful. We also welcome the government's further encouragement of private-sector involvement in the provision of public services, and the proposed changes in public-sector accounting are long overdue. The chancellor assumes that inflation will remain low and the economy will grow. This is clearly a calculated bet on the future. Let's hope he is a good betting man.' Jon Walden Managing director, Lex Vehicle Leasing 'I'm delighted with the chancellor's forward-thinking Budget, which has finally recognised the importance of the motor industry in economic recovery by deciding not to increase substantially its tax burden. We're pleased in particular that there are no further changes to the company car taxation scheme due in April, such as requiring National Insurance contributions for employees. Other increases such as that on fuel and the ad valorem tax on insurance premiums are roughly in line with expectations. And we're pleased to see that there will be no introduction of road pricing until the proper technology is available. Overall, a Budget which should allow the fragile recovery to continue.' Sir Denys Henderson Chairman, ICI 'This is a skilful Budget and I believe that it should be welcomed by industry. The substantial phased reduction in the PSBR should assure the markets and limit the risks to the recovery against the background of the cut in interest rates. The measures to encourage small business are to be welcomed and particularly the schemes to increase venture capital investment. I also welcome the higher education spending and the adults' apprenticeship scheme. Industry has wanted this for a long time. The chancellor's strategy depends on lower interest rates, lower inflation and strict control of public expenditure and that is in the government's court.' Sir Barry Duxbury Director, Society of British Aerospace Companies 'These spending cuts will probably take another 5,000 to 10,000 people out of direct employment in the defence sector and will have an inevitable spin-off effect on indirect jobs linked to the industry. We feel that the Treasury has failed to appreciate the significant contribution the defence and aerospace industry makes to the overall economic wellbeing of the country. It makes an enormous contribution to exports and the balance of payments. Many civil projects also depend on that expenditure. Bringing together the MOD and the DTI on the issue of R &amp; D support for aerospace would be an important step forward: you can't run this industry in a vacuum between two ministries.' Geoffrey Whalen Managing director, Peugeot Talbot 'The vital thing was for the chancellor to protect the recovery by avoiding further substantial tax increases. This he appears to have done and to that extent the motor industry will be pleased. But motorists will be disappointed that the 3 per cent insurance tax will put up their costs. They will also be annoyed that tax on petrol and diesel has been increased by substantially more than previously indicated. This may help government revenues but, if a prime purpose of the fuel tax increase was to reduce CO2 emissions, he should have reduced the tax on diesel. Motorists will also await with trepidation plans for electronic motorway charging.' Malcolm Taylor Managing director, Bridgeport Machines 'I am very disappointed that no measures were announced to stimulate the economy by increasing investment. Fiscal policies such as low interest rates are not enough on their own to stimulate investment, and we had thought that both the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry accepted that. But the chancellor did nothing to extend the two-year temporary 40 per cent capital allowance. Employers will look at the apprentice training scheme with great interest and are likely to view it positively. The move to discourage late payment of bills is also a good thing, although it is difficult to know how it will work in practice.' Joe Dwyer Chief Executive, Wimpey 'On the face of it, this appears to be a relatively neutral Budget for construction - not worse and perhaps slightly better than expected. On MIRAS, the proposed cut is not dramatic and may even encourage some people to bring forward their home-buying plans. The sharpest pain will come from overall capital spending cuts of 10 per cent over the next two years. These will heighten the industry's difficulties, given our over-dependence on public investment until private investors regain confidence. But if the chancellor puts real muscle behind his commitment to private-public sector initiatives, this is most encouraging - if only for the longer term.'</p>

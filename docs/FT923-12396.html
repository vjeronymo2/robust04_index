			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Moscow call for Estonia sanctions RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday demanded sanctions against the Baltic republic of Estonia if it does not stop discriminating against its large Russian minority. The resolution, which included a call to consider suspending the co-operation treaty between the two states and a threat to raise the issue at the United Nations, is a sign of the deepening hostility between Russia and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. It is also a further indication of the hardening of attitudes in Russian political circles - a trend which is leaving Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the moderate foreign minister, increasingly isolated. The latest call for his resignation came yesterday from General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, who again accused him of malign intent in predicting a coup organised by military and security circles. In spite of efforts to improve relations - especially on the parts of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, his Lithuanian counterpart - the issues between them continue to drive them further apart. The Russian parliament derailed the government's budget yesterday, vetoing a budget deficit proposed by the acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, and agreeing extra spending of Rbs100bn, Reuter reports from Moscow. A new deal, passed by an overwhelming majority, envisages a budget deficit of Rbs950bn, up from Rbs800bn proposed on Thursday. Mr Gaidar last month put the deficit at Rbs690bn. The presidium of the Russian parliament yesterday appointed Mr Viktor Gerashchenko as acting head of the Russian central bank. Mr Gerashchenko, the former head of the Soviet State Bank, Gosbank, replaces Mr Georgy Matyukhin, who resigned on Thursday. A plan to attract foreign investment of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn) a year over the next three years was yesterday adopted by the Russian cabinet. The ambitious target - given a total of only Dollars 2bn in foreign investment over the past five years - would make up 18 per cent of total investment in the economy, according to Mr Gaidar. The programme calls for further legislation on investment to be enacted this year, together with changes in tax and customs duties.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar beats off predator HONGKONG LAND has only increased its stake in Trafalgar House by a negligible amount after its tender offer closed yesterday afternoon. Hongkong Land, which recently bought a 14.9 per cent stake, was unable to push its holding above 15 per cent. It will formally announce the result on Monday. The colony's leading property and development group hoped to take its stake up to 29.9 per cent. Directors at Trafalgar, where the board will meet on Monday to discuss the issue, said the result vindicated their arguments that their property, construction and engineering group was worth considerably more than the 85p a share offered by Hongkong Land. They also said they were delighted with the loyalty shown by shareholders. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are expected to seek a meeting with Sir Nigel Broackes and Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chairman and chief executive respectively. The Keswicks are still hoping for representation on Trafalgar's board and are expected to tell Trafalgar's directors that their international contacts could help the group secure further contracts. They are also expected to argue that they have strengthened the group by underpinning the price of Trafalgar's shares through their offer price of 85p a share. One item for discussion will be Trafalgar's hotels which Trafalgar is trying to sell. The Keswicks are expected to argue that the group no longer needs to make what appears to be distressed sales. Trafalgar, however, is unlikely to feel under any pressure to heed the Keswicks's wishes. Nonetheless, some of the group's shareholders yesterday said Trafalgar should not interpret their decision not to sell in the tender offer as an endorsement of the group's strategy and management. Trafalgar's shareholders did not believe that 85p a share represented good value. Many are waiting to see whether Hongkong Land continues to try and buy more shares or launches a full bid. The ordinary shares closed yesterday at 85 1/2 p and the A shares at 82 1/2 p. See Lex</p>

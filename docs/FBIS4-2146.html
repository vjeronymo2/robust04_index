			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Forex Market Opens Smoothly"] </F>   [Text] The country's first interbank foreign exchange  market has been operating smoothly since it started trading on  Monday.    And the price of the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars remained  fairly steady the past two days at the Shanghai-based China  Foreign Exchange Trading Centre.    The US dollar opened at 8.6889 yuan and edged up to 8.6948  yesterday.    The average weighted price of the U.S. dollar yesterday was  8.6999 yuan, slightly higher than the previous average of 8.6967  yuan.    Total transaction value on Monday and Tuesday was $89.77  million.    More than 2 million Hong Kong dollars ($256,000) changed  hands yesterday and the average price closed at 1.1275 yuan,  slightly up from 1.1273 on Monday.    The centre only handles U.S. and Hong Kong dollar  transactions.    But it has been hailed by market analysts as a major step  forward in China's foreign exchange reform.    They say it will help make the country's rate truly reflect  the supply and demand of foreign exchange.    Daily trading prices quoted on the market are referred to  the  central bank to set the next day's rate.    The central bank adjusts the exchange rate by buying and  selling hard currencies on the market.    The official said it is hard to predict how the rate will  change in the coming months, adding that its stability depends  on the economy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["First of a series of interviews" with Lieutenant Colonel </F> (Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the  Interior Office by police reporter Alemany; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Alemany] In Havana Province, a number of measures  have been taken by Interior Office police to guarantee that  agricultural products harvested this year will reach the  population and to avoid their being diverted or stolen by  unscrupulous people. In this struggle against those who  illegally get their hands on foodstuffs earmarked for the  population, the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP]  forces play a fundamental role, Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio  Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the Interior  [Minint] Office stressed.    [(Geronez)] We have formulated a joint plan this year. SUVP  forces play a fundamental role in this plan, from the community  level to the provincial level. The objective is to have all the  products being harvested in Havana Province reach their  fundamental destinations, either to cold-storage facilities or  directly to the population for consumption.    [Alemany] It has been pointed out that according to  calculations made in the past, almost 30 percent of the  agricultural products harvested in Havana Province have gone  into the underground economy. For that reason, these  agricultural products did not reach the consumer through the  local produce markets [agromercados y placitas].    [(Geronez]) The plan we have formulated covers particular  times or places, basically, from the time the product is  harvested in the fields to the time the product arrives at the  cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site [mercado  concentrador].    For the moment, SUVP groups have been activated at places  dealing with the fields, that is to say where the product is  harvested, taken out of the ground, SUVP groups belonging to the  miscellaneous crops enterprise, the Basic Cooperative Production  Units [UBPC], or the community, that is, all SUVP groups that,  through residency or organization, have anything to do with  watching over and protecting the product in the fields. That  vigilance is maintained 24 hours a day until the product is  loaded onto trucks. They have to guarantee the vigilance and  protection of those products at the site with their personnel  and resources and with the methodological help of the comrades  from the Ministry of Interior. Thieves must not be allowed to go  there and carry things off and then go and do all the wheeling  and dealing that they do with these products.    [Alemany] Lt. Col. (Geronez) also said that during these  months of harvesting tubers, vegetables and other products in  Havana Province, strict controls have been established, among  these, establishing fixed routes for the trucks.    [(Geronez)] Once the product is loaded onto the truck or  trucks, a set of measures has been taken, measures that cover  the vehicles' entire travel itinerary, all the way to the  cold-storage facility or the product-concentrating site. The  basic elements of the measures are that basic fixed routes are  established for the trucks to follow.    Because of the number of product-producing municipalities we  have, we have established five basic fixed routes in the  province. We have given each of these fixed routes a particular  identification. This identification appears on the documentation  that every truck carries. For every itinerary, we have chosen a  color and a number, and this color and number appear on the  documentation that the driver carries. This permits the  checkpoints that we have set up to quickly determine when a  truck is not following the proper itinerary, is off the fixed  route it should be following. And, precisely, when a truck is  found to be out of its fixed route, an investigation is  conducted by the police, to determine the reasons, the causes,  to see why the truck is deviating from its set route.    [Alemany] The second part of this interview with Lt. Col.  (Octavio Geronez) will be given tomorrow on Radio Progreso's  "First Thing in the Morning" program, at this same time. This is  reporter Alemany, on the "First Thing in the Morning" program.</p>

They have also  put aside sufficient time to stay in Iran, again indicating the  importance of this relationship. They also intend to visit  various parts of the country, again indicating their interest in  Iran. We did the same while in Turkmenistan. I think this  could be a good example for the world, of relations between two  countries. God willing.

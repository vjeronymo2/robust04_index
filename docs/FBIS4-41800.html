			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 121 (611); </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] According to preliminary reports from district  electoral commissions, the current head of state Leonid Kravchuk  and the former prime-minister Leonid Kuchma hold the lead among  presidential candidates.    Kravchuk is more popular in West Ukraine. In Ternopol 82 pct  [percent] of votes were cast for him, in Rovno 70.    Kuchma was supported by the majority in the East and in  Crimea. A preliminary report of the Central Electoral Commission  says 82.6 pct of the voters that came to polling stations in  Crimea cast their ballots for Kuchma and only 7.4 for Kravchuk.    Vote-counting continues, however, observers feel that  Kravchuk and Kuchma are the most likely candidates to continue  the presidential race.    The overall turnout was 68 pct of the electorate.    After voting on Sunday [26 June] Kravchuk answered questions  from the press at a polling station in Kiev. He declared that  the parliament cannot legally restrict the powers of the  president. According to him, "The president is elected as the  head of state and the head of the executive branch of power." IF  Note: At the moment the Ukrainian parliament is discussing  amendments to the law on presidency under which the president  would only have the powers of the head of state.    Kravchuk believes that the powers of the president can be  altered only through a referendum declared by parliament. "But  if such a referendum is announced, the powers of the parliament  might end with it," he stressed. If the parliament tries to  restrict presidential powers without a referendum, confrontation  is going to begin, the president thinks. This should be  realized by both sides.    Kravchuk spoke of the priority of relations with Russia for  his country. Whoever is elected president must understand that,  he said. Kravchuk said he continues to insist on Ukraine's  membership in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. He said he  submitted an appropriate suggestion to parliament.    Meanwhile, Kuchma intends to refrain from submitting the  matter to parliament in the event of being elected. "Ukraine has  not received a cent in Western aid for scrapping nuclear  weapons," he explained his stance to the press on Sunday in Kiev.    "If the parliament restricts presidential powers and I am  elected, either of the two will have to step down," Kuchma said  adding that no one runs for presidency in order to resign.    Speaking of his economic policy Kuchma said he favored a  civilized market controlled by the state. As for foreign policy  he said: "We have many tasks inside the CIS." According to  him, Ukraine should contact countries that want to have  relations with it.    Kuchma spoke for revising the Ukrainian tax policy and  fixing  the exchange rate of the karbovanets with regard to key foreign  currencies.    He said he does not see any tension in Crimea. In his  opinion there are certain circles that find tension in Crimea  advantageous. In his opinion the problem of the Black Sea Fleet  was resolved by the present cabinet a long time ago.</p>

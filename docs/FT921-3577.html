			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 13: EC appetite ensures low vacancy rate - Belgium / Enlargement of the Community and closer political union will fuel demand for office space in Brussels OVER the past 18 months, those few doubters who played down the influence of the European Community institutions on the Brussels property market have had their doubts swept away. Brussels dominates the Belgian office market - 7.5m sq m account for 75 per cent of the country's office space - and the European Commission, Parliament and Council dominate Brussels. Last year, the Commission - the biggest EC employer in the Belgian capital - decided it would have to move out of its headquarters, the starfish-shaped and asbestos-filled Berlaymont building in Brussels' Quartier Leopold. The Brussels authorities were asked to lease an extra 125,000 sq m on behalf of the Commission, boosting Brussels' annual take-up of office space by nearly 40 per cent to 380,000 sq m. The Berlaymont itself is to be stripped of asbestos and refurbished. In 1992, the most dramatic development has been the European Parliament's decision to lease the 380,000 sq m Espace Leopold, a massive three-phase development of offices and 'conference space', including a 1,000-seat auditorium. The signing of the lease contract - at an unspecified rent - may be the first stage in wrestling the monthly full sessions of the European Parliament away from Strasbourg, which desperately wants to hang on to its place on the EC band-wagon. But apart from the political ramifications, the EC's appetite for offices has also left Brussels with an extraordinarily low vacancy rate. In the Quartier Leopold, available office space is said to be less than 1 per cent of the total and the city average is 2.6 per cent compared with 5 to 10 per cent elsewhere, and perhaps 20 per cent in the City of London. Over the next decade, a combination of enlargement of the EC and closer political union will continue to fuel the demand for office space in Brussels, from institutions and companies directly or indirectly involved with Community affairs. Some 180,000 sqare metres of office space is under construction near Brussels' north station, including a 110,000 sqare metres twin-tower development which is Brussels' largest speculative project. But sites for the offices of the future - at least within the coveted area covered by the 19 municipalities of Brussels - are few and far between. That should be good news for rental values, which are historically lower than elsewhere in Europe. Annually, Brussels' top office rents stand at BFr9,000 per square metre, just under a quarter of the peak rental values in London. 'One of the problems in London and Paris was that we saw boom years where 20 per cent or more was put on rental values and the whole market got overheated,' says Mr Neil Jones, an investment surveyor with Healey &amp; Baker's Brussels office. 'That's not likely to happen here because the Belgian economy remains healthy and interest rates are manageable - relative to the rest of Europe it hasn't been badly hit.' Office rents in Brussels are continuing to rise, making it the only city in Europe experiencing continued growth, apart from Berlin. In Brussels, rents increased by 12 per cent last year and have risen at an average of about 10 per cent over the past decade. The influences on the Belgian retail market are quite different. Indeed, the Belgian public authorities seem to have hampered rather than encouraged investment in retail property, by applying rigid rules on planning permission and construction of large-scale city-centre redevelopment and new out-of-town shopping centres. That has meant that most towns have retained a prime central retail area, with the limited available space greatly in demand. That said, Brussels' retail rents - now running at about BFr72,000 per sq m per year - are still lower than those in Madrid, Rome, London and Paris. One symptom of the squeeze on retail space has been the steady rise over the past 18 months in the share price of Belgium's three largest supermarket chains. This has been partly attributed to competitors' inability to establish a strong foothold in the retail property market. The situation is beginning to change. Belgium's largest shopping centre, 36,000 sq m next to an existing 16,000 sq m hypermarket, is to open near Antwerp in a year's time, and there are other limited schemes under consideration. Despite its attractions, however, foreign property investors are not flocking to the Belgian market. In all sectors, Belgium is affected by the same malaise which has struck across Europe. German, Dutch, British, French and Swedish investors are waiting for economic problems at home to clear up before they take the plunge abroad. But with Belgium's and Brussels' characteristic qualities likely to be enhanced rather than diminished over the coming years, property analysts are confident that the institutions will return to the market in due course. 'There are a lot of foreign investors waiting on the sidelines at the moment,' says Mr Jones.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords cost in           Agents fees: 15% + 17% VAT letting of a building  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants cost in             Real estate tax: 10% of rent leasing of a building       Registration cost of lease: minimal sum                             Legal fees                             Agent fees: if agent is acting for the                             tenant  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Registration tax: 12.5% (60% of which is or owner/occupier           recoverable if property is sold again                             within five years).

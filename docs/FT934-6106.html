			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Calverley quits Trafalgar House Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate which is in the midst of a wide-ranging review of its businesses, is replacing the head of its loss-making property business. David Calverley, 52, chairman of the group's property division, will leave the group at the end of the year. Calverley, who joined Trafalgar House in 1968, is the latest member of the old guard to leave the company which was founded by Sir Nigel Broackes in 1956. A well known and popular figure in the property business, Calverley played an important part in expanding Trafalgar's property interests under Sir Eric Parker who stepped down as chief executive last year. However, the company has been hard hit by the recession and will shortly announce details of its third cash-raising exercise in two years to repair a balance sheet which has been damaged by large property writedowns. Hongkong Land, which has built up a stake of just under 26 per cent in the business over the past year, has been overhauling the Trafalgar House management team - which helps explain Calverley's departure. Calverley was on a three-year contract but Trafalgar House says compensation for terminating his contract would be substantially less than he would have been paid over the next three years. His replacement is expected to come from outside the group.</p>

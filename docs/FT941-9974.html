			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers shows 15.6% underlying growth United Carriers Group, the parcels and freight distribution company which will be floated next month, yesterday said that its underlying profitability increased by 15.6 per cent last year. The pathfinder prospectus for the group, which is expected to have a market value of just over Pounds 50m, said operating profit on continuing operations before exceptionals rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.3m in the year to December 31. Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 93m to Pounds 106.4m, including Pounds 11.2m of sales from Carpet Express since its acquisition in March. Parcels volumes were up by 7-8 per cent, but part of the specialist distribution business suffered from lower car sales in continental Europe. A placing will raise about Pounds 7m of new money. In the short term, the proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings and strengthen the balance sheet, which has gearing of 42.5 per cent. However, Mr Allan Binks, chairman and chief executive, said the group would invest about Pounds 7m over the next two to three years in the further development of the United Carriers depot network, which specialises in the distribution of heavy consignments, from 25kg to 250kg. United Carriers and certain other businesses were acquired from Bunzl in a management buy-out in 1989, supported by institutional investors led by Phildrew Ventures. The management team - which currently has a 20 per cent stake in the company  -rationalised the core parcels and freight distribution business and improved profitability by focusing on the higher weight segment of the market. The group also operates specialist transport and distribution businesses, covering Vauxhall automotive components and cars; Carpet Express, which supplies retail and wholesale outlets; and Homelink, which provides a home delivery service for large mail order houses. It also supplies dedicated distribution services for corporate customers. The listing is being sponsored by Lazards, with UBS acting as broker to the placing. The prospectus is expected to be published on February 24 and dealing in the shares should start on Thursday, March 3.</p>

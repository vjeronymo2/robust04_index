			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Humberto Lugo Gil, acting leader of the Senate of  the Republic, demanded reciprocity from U.S. Congressman Robert  Torricelli for the services and treatment he received during his  trip to Mexico.    [Begin Lugo recording] We welcome any one who wants to come  and visit us to see what the national situation is like. We ask  him to be objective in his observations based on the general  reality of our country and not based only on the events of a  specific time span, to prevent this person -- or any other  visitor -- from reaching conclusions that do not reflect the  truth about the real situation we are experiencing here, both  domestically and abroad. [end recording]    Most Mexicans are bothered by Robert Torricelli's presence.  This is the same U.S. congressman who always opposed NAFTA and  has even proposed even stricter and stronger border restrictions  for immigrants, particularly Mexicans, to our northern  neighbor's Congress. Important high-ranking officials and public  leaders say Robert Torricelli is not welcome in Mexico,  including former Mexican Foreign Minister Fernando Solana, a  candidate for the Senate.    Fidel Velasquez, secretary general of the Confederation of  Mexican Workers, said there is nothing lost because of the  Torricelli visit. He said he is not violating national  sovereignty with his statements. This happens in Mexico,  because Mexico is a very generous nation. In any case, Don  Fidel still is not very pleased with the visit.</p>

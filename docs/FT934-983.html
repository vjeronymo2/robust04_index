			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Israel and Palestinians edging towards compromise on borders Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation appeared to be edging towards a compromise in deadlocked peace negotiations as the two sides resumed top-level talks in Paris last night. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said his government would accept Palestinian co-ordination at border crossings 'as long as we will be able to control, for the sake of security, everybody that crosses'. In Tunis, PLO officials indicated that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, had agreed to back down on his demand for full Palestinian control of border crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho and Jordan. The officials said the PLO was prepared to concede control in return for extensive powers for Palestinian police at checkpoints. The issue of border control has been the main point impeding the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord's implementation. Israel has insisted the peace deal left external security exclusively in the hands of the Jewish state and has accused Mr Arafat of trying to win important concessions over sovereignty, which the agreement left to later negotiations. Mr Rabin told the foreign affairs and defence committee of Israel's parliament yesterday that the US, European Union, Egypt and Morocco supported Israel's interpretation of the peace accord as did Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO official who signed the agreement with Israel in September. Israeli officials said the inclusion of Mr Abbas in the Palestinian team meeting Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Paris last night was a sign of progress. Mr Abbas has reportedly been at loggerheads with Mr Arafat for several weeks over the PLO chairman's management of peace talks. Officials said that once a compromise was found on the border issue, resolution of the other key obstacle - the size of the Jericho area - would be relatively quick. Meanwhile, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Gulf Arab states yesterday discussed the possibility of easing the Arab economic boycott of Israel. Mr Youssef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah, Omani foreign minister of state, said: 'Lifting the boycott could be in our favour.' Diplomats, however, said it was unlikely the Gulf states would lift the boycott before there was a united Arab decision through the Arab League.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (XINHUA) -- South Korea has decided  to concentrate on a peaceful settlement of the nuclear problem  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through  dialogue such as a high-level meeting between Washington and  Pyongyang.    The decision was made at a Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Committee Meeting presided over by Deputy Prime  Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi  Hong-ku here Friday [17 June].    Former President of the United States Jimmy Carter, who is  currently on a visit in Pyongyang, held first round of talks  with the DPRK's President Kim Il-song yesterday on ways to find  a solution to the nuclear issue.    Kim was quoted as telling Carter that his country has  changed  its mind and will let two inspectors of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) remain in the DPRK.    Meanwhile, Carter reportedly said that Washington-Pyongyang  high- level talks may resume if the DPRK freezes its nuclear  program.    The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on  the nuclear issue in June and July last year. The third round  of talks, which had been scheduled for March 21 this year, was  cancelled due to differences between the two sides.    The South Korean Government will announce its position on  Pyongyang's new sign of reconciliation after President Kim  Yong-sam meets with Carter again over the weekend, officials  here said.    Carter, who went to Pyongyang through the heavily-fortified  border village of Panmunjom after a three-day visit to South  Korea, will return to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief  President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks with DPRK  leaders before heading back to Washington.    The former U.S. President said earlier that his trip would  be  a private one aiming "to discuss some of the important issues of  the day with leaders of the area."    The United States yesterday submitted a draft resolution at  the United Nations Security Council calling for sanctions  against the DPRK, which on Monday withdrew from IAEA, the United  Nations nuclear watchdog, and declared not to accept any more  inspections of its nuclear program.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Nationwide tumbles to Pounds 201.9m PRE-TAX PROFITS at Nationwide, the second largest UK building society, tumbled by 29 per cent to Pounds 201.9m in the year to April 4. The fall reflected provisions of Pounds 235.9m against doubtful loans, the highest such charge in the industry. Operating profits before provisions were up from Pounds 379.5m to Pounds 437.8m. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said the results showed that the society had managed to stem the decline in its losses arising from unparalleled difficulties in the housing market last year. Analysts agreed that the result was better than had been feared. 'There are signs that despite another disappointing result, Nationwide is on course for improvement,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Total assets were up by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 34bn, while net mortgage lending was down to Pounds 2.6bn (Pounds 3.5bn). Retail savings were up from Pounds 23.5bn to Pounds 25bn. About 23 per cent of funding is now raised on the wholesale money markets rather than through deposits. The interest margin narrowed slightly, from 2.35 per cent to 2.21 per cent. Losses at Nationwide Estate Agents were reduced from Pounds 15m to Pounds 12m. On other fronts there were signs of improvement. The cost:income ratio fell for the fourth year in succession to 55.2 per cent. There was a 31 per cent increase in income from fees and commissions to Pounds 255.6m, mostly achieved through the sale of insurance through its branches. The society has also maintained a strong capital ratio. The Tier 1 capital ratio is now 8.45 per cent (8.34 per cent) and is expected to rise to 8.7 per cent shortly when the society goes ahead with an issue of permanent interest-bearing shares in London.</p>

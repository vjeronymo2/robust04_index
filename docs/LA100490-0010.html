			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Exhibit Grows in Brooklyn: The Brooklyn Museum is showing deliberately  "objectionable" artworks funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> Museum officials culled the display of nude children, embracing lesbians and  homo-erotic paintings from their own collection, in response to what they call  the current climate of censorship. The exhibit, "The Brooklyn Museum  Collection: The Play of the Unmentionable," also includes Robert Mapplethorpe  photographs. It runs until Dec. 4. NEA spokeswoman Virginia Falck said Tuesday  the endowment was not aware of the nature of the exhibit and was "looking into  it." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Major accused over BMA MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was accused in the Commons yesterday of having 'totally misrepresented' the views of the British Medical Association on the introduction of contracts for general practitioners, Ivor Owen writes. Mr John Cunningham, Labour's shadow leader of the house, claimed that Hansard, the official parliamentary report, had been 'doctored' to correct erroneous statements made by the prime minister. He said Mr Major implied on Thursday that the BMA had departed from its opposition to GPs' contracts. Mr Cunningham said the BMA remained opposed to contracts and 'yet again the prime minister was badly briefed or confused - or both'. Mr Harold Walker, the deputy speaker, promised to start an inquiry.</p>

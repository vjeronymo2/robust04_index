			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> WOMAN IS ACCUSED OF CHECK-KITING  </P> <P> A Dana Point woman was arrested on suspicion of using a complex check-kiting  scheme to steal more than $50,000 from at least 10 Orange County banks,  authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> "Our banks were getting hit real hard.  </P> <P> We don't see kiters of this magnitude everyday," said Sheriff's Sgt. Stan  Kinkade.  </P> <P> Shirley K. Harvey, 20, was arrested Friday after a monthlong investigation on  suspicion of opening bank accounts at 18 local and Florida banks with checks  drawn on other accounts that already had been closed, Kinkade said.  </P> <P> "The complexity of the scheme is only starting to unravel," Kinkade added. "We  expect there might be more (banks) involved."  </P> <P> Authorities said they believe that Harvey, who also went by the name of Trisha  Michele Browne, worked alone.  </P> <P> Harvey bought two new vehicles from South County car dealerships using funds  obtained through the scheme, Kinkade alleged.  </P> <P> Harvey was arrested while allegedly trying to withdraw money from Dana Niguel  Bank in the 34100 block of Coast Highway, Kinkade said. She is being held at  County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.  </P></p>

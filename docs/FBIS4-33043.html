			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Venezuelan President Rafael </F> Caldera by reporter Marcel Granier in Caracas on 29 March; first  two paragraphs are an introduction]    [Text] President Rafael Caldera told Marcel Granier during  an interview at the Radio Caracas Television Studios on 29 March  that those banks which have received financial assistance from  the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade] no  longer belong to bankers, but, rather, to the country, and they  will have to be rehabilitated in order to be privatized.    Certain aspects of the lengthy dialogue between President  Caldera and Granier follow:    [Granier] President Caldera, when Venezuelans elected you as  president of the Republic for a second time, the country was  experiencing a serious political, economic, and social crisis.  During the short time that has passed since you took office, we  have observed a growing stabilization in the political arena.  The instability, confusion, dislike, and contempt that have  existed regarding politics have begun to vanish, and one senses  the people have regained pride in their basic institutions.  There is a revival of trust in that area. When will we be able  to see the same stabilization we have witnessed in the political  arena in the economic and social areas?    [Caldera] We are on the way. I am determined and convinced I  will achieve it once the puzzle is assembled, but this country  is in the midst of chaos; everyone is looking after his own  interests. I want to urge my friends and colleagues at the  university: Show the country that you feel as a part of  Venezuela, that your problem is part of a larger problem that  affects the entire country, that you are willing to make  sacrifices, as we all should, to get the country going.    The economic situation has been, undoubtedly, on the front  burner. First, it was Banco Latino's intervention, which,  despite being a very serious problem, was resolved, and  satisfactorily, according to many. The intervention of Banco  Latino has unveiled the fact that other banks were facing  problems as well, that a systemic crisis was occurring. Those  banks that receive financial assistance from Fogade are actually  obtaining money the Central Bank withdraws from its reserves.  The Central Bank gives these funds to Fogade, which, in turn,  gives it to the banks, and rumors claim that bankers receive the  money, which is untrue. These funds are given to depositors,  savers, those who have suffered anxiety similar to that  experienced by those involved in the Banco Latino case. Those  people numbered almost as many depositors as those affected by  the intervention of Banco Latino.    Incidentally, I would like to insist on this explanation.  That money has not been given away; it was given to the banks in  exchange for their shares, their assets, and their properties.  Those banks no longer belong to bankers but, rather, to the  country. The country will have to rehabilitate them in order to  see whether it privatizes or sells them, and whatever profits  are made from their sale will help reimburse the Central Bank  for its loan to Fogade.    It has truly been a serious situation, but, fortunately, it  is stabilizing. I have met, almost daily, with the Central Bank  Board of Directors, discussing the problem over with them, and I  have told them of my decision to take any necessary measures,  because I am willing to put the country's interest above all.  They have talked about it, studied it, and made various  suggestions, and so far we believe the current system is heading  toward a balance.    [Granier] It has been, undoubtedly, a significant move. Many  are blaming the exacerbation of the problem on a lack of  coordination of your economic team. Is that why you have made  the cabinet changes the media published yesterday?    [Caldera] It is natural for a government team to be  organized  in accordance with its party. Adjustments may be implemented  later, but a government team arrives with built-in machinery.    The English, for instance, have a proposed cabinet so that  when the opposition assumes power it does so accompanied by its  entire team. This is not the case here. We had a true  convergence, and due to the participation of people from various  trends, we have had to incorporate different views. Thus, the  machinery has been organized, adapted, and the system has been  established. The government team has worked hard. The problem is  that we received this country in an extremely poor condition. I  do not believe it would be constructive or prudent for the  people if we were to persist in telling them of the disarray we  have encountered.    Do you believe I am like Perez?    [Granier] Not at all, thank God.    [Caldera] Commander Chavez is the one person who you should  not confuse me with Perez. I am not interested nor do I believe  it is appropriate for me to engage in a discussion with him. I  have given him every assurance for his return to civilian life  and for him to use all the rights he has as a Venezuelan. If  this is the way he feels, fine; he has the right to say so even  though what he says many times borders on what the laws  tolerate. Anyway, it is best for the country to hear him and for  the country to begin seeing things the way they really are. It  is best for the country to begin realizing who is who, how  people think, and what they want.    [Granier] It has been said one cause of the economic problem  is the many and contradictory statements the government  spokesmen are making about it. Will the cabinet change mean the  government will have only one economic spokesman?    [Caldera] According to the law, the Finance Ministry is the  center of the government's economic policy. Dr. Julio Sosa is  the government's most authorized authority in economic matters.  Julio's full name is Julio Sosa Rodriguez. Somebody has said we  are cousins, because I am Caldera Rodriguez. There is no kinship  between us or between us and the Rodriguez relatives of Carlos  Andres Perez.    We cannot avoid cabinet members speaking to the media at  various activities. I have occasionally noticed this; some have  different ideas, different points of view, and we have been  working on this. This is why I am receiving reports from all the  ministers at least once a week and from certain ministers  several times a week. I have done this in compliance with a  commitment, because I think the president, as the country's  manager, must manage his government team. I have done this to  create, to build a common position in the government. There have  been difficulties, and I have not achieved a perfect situation,  but I think we are marching in that direction.    [Granier] Currency exchange stability is very important for  the economic stability we all want, but there are two other  matters on which I would like for you to comment. Venezuela  urgently needs investments, and they will be coming, basically,  from abroad. To make changes possible, Venezuela needs programs  of social assistance; that is, there are people who are more  negatively affected when the value of the dollar rises from 120  to 160 bolivares. The economic recession that exists due to the  hike in the value of the dollar, the drop in imports, and the  reduction in oil exports has negatively affected economic  growth. The impact of this situation is more severe on certain  people more than others. What social assistance plans or  programs does your government have?    [Caldera] I will begin by saying there is no single week  during which I fail to receive the visit of one, two, or more  foreign investors who come to tell me of their plans to invest  in Venezuela. I would like to see Venezuelan investors come to  me in the same number as the foreign investors.    We have opened some doors. The Law for Construction of Works  Using the Concessions System is most important, as acknowledged  by the many people who are connected with the construction  industry or the economy. This opens the doors for important  public works that the state cannot carry out now and that need  to be concluded, and this is why it is necessary to take  advantage of investments. Those who use services are prepared to  pay for them. Tolls on highways will be a heavy burden, but the  people are willing to pay, because they will get where they are  going quicker, more comfortably, and will save on fuel and car  wear. For example, how long has it been since the opening of the  Romulo Betancour Highway in the east?    We are again promoting the Program on Equipping  Neighborhoods  and Public Housing. This neighborhood program is very  interesting, because in some of those neighborhoods there are  houses built by the townspeople with great efforts, homes that  are comfortable with fairly good amenities but without public  services. There are no streets, no water, no sewage, and no  telephones. We are trying to create awareness and the  possibility of the communities living decently.    I realize that this drama that is over--I think it is,  fortunately, over this matter of the dollar and the exchange  rate--has produced, due to devaluation, another process of  inflation and that this directly affects the poor sectors. We  have to face that. I am prepared to make all the necessary  efforts, serious efforts. I do not want to tell lies. I do not  want to announce things that will not be carried out.</p>

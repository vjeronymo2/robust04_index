			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Perot poll campaign shows signs of growing disarray SENIOR Democrats and Republicans are openly speculating that Mr Ross Perot will not launch his independent run for the US presidency, amid growing signs of disarray in the Texan billionaire's camp. Mr Perot might pull out now that his prospective campaign has run into controversy and lost momentum, according to Governor Ann Richards of Texas and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, both Democrats, and Mr Bill Bennett, the Republican former secretary of education. Several newspapers reported from Dallas yesterday that Mr Hamilton Jordan, who ran the successful Carter campaign in 1976, was threatening to resign as an adviser because Mr Perot was refusing to listen to his advice. Mr Jordan denied the reports. But Mr Ed Rollins, the Republican political expert recruited at the same time as Mr Jordan, confirmed there had been 'internal dissension' last week when Mr Perot summarily dispensed with the services of an advertising consultant recommended by both of them. Mr Perot opted instead to use an old Texas colleague with little experience in politics. Mr Perot also lost the potential support of a prominent Democrat yesterday when Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia endorsed Mr Bill Clinton, who is due to be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate tonight. There had been a spate of well-founded rumours that Mr Perot was considering offering Mr Wilder, who withdrew from the Democratic race early in the year, the number two spot on his ticket. The Perot bandwagon has slowed. The opinion polls, which had him ahead of both President George Bush and Mr Clinton last month, now mostly put him in second or third place. The decline is not as fast as his rise, but a poll published yesterday had him down to 24 per cent, with Mr Clinton on nearly 35 per cent and Mr Bush on 31. Mr Perot is increasingly viewed in a negative light, mostly because of the lack of specifics behind his populist ideas. Last weekend, he appeared to demean a black political audience by referring to 'you people'. This received such critical coverage that he is understood to have personally complained to CNN, the network on which he has promoted his own cause. Mr Perot has left himself with an exit should he choose not to run. He has always said it would require successful petitions to put his name on the ballot in every state before he would answer the call. This has been achieved in more than 20 states. The last filing deadlines in some states are not reached until September. It had been thought he might wait another month for his formal declaration, seeking to highlight the popular appeal of the registration drive. Policy positions were also expected to stay under wraps until then. Mr Bennett, an outspoken conservative who himself recently turned down an invitation to become co-chairman of the Bush campaign, said he hoped Mr Perot would stay in the race because his presence would most hurt the Democratic presidential candidate. However, the Democratic party believes that the core Perot support is heavily Republican. It is also concentrated in the south-western and western states which have voted republican in most recent presidential elections. The rise in Mr Clinton's popularity is seen in part as a reflection of public disaffection with the acerbic Bush-Perot rivalry. At present it suits the Democrats to have Mr Perot remain in the game, as a diminished but still consequential force.</p>

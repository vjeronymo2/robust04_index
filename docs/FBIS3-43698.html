According to a communique issued by the Defense Department,  government troops this morning recaptured Kobu, Kokoru, Jawe,  and Geleblama in the Kenema axes. Defense officials say the  capture of the towns has now reopened the road from Jolu to Zimi  to commuter traffic.    Also this morning government troops swept through Kongoma,  Bowo, Baoma, Jaluahun, and Kayima in the Kailahun District in  rapid succession. At Bowo, seven rebels were killed after a  two-hour battle, while two officials of the RUF [Revolutionary  United Front], Lieutenant Kosia, a renegade soldier, who was the  rebels' director of training, and Philip Kpulum were captured.    To celebrate the triumph of government troops, the  undersecretary of state for defense, Captain Komba Kambo, has  dispatched a message of congratulations on behalf of the  chairman of the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] and  head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser, to the commanders of  the 3d and 4th Battalions. The message commended the gallantry,  bravery, and endurance of the troops in prosecuting the rebel  war.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Call for cocoa price of Pounds 1,400 a tonne THE NEW international cocoa agreement now under negotiation in Geneva should aim to defend a price level of about Pounds 1,400 a tonne, or more than double the current price, Mr Alain Gauze, the Ivory Coast's minister for commodities and head of its delegation to the talks, hinted yesterday. He told a news conference that this 'would be a good price'. However, Mr Gauze did not disguise the fact that producing and consuming countries, now half-way through a three-week negotiating session, remained far apart on the objectives and financing of the new accord. The present International Cocoa Agreement expires in September 1993. Discussion has centred on the proposal made by consuming countries for the introduction of a withholding scheme to keep supplies back from a saturated world market, coupled with longer-term measures to curb production. Producers, led by Ivory Coast, which accounts for a third of world output, say they are willing to accept withholding, provided the plan reverses the downward trend in prices, stabilises the market and lifts the price 'to remunerative levels'. Mr Gauze would not say yesterday how much cocoa would need to be withheld from the market to defend a price of Pounds 1,400 a tonne. However, he estimated that 400,000-450,000 tonnes would have to be held back just to cover the costs of the scheme. He added that producers did not want any ceiling on withholdings and described the limit proposed by consumers of 300,000 tonnes as 'insignificant'. With the inclusion of the 240,000 tonne buffer stock now held by the International Cocoa Organisation, world cocoa stocks were around 1.2-1.3m tonnes, he said. Mr Gauze also criticised consumer proposals to finance the proposed withholding scheme principally from payment of arrears to the International Cocoa Organisation. The organisation is owed nearly Dollars 140m, much of it by the Ivory Coast and Brazil. Producers say the new scheme, like the old, should be financed by a levy on cocoa trade, including the exports of countries not members of the agreement, such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Mr Gauze said arrears should be repaid by a surcharge on the levy.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse mounts rescue of Ekobank CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, has rescued EKO Hypothekar-und Handelsbank (Ekobank), one of the country's largest regional banks. Ekobank was ordered closed by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission last Thursday but, following approval of the takeover by its shareholders on Monday, its branches opened as Credit Suisse branches on Tuesday. The takeover occurred in the context of a safety net established a year ago by the Swiss Bankers' Association following the collapse of another regional bank, Spar und Leihkasse Thun. The intention was to prevent another incident that would harm the international image of Swiss banks. Credit Suisse said: 'We are willing and eager to do our part to maintain the rep-utation of the Swiss financial centre.' Ekobank, based in Olten, had assets of SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) at the end of 1991, and employs about 100 people. It was owned, and its assets and liabilities were totally guaranteed, by the local community. As part of the takeover agreement, the potential liability of the community for future losses is limited to SFr40m. Credit Suisse said that provisions for Ekobank's bad loans were made as part of the agreement on the takeover conditions, and it anticipated that no further provisions would be necessary.</p>

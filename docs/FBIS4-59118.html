			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview With Brigadier General Isma'il Jabr, Palestinian </F> commander of the Jericho area police, by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab in  the Jordan valley on 10 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Jabr] The crossing of Palestinian police to  Jericho was to have taken place today. A previously scheduled  meeting was held today with the Israeli side with the objective  of setting the crossing into motion. However, the Israeli side  said it could not let the entry of the Palestinian police force  go ahead, citing political reasons. However, we managed to  smooth over some snags holding up the entry. For our part, we  informed them we were poised to crossing at the very moment we  were holding talks with them.    [Dhiyab] What were the most important points you agreed on  in your talks with the Israeli side?    [Jabr] The Israeli side said it would refer to its command  for clearance to start the crossing. As I have said, we told  them we were ready to move as of yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea has become a hub for laundering Chinese  farm and marine products for export to the South.    The laundering has become frequent recently and abuses the  non-tariff privileges for North Korean products in accordance  with the law concerning the promotion of inter-Korean exchanges  legislated in August, 1990.    The concept is similar to money laundering on black markets  to avoid tax payment or the tracing of money flow.    One of the laundering processes presumed to exist by the  customs authorities is for traders to receive certificates of  country of origin and quarantine inspections in conspiracy with  Pyongyang authorities bringing Chinese products into the North  before shipping them to the South.    Another type is for domestic importers to conspire with  their  counterparts in third nations, including Japan and Hong Kong, to  import Chinese products disguising them as North Korean produce.    The customs authorities have reached their conclusions about  the laundering process based on several cases of detection of  disguised imports. But they have not been able to obtain  clear-cut evidence as the laundering is taking place in China  and North Korea and they cannot understand will their trading  and customs practices, a customs official said. [sentence as  received]    Inchon Customs Office detected four false claims since 1991  till last February but arrested only two importers involved in  the laundering. The office has faced difficulty in proceeding  to the trial because of the lack of evidence and appeals by  defendants to higher courts, buying attorneys, the official said.    The office recently launched investigations of alleged  imports of Chinese royal jelly upon a tip from the Korea  Beekeepers Association that 10 tons of North Korean royal jelly  customs-cleared in Inchon was Chinese product.    But the jelly contains the certificate oe North Korean  origin  confirmed by Pyongyang North Korean Taesong No. 8 Trade Co., the  official said, adding that there was no defect in the documents.  As a result, the office has failed to confirm it was from China.    The office also found that 554 tons of walnuts brought in by  an importer through the port of Inchon in January this year were  in fact Chinese product. The Chinese walnuts were found to  have been transported by rail from China to Nampo on the western  coast of North Korea, where they were transshipped to the South  with North Korean certificates of country of origin and  quarantine documents, he said.    He explained the rail luggage labels were still attached to  the farm produce verifying that the products were transported by  rail from China. "We were very lucky in being able to confirm  this," he said.    A walnut importer, who is also suspicious of rampant  laundering said that walnuts imported from North Korea were  double the volume produced in the north last year.    Major reasons of the laundering are that Chinese products  are  not as good as North Korea's and traders are able to make much  profit due to duty-free prices, the official said.    Another speculation is that importers of Chinese products  have a tacit understanding with the North Korean authorities on  the laundering in return for paying a portion of the value to  the North which is hungry for foreign currency.    Meanwhile, Yi Hwan-kyun, commissioner of the Korea Customs  Administration, ordered customs officials across the country to  thoroughly crack down on disguised imports of Chinese farm and  marine products under North Korean certificates of origin last  week.</p>

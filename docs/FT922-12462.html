			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Peugeot cuts dividend as profits tumble PSA PEUGEOT Citroen, the French car company, fell prey to the downturn in demand that depressed the international motor industry last year and saw its net profits fall by 40 per cent from FFr9.26bn in 1990 to FFr5.53bn (Dollars 983m) in 1991. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, said he expected an improvement in market conditions this year and sales growth of 7 per cent to 8 per cent. However, the board has decided to cut the dividend from FFr19.5 to FFr13 a share. The group, hit last year by sluggish sales and rising research costs, is the latest in a series of international car companies to have reported depressed results for 1991. The French group maintained that although profits had fallen in 1991, its net margins - at 3.5 per cent - were still the highest of all the major motor groups, ahead of Toyota with 2.9 per cent and BMW with 2.6 per cent. The group's sales were virtually static last year at FFr160.17bn, compared with FFr159.98bn in 1990. But costs of launching two new cars - the Citroen ZX and Peugeot 106 - during the year, combined with higher research costs, lowered operating profits to FFr10.1bn from FFr15.7bn. The overall level of investment rose by 2.5 per cent to FFr15.52bn. Pre-tax profits fell by 39.8 per cent from FFr14.08bn to FFr8.49bn while the group's net debt rose from FFr8.27bn to FFr9.39bn by the year-end. Earnings per share slipped from FFr185 to FFr111 in 1991. The group took steps to cut costs and to reduce stocks last year. Mr Calvet said it had reduced car stocks by 10,000 units by bringing 'production better into line with sales'. The group produced 2.05m cars in Europe last year, against 2.22m in 1990, and sold 2.06m cars, compared with 2.19m. The group, he said, planned to cut costs further this year. Mr Calvet expected an improvement in sales this year, although first-quarter business had been comparatively quiet. He added that Peugeot Citroen was keen to increase collaborative ventures with other motor manufacturers.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEISMAN WINNER SANDERS WILL TURN PRO;  </P> <P> JUNIOR AT OKLAHOMA STATE READY TO TEST NFL RESTRICTIONS  </P> <P> Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders will turn pro, testing the NFL's  restrictions against drafting anyone not yet a senior, Oklahoma State Athletic  Director Myron Roderick said today.  </P> <P> "He is going to go pro," said Roderick, who added that the school had notified  the NCAA and was in the process of declaring him ineligible to play next  season.  </P> <P> Earlier, a pro football source told the Associated Press that Sanders will be  represented by David Ware, an Atlanta-based agent, to negotiate his contract.  However, it was not clear whether he had formally signed with Ware.  </P> <P> Neither Sanders nor his parents were available for comment. Ware was also  unavailable.  </P> <P> Sanders, a running back, will announce his decision at a news conference in  Denver on Saturday run by All Pro Sports and Entertainment.  </P> <P> In January, the NCAA placed Oklahoma State on four years probation, barring the  Cowboys from bowl games for the next three years and live television for the  next two.  </P> <P> Sanders is a true junior -- he has been at Oklahoma State for just three years  -- and would be the first to attempt to enter the NFL through either the  regular or supplemental draft.  </P> <P> If he entered the regular draft, he might be picked as high as third -- the  Detroit Lions, who pick in that spot, have indicated that they might choose  him.  </P> <P> In the past, the NFL has permitted underclassmen to enter the draft rather than  risk a lawsuit that might eliminate all restrictions. However, they spent four  years in school, like Craig Heyward of Pitt, who had a year of eligibility  remaining when he was taken by the New Orleans Saints in the first round last  season.  </P> <P> However, there is some question about whether Sanders would be granted  eligibility. Some league officials have suggested that the league might take a  stand in the Sanders case, hoping that it would be upheld by the courts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sanders will be ineligible to play college football, even if he is  barred from the NFL.  </P> <P> "We'll notify the NCAA of that intention as far as ruling him ineligible for  1989," Roderick said. "This is in the process of being done right now.  </P></p>

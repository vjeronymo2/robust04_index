			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Zeghloul: "Sources of Terrorist Financing"] </F>   [Text] After the arrest in Lille of two FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front] militants on charges of drug trafficking and  possession of weapons, ammunition, and important Algerian  administrative documents, the French press is raising disturbing  questions about the activities of the fundamentalist movement in  France.    The traffic in counterfeit Lacoste shirts that made so many  headlines turns out to have been just a minor sideline. The  mainspring of the fundamentalist movement in France, the  dissolved FIS, is diversifying sources of financing for its  armed struggle in Algeria. After relying first on aid from  countries committed to exporting their ideology, then on  begging, gifts, hold-ups, and rackets, it is now resorting to  drug trafficking to finance its jihad against society and  Algeria's republican state. The former party of Abassi Madani  has built up a network of drug dealers. One such ring was just  recently dismantled in Lille (France), in an investigation of  heroin trafficking in the prostitute demimonde of the town,  which is a veritable crossroads because of its proximity to  Belgium and the Netherlands.    These two countries are known for their permissiveness on  drugs. According to investigators with the French Judicial  Police [PJ], "some of those arrested averred to the examining  magistrate in Lille that one Hassan Tobal, a drug trafficker for  the dissolved FIS and confederate of two militants arrested on  21 March for `conspiracy in a terrorist plot,'" turned over a  portion of drug proceeds to members of the Islamist movement.    The profits from this network alone over the two years or  more it operated were in excess of 9 million francs [Fr]. In  addition, there were "commissions" extracted from independent  dealers.    In September 1993, about 10 ex-FIS militants were arrested  in  Rotterdam for drug trafficking. Among them were the imam of a  mosque in the Lille suburbs, the head of an antidrug  organization in Roubaix, and several individuals who hunt down  dealers (sic). Readers are reminded of the much-publicized  French Interior Ministry report to the Elysee, which was  followed by the expulsion from France of Kamreddine Kharbane,  ex-FIS representative in France, and Boudjemaa Bounoua, a Saudi  Arabia-based recruiter of Algerian volunteers for Afghanistan.    The ministry's explosive report noted that a re-Islamization  of the "beurs" [second-generation Arab immigrants in France] in  the same forms as those already adopted by apparently isolated  activists and certain voluntary associations acting under  humanitarian cover could lead to "a drift toward terrorism of  certain small groups within that movement (Editor's Note: the  fundamentalist movement)." Events have proved these fears  well-founded.    Numerous charitable associations ostensibly "working"  against  drug addiction and crime or to improve recreational  opportunities in the suburbs, are in fact working to infiltrate  and organize young Muslim immigrants.    In that context, the violent "hunt" for dealers led by the  Islamists, especially Kraouche's FAF [Algerian Fraternity in  France], as a "justifying cause," was undertaken in reality not  to suppress them but to supplant them in this lucrative traffic.    According to the French weekly VSD, drug trafficking is one  of the principal sources of financing for the dissolved FIS,  which, in addition to its French networks, reportedly also  relies on a Pakistani network to transport narcotics from Iran  and Afghanistan to Europe.    In its July 1993 issue, LA DEPECHE INTERNATIONALE DES  DROGUES  classified Algeria as a producer country or transit point for  international drug trafficking.    The Geopolitical Drug Observatory (OGD) noted, after an  investigation of the Staoueli poppy fields (summer 1992), that  "Algerian PJ do not believe, however,that the fundamentalists  are setting up narcotics trafficking rings, at least not on  Algerian territory." The "most reasonable hypothesis," according  to the PJ, was that some Afghans "are seeking to satisfy a taste  for artificial paradises, which they acquired during their  sojourn in Asia." Various indicators seem to discredit that  hypothesis--for example, the fact that the Uzis and Scorpios  found in the terrorists' lairs are the weapons of choice for  international drug rings with ties to arms traffickers.    Is such a hypothesis plausible, when we know that all over  the world armed insurrectionary movements (Peru, Kashmir,  Punjab, Pakistan, Casamance, etc.) are financed in part by drug  trafficking? And that these same movements, especially since the  end of the Cold War, are increasingly acquiring a direct or  indirect strangelhold on these phenomenal sources of income?    Can Algeria's fundamentalist movement be expected to turn  its  back on this manna when the borders, especially with Morocco,  leak like a sieve? Even though they have never ceased clamoring  for the establishment of an Islamic state, no matter what the  cost?  <H5>  Official Assassinated </H5>   Attendance was sparse yesterday at burial services for Mr.  Belaid Meziane, the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers]  national secretary for union training programs who was  assassinated on Thursday. The several dozen people who  accompanied to his final resting place this victim of cowardly  assassins carried themselves with solemnity and dignity, tinged  with sadness and consternation.    A communication slip-up was apparently responsible for the  small turnout by militants and workers affiliated with the labor  central.    On Thursday at 1430, Belaid Meziane left the home of his  sister in the Diar El Djemaa development in Bachdjarah commune.  His young nephew accompanied him in his vehicle. Several meters  down the road, Meziane slowed down to avoid a crevice.    Two youths waiting at that very spot--obviously familiar  with  his itinerary for the day--stepped in front of the vehicle to  block his path, fired a first bullet that hit him in the throat,  then a second and fatal bullet that hit him in the neck. Taken  immediately to Belfort hospital, Belaid Meziane, age 51,  succumbed to his wounds.  <H5>  Communique </H5>   The Ettahadi-Tafat movement has issued a communique  condemning this new assassination:    "This odious assassination follows attacks against Abdelhak  Benhamouda, secretary of the UGTA, and shows that the  fundamentalists are committed to destabilizing the labor central  and preventing it from taking antifundamentalist positions that  correspond to the basic interests of the workers and the country  as a whole."</p>

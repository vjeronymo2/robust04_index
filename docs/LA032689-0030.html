			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG SCREEN VS. TUBE  </P> <P> I have just finished seeing the five movies nominated for best picture in the  Oscar race:  </P> <P>  -- "Working Girl," a piece of fluff with uninspired direction;  </P> <P>  -- "Dangerous Liaisons," about people I care nothing about;  </P> <P>  -- One truly good movie, "Mississippi Burning," which features a performance  by a national treasure, Gene Hackman;  </P> <P>  -- "Accidental Tourist," a lovely "little" picture that rates a 7;  </P> <P>  -- "Rain Man" . . . Dustin Hoffman was good but I never forgot he was Dustin  Hoffman.  </P> <P> Oh well, I shouldn't be too crabby: I've just seen, for the third time, my  videotape of a great movie, better than anything in 1988. And the TV miniseries  "Lonesome Dove" didn't cost me a nickel.  </P> <P> CELIA LEE MERRITT  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / BAA opens Terminal 5 battle Failure to develop Heathrow would drive business overseas and undermine the UK aviation industry, BAA, the airports operator, said yesterday. BAA unveiled its long-awaited economic and environmental case for a fifth terminal at London's main international airport in the opening shot in what is likely to be a fiercely fought planning battle. A public inquiry is expected to start in May next year. BAA's case is supported by the Board of Airline Representatives, which speaks for nearly all domestic and foreign airlines using UK airports, but the development of Terminal 5 is opposed by local authority and environmental groups. The central premise of BAA's case is that existing capacity in the south-east will be incapable of meeting forecast passenger demand by 2002. Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, said: 'Without a significant increase in capacity where it is most needed we will fail to meet demand. For the sake of the UK economy and the UK aviation industry we must provide more capacity in the south-east.' BAA's statement of case says Heathrow remains 'the first choice of airlines and passengers'. It has unrivalled international connections and the trend is towards greater centralisation based on the big hub airports. The statement recognises that Gatwick and Stansted  - the two other main airports in the south-east  - are growing to meet increased passenger demand. But it says that only expansion at Heathrow will prevent additional business going to rival European airports. BAA said Terminal 5 would allow Heathrow's existing runways to handle 30m more passengers a year, and would be a suitable alternative to the building of an additional runway being at the airport until about 2015. The airports operator, with British Airways, has been anxious to avoid the row over the proposed new runway at Heathrow undermining the planned development of Terminal 5, and hopes a decision on the additional runway will be deferred. BAA says development of the proposed terminal on an existing sewage sludge site will displace only 15 houses. Although two rivers will have to be re-routed the 'flow and quality of ground water would be maintained, and air quality would remain within accepted limits'. Yesterday Mr Des Wilson, BAA's public affairs director, released the results of an opinion poll suggesting that local residents were less opposed to the runway than had previously been thought. The borough of Hounslow, which includes Heathrow, has conducted its own poll showing more than half of local people are against an additional terminal. The council said: 'Locals fear BAA's plan will mean more concrete and less green space.' Mr Dermot Cox, a committee member of the Heathrow Association for the Control of Airport Noise, said BAA's proposals would mean a 'massive increase in flights, congestion and pollution, while safety standards will be under immense pressure'. Mr Cox, a market researcher, challenged the validity of BAA's poll. He said: 'There are questions as to how it was conducted and whether it was an appropriate method to resolve quite complex issues.' Mr Wilson said anti-Heathrow groups 'receive more publicity than their standing in the community warrants'. The Department of the Environment said 95 per cent of the letters it had received about the development of the terminal were hostile to it.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure falls 25% to Pounds 1.2m and seeks Pounds 13m ALLIED LEISURE, the nightclub and ten-pin bowling company, yesterday announced a 25 per cent fall in interim profits together with a Pounds 12.6m rights issue to finance development of part of a leisure complex on the site of the old Crystal Palace in south London. The company is offering 7 new shares for every 10 held at a price of 48p - 10p below Wednesday's closing level. They closed yesterday at 53p. Pre-tax profits for the 25 weeks ended January 3 fell to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 1.65m) on sales up 8 per cent at Pounds 11.5m. Earnings per share declined to 2.92p (3.69p) and the interim dividend is cut from 1.5p to 1p. Mr Richard Carr, chairman, warned at the AGM that the dividend was to be more conservatively covered by earnings but that the company would maintain the policy of paying approximately a third of the full year dividend at the interim stage. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Williams de Broe but only after Allied Leisure and Smith New Court, its usual merchant bank, parted company. Smith and Allied Leisure are understood to have had different ideas about the timing of the rights issue. The company is expecting to spend about Pounds 10m on a high capacity night club and a megabowl. It will become what Mr Carr calls the flagship of the group. Initially the rights issue will reduce gearing from about 55 per cent to 15 per cent at the year-end but the development will also depress earnings per share until the complex is completed in 1995. Mr Carr said he was comfortable with City forecasts that Allied Leisure would make pre-tax profits for the year of Pounds 2.6m.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Reform passes last hurdle in Japanese Diet: End of multi-seat constituencies seen as a challenge to LDP Japan opened a new book in political history yesterday when the upper house of the Diet (parliament) gave definitive approval for a reformed election system, to come into force on December 25. This finalises a comprehensive new set of political rules, under which politicians will have to compete harder for parliamentary seats than before, a threat to the conservative old guard of the Liberal Democratic party which has run Japan for most of the past four decades. It removes an obstacle to an early general election, at a time when Japan's fragmented opposition is weeks away from forming a single new party, to combat a potentially unstable government coalition of conservatives and socialists. Parliament yesterday adopted a bill to redraw electoral boundaries for the new electoral system, a mixture of first-past-the-post single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. It replaces a unique multi-seat constituency system, in place since 1925, which had made it possible for many politicians to get a seat with as little as 10 per cent of the vote. Yesterday's completion of political reform is the starting signal for a power struggle within the main parties. They must now allocate candidates to the 500 seats of the new system, 11 fewer than than now. Because of the boundary changes, the three coalition parties have been left, awkwardly, with competing candidates in 110 districts, while the opposition faces the same problem in 40 constituencies, according to a poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. One example is Gunma, a rural area north of Tokyo, where former LDP Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and the son of a former LDP leader, Mr Yasuo Fukuda, have ended up in the same single-seat district. One of them, clearly, has to offer to compete in a different constituency. That is a difficult decision, given that close ties, patiently nurtured over many years, are the traditional method of getting a parliamentary seat. Yesterday's parliamentary decision concludes a five-year debate on political reform, triggered by the resignation in 1989 of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, to take responsibility for the exchange of shares for political favours. This and other cases had provoked public distaste of the ruling class. In an attempt to rebuild credibility, the LDP then proposed the first of a series of draft reform plans. It has taken five governments and the LDP's first period of opposition in 38 years to get the new rules on the statute book.</p>

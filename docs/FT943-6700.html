			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU tape levy too burdensome Sir, Emma Tucker ('Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan', August 18) was fairer than Mr Bickerton (Letters, August 24) suggests. But she quoted an interesting comment from the Commission to the effect 'we shall try to (harmonise the levy) at a level that is not too exaggerated'. This is fine, but not matched by reality: the Commission is thinking of a 26.3 per cent rate on the trade value of audio tapes and 45.8 per cent on video tapes. These rates, which average out at more than 39 per cent for audio and video tapes together, contrast with 3 per cent in the US and Japan. The EU wants to impose more than 10 times this rate. The EU is sometimes criticised for shooting itself in the foot by placing hefty burdens on its own industries. This would be a classic example. John Buchan, European Tape Industry Council, B-1040 Brussels</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Make it easy on yourself - Cookery Does anyone manage to avoid last minute Christmas shopping? Often, I find, there are presents as well as foods to buy on Christmas Eve. There are parcels to wrap, maybe cards to write, the tree to decorate, stockings to fill, and lots of culinary preps to be done for the morrow. It can easily become my least favourite day of the year. If the cook is to remain sane Christmas Eve menus must be kept as easy as possible. Yet such is the pace of activities that our need for edible fuel is considerable. Lunch and tea tend to be pit-stop affairs with people coming and going at different times so self-service is probably best. The obvious choice for lunch, and hard to beat, is lashings of good hot soup, made at an earlier date and squirrelled away in the freezer. Good breads and a first crack into the Christmas stilton will complete the meal with walnuts and jugs of crisp celery, and, finally, maybe a bowl of clementines. By teatime various members of the family, usually scattered countrywide, begin to gather under one roof. So tea should be a proper welcoming tea with crumpets and drop scones and fruit breads that everyone can toast for themselves in front of the fire. Dinner will probably be late. The menu should signal the beginning of the festivities. Yet it is best to avoid very luxurious foods or too much of a blow-out. Enough of that tomorrow. Besides you may want to stay awake for the midnight service. A modest yet appetising menu might start with potted shrimps, be followed by a dish of pork then one of rice, both of these last two taking their cue from Scandinavian Christmas customs. CHRISTMAS EVE PORK (serves 5-6) Pork (and goose) are the meats with which Christmas is celebrated in Scandinavia. This fragrant dish of pork is one of the easiest I know. The raw ingredients are simply packed into a pot and slipped into the oven. No need to preheat the oven. In fact, if you plan to be out all day, you can set the automatic oven timer so the meal will cook itself in your absence and your homecoming will be greeted by a comforting whiff wafting from the kitchen. Serve the pork with lots of mashed potatoes to soak up the flavoursome gravy, and a clean green salad of bitter leaves on the side. 2 lb boneless belly of pork rashers; 1 dozen prunes; 1 smallish onion; 2 fat garlic cloves; plenty of thyme, preferably fresh lemon thyme; 3-4 tablespoons each of chopped coriander and flat leaf parsley; a small corner of chicken stock cube; 2 or 3 butter papers; 1 tablespoon tarragon or white wine vinegar plus enough unsweetened white grape juice to make  1/2 pt liquid in total. Lightly butter a large shallow dish that will take the pork in a single layer. A Le Creuset buffet casserole is ideal. Cut each rasher of pork in half. Leave the rinds on. They will enrich the texture of the gravy deliciously, they will be meltingly tender by the end of cooking and are good to eat. Lay the pork jigsaw fashion in the dish, squeezing the prunes into the gaps. Scatter the thyme leaves and the finely chopped garlic over the meat. Season well with salt and pepper. Add the crumbled stock cube and veil the whole lot with the onion, sliced as paper thin as you can. Pour on the liquids, which should come almost level with the top of the meat. Lay the butter papers directly on top. Cover with a well fitting lid or double thickness of tightly crimped foil. Place the dish in a cold oven, turn it on to 300`F (150`C) gas mark 3 or just under and cook for 3 1/2 -4 hours. A little longer will do no harm providing the temperature is low and the dish is well sealed. When it is ready the meat should be so tender that even the toothless would rejoice in eating it. CARDAMOM CREAM RICE PUDDING (serves 6) Rice porridge and rice puddings of various sorts, some hot, some cold, are favourites at Christmas throughout Scandinavia. Tradition calls for a whole shelled but unblanched almond to be buried in the pudding to bring special good luck to whoever finds it. My version is cold and creamy and I have scented it with lemon and cardamom. Most shop-bought fruit jellies are too sweet and too stiff for my taste. Home-made redcurrant is what I use here. Cranberry, sour cherry, rowanberry or spiced crab apple jelly should also be good. How much you will need depends on the surface area of the glasses in which the pudding is served. 2 oz pudding rice; 1 pt milk; the seeds from 6-8 cardamom pods crushed to a powder; the finely grated zest of 1 large lemon; 1 tablespoon sugar;  1/2 pt double cream; 2-3 tablespoons extra milk or yoghurt (optional); 1 shelled but unblanched almond; a jar of tart fruit jelly. Scald the milk with the cardamom in a heavy based saucepan. Trickle the rice into the milk and cook fast, stirring continuously, for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every now and then, until the grain is soft and swollen and has absorbed most of the milk. Stir in the citrus zest and sugar, and stand the rice pan in a bowl of cold water to speed cooling. When the rice is cold, spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the surplus milk from it onto the cream. Or if the grain has absorbed all its cooking liquor, stir a splash of extra milk or a little yoghurt into the cream. Whip the cream softly and fold the rice into it. Spoon the soft and creamy amalgam into individual glasses, slipping the almond into one of them in obeisance to Scandinavian Christmas custom. Barely melt some jelly and spoon a little of it gently over the top of the rice to cloak it with scarlet - or to cloak it with gold in the case of spiced crab apple jelly. Chill until shortly before serving.</p>

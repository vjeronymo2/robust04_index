			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, March 9 (KCNA) -- The fifth working-level  contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the  North and the South was held behind closed doors at the Thongil  House in the northern portion of Panmunjom today.    At the end of the contact the head of the North side  delegation was interviewed by home and foreign reporters on the  spot.    According to his briefing, the North side once again urged  the South side to manifest its position on the four-point demand  including the question of discontinuing large-scale nuclear war  exercises that stands in the way of exchange of special envoys,  a demand raised by it at the fourth contact.    Then it put forward a new amendment to "agreement on the  exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South"  taking the South side's view into full consideration, out of a  desire to realize the exchange of special envoys at an early  date. The proposal involves detailed matters such as the rank  of the special envoys of both side and their suite, the tasks of  special envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their  exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their  travels and security arrangements, news coverage and (?offer) of  conveniences to reporters.    The South side created difficulties, grumbling about what it  called "creation of obstacle" or "unnecessary things" instead of  expressing its clear attitude toward the principled demand  raised by our side and entering the discussion of working  matters.    Our side proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of  both sides from a sincere stand to tide over the obtaining  difficulties on all accounts and concluding the working-level  contact.    There was a contact between the heads of both sides.    It was agreed to have the sixth contact between working  delegates in the South portion of Panmunjom on March 12.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- According to some  Bratislava officials, Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD)  Chairman Milos Zeman has informed leaders of the Slovak Social  Democrats and Democratic Left Party (SDL) of his intention to  make a new endeavor to create the Czechoslovak union, Robert  Casensky and Michal Musil from Bratislava say in the  right-oriented daily TELEGRAF today.    According to Zeman's plan, a referendum should decide on the  issue. Although the information has been confirmed by Frantisek  Miklosko, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)  Deputies' Group, and indirectly by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss,  Zeman asserts that he did not make such a statement.    "Should such an offer be made I will comment on it," Zeman  said. However, if some Slovak political parties consider such a  proposal then it is "their own business" and the CSSD would not  interfere in it, Zeman said.    Miklosko asserts, however, that Zeman has actually come up  with such an initiative at talks with representatives of the  Slovak Social Democratic Party (SSDS) and part of the SDL.  Miklosko said that according to information he possessed, the  CSSD is planning to include the creation of the union in its  election program. Slovak political parties had not, however,  shown much interest in Zeman's initiative. "I personally believe  that the Slovak left will not be strong enough to carry out the  idea. Mr. Zeman has much bigger aspirations in this respect,"  Miklosko said.    Weiss did not refute Miklosko's information. Asked directly  what his party's stand has on the proposal by the Czech Social  Democrats, Weiss said that the SDL saw the division of  Czechoslovakia as a fait accompli. "The independence of both the  Czech and Slovak Republics is a reality and there is no point in  changing it," Weiss said, adding that there were neither  internal political nor external political conditions for the  renewal of something which was once here.</p>

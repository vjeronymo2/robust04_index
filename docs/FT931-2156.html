			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Labour calls for probe at Kellogg MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday called on the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the refusal of Kellogg, the cereals maker, to supply two discount supermarket chains. In a letter to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, Mr Griffiths took up the case of the refusal by Kellogg to continue to supply Shoprite and United Norwest Co-operatives. Mr Griffiths said yesterday: 'I believe that large supermarkets are behind this and action must be taken to bring prices down for consumers. 'It is my view that there has been no thorough investigation which has got to grips with the massive power over suppliers and wholesalers of the big supermarkets.' His letter spells out the basis of the case which Shoprite put to the OFT a few weeks ago. It says that between November 1990 and February this year Kellogg supplied Shoprite with a range of items and that, with Kellogg's knowledge, Shoprite sold cornflakes below cost price. In January this year, however, Kellogg wrote to all its customers, saying that it would not supply a brand to a retailer selling that brand below or at cost price. In 1990, when asked by Aldi, the German food discounter, to investigate allegations of manufacturers refusing to supply discounters, the OFT said it would monitor the situation.</p>

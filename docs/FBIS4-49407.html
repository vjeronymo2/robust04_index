			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yanbin (3769 6066 1755)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- Agriculture Minister Liu  Jiang said: The current overall situation in agriculture and the  rural economy is good. It should be soberly noted, however,  that there are problems in further development. The stress of  our future rural work is to be put on deepening rural reform,  effectively developing the rural economy, raising peasants'  incomes, and maintaining social stability.    Liu Jiang today made a report on the current situation in  agriculture and the rural economy at a reporting meeting  sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central  Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the CPC Central  Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the State  Council, the General Political Department of the People's  Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. He  said: With the implementation of policy measures taken by the  party Central Committee and the State Council to support  agricultural production and protect peasants' interests in the  past year, the rural economy maintained a good momentum of  development; grain output has topped 450 billion jin, an  all-time high; the output of most cash crops, except cotton and  oil-bearing crops, went up; products related to the "vegetable  basket" project continue to increase; village and town  enterprises developed rapidly, with better economic performance;  peasants's incomes continue to rise, and their burdens were  reduced to some extent; and rural reform continued to deepen,  and market forces played an increasingly important role in the  rural economy.    On problems in the development of agriculture and the rural  economy, Liu Jiang considered the following to be major  problems: 1) The effective supply of farm products is not stable  enough. With scarcity of land and a large population, our  country's increased agricultural production is offset by an  increase in the population. The average per capita consumption  of farm products is low, and the distribution of farm products  in areas and the structure of their varieties are uneven. Prices  sometimes fluctuate rather sharply. 2) The increase of  peasants'incomes has been slow in the past few years, which has  affected their input into agricultural production and the  expansion of rural markets. 3) The pressure of rural surplus  manpower for employment has increased. He said: Conscientious  efforts should be made to solve institutional or deep-seated  problems in the development of the rural economy, such as  insufficient investment, the increasing disparity in prices  between industrial goods and agricultural produce, backward  scientific and technological education, and unsound rural  management and operation systems.    Liu Jiang stressed: The major tasks in future rural work are  to deepen rural reform, effectively develop the rural economy,  raise peasants' incomes, and maintain social stability. He  said: To effectively develop the economy, it is necessary, first  of all, to do a good job in cotton production, make the  "vegetable basket" project a success, stabilize grain  production, and ensure the effective supply of farm products.  Peasants' incomes are one of the crucial issues in rural work  in the 1990's. Without a steady increase in peasants' incomes,  their input into agriculture cannot possibly increase, nor can  rural markets expand. The basic way to raise peasants' incomes  is to deepen reform, accelerate the development of the rural  economy, and increase their incomes with increased production.  He emphasized: For rural areas, it is essential to lighten  peasants' burdens, help them free themselves from poverty,  vigorously rectify various unhealthy trends about which people  have a lot of complaints, strengthen the building of basic-level  rural organizations, and gradually narrow the gap between the  eastern and western regions of the country in order to maintain  social stability.    Liu Jiang: We should step up our work in five aspects to  develop agriculture and the rural economy: 1) We should further  improve our policies to protect and support agriculture. 2)  Keeping in mind the goal of establishing a socialist market  economic structure, we should further deepen rural reform,  particularly improve the grain purchasing and selling policies  and the basic rural management system, guide the sound  development of the cooperative share holding system, and deepen  the reform of the rural banking system. 3) We should promote  scientific and technological progress in rural areas and develop  agriculture through the development of science, technology, and  education. 4) We should clearly define our responsibilities and  vigorously implement policies. 5) The whole party should pay  close attention to agriculture, and society as a whole should  concern itself with it.</p>

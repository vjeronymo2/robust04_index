			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome bids to make clarity a virtue - Andrew Jack explains why the company's report has had a facelift WHEN shareholders receive the latest annual report from Wellcome later this month, they should find it easier to read, thanks to an unusual collaboration between the pharmaceutical company and three academics. A number of significant changes to the report's writing, format and design have been made as a result of research into the widely varying patterns of how different readers use - and understand - the document. Professor Roger Hussey, David Bence and Catherine Wilkie of the University of the West of England in Bristol were commissioned by Wellcome to analyse the responses of 1,124 private shareholders, analysts and institutional investors to its 1991 report. Changes that have emerged and will be reflected in the 1992 edition include: an alternative presentation of cash flow in addition to the format required by accounting standards, to show it in the form used in internal management reports; a detailed, clearly written joint statement from the chairman and chief executive, describing the company's performance in a format similar to the management discussion required in US accounts; more emphasis on clear graphics, diagrams and other illustrations to highlight financial performance. Mr John Precious, finance director, says: 'We think these accounts are fairly radically different and give more information to the average and the new reader. We believe the accounts are a serious means of communicating with our shareholders.' He stresses that work on improving the presentation, content and style of the Wellcome accounts has been underway for the past several years. At the heart of the academics' findings lies a paradox. Private shareholders seem reluctant to read - or have difficulty understanding  - the more technical parts of accounts. Yet analysts, who ought to be better versed to take on that task, do not give the reports much attention. Analysts ranked accounts only the fifth most important source of information on a company, after preliminary and interim statements, company presentations and personal interviews. Private shareholders, by contrast, ranked the accounts second, after press articles, and just above information gleaned from financial advisers, radio and television programmes. Only 10 per cent said they read all the company's report thoroughly, although 40 per cent read parts thoroughly. But those portions read most conscientiously were the chairman's statement and the financial highlights. Few either read or considered very important the notes to the accounts or the auditors' report. Only institutional investors - arguably with both the money and the long-term perspective to consider the information presented in detail - ranked the annual report most important, jointly with personal interviews. Their other primary sources were presentations, visits and preliminary statements. The institutions were also the only one of the three groups to consider the notes most important, followed by the balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash-flow statement and review of products sold. 'We are moving towards a two-tier system,' says Prof Hussey. 'The accounts are becoming a more complex document used mainly by institutions for reference purposes, and are over the heads of the great majority.' He says there is a tension between the 'public relations' text at the front of the report, and the financial statements controlled by the accountants at the rear. He stresses the need to make more connections between the two parts. All three groups said the main purpose of the company in issuing the annual report was to comply with legal requirements. They believed that providing information for investment decisions was less in Wellcome's mind than presenting a good image and giving an indication of the value of the company. They all agreed that the new cash-flow statement was one of the most difficult part of the accounts to understand - one reason Mr Precious has provided additional information this year.  -----------------------------------------------------------       PARTS OF ANNUAL REPORT PRIVATE SHAREHOLDERS                    READ THOROUGHLY  -----------------------------------------------------------                                                % of                                             respondents  ----------------------------------------------------------- Chairman's statement                           65.8 Financial highlights                           58.6 Group p&amp;l account                              54.2 Chief exec's review                            46.8 Five-year summary                              36.8 Directors' report                              36.1 Mission and operating philosophy               35.0 Group and parent company balance sheet         32.1 Board of directors                             30.8 Notes to financial statements                  26.3 Cash flow statement                            24.4 Auditors' report                               24.3 Other                                           4.9  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

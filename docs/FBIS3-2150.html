From  the fact that the conference insisted on a need to ensure social  stability while pursuing reform and economic development, this  is considered a measure to prevent media reports from causing  social unrest.    However, the decision to ban the use of the slogan comes as  a  surprise to large sectors because it was a slogan announced by  the supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, during his visit to south  China in February, 1992. This visit is known to have become the  starting point of the current high economic growth.    Besides the ban on use of the slogan, the source said the  conference released the policy on banning media reports which 1)  can incite public apprehensions about inflation; 2) play up  increasing debts of state-owned enterprises; and 3) point out  problems with economic development of coastal areas or criticize  growing gaps in regional economy and personal income.    Since late last year, media have reported much about the  possibility of large-scale economic reform being launched this  year, thus causing public apprehensions about inflation,  panicking people into hoarding foodstuffs and thus causing price  hikes. The source said these measures are a product from this  experience.    Premier Li Peng spoke on the current economic situation at  the conference, and said: "While paying attention to both  favorable and unfavorable conditions existing in our economy, we  should promote economic reform at an appropriate pace but in an  positive way." Furthermore, he indicated that the economic  growth for this year will be set at around 9 percent as was  decided at the State Council's Economic Work Conference held at  the end of 1993.    Since the nation achieved an economic growth of 13 percent  in  the past two consecutive years, however, there are strong  complaints among local CPC cadre members about this as in seen  in a remark by a Beijing cadre member who charged setting the  goal at 9 percent "is extremely conservative." Even Deng  Xiaoping is said to be unhappy about it.</p>

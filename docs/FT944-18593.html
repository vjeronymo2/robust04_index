			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Blair's 'crusade for change' undermined by tension over tax Tension over Labour's tax plans for the middle classes yesterday undermined Mr Tony Blair's efforts to secure a trouble-free conference debut as party leader. As party officials cleared the way for compromises on minimum wages, women's rights and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair sought to set the tone for the conference in a statement promising a 'crusade for change'. His comments came as Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, outlined a comprehensive series of measures being considered as part of Labour's industrial regeneration plan. He emphasised in an interview with the Financial Times that a Labour government would seek a partnership with business rather than seek to direct it and said the priority was to tackle short-termism and to promote greater investment in training. Mr Brown will also use the opening of today's debate on the economy to underline the party leadership's commitment to modernising the welfare state. He will signal Labour's plans to integrate the tax and benefit system for pensioners and to use the benefit system to remove work disincentives for the unemployed. Mr Brown played down remarks by Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, which appeared to signal support for higher taxes for the better off. He said Mr Prescott's view was in line with Mr Blair, who pledged in his statement that 'people who generate ideas, jobs and wealth have nothing to fear from a Labour government'. However, Mr Prescott said on independent television's Walden programme that Labour had given no promises to any groups of voters on taxation. Mr Blair's efforts to modernise the party were repeatedly attacked at pre-conference fringe meetings by leftwing activists accusing him of seeking to compete with the Conservatives in running a market economy. The leadership was more embarrassed by disclosures that delegates from many big unions will be told how to vote by union leaders, undermining the abolition of the union block vote at last year's conference. Mr Blair insisted that last year's conference decision to scrap block voting stood. He told Sky News: 'Last October, the block vote was finished, it died. People are entitled to vote at the conference as individual members, as individual delegates.' Senior party officials were confident that a threatened row over the party's commitment to a minimum wage had been averted by a compromise resolution referring the issue to a commission due to report next year. The resolution confirms Labour's commitment to a legally enforceable national minimum wage pegged to half the level of male median earnings, but meets Mr Blair's concern that the party should avoid specifying a figure. The ruling national executive committee announced a shift of emphasis on Northern Ireland towards neutrality between the nationalist and unionist traditions.

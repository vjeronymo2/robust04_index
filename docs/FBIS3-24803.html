According to the radio, a group of six rebels, who came to  trade fleece in a market, was surprised by a detachment of the  Republican Guard, which opened fire, killing four of them. The  national radio did not give any details about the fate of the  two remaining Chadian rebels.    This incident occurred while a Niger delegation led by  Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou was in Ndjamena from 27 to 28  January for a series of talks devoted to the problem of Chadian  refugees in Niger and, more generally, to security at the border  between the two countries. According to Oumarou, some 3,600  Chadians have taken refuge in Niger since the political changes  that have taken place in Chad over the past few years. The  Niger minister, quoted by the national radio, assured the  Ndjamena authorities that "Niger would not serve as a rear base  and would not tolerate the presence of armed soldiers on its  territory seeking to destabilize the current democratic process  in Chad."</p>

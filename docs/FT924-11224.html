			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES dealers were surprised yesterday by a substantial deal in Amstrad options which represented almost 10m shares. This activity ensured healthy turnover in an otherwise quiet day, writes Peter John. The two-for-one Amstrad deal consisted of a trader buying 3,200 June 25 calls at 5p a share and selling 6,400 June 30 calls at 2.5p. The investor will make money if the shares are at between 25p and 35p next June and the deal was interpreted as speculation on Mr Alan Sugar making a successful bid at 30p a share for the outstanding share capital of the electronics group. The other significant trade was a roll-over in Sainsbury calls from the near month to January representing just over 3,000 lots. As a result of these two deals, total turnover was well above break-even point at 36,865 lots. Meanwhile, the contract on the FT-SE 100 for December delivery darted around in early trading but settled back in the afternoon to trade within a narrow range and close 23 down at 2,698 with only 5,306 contracts dealt. December reached a high of 2,724 at the start of trading, forced up by growing hopes that interest rates will be 6 per cent by the end of the year. Then the contract fell sharply, pared by worries that in view of prevalent political and economic uncertainties, the stock market may be over-priced.</p>

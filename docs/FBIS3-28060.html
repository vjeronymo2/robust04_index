As a result of an almost fanatical  commitment to keeping secret the inner workings of their  organization, almost nothing is known by outsiders about the  leadership of one of the world's most resilient guerrilla  movements. But two of the KR's most powerful and prominent of  their small group of top leaders have been purged over policy  differences since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, the  POST has learned.    Ieng Sary -- long time member of the Party standing  committee, Foreign Minister during the KR rule, in charge of the  Party's economic portfolio, and liaison for all Chinese military  and financial aid until the Paris Agreements --has been stripped  of power in a bitter break within the organization. [passage  omitted]    Son Sen -- also a member of the Party standing committee,  the  Minister of Defence, and one of the two official KR members of  the Supreme National Council [SNC] set up by the Paris Peace  agreements to administer the country prior to election -- was  relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high level  dispute over whether the KR should pull out of the UN organized  peace plan. He supported entering into the phase of the peace  agreements that called for the four warring factions in June  1992 to demobilize their armies. [passage omitted]    The revelation of Son Sen's dismissal from his position as  KR  Minister of Defence is particularly important as it is the first  firm evidence of high level debate within the leadership over  whether to pull out of the UN sponsored peace process and  elections in May 1992. [passage omitted]    Purges of senior officials within the KR are of course part  of their legacy. Indeed, a majority of the top officials of the  KR who came to power in the party and state organs after their  197 victory were executed during their 3 and 1/2 year rule.  There is no indication that disagreements among leaders are  resolved by execution in recent years.    Son Sen was days away from being arrested and most certainly  executed in late 1978 during the waning days of the KR regime.  He was saved ironically, by the Vietnamese invasion in late  1978, according to recent analysis of confessions of other party  cadre at Tuol Sleng prison, Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder told  the POST.    A former deputy Prime Minister in charge of defence during  the KR years in power and an alternate on the Standing  Committee, Son Sen is a graduate of the Sorbonne and was a  director of one of Phnom Penh's most prestigious universities  before fleeing to the "maquis" in 1963. While defence minister  throughout the 1980's of the guerrilla army, he began to rise  further in influence in 1987 when the KR prepared him for future  political role as they prepared for a political solution to the  war. [passage omitted]    Son Sen argued, during April and May 1992, that the KR's  future also depended on remaining sincere in the eyes of the  world for desiring a peaceful, political solution to Cambodia's  conflict and participating in a democratically elected coalition  government. To pull out would undermine the groups already rock  bottom credibility both domestically and internationally which  the KR continue to see as vital to reestablishing their ability  to play a role in future Cambodian affairs.    This period also marked the dismantling of a carefully  developed group of tactical and strategic military alliances  with FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], the KPNLF [Khmer  People's National Liberation Front], China, the United States,  and other powers. The absence of this decade old alliance,  which provided political credibility to the KR cause, left the  group dangerously isolated and vulnerable. Some leaders saw a  pullout from the peace process as resulting in isolation they  believed would cause an unacceptable degree of political damage.    These arguments did not prevail during high level meetings  of  the leadership held near the Thai border in May 1992.    As a result of his purge, sources say Son Sen went through a  period of what appears to be reeducation from June to December  1992, when he is said to have agreed that he had been mistaken  in his initial views.    His change of heart came when Sihanouk himself in December  1992 began to publicly condemn the UN operation and indicate  that a provisional government should be formed under Sihanouk's  leadership and elections perhaps abandoned. Internally, the KR  interpreted this as Sihanouk entering into an alliance with them  to oppose the UN operation and elections.    Son Sen is expected to play a role in the future in KR  political activities, sources say, but his influence remains far  less than before and he no longer has a military role.    Ieng Sary's demise came in 1992 after years of friction  within the party. He was in charge of foreign relations during  the KR rule, and most of the intellectuals who came back to  Cambodia after the KR victory in 1975 were under his charge.  Hundreds perished, and others, distrusted by the Party, were  kept in reeducation camps or virtual prisoners doing menial work  in state ministries.    After the KR fled to the jungle in 1979, Ieng Sary caused a  major rift within the Party by acknowledging to a journalist the  existence of the Tuol Sleng torture center in which at least  16,000 people died -- mostly party cadres and their families.    He also appeared to criticize the leadership by saying he  was  out of the country when certain senior KR officials were  arrested and executed. This was seen as a breach of solidarity  within the KR who hold firmly to collective decision making that  strictly prohibits independent public statements by leaders on  political and policy issues. But Ieng Sary had the support of  the Chinese, who insisted that all covert Chinese assistance --  both military and financial -- be passed through him. As a  result he was in charge of the Finance portfolio and  disbursement of weapons, which gave him significant power. But  he is known to have had several disputes with Pol Pot in the  late 1980's, and angered many field commanders and intellectuals  for his autocratic style and abrasive personality. When the  signing of the Paris agreements ended all Chinese direct support  to the faction, Ieng Sary's influence diminished.    His headquarters, along the Phnom Malai escarpment on the  Thai border, was also the center for KR diplomatic operations  and housed the group's intellectuals and their families.  Intellectuals, many who hold him in contempt, moved their  headquarters and families to another KR base in 1993, further  isolating Ieng Sary.    While he still controls a small swath of territory in  western  Cambodia, he no longer controls significant troops or money, and  appears to have been removed from the standing committee. Some  sources say he retains an "observer status" on the standing  committee. KR sources say that he has permanently lost  influence within the decision making structure of the party and  army.    While Pol Pot is said to remain in full overall control of  the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and its political wing  -- the Party of Democratic Kampuchea -- through his position as  chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of  the Party, there has also emerged a group of younger military  commanders and intellectuals who have risen in influence and are  being groomed for power.    While the KR officially dissolved their communist party in  December 1981, and announced they supported a "liberal  parliamentary democracy," most analysts dismissed the claim.  They said it was designed to attract united front allies among  other Cambodian factions who also opposed the new Vietnamese  controlled government in Cambodia. It was also seen as an  attempt to draw western political support for a coalition  anti-Vietnamese resistance group that formed along the Thai  border to wage war against the Vietnamese and their installed  government.    Similarly dismissed were KR public announcements in the  mid-1980 that the three top ranking members of Party -- Pol Pot,  Nuon Chea, and Ta Mok -- also "retired." Evidence is strong  that most of the same "old guard" leadership that comprised the  last official standing committee before 1981 remain in control  of the organization today continuing to carry out essentially  the same functions they have since the late 1970's.    Pol Pot remains a highly effective and respected figure  among the top cadres, who view him as the one man who can bridge  differences among other leaders. He spends much of his time  developing political strategy. He rarely travels to bases and  is said to almost never meet cadre under the rank of division  commander. Described as a "genius" by his supporters, he is  said to be a remarkable orator and occasionally delivers  lectures. He still officially holds the title of director of  research at a KR military "institute." Many cadre worry that if  the 66 year old leader were to die there would be no one to  replace him and major infighting could break out within the  leadership.    Also remaining in the same position, is the little known  Nuon  Chea, who has been described as Pol Pot's "alter ego." He fled  to the jungle with Pol Pot in 1963, and has made one public  appearance since then -- in the late 1970's to a Danish  communist party. He is in charge of party organization, deputy  supreme commander of the armed forces, and number 2 on the  standing committee.    It is Ta Mok, the number three on the standing committee,  who  has seen a significant rise of influence since the Paris  agreements. He serves as chief of the general staff of the KR  army and military commander of the northern region. But when,  in 1992, Son Sen gave up control of 6 Divisions under his  control, they fell under the command of Ta Mok, who now controls  at least 12 Divisions and is responsible for KR cadre and troops  from the northwestern Thai border, throughout the north and the  entire eastern region abutting Vietnam. This gives him control  of perhaps 70 percent of the KR army and most of the country.    The one-legged commander is of peasant origin and controlled  the southwestern military region during the KR years. It was  troops under his command who carried out campaigns against  "internal enemies," attacks on Vietnam, and arrests of other KR  leaders before the Vietnamese invasion. As a result he has  earned the nickname "the butcher." But despite his fierce  reputation among foreigners and other Cambodians, Ta Mok  engenders tremendous loyalty among his forces. His troops are  said to [be] well paid, fed, and armed, and their morale remains  high and their commitment to the KR cause strong. But as would  be natural in any organization with aging leaders, a new,  younger group of political and military leaders are currently  rising in power within the organization. In 1987, according to  KR sources, Pol Pot issued a directive to groom this younger  generation of leaders.    On the military side, a group of about 7 commanders --  division level or higher -- now form a collective committee that  proposes military tactics and strategy which is submitted for  approval to the standing committee.    In their 40's and 50's, virtually all of this group fled to  the jungle with Pol Pot to join the underground revolution  between 1963 and 1967. Many were students or teachers in urban  areas when they joined the movement, but have spent virtually  their entire adult lives in the jungle.    They hold significant power because of the trust given to  them by the leadership, and, importantly, because they control  "concrete forces." It is these leaders who have long exerted  direct control over troops, administer civilians in their  "liberated zones", are trained in and conduct "political work"  among their rank and file and the peasantry, and disburse  funding and oversee economic activity in their zones of control.  Their practical experience gives them as much the role of  "governor" as military commander in the 20 percent of Cambodia  controlled by the KR.    Included in the group of 7 are important family ties as  well.  So Hong, the commander of Military Zone 1002, is a nephew of  Pol Pot and was a senior official in the KR Foreign Ministry  during their years in power. Mit Nikorn, who was elevated to  the position of commander in charge of all western military  forces in 1992 with at least 5 divisions under his command, is  the younger brother of Son Sen. And Ta Mok has at least one son  and one son-in-law who are powerful division level field  commanders.    Family ties play a vital role in Cambodian culture and,  consequently, in access to power in Cambodia politics, including  the KR. Son Sen's wife is in charge of propaganda for the  Party. Ieng Sary's wife, Ieng Thirit, was minister of social  affairs during the KR rule and continued to wield significant  influence until her decline accompanied her husband's in recent  months. She also suffers from ill health.    She, significantly, is also the sister of Khieu Ponnary, Pol  Pot's wife until the mid-1980's. Khieu Ponnary suffered a  mental breakdown in the late 1980's and was divorced from Pol  Pot. He has taken a new wife by which he has two young  children. It is generally agreed by observers that the severing  of direct family links between Pol Pot and Ieng Sary after the  divorce played an important role in the purging of Ieng Sary.    There are three primary power bases that now make up the KR.  Aside from the all powerful standing committee and the younger  collective of military commanders, there is a group of younger  political cadre who analyze, carry out, and formulate political  policy for the KR. Made up of about 15 highly educated  intellectuals who have been with the movement since the 1960s --  and a lesser amount [in] the early 1970's -- they have mostly  served in KR diplomatic posts and advisors to the top leaders  until the Paris agreements.    Many senior intellectuals have quietly left the movement in  the 1980's complaining that the organization remained hostile to  real change and they were only being used to put an "acceptable  face" to the KR.    In Nov. 1992, the KR announced the formation of the Great  National Union Party and listed 10 intellectuals as its founding  members. Headed by Khieu Samphan and Son Sen, all the men are  well known technocrats who have been with the organization since  before they came to power in 1975. Its members -- all with  advanced degrees from European universities -- include one  lawyer, three economists, one mathematician, four engineers, and  an educator.    In the announcement of the new party, there was no mention  of  the hard-line figures that are said to remain in real control of  the party. They announced that the founders of the new party  would play the leading role for them in any national  reconciliation government that emerged from the peace process.    While dismissed by most scholars and analysts as merely a  front group with no real decision making authority independent  from the old guard remaining in the jungle, they nevertheless  have seen an increase in power and influence as the KR  increasingly becomes a political movement.

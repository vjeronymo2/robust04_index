			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / MPs summon watchdog chiefs to further meeting The Commons committee examining financial regulation has summoned the chairman and chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private investors, for a further session of questioning. In a move that intensifies pressure on the regulator, which is already facing doubts about its future, the Treasury committee will take evidence at the end of this month from Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, and Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive. Mr John Watts, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the MPs wanted to discuss with the PIA some of the points that had been raised by other witnesses questioned since the authority first gave evidence early last month. At the initial session the authority faced scepticism from MPs over its plans for the admissions process and for its ability to monitor its members. Some committee members were dissatisfied with the authority's responses, but want to give it a chance to sound more convincing. In a Commons debate earlier this week some MPs also expressed doubts about Mr Palmer's credibility as chairman of the new body. He was previously chief executive of life company Legal &amp; General, which recently attracted a record fine for systemic non-compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>

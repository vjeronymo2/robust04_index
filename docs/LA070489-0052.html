			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SILICONE INJECTIONS INCREASE BREAST DISEASE RATE IN RATS  </P> <P> Question: I had a silicone implant operation to increase the size of my  breasts. Now I've heard that these implants have been found to cause cancer. Is  this true?  </P> <P> Answer: Silicone gel injected into the breast tissue of rats did result in an  increased rate of breast cancer, but what is true for animals does not  necessarily apply to humans. There is no evidence that these implants are a  cause of cancer in women.  </P> <P> Q: It's bad enough to have diabetes, but a nephew of mine has diabetes and a  heart condition. To top it off, although he'd like to keep physically active  because he knows it would be good for the diabetes, he's afraid of doing  anything too strenuous because of the heart condition. I assume that other  people must have had this problem, and I'd like to know if anyone has come up  with an answer to it.  </P> <P> A: Most people with heart conditions can engage in some form of exercise, but I  can't even begin to suggest what might be appropriate for your nephew. He  should check with his physician, who may be able to make specific  recommendations for an exercise program, or who may refer him to a specialized  center.  </P> <P> Q: Why should someone who appears to be in good health become constipated? If  constipation does become a problem, is there any away to treat it without  drugs?  </P> <P> A: Simple constipation -- that is, irregularity not due to some underlying  disorder -- usually results from one of three conditions: a lack of bulk or  liquid in the diet, insufficient exercise or failing to respond to body  signals.  </P> <P> The frequency with which constipation is being reported these days has been  attributed to changes in the diet -- away from high-fiber foods, such as  fruits, vegetables and whole-grain breads, and toward fats and refined sugars.  Irregular and inappropriate eating habits are important causes of constipation.  </P> <P> The hectic pace of modern life has also been implicated as a cause of  irregularity. When a person tends to delay using the toilet, body signals may  subside; if this pattern is repeated over a period of time, the result may be  chronic constipation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuwait, 27 June (KUNA) -- Michael Heseltine,  British president of the Board of Trade, said here today that he  did not discuss "any new trade deals" for British companies in  Kuwait as part of a privatization drive.    Heseltine told a news conference here today that his visit  was confined to strengthening bilateral ties between the two  countries and to present Britain's privatization experience and  its success so that Kuwait could benefit from it.    He expressed his hope that British companies would be given  more investment opportunities in Kuwait, stressing that the  final decision belonged to the Kuwaiti Government. [passage  omitted]</p>

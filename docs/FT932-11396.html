			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Danes try to allay fears over Maastricht treaty THE DANISH government and the European Commission yesterday moved quickly to dampen controversy caused by a leaked note by a senior EC lawyer saying Denmark's exemptions from the Maastricht treaty are probably unenforceable. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister, insisted that the treaty opt-outs are binding in international law. A senior EC official declared that the leaked private opinion by Mr Donald Allen, a British lawyer at the European Commission, was a 'non-story'. Weekend publication of the note just two weeks before the second Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 is an embarrassment for the Yes campaigners. Part of their appeal rests on their contention that Denmark won new, legally binding treaty exemptions on monetary union, defence policy and immigration at the EC summit in Edinburgh last December. In practice, the issue is less clear-cut. Danish opt-outs are more a clever piece of Brussels drafting which spells out previously agreed exemptions but does not amend the substance of the treaty. This would have required re-ratification of Maastricht, an unacceptable risk for member states. Mr Allen, 63, sent a private note siding with the opinion of three British legal experts and noted Euro-sceptics who attacked the legal status of Denmark's opt-outs. But after the contents of the note appeared in the British press last weekend, Mr Allen beat a hasty retreat. In a statement issued in Brussels yesterday, Mr Allen said: 'My comments given in an informal way as a matter of courtesy referred only to the professional reputation of one of the authors and the technical quality of the presentation of the legal opinion referred to in the articles, but not to its merit and conclusions. 'On the contrary, I fully share the Commission's view which indeed I have never doubted, that the decision agreed in Edinburgh by the heads of state and government, in order to answer the Danish request, is binding in international law. I regard the use of my name in such a serious matter as a blatant act of bad faith.' Mr Allen was said to be on holiday yesterday and unavailable. Well before the weekend controversy, he was due to take early retirement next year after 20 years' service with the Commission, officials said.</p>

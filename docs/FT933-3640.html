			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: New home for MoD personnel The Ministry of Defence has awarded a Pounds 100m contract to JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION for the 'shell and core' construction work at the new Procurement Executive headquarters at Abbey Wood, north Bristol. The new headquarters will bring together staff currently housed in nine different London buildings as well as sites in Bath, Portsdown and Portland. Annual running cost savings of up to Pounds 40m are estimated along with manpower savings of a further Pounds 35m a year. This contract will involve construction of the new headquarters buildings and is expected to provide a considerable boost for the construction industry and the local economy. Much of the workforce will be recruited from the Bristol area and a number of local sub-contractors will also benefit. Construction work will begin next month and is scheduled for completion in 1996. Interior fit-out work is not included and will be subject to further competitive tendering. The Procurement Executive will begin to occupy Abbey Wood from Autumn 1995 as the office accommodation becomes available. John Laing Construction is currently developing the infrastructure of the site and the whole scheme is being managed by Symonds Construction Management.</p>

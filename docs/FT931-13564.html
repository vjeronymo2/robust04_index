			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / New tax boosts Brazilian reform THE Brazilian government has won a partial victory in its battle to implement fiscal reform, with Congressional approval of a new tax on financial transactions. After much negotiation, the House of Representatives voted by 358:84 late on Wednesday to introduce the 0.25 per cent tax on all financial transactions, including cheques. The government estimates this will generate Dollars 7.2bn in extra revenue and tap into the informal economy, though Brazil's bankers are working to find a way round it. Mr Henrique Hargreaves, the president's chief of staff, said: 'This means we can now progress with our programme of economic stabilisation and social investment'. Economy ministry officials said yesterday they were confident that the new tax, with a recently approved withholding tax on financial gains, will enable them to plug the Dollars 13bn hole in this year's budget and show some progress to the International Monetary Fund at negotiations next month. The real deficit is thought to be much greater than shown by government figures, and the reform so far consists of increasing taxes rather than sweeping structural changes, but the new tax is regarded as a crucial step on the road to reducing inflation, predicted at 27.5 per cent this month. Approval of the new tax was won through centre-left co-operation. In return, the government had to drop two proposed new taxes on fuel and corporate assets, and to abandon proposed authorisation for the economy ministry to lift banking secrecy and to set up special tribunals to crack down on evaders. It also had to agree to devote more of the new revenue to social programmes. The new tax requires another House vote, a Senate vote and an enabling act for implementation this year.</p>

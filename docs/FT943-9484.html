			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Mexicans 'will protest' if election fraudulent Mexico's rebel-organised 'democratic convention' in the jungle ended with delegates promising massive civil disobedience and protests if there is fraud in the presidential election on August 21 but rejecting an armed uprising, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The convention, which ended on Tuesday, was hosted by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in the Lacandon jungle of the southern state of Chiapas. Some 5,000 delegates from radical and leftist political organisations throughout Mexico participated. Sub-Comandante Marcos, the rebel spokesman, told delegates that the Zapatistas would not be the first to take up arms. They launched a rebellion in Chiapas in January and still control jungle areas. The delegates left the jungle pledging to organise meetings and protests in favour of a free vote on August 21. They said they would participate in the elections, and vote against the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Most are expected to vote for Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of the main leftist opposition. Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling party holds a commanding lead over his nearest rivals, according to a well-regarded national opinion poll. His support stood at 46 per cent, against 19 per cent for Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right opposition, and 9 per cent for Mr Cardenas, with 18 per cent undecided.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told a closed  parliamentary meeting Friday [13 May] that he would have to  resign as head of state, deputy Tengiz Sigua told journalists.    Commenting on his decision, Shevardnadze said that if an  agreement on a settlement in Abkhazia was not signed, Abkhazians  would start to shell Zugdidi, Western Georgia.    According to Sigua, not only the parliamentary opposition,  but also a number of representatives of the majority usually  supporting Shevardnadze this time opposed his proposal to sign  the Georgian-Abkhazian agreement on settlement in Abkhazia. In  particular, deputy Nodar Natadze said that if the agreement was  signed as it was, it would mean Tbilisi's complete capitulation  before Abkhazian leaders.    Earlier this afternoon, deputies prohibited the Georgian  delegation in Moscow from signing any documents during  negotiations with Abkhazia until a special parliamentary  decision had been taken. The ban was caused by unacceptable  concessions envisioned by the agreement, which was planned to be  signed in Moscow Friday.    However, parliamentary sources in Tbilisi reported that the  ban was of a recommendatory character. Though as many as 88  deputies voted in favor of the decision, it was insufficient for  a qualified majority of 112 votes. The Georgian parliament is  expected to continue the discussion of the Georgian-Abkhazian  settlement agreement Saturday, 14 May.</p>

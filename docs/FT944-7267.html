			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: A proper pyramid Sir, I am writing with reference to the article, 'Blueprint for two kinds of pyramid schemes' (November 19). The article clearly and concisely highlighted the differences between legitimate direct selling or multi-level marketing schemes and unethical pyramid selling schemes that are 'dressed up to look like legitimate multi-level marketing plans or investment clubs'. Since 1992, Amway has been running the Business Awareness Campaign which is lobbying government to tighten the existing pyramid selling legislation so it protects the consumer from these unethical schemes. The campaign also aims to educate the public and opinion formers about the different types of direct selling so that any dubious or fraudulent schemes can be clearly identified and avoided. The campaign is fully supported by the Direct Selling Association and the Department of Trade and Industry and by members of Parliament from all parties. The Direct Selling Association is currently drafting proposed legislative amendments with the support of the DTI so it may not be too long before these much-needed changes in the law are implemented.

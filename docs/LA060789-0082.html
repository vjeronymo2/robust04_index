			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE URGED NOT TO PAROLE ASSAILANT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council urged state officials Tuesday to reverse their  decision to parole a crazed movie fan who nearly killed actress Theresa Saldana  in a knife attack seven years ago.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to support the motion of its president, John  Ferraro, demanding reversal of the decision to free Scottish drifter Arthur  Jackson on June 15.  </P> <P> "If recourse to the courts and the Legislature is out, then an appeal to the  parole board to add more conditions to his parole may be the only action left,"  Ferraro said.  </P> <P> The council's action came the same day that 60 members of the Assembly sent a  letter to the state Board of Prison Terms asking that Jackson's release be  blocked.  </P> <P> Although Jackson has a June 15 release date, he faces a prison disciplinary  hearing next Tuesday for breaking windows. The incident could add another 180  days prison time.  </P> <P> Additionally, Jackson will be turned over to immigration agents for deportation  to Scotland.  </P> <P> Jackson's obsession with the actress led to the March 15, 1982, attack outside  her West Hollywood home. She was stabbed 10 times. He served seven years of a  12-year sentence.  </P></p>

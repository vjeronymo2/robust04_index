			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: The Way of the World For the Dublin Theatre Festival the Rough Magic theatre company produced Congreve's The Way of the World, which has not been seen here since 1932. Perhaps the reason for its long absence is that this is not a light, frothy comedy, but a serious moral one whose convoluted plot demands close attention from the audience. Director Lynne Parker has taken an inspired gamble by setting the play in the 1930s, a period which is brilliantly suited to Congreve's cynical cast of characters. It is played in the round on a set (by Blaithin Sheerin, who also designed the costumes) which consists of a stark steel and smoked glass cocktail bar. The women wear slinky long dresses while the men appear in various permutations of white tie and evening dress. However, it is still hard work to follow the double crossings and dissimulations. Basically, it concerns Mirabell's efforts to convince Lady Wishfort to allow him to marry her niece, Millamant. It is complicated by the marital infidelities of the Fainalls, in which Mrs Marwood is involved, and the arrival in town of Lady Wishfort's nephew Sir Wilful Witwoud. Most people will sympathise with Sir Wilful's half-brother Witwoud when he says, towards the end of the long protracted denouement, 'Egad I understand nothing of the matter; I'm in a maze yet, like a dog in a dancing school.' One of the most striking features of the 1930s setting is the uncanny way that Congreve's words, written in 1700, sound so appropriate from the lips of these chain-smoking lounge lizards. The characters' affected, world-weary attitudes travel remarkably well across the centuries, and Congreve's words are brought newly alive. Among a hard-working cast of 13, Darragh Kelly's Witwoud is especially appealing, raising laughs where one would not necessarily expect them. Barbara Brennan plays the aged and domineering Lady Wishfort with such subtlety that she seems more pathetic than ridiculous. Andrea Irvine's Millamant is a lively black-haired beauty, and it is easy to see why Mirabell is so enthralled. I thought that Peter Hanly's Mirabell was too young and foppish to carry the moral weight of the part, but he came good in the last act. Martin Murphy, a large fresh-faced man, was perfectly cast as the country cousin, Sir Wilful Witwoud, and Mal Whyte apparently making his stage debut as Waitwell, the servant who is disguised to woo Lady Wishfort and make a fool of her, has a natural comic gift. Lynne Parker directs the proceedings at a fast and well-sustained pace, and as far as I could tell not a word has been cut. She also makes some good visual jokes with the unusual set, for example, posing Millamant beside a pillar to which the white lily has been tied, and using the actors' cigarette smoke to symbolise their dissemblance.</p>

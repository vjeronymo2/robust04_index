			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (7): Potential for growth - Japan catches on fast FACTORING is a relatively undeveloped business in Japan, although turnover more than tripled in the five years through 1991 to Dollars 17.203bn. That was enough to make Japan the world's fifth largest factoring market. At the same time, the economic superpower's share of global factoring activity was a mere 6.5 per cent, suggesting there is plenty of potential for further rapid expansion. The relatively low turnover is partly due to the late advent of factoring in Japan. The first specialised factoring company was established by a financial institution in 1972 when Sanwa Bank set up the firm now known as Sanwa Business Credit Co. Not until 1975 did the Ministry of Finance clarify the range of activities such bank affiliates can undertake and officially approve creation of subsidiaries to carry out factoring as a near-banking activity. That same year, Mitsui Bank and Mitsui &amp; Co. jointly established Japan's second factoring firm, Mitsui Finance. Today 43 bank-affiliated factoring companies are active, including those associated with each of the nation's 11 city, or large commercial, banks. In addition, scores of independent non-bank financing firms offer factoring services to retailers, manufacturers and other clients. The difficulties faced by small and mid-sized firms in developing modern account supervision and credit collection systems have helped foster the industry, as have the Banking Law's limits on bank financing and credit guarantee activities. A distinguishing feature of Japan's factoring market is the focus on discounting of promissory notes. Under the system, factors accept notes at a discount from sellers of merchandise, specifying amounts, dates and financial institutions designated to receive funds. The notes can be purchased with or without recourse. The transactions are appealing because of the ease of transfer and the note holder's clear, binding rights to collect specified amounts from issuers at maturity. The widespread use of promissory notes has fostered this type of factoring activity, and it often takes the place of accounts receivable financing. Such financing is in high demand among small and mid-sized businesses and at Shohkoh Fund &amp; Co. has expanded 40-50 per cent annually in recent years, says company president and founder Mr Kenshin Oshima. The fast-growing non-bank financing firm derives about one-fifth of its revenues from promissory note discounting and another 4.5 per cent from trade accounts factoring. It expects turnover to increase at least 20 per cent annually for some years, Mr Oshima says. At the same time, differences in business practices, particularly the widespread use of promissory notes, will keep Japan's factoring market small relative to its economy, argues Mr Takeshi Fukuda, who heads factoring operations at Nichiboshin, a large non-banking finance company. Promissory note discounting with recourse, in which factors handle collection for department stores, wholesalers, retailers, car dealers and other clients and receive payment from them, involves no direct risk from debtor bankruptcies but yields only razor-thin margins of around 0.15 per cent, Mr Fukuda adds. In contrast to many other countries, cash financing of accounts receivable is not common in Japan because of legal requirements that sellers gain written consent from each customer before transferring collection rights to a financing company. This is typically opposed by debtors as a sign of distrust among sellers. The practice frequent among trading companies of providing materials with credit of 90 days or more also often serves a trade financing function, while non-bank financing firms offer additional credit alternatives. Other services provided by leading factoring firms include direct debit collection, financing with securities and real estate collateral which banks are often proscribed from providing, collection services and international import-export factoring. Over the past few years, deflation of Japan's speculative real estate and stock market bubbles and a dramatic rise in personal and corporate bankruptcies have vastly complicated credit assessment for all types of factoring, says Mr Mitsuo Higashi, general manager of the international factoring department at Diamond Factors, a member of the Mitsubishi Bank group. Previously, domestic bad debt rates hovered around 1 per cent. Recently they have roughly doubled and could easily hit 3-4 per cent in the near future, he adds. Although starting from a small base, Japan-related international factoring grew to Dollars 513m in 1991 from Dollars 62m five years earlier, according to Factors Chain International. This still pushed Japan's total last year to just 3.3 per cent of factoring worldwide. Currently, only seven firms offer such services in Japan, including six city bank affiliates and Hyogin Factors, a leading domestic factor set up by Hyogo Bank of Kobe. Prospects are bright for continued rapid expansion of the international factoring market as trade expands and exporters move away from transacting business via letters of credit or using export insurance. Instead, open account sales are rapidly gaining popularity, particularly for intra-Asian trade. Exporters are also attracted by the ability to present copies of shipping documents and instantly obtain 100 per cent of invoice value from banks. In addition, large trading houses are looking to international factoring to cover insolvency risks and as a simple means of credit protection, says Mr Higashi. A nine-year veteran of international factoring, Mr Higashi has responded recently to inquiries from several affiliates of large financial institutions keen to enter the market, where he says there is plenty of room for everyone to expand. 'Every month we have new clients since we're fulfilling a useful social function,' he says. 'The market is growing quickly enough that we don't have to worry about competition.'</p>

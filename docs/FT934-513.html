			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Expamet warns of second half loss Expamet International, the building, industrial and security components supplier, has warned of pre-tax losses in the second half of its year to the end of this month. Its shares fell 11p to 58p. A deterioration in sales and margins in some of its continental European activities has necessitated reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.1m, including Pounds 1.7m of redundancy charges. It will also be making a Pounds 1.8 provision against property holdings. The company said that excluding the costs, to be taken as exceptional charges, second half pre-tax profits would be about the same as the first half's Pounds 1.95m. Mr John Roberts, chairman, said the annual saving of the redundancies would be more than Pounds 3m but only about Pounds 1m would benefit the present year.</p>

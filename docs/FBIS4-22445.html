			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Bednyakov, mayor of Nizhniy </F> Novgorod, by Yuriy Kozlov; place and date not given: "The  Inverted Triangle of Authority"]    [Text] Mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov on  local self-government, on his dispute with Boris Nemtsov, on the  situation in GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant], and on the  socioeconomic policy of the city administration.    Dmitriy Bednyakov, 42 years old. A lawyer. Candidate of  Juridical Sciences. In 1991, the session of deputies of the  Nizhniy Novgorod City Soviet did not approve his candidacy for  the post of head of the city administration. He was appointed  acting head of administration by an edict of President of the  Russian Federation B. Yeltsin. A year later, in February 1993,  after an account about his activity, he received the absolute  support of the deputies of the city soviet (105 votes out of 138  who voted).    [Begin boxed item]    From the program of Dmitriy Ivanovich Bednyakov, candidate  for the post of head of local self-government of the city of  Nizhniy Novgorod    --social support of every Nizhniy Novgorod family,  especially  those with many children, and assistance to invalids and to the  aged;    --support of programs for the development of education and  health services;    --fight against crime;    --support of Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises and entrepreneurs;    --limiting local taxes and allocating tax benefits;    --reduction of the bureaucratic apparatus and cuts in  expenditures on administration.    [End boxed item]    [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what brought on  the need for elections of the head of local self-government of  Nizhniy Novgorod?    [Bednyakov] Strange as it may seem, it is most of all  associated with the adoption of the new Constitution. It  provides for the rather independent existence of local  self-government. Article 12 states explicitly that local  self-government is not part of the system of organs of state  authority. And this is the main reason for today's and future  disputes that arise between organs of state authority of  components of the Federation and local self-government. I would  express the gist of the dispute in this way: Will there be or  will there not be local self-government? Today, many governors  and managers of executive authority of the Federation conduct  themselves with respect to local self-government in  approximately the same way that the center conducted itself two  or three years ago with respect to the components of the  Federation. Having received authority, they, with passionate  force, do not want to part with it, although the Constitution  does proclaim the independence of local self-government. But in  fact, the governors do not need this independence, and they are  resisting it as much as they can. They want the heads of local  administrations to be appointed and not to be elected.  Unfortunately, the president's administration often shares this  point of view, although it also does not hinder elections where  they are already designated.    [Kozlov] That is, the issue is not to let local  self-government break away from organs of state authority of the  components of the Federation?    [Bednyakov] Let us imagine, for example, two pillars:  legislative authority and executive authority. If vacillations  began at a high level, they were passed on down these pillars to  the lowest level, to the rural soviets. Local self-government  today seems to support the pedestal of both pillars. At the  level of local self-government, legislative and executive, and I  think in the near future the judicial functions as well, will  merge and unite--we will also come to Justices of the Peace. In  my opinion, the matter stands like this: The "pedestal"--local  self-government--will get stronger, and stability and order will  become firmly established. Vacillations at the upper level will  stop influencing the life of every citizen in the country.  Today, unfortunately, many managers of the components of the  Federation do not understand this, and they simply do not want  to share authority.    [Kozlov] Probably, not so much executive as much as  budgetary  and financial authority?    [Bednyakov] We analyzed the budgetary relations of the city.  Interesting details were ascertained: In fact, the oblast budget  was almost always equal to the consolidated budget of the city.  But in the three last years, a trend in the sharp growth of the  oblast budget and a reduction in the city budget have been  noted. We are collecting more than 50 percent of the taxes that  make up the budget of the oblast. Less than 20 percent remains  with us. Virtually all financial resources are concentrated at  the level of components of the Federation, but local  self-government depends fully on representatives of executive  authority. It is necessary to go and ask on every occasion. This  is by no means a Nizhniy Novgorod dispute, but, if you like, an  all-Russian dispute.    [Kozlov] This means not only "to fight or not to fight," but  also "to be or not to be" for local self-government in Russia?    [Bednyakov] In order "to be," it is necessary, first, that  both the representative organ and the head of local  self-government absolutely be elected by the people. Second, it  is necessary to set up an appropriate legislative base. Only in  such a case will an elected person receive a vote of confidence  from the people and depend less on who appointed him, even if it  is the president himself.    [Kozlov] Under what circumstances did you become mayor of  Nizhniy Novgorod? Over the course of two years, what did you  think was fundamental in your work? And what did you succeed in  doing?    [Bednyakov] I did not plan to become mayor. I collaborated  as  an expert and a consultant with the Supreme Soviet for two  years--in committees on legislation, and on questions of  legality, economic reforms, and property. I took part in the  development of laws on privatization, foreign investments,  enterprises, stock market funds, and many others. I became  acquainted with Boris Nemtsov there. When the question on his  appointment as governor was decided, he suggested that I become  mayor. I refused for a long time, because I was planning to  engage in science in an earnest way. I had published more than  40 publications, I was a candidate of juridical sciences and a  docent, and a monograph appeared in the publication  YURIDICHESKAYA LITERATURA. I planned in March 1992 to defend my  doctoral dissertation, but Mr. Governor persuaded me. As of this  date, we have departed substantially from totalitarian  economics, and from a totalitarian state. Since we are talking  about the economy, then it is already mixed in Nizhniy Novgorod,  and in some sectors--trade and public catering--with a  predominance of private capital. It is also possible to talk  about elements of a democratic, civic society. What did we  succeed in doing? First, to form a city administration team that  worked on the resolution of city problems "not for the sake of  personal profit." It was possible to achieve a certain stability  in the work of the city economy and transport. Nizhniy Novgorod  has one of the lowest rates of decline in production in Russia.  Our entrepreneurship is fairly well developed. Finally, we  succeeded in establishing a rather effectively acting mechanism  of social protection of the poor. Although we are only at the  beginning of the road. I do not like such words as the  "Nizhniy Novgorod experiment," the "training ground," and so  forth. We have always acted independently and in the interests  of the residents of our city. But the main result of my  "mayoralty" is that a definite reserve of stability for the  future has been established.    [Kozlov] Both you and Boris Nemtsov are known in Russia, and  even beyond its boundaries, as staunch reformers and organizers  of the famous Nizhniy Novgorod "economic miracle." An article  appeared in the press recently that indicates that differences  have arisen between you. What is the gist of these differences?  Are they associated with the forthcoming elections for mayor in  Nizhniy Novgorod?    [Bednyakov] This is not an easy question for me. We do not  have any fundamental differences regarding how to reform the  economy. But it turned out that on the threshold of the  elections, Governor Boris Nemtsov is not supporting me, but  another person. I thought for a long time about the reasons for  this behavior of the governor, and I came to the conclusion that  there are two reasons. First: I told the governor too often  about the mistakes he made and is making. Let us put it this  way--he got sick of this. Although as a physicist, he should  know that you can only be supported by that which offers  resistance. It is impossible to lean on anything that does not  offer resistance. The second reason, apparently, is that I  consistently defended the interests of the city. Moreover, it is  not so much a question of the redistribution of power as it is  very simple things. If I am charged with appropriate functions  and duties, this means I should receive the necessary amount of  authorities and resources in order to fulfill them. There are  laws on the status of judges, on the militia, and on the  protection of the rights of servicemen. It is written there that  I am obliged in the course of six months to give an apartment,  install a telephone, set up their children in kindergartens, and  so forth. When I say: Give me the money for this, they reply:  You will get by! And I am left one on one with infuriated  people.... I will never resign myself to such an understanding  of authority--on the one hand, to control everything and, on the  other hand, not to be responsible for anything. We seem to be  dealing here with an inverted triangle. With its point, that is,  with a real capability to resolve society's social problems, it  is aimed downward. At the same time, from the standpoint of  control and the capability to distribute financial and various  resources of these sides, it is aimed endlessly upward. There is  this concept of "city-forming enterprises." Previously, they  were financed from the budget. Of the allocated resources, 20-30  percent went for the development of the city infrastructure. All  of this ended in 1990. According to our calculations, Nizhniy  Novgorod city enterprises received R900 billion less than was  due. And, meanwhile, city infrastructures are becoming  dilapidated. We are not being given any money. People come to us  because of housing, the roof is leaking, the heating system does  not work.... The most difficult for me is when I have to refuse.  I am told: Lie, promise more. I cannot.    [Kozlov] In what way does your preelection program differ  from the program of the other candidate?    [Bednyakov] Sociologists claim that 80 percent of a  preelection campaign should be built on lies and promises. Thus,  Mr. Krestyaninov--my rival--claims that the problem of  dilapidated housing can be resolved in two years. There are  7,000 dilapidated homes in the city. Can this problem really be  solved in two years? This is how our programs differ. My program  is a critical analysis of what has been done and a specific  direction for the city's development in the future. His program  is hare-brained schemes and promises. I am for a Nizhniy  Novgorod self-government charter, in which individual rights  would be strengthened. Krestyaninov is opposed. He wants from  the beginning to adopt a charter for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast in  which city "freedoms" would be limited appreciably and  subordinated to oblast executive authority. I am for a strong  city. Then there will also be a strong oblast. He wants to  reduce the significance of the city.    [Kozlov] In your opinion, is the situation at the Gorkiy  Automobile Plant changing for the better or for the worse? How  was the dispute resolved between Boris Nemtsov and Vidyayev,  director of the automobile plant, in which both the president  and the chairman of the government took part?    [Bednyakov] There is a rather severe, and I would say  unprecedented, directive of the government, signed by  Chernomyrdin. Nemtsov has two claims against the automobile  plant. First: He says that there was a blunder in foreign  investments. So, a new director will come--Pugin--and then.... I  think this is an illusion. Foreigners will not invest in the  Russian automobile plant. They do not need competitors. Indeed,  they are not in much of a hurry with investments in general. The  second claim is that Vidyayev is managing the plant poorly.  Pugin will manage better. However, the plant not only has not  come to a stop, but it is even increasing the volume of  production. By comparison with 1992, the increase in passenger  cars totaled 26 percent! The automobile plant is kept under  strict executive discipline. If you now begin to reform it  drastically, introduce new methods of management, and so on, it  could fall apart and come to a halt. But the Gorkiy Automobile  Plant is the heart of the city and the oblast. I am afraid that,  with the arrival there of a new person who is not burdened by  any kind of obligations to the plant collective, the entire  plant social sphere will be instantly sloughed off on the city  budget. And this is 30-40 percent of all of the housing! The  plant now independently maintains its own social infrastructure.  In the meantime, preparations are under way to collect  stockholders. Incidentally, the situation with vouchers, which  the managers of the plant allegedly accumulated for money  allocated from the budget, is not really that simple. They claim  that they bought the vouchers for resources earned owing to the  additional output of passenger cars. The results of the check  auction have not been canceled. An annual balance will be  conducted at the end of March, and everything will become clear  then.    [Kozlov] The city charter, in whose development you  participated directly, will be submitted in a referendum  simultaneously with the election to mayor. What will the charter  give to the people of Nizhniy Novgorod?    [Bednyakov] The charter is the springboard around which the  policy of the city authorities will be formed--it is the  legislative base. The charter describes who can do what, what  cannot be done by someone, and what rights citizens have. For  example, it states there: "Citizens have the right to collective  petitions and appeals. Citizens have the right to attend any  meetings of the organs of local self-government. Citizens have  the right to be heard out by any official." This is a charter  that restricts the arbitrariness of officials and protects the  rights of ordinary citizens. We want to print it for wide  circulation, so that it would be in every apartment, and so that  people not only know, but also would be able to defend their own  rights.    [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what is now  determining the political and economic situation in the country?  Which way is Russia moving--toward confrontation or  stabilization?    [Bednyakov] I think that a repetition of the events of  October of last year is not likely. The people are tired of  politics and will hardly actively support any one of the  disputing parties. There are fewer and fewer reasons today for  upheavals in society. People's expectations are associated not  so much with the possible actions of the authorities as with  specific matters--theirs and those close to them. And this is  the beginning of stabilization. People are beginning to realize  that their fate is in their own hands and that they are able to  improve their life. And if life is changing for the better, no  one needs any upheavals.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Cruising into trouble The highly visible problem of ugly waste dumped by cruise liners on idyllic Caribbean islands is to be the subject of a report funded by the World Bank and the United Nations. Cruise liners carrying up to 3,000 passengers visit islands where they expect to leave their rubbish as they cannot throw it overboard. Each passenger generates an average 2kg of rubbish a day. After three days at sea a liner of 1,500 berths could need to dispose of 9,000kg of rubbish. As one member of the International Maritime Organisation puts it: 'These ships turn up, the passengers all get off and buy one funny hat each and get back on to the ship. Before leaving, the captain hands thousands of bags of rubbish to the port authorities.' Ship-generated waste is estimated at up to 30 per cent of a smaller island's total waste for a year. But adequate reception facilities for such large quantities of waste are hard to find in developing countries. Unsightly rubbish on beautiful beaches is the result. Last year the Caribbean was given special status under IMO pollution convention. The designation imposes heavy restrictions on dumping of rubbish from ships. The study, which starts this month, aims to come up with a variety of solutions including landfills, adequate incineration and better-equipped ships. John Schrinner, special project officer based at the IMO, says that simply raising charges for liners is not the solution, since most of the islands' economy depends on tourism. 'The cruise industry is very competitive and a situation where ports are simply undercutting each other on reception charges to win trade would not be ideal.'</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REQUESTS CLIMB FOR FREE RIDE ON PARKING TAX  </P> <P> Two things are certain in life, Benjamin Franklin once said, death and taxes.  </P> <P> Of course, old Ben never paid a visit to Los Angeles, where a new city parking  tax is mired in a confusing assortment of regulations and exemptions that city  officials still haven't sorted out.  </P> <P> At first glance, the tax looks simple enough.  </P> <P> Beginning last Wednesday, fees charged on all privately owned parking spaces in  the city were subject to the 10% tax. Apartment dwellers, commuters, baseball  fans, shoppers and others will pay the surcharge each time they pull their  automobiles in a pay-for-park space. City officials project that the tax will  bring $22.5 million into city coffers each year.  </P> <P> But there is the tricky matter of exemptions. City officials say the Mosquito  Abatement District, the Wilmington Cemetery District and dozens of other  government agencies don't have to pay the tax. Banks don't have to pay either,  although savings and loans do. Insurance brokers will pay, but insurance agents  won't.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County agencies need not pay the municipal tax, either. County  employees, however, will be taxed if the Board of Supervisors and the South  Coast Air Quality Management District agree on a plan to require county  employees to pay for the parking spaces they currently get free, city officials  said. That proposal has been hotly opposed by county employees.  </P> <P> Donald De Bord, chief of the tax and permit division of the city clerk's  office, is in charge of sifting through the confusion. Businessmen and  bureaucrats have been phoning his office since the tax went into effect, all  pleading convincing cases as to why they should not be taxed.  </P> <P> "We're being advised by people, 'This is what I am and I should have an  exemption because of what I am,' " De Bord said, adding that he expects the  bureaucratic dust to settle soon. "We're in a learning process mode."  </P> <P> The City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley approved the tax as part of a revenue  package to finance the city's record $3.68-billion budget, but several council  members also hoped it would drive some commuters from their cars and into buses  and car pools.  </P> <P> De Bord said it was still too early to tell if the tax will bring in less  revenue than expected because of the growing list of exemptions.  </P> <P> Municipal taxes, such as business and utility taxes, often carry exemptions, De  Bord explained. Banks and insurance companies, for example, pay higher tax  rates to the state Franchise Tax Board and are thus exempt from most municipal  taxes by state law. Those rules are being applied to decide who is exempt from  the city's parking tax.  </P> <P> The motorists who did pay the tax in its first week weren't too happy about it.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of public complaints," said Tom Phillips, president of System  Parking, which operates 30 lots in the downtown area and also the lot at Dodger  Stadium. "The main complaint is that it seems to have taken a lot of people by  surprise."  </P> <P> The biggest tax chunk was paid by monthly customers, who found their paid bills  for the month of August typically had $15 in taxes tacked on to a monthly  charge of about $150, Phillips said.  </P></p>

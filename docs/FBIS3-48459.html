The formalization of the revolutionary ideology of  the respected and beloved great leader [suryong] by the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il occupies the most important position  in his ideological and theoretical achievements gained in  developing and evolving the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  revolutionary spirit.    Scientifically formalizing the leader's [suryong]  revolutionary ideology is of basic significance in advancing the  revolution and construction as intended by the leader [suryong]  and in consummating the working class' revolutionary cause.    We can make the working class and popular masses cherish the  immortal revolutionary banner to endlessly consummate the  revolutionary cause only if we formalize the revolutionary  ideology of the leader [suryong].    The cause of formalizing the leader's revolutionary ideology  cannot be easily achieved by anyone because it is regarded as a  lawful requirement in the developing revolution, but it can be  achieved by the leader's [suryong] successor, who is endless  loyal to the leader and who has a far-sighted extraordinary  wisdom and a scientific insight.    The historic cause to scientifically formalize the respected  and beloved leader's revolutionary ideology was brilliantly  carried out by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the  genius of ideology and theory and great leader [yongdoja] of the  chuche cause. The dear comrade leader scientifically  formalized and announced the leader's revolutionary ideology by  reflecting the warm aspiration and unanimous desire of the  people, who want to comply with the indispensable requirement  for our party and the developing revolution and the  revolutionary ideology of the great leader [suryong] in  combination with the esteemed name of the leader [suryong].    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said that the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly solved the question of  comprehensively systematizing the principle of the chuche idea  by energetically conducting the ideological and theoretical  activities and he has taught: Based on his deep study of the  basic principle and essential contents of the chuche idea, he  has formalized our party's guiding ideology as a monolithic  system of theory and method of chuche idea.    As formalized by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  revolutionary ideology of the great leader is a system of the  theory and method of the chuche idea. In other words, it is a  monolithic system of the chuche idea, as well as the system of  the revolution and construction based on embodiment of the idea.    The scientific formalization of the great leader's  revolutionary ideology by the dear comrade leader is a  significant event in effecting an upturn in the development of  our party and the revolution and in our people's ideological and  spiritual lives. It is also a historic declaration that  announced the respected and beloved leader's [suryong]  revolutionary spirit as the highest stage of the development of  the working class' revolutionary ideology. This, indeed,  becomes an immortal achievement contributed to the development  of ideology of mankind and to the consummation of the  revolutionary cause of the working class.    Thanks to the formalization of the revolutionary ideology of  the respected and beloved leader by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, his revolutionary ideology has been a great guiding  ideology for the revolution and construction in our times, the  chuche era. As a result, its historic truth has been disclosed.    One of the basic characteristics of the revolutionary  spirit of the great leader [suryong] lies on the fact that it is  a system of ideology and theory -- the essence of the great  chuche idea -- which was founded for the first time in the  ideological history of mankind.    The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of  the chuche idea -- indicates that all of its contents has been  developed and systemized based on the theory and method of the  chuche idea.    The revolutionary ideology of the leading working class  regards dialectical and historical materialism as a basis for  the outlook of the world. The world consists of materials based  on the revolutionary ideology of the leading working class. The  world is based on a principle of dialectical materialism, which  means that it is constantly being changed and developed by the  material movement, as well as on a principle of historical  materialism that applies to the history of society.    The primitive philosophy of the working class greatly  contributed to overcoming the mystery, subjectivity, and  fatalism on the question of mankind's fate, but could not handle  the question of mankind's fate because its direct mission is to  reveal the essence of the objective world and the lawfulness of  the development of its movement.    The question of the fate of the working popular masses is  raised profoundly for the first time by the chuche idea as a  question of the outlook of the world. The chuche idea has  solved all problems of the outlook of the world centering on  mankind, the working popular masses, as well as an outlook of  the world which its direct mission is to contribute to pioneer  the fate of the working popular masses.    The chuche idea has developed the essence of the world based  on mankind. Also, it has expounded the lawfulness of the global  change and development in combination with mankind. As a  result, it has clearly presented ways to pioneer the fate of  mankind, of the working popular masses.    As stated, the chuche idea fully elucidates all problems of  the outlook of the world centering on mankind and is the most  scientific and revolutionary outlook of the world centering on  mankind. The progressiveness and historic system of socialist  ideology can be determined on how much it can correctly  elucidate a way for the pioneer of the fate of the popular  masses.    The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of  the chuche idea -- is one that elucidates most correctly the way  for the pioneer of the working popular masses' fate. Because of  this, it has entered the highest stage of development of the  working class' revolutionary ideology. Therefore, it becomes a  great guiding ideology for the revolution and construction in  our times, the chuche era.    Also, the basic characteristics of the great leader's  revolutionary ideology lies in the fact that it has a completed  compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche.  Because the great leader's revolutionary ideology has the  compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche,  its historic position, as the highest peak of the development of  the working class' revolutionary ideology, exists, thus giving a  perfect solution to all theoretical and practical problems in  the revolution and construction in the chuche era.    The compositional system of Marxism includes philosophy,  political economics, and scientific socialism. The historic  mission of Marxism is to prepare the working class for the  revolution and to improve the labor movement based on scientific  foundation. To fully carry out this mission, therefore, Marxism  had to abolish [tapa] religion, idealism, and metaphysics, but  instead establish a materialistic and dialectical outlook of the  world. Also, it had to scientifically disclose the secrecy of  the exploitation by capitalism; had to explain the origination  and the development of the capitalist economy and the lawfulness  of the collapse of capitalism; and had to elucidate the  inevitability of the victory of the socialist revolution.    After then, Marxism consisted of three major systems of  dialectical and historical materialism, and socialism of  political economics and science. Marxism, which is a theory  formulated at a time when the working class entered the stage of  history waging a struggle against capitalism, greatly  contributed to clearing up the exploiting class and system and  achieving a class liberation for the popular masses. However,  as the times change and history develops, Marxism also could not  avoid historical limits.    Unlike the previous revolutionary ideologies of the working  class, the constituting systems of the great leader's  revolutionary ideology are ideology, theory, and methods. The  great leader's revolutionary ideology had the unique  constituting systems because the great ideology is related with  the sacred historic mission of the times and revolution.    Our times consists of a new historical era--the chuche  era--in which the working popular masses, who were once  exploited and oppressed, emerge as the master of history,  independently and creatively carving out their own destiny.  Revolutionary implementation of our times demanded that the  revolutionary ideology of the working class consist of guiding  ideology which gives ideology, theory, and methods.    For the working popular masses to independently and  creatively carve out their destiny as the master of the world,  they should be given chuche-based opinion and view of the world  and the self-consciousness of their position and role, correctly  be taught with the inevitability, strategy, and tactics of the  birth and development of revolutionary struggle for  independence, as well as the methods to accomplish their  responsibility and role as the master of revolution and  construction.    Based on such a demand of our times, the chuche era, the  great leader's revolutionary ideology was constituted with the  systems of chuche ideology, chuche revolutionary theory, and  chuche leadership methods.    By constituting the three major systems of ideology, theory,  and methods, the revolutionary ideology of the great leader  gives the working popular masses a great view of the world, and  a powerful ideological and mental weapon for them to  independently and creatively carve out their own destiny as the  master of the world. It not only thoroughly clears the way for  the struggle to achieve the historic cause of national, class,  and human liberation, and nature, society, human remodeling, and  completely achieve independence, but also teaches the leadership  methods for the popular masses to maintain their position and  accomplish the role as the master of revolution and construction.    The revolutionary ideology of the great leader has three  major constituting systems of ideology, theory, and methods so  that it gives perfect answers to all theoretical and  implementation problems arising from the struggle for  independence in our times. Here lies the historic value of the  revolutionary ideology of the great leader as the leadership  ideology, theory, and methods representing the chuche era.    The revolutionary ideology of the great leader is formalized  by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il so as to add luster to  the revolutionary ideology of the great leader as a great  leadership ideology of our times, the chuche era, and to give  the working popular masses an immortal revolutionary banner to  complete the socialist and communist cause.    Following the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, our people will complete to the end the socialist  cause and chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by upholding the  banner of the revolutionary ideology of the great leader.</p>

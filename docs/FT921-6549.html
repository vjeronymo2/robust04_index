			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Telmex earnings advance TELMEX, Mexico's telephone monopoly, recorded net profits of 6,986bn pesos (Dollars 2.26bn) last year, a 77.8 per cent inflation-adjusted increase over 1990. The higher-than-expected increase pushed the price of Telmex's American Depositary Receipts, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, up Dollars 3 to Dollars 58 in early trading yesterday. Telmex's operating income rose by 46.5 per cent thanks to substantial rises in tariffs and line expansion. In the last quarter, Telmex installed 299,000 new lines, compared with 346,000 in the first nine months of the year. Telmex made Dollars 488m in financial gains last year, of which Dollars 204.3m came from a debt swap arranged between Telmex and the Mexican government. Other gains came from profits on the interest spread between Telmex dollar debt and peso denominated cash, according to Mr Scott Kald of Smith Barney in New York.</p>

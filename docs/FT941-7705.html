			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Welsh cereal growers appeal to Brussels over compensation plan Welsh cereal growers are calling on Brussels to intervene in their battle with the UK government over compensation payments for cuts in cereal support prices. The Welsh want to receive the same payments as English cereal growers. Pressure from Wales's 4,000 cereal farmers forced the government last week to drop controversial proposals to divide Wales into two regions based on 1,000 parishes, with one region getting higher payments than the other. The scheme was denounced as unfair and divisive by the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales. In some cases, neighbours and even single farms were split into separate payment regions. However, the Welsh farmers are just as angry about the government's new proposals to divide Wales this year into two payment regions based on existing Less Favoured Areas and non-Less Favoured Areas. Farmers in the former receive special payments for livestock because of the poor terrain and will receive lower cereals payments than counterparts. Mr Bill Goldsworthy, Welsh NFU director, has written to Mr Frank Leguen de Lacroix, assistant to the agriculture director-general, to ask for his views on the new proposals. When Mr Lacroix visited Wales in January, he said he was puzzled by the earlier, parish-based proposals. 'You will appreciate I am sure, following your visit, that this decision is equally unpalatable to a different section of Welsh cereal growers,' Mr Goldsworthy told Mr Lacroix. He said some Welsh cereal growers producing top yields of eight or nine tonnes a hectare would get compensation based on output of only 3.32 tonnes a hectare, while other Welsh growers would be granted 5.17 tonnes a hectare and English cereal farmers would get 5.93 tonnes a hectare. Mr John Redwood, secretary of state for Wales, said last week that most specialist cereal growers were in the non-LFAs and would benefit from higher payments in line with the views of the industry. Making England and Wales a single payment region 'would not be in the best interests of the UK as a whole,' said an official, declining to elaborate. English cereal farmers, who would suffer a small drop in payments, appear to have accepted the idea of a single region, with Mr David Naish, NFU president, strongly advocating it.</p>

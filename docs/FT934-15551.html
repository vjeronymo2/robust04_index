			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (3): Britain takes the lion's share - More than 3,500 US companies are located in the UK THERE is no argument about which EC member-state has been taking the lion's share of inward investment into the community. Britain has consistently seen off all competitors in the contest to win foreign direct investment. Despite the political debate which surrounds the inward flow of foreign capital - is Britain's success in this respect a sign of its economic strengths or its exploitable weaknesses? - there can be no disputing its impact on the UK. Britain's prowess at promoting its 'open door' policy is confirmed by the statistics. The country has been taking as much as one third of all inward investment coming into the EC. There are now more than 3,500 US companies located in the UK, with 1,000 German companies and around 200 from Japan. By 1991, the cumulative UK share of all US investment made in the community had reached 36 per cent in value terms. The UK also accounted for nearly 41 per cent by value of all Japanese investment in the EC. Last year, another 303 inward investment decisions were taken in the UK's favour, likely to involve around 56,000 jobs. In the five years until the end of 1992, 275,000 jobs has been created or safeguarded in Britain by inward investors. In the manufacturing sector, overseas-owned enterprises investing in the UK now provide 27 per cent of net capital expenditure and 16 per cent of all UK manufacturing jobs. Britain's attractions to potential investors include flexible working conditions, relatively low labour costs and, for many, a language and business culture which is easily adopted. Though there have been some fears expressed about Britain's attitude to Europe, most surveys have confirmed that this has not damaged its chances of continuing to win new investment. Indeed, indications that Europe's competitiveness is under threat because of its relatively high social and employment costs could provide a further advantage to the UK as an EC member-state which has refused to sign up to the EC's social programme. There has also been concern about the quality of investment being made in the UK by foreign companies. The arrival of so-called 'screwdriver' assembly plants has not been greeted enthusiastically by critics, who complain of low labour rates and the failure of inward investors to import the type of technology which is badly required. Supporters of inward investment, however, claim that the beneficial impact far outweighs any disadvantages. The argument is that, far from spawning fresh ranks of 'slave labour', new investment creates more jobs, raises the demand for labour and, in turn, pushes up wage rates. In the final analysis, it is a brave critic who will reject the notion that any job is better than none. A report on the knock-on effects of inward investment, commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry, suggests that, apart from offering employment and training opportunities and new customers for UK capital equipment, the arrival of foreign companies can bring about significant quality improvements among suppliers and competitors. At the heart of UK efforts to attract inward investment against a background of global recession and increasing competition from other locations is the Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, which has been operating for 16 years. The IBB, offering a free and confidential service, is the government's main inward investment promotion agency. It is the only body which represents the nation as a whole, as opposed to the numerous regional organisations and local agencies which champion their own areas. The IBB, which has helped more than 2,000 foreign investment projects in the UK, sees itself as the first port of call for any potential investor and the provider of 'honest, accurate information', according to Mr Christopher Priston, director. 'We are not here to push companies in one direction, unlike some of our EC competitors. We enable investors to have all the facts and to make the best possible decision for them. To behave any differently would be counter-productive,' he adds. Apart from promoting the general attractions of the UK and providing detailed location information for individual investors, the IBB is charged with co-ordinating the efforts of the other, more localised promotional agencies. The bureau has an annual budget of Pounds 5.5m to fund the English regional development organisations - Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are funded directly by the Treasury - and has its own Pounds 2m promotional budget. Mr Priston rejects the notion that the English promotional effort would be better served by the creation of a single agency, as in the other countries which go to make up the UK - 'I think we get the best of both worlds. England is a big patch to cover and we have some excellent local agencies, backed up by IBB at national level'. The IBB accepts that it faces a tough challenge in maintaining the UK record. In the year to April 1993, for example, the number of new inward projects confirmed for the UK declined again from the 1990 peak of 350 to 303, largely because of the recession-associated fall in investment activity. The bureau expects the pattern of inward investment to change, irrespective of the future level of activity. According to Mr Priston: 'The big US companies are already here. There will be some continuing green field investment but we now expect smaller investments from smaller American companies wanting to take advantage of the single market. 'There will be few mega-projects from Japan but a second wave of investment likely to involve supplier and sub-contractor activities. We also expect some joint ventures, a route which the Japanese have not readily chosen in the past.' In response to complaints that inward investors are abandoned to their own fate once they have taken the decision to set up in the UK, the IBB has just started a follow-up programme which will entail visits to 1,000 companies this year. They will be asked if they have any problems and the IBB will endeavour to help if it can.</p>

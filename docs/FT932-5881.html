			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Britain faces Pounds 18bn nuclear bill: NAO report on decommissioning cost raises fear of burden on taxpayer THE TOTAL cost of scrapping the UK's civil nuclear facilities could approach Pounds 18bn, according to a National Audit Office report to be published on Friday. The report - the most comprehensive study of UK decommissioning costs to date - will raise fears of a heavy burden facing the taxpayer and will deepen the controversy surrounding the future of Britain's nuclear industry. Whitehall officials are worried that the Public Accounts Committee, which will assess the report on June 30, could judge that not enough money will be available to pay for decommissioning on present plans. Nuclear plants have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them and storing the radioactive waste is one of the industry's biggest future costs. The nuclear industry is likely to use the report to argue that it needs more new stations to provide revenue for decommissioning those going out of service. Nuclear Electric hopes to start building a Sizewell C nuclear station in Suffolk next year for commissioning early in the next century. Nuclear Electric may also use the report to lobby against a reduction in the nuclear levy, paid by electricity consumers and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year. The industry also wants to persuade the Department of the Environment that it should be allowed to take at least 135 years to decommission nuclear facilities instead of 100 years, a move that will provoke fierce opposition from environmental groups. The report comes just months before the government's nuclear industry review. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, says in a report this week that it fears the review may not consider who picks up the bill for decommissioning. It believes the full costs could be Pounds 30bn, although it has no detailed projections. The NAO's report says the cost of decommissioning Nuclear Electric's eight Magnox power stations and five advanced gas-cooled (AGR) stations makes up some Pounds 7bn of the Pounds 17.9bn total, in 1992 money values. Scottish Nuclear's Magnox station and two AGR stations make up just over Pounds 1.5bn. British Nuclear Fuels' fuel treatment and reprocessing facilities contribute about Pounds 6bn and the Atomic Energy Authority's research and reprocessing facilities about Pounds 3.5bn. It is understood that about a third of the estimates of BNF's costs represent work carried out for the Ministry of Defence - a tiny fraction of the cost of dismantling missiles under anti-nuclear warfare treaties. The nuclear industry is likely to argue, however, that the figures are not discounted to reflect the fact that much of the spending will not take place for decades and that the true amount needed will be much lower. The industry is also likely to welcome the report's suggestion - based on an independent engineering assessment - that nuclear companies have estimated the costs prudently and that technological improvements may bring estimates down further. However, the report throws a spotlight on the thorniest of the decisions facing the government's nuclear policy - the timing and method of decommissioning. This is central to the question of whether cashflow from the industry will be adequate to cover decommissioning. The nuclear industry has been pushing for months for a 'deferred safe storage strategy' which would spread decommissioning over 135 to 150 years, instead of the 100 years assumed in the NAO report. The first stage - stripping out the highly radioactive fuel rods - would still happen immediately. The facility would then be left - supervised - for 35 years, when a concrete shell would be built around it. After another 100 years, when much of the radioactivity had declined, the site would be razed.</p>

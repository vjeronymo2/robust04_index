			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood has  stated that the U.S. President's recent remarks on Jerusalem as  the eternal capital of the Zionist entity show his continued  support for the Zionist enemy's racist policy of settlements.  These remarks also reaffirm the stand of the U.S.  Administration at the Security Council and its obstruction of  the issuing of a mere statement condemning the ugly massacre  perpetrated by the Zionist occupation forces, which blessed the  Zionist settler's killing of more than 40 worshipers and then  themselves killed more than 50 more people.    The statement noted that the peoples of the Islamic world  are  very angry about the U.S. Administration's stand, which flouts  the rights of Muslims in Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The  statement said that the utter silence by the governments, kings,  amirs, and presidents of the countries of the Islamic world has  produced a bad and bitter response among the Arab and Islamic  peoples. In its statement, the brotherhood demanded the Islamic  nation condemn the U.S. stand on the Palestinian cause and show  popular anger toward this stand, which is totally biased toward  the Zionist enemy. The brotherhood said: We remind the U.S.  Administration that its interests are linked to the peoples of  the Islamic world, that it is impossible to continue the current  situation, and that the clear neglect of the rights of Arabs and  Muslims in Palestine, especially in holy Jerusalem, makes it  obvious that the United States has lost its neutrality and the  possibility for its mediation in solving the Palestinian issue.  This is clearly evident in the current negotiations.    And God hath full power and control over his affairs; but  most among mankind know it not. [Koranic verse]</p>

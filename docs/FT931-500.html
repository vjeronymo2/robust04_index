			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Power company staff get 2.9% rise MIDLAND ELECTRICITY, one of the 12 regional electricity companies, has agreed a pay increase of 2.9 per cent with its 5,500 staff. The company has also won agreement to more flexible working time and changed working practices, David Goodhart writes. Mr Richard Young, Midlands Electricity managing director, described the agreement as 'historic'. Many other regional companies are similarly engaged in detailed renegotiation of working patterns. The pay rise is less generous than the rises recently agreed at the generator PowerGen and National Grid, which runs the network in England and Wales. At PowerGen most of the 5,500 workers will receive rises this year, including one-off bonuses, of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. National Grid has been even more generous with rises of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent for most of its 5,500 employees.</p>

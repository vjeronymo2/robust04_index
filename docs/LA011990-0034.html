			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Real Thing: Elton John and Paula Abdul will perform a duet in an upcoming  commercial for Diet Coke.  </P> <P> The 60-second commercial will debut during the 17th annual American Music  Awards special Monday on ABC. In the ad, rock singer John sings from behind  different pianos, while pop star Abdul sings and dances atop a huge keyboard.  Michael A. Beindorff, vice president of marketing for Coca-Cola USA, called it  a "stylized, updated version" of the "Just for the Taste of It" theme for Diet  Coke, a campaign that has been used since 1982.

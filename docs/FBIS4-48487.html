			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] has requested the international community to  exercise pressure on the government led by the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola in Luanda to end what it described  as the massacre of civilians and the use of chemical weapons in  Angola. A communique issued by Jonas Malheiro Savimbi's  movement in Brussels has accused the government armed forces of  using chemical weapons and South African mercenaries against the  Angolan people and called on the United Nations, the European  Union, the OAU, and South African President Nelson Mandela to  intervene. This afternoon, Goncalves Carvalho contacted UNITA  representative in Brussels Alcides Sakala to give more details  on the communique.    [Begin recording] [Sakala] We think the situation has  deteriorated of late, following the systematic use of chemical  weapons in air raids carried out by the Angolan Government  against defenseless people in major urban centers, particularly  in Ndalatando, Huambo, and other cities. That is why, we  decided to alert the international community to this serious  situation in Angola.    [Goncalves] Is there any proof of the use of chemical  weapons  and acts of genocide.    [Sakala] There is a lot. We have sufficient evidence that we  shall present to the international community in due time. This  behavior by the Angolan Government is not new. As you are  aware, during the war fomented by Russians and Cubans in Angola,  the Angolan Government systematically used these chemical  weapons. It is now doing so again and in a massive way.    [Goncalves] The government has at times made similar  accusations against UNITA.    [Sakala] We have no aircraft, as you are very much aware.  The accusations are therefore not valid.    [Goncalves] Well, but chemical weapons can also be used by  artillery.    [Sakala] UNITA does not use chemical weapons in its  operations. We do not use chemical weapons, but we have clear  evidence that the government has been systematically using them.    [Goncalves] When will UNITA present this evidence?    [Sakala] Soon, soon. As you are aware, Mr. Hendricks, a very  experienced specialist is presently here in Brussels. He has  visited our areas on various occasions, and he was the one who  for the first time informed the world about the use of these  weapons by the government. We are in contact with him here in  Brussels, and we shall see how we can in due time expose this  violation. [end recording]</p>

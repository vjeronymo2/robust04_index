			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Headlam profits halved to Pounds 458,000 Taxable profits at Headlam Group, the Northampton-based footwear and fabrics group which fought off an attempted management coup last April, were halved to Pounds 458,000 in the year to December 31, 'a difficult trading period', according to Mr Colin Wyman, chairman. Turnover rose to Pounds 23.25m (Pounds 22.87m), but heightened competition for business saw trading profits slip to Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 1.32m). Interest took Pounds 133,000 more at Pounds 391,000 and there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 130,000) relating to the reorganisation of Phipps-Faire, the textile and plastic materials distributor. Earnings were down at 2.9p (6p) but the proposed final is maintained at 1.65p for an unchanged total of 2.4p. Group borrowings were reduced to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 2.47m), in spite of the Pounds 210,000 extraordinary costs of the extraordinary general meeting and the abortive acquisition of Cadogan Oakley.</p>

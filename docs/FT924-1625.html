			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: IRA strikes again POLICE sealed off a large area of London's West End yesterday after two small bombs injured three people, Bethan Hutton writes. The first bomb, placed in third-floor lavatories at the John Lewis Partnership department store in Oxford Street, exploded about half an hour after vaguely worded warnings had been telephoned to news organisations by callers claiming to be from the IRA. The second bomb, in a litter bin in Cavendish Square, directly behind John Lewis, went off 10 minutes later as staff and customers were being evacuated. The three casualties were taken to hospital with minor injuries, together with a fourth, a man who suffered an asthma attack after the explosions. Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the attack was part of the 'obscene game' the IRA wished to play with the police. 'The pattern is there: imprecise messages not indicating inside the store or outside the store, and impossible time scales for the police to clear the area.' Mr Tucker said both bombs appeared to be small, but it was 'miraculous' that there had not been more injuries. Oxford Street was closed for several hours. Damage to the John Lewis building was limited and the store reopened later.</p>

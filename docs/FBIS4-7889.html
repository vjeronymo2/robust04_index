			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- Bulgaria will probably be  granted the so-called "enhanced status" of a Western European  Union (WEU) associate member at a meeting of the ministers of  the WEU-member states, said Sir Dudley Smith, president of the  WEU Assembly, at the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee  today. Membership in the WEU for Bulgaria is comparable to  membership in NATO, Sir Dudley Smith told MP's. The WEU is to a  great extent a catalyst in NATO and UN activities, said Mr.  Cameron, also member of the WEU delegation headed by Mr. Smith  visiting this country since yesterday. The visit provides a  chance for Bulgaria to defend its democratic image, Mr. Nikolay  Slatinski, chairman of the Parliamentary National Security  Committee, told BTA after a meeting of the WEU delegation with  this committee. Bulgaria should convince the European states  that it is neither economically not politically inferior to the  states of the Visegrad group, Mr. Slatinski added.    At present Bulgaria holds the status of a permanent observer  in the WEU. We should not aim at the highest possible as  regards Bulgaria's future status in the WEU; in this respect I  am moderately optimistic, Ivan Gaytandzhiev MP told journalists.  As an associate member Bulgaria will be able (possibly through  a representation in Brussels) to take part in preliminary  investigations and in the making and implementation of decision  to be adopted by the full WEU members, Mr. Robins of the WEU  delegation explained. It has also been provided for maintaining  constant contacts between the defence ministries and other  institutions of the countries of various statuses in the WEU.  Central Europe should become an integral part of the WEU and  the Union may therefore have to change its name, Sir Dudley  Smith said at the meeting. As regards Russia, at present that  country has too many unsolved problems to be accepted in the  WEU, the president of the WEU Assembly added.    Sir Dudley Smith described the decision of the UN Security  Council to send Greek and Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia as  inappropriate. Greece's stand on the Macedonian state is too  extreme; Bulgaria is a leading force in the eastern part of the  Balkans, Sir Dudley Smith told MP's of the Foreign Affairs  Committee. Events similar to the ones in Bosnia may take place  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] as well and it is necessary to avert them. The WEU is  fully aware of the role of a frontline state which Bulgaria has  assumed in enforcing the Yugo-embargo, he added. The president  of the WEU Assembly told MP's that it is important for the  Bulgaria side to make out a good case of the issue of its  embargo-related losses at the session of the WEU Assembly in  June 1994.    The potentials of the Bulgarian military industrial complex  are interesting and deserve to be studied in greater detail, Mr.  Cameron told MP's today in response to a question. The WEU  Assembly has recommended the ministers of its member-states to  allow the associated countries to take part in the work of the  WEU Satellite Telecommunications Centre in Spain, Mr. Cameron  recalled. There are ample opportunities for future cooperation  between Bulgaria and the WEU in arms production through the  so-called Western European Armaments Group, the WEU delegation  believes.</p>

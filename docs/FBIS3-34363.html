In an editorial today, the paper says the stance adopted by  the UN officials since the crisis began has been one designed to  demonstrate neutrality and ignore responsibility to preserve  peace and stability in member states.    The newspaper adds that the international organization has  left the Bosnian people easy prey for extremist ethnic gangs,  which get the most modern weapons anywhere, while it has barred  the victimized people's access to weapons to defend themselves.    The paper describes the world's position on the massacre as  "loose and feeble," although the world claims it has reached the  peak of civilization.</p>

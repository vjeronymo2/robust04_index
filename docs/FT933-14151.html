			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marion Merrell Dow restructures MARION Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals group 70 per cent owned by Dow, the large US chemicals company, yesterday announced a sweeping package of measures to reduce costs by about Dollars 250m a year. The restructuring, including a 13 per cent cut in staff, rationalisation of research and development, and other cost-cutting measures, will lead to a special pre-tax charge of about Dollars 180m. Most of the Dollars 250m savings should be achieved this year. Mr Fred Lyons, MMD president, said: 'We are moving aggressively to realign our business, both to improve current results in face of rapidly changing conditions and to prepare for the longer-term opportunities.' The measures were principally in response to the growing importance of the 'managed' (bulk discount) care sector in the US, Mr Lyons said. MMD is a leader in managed care, from which it generates about 40 per cent of its US sales. The rationalisation is also a response to a series of blows in recent months. Sales of Nicoderm, the best-selling smoking patch in the US, collapsed this year as the smoking cessation market, worth Dollars 800m in 1992, fell to Dollars 350m. MMD has also been affected by the expiry last November of the US patents of its best-selling product, the heart drug Cardizem, which had sales last year of more than Dollars 1bn. Sales of Seldane, its anti-histamine, have been undermined by safety concerns. Business in Europe has also been affected by healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy. The company plans to cut as many as 1,300 jobs from its workforce of 9,800. Most of the reduction will be in the US. The figure includes cutting 275 full-time US sales representatives and 200 part-time sales positions. MMD saw first-quarter turnover fall 21 per cent to Dollars 617m from Dollars 779m and pre-tax profits decline 56 per cent to Dollars 74m. It said it would focus its R&amp;D on specific projects, including a Seldane metabolite that would not have the side effects now associated with the product; Sabril, an anti-epileptic; and allergy products. Last year, MMD formed a joint venture with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, to develop and market over-the-counter medicines in the US.</p>

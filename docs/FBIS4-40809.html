			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Afanasyeva under the "Chuche" rubric: </F> "North Korea Has Promised `an Eye for an Eye...'"]    [Text] "We will respond to war with war! Our  countermeasures will depend on the sanctions applied by the  United States and other countries," Son Song-pil, North Korea's  ambassador to Russia, declared yesterday at a session of the  State Duma Committee for International Affairs.    The Korean representative called the whole Korean nuclear  question "nuclear suspicions invented by the Americans," while  the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, according  to him, is "aimed at destroying North Korea's socialist system  and the republic as a whole."    According to the ambassador's statement, North Korea wants  to  resolve the problem peacefully but, given the slightest pressure  or threats from America or other states, Kim Il-song's country  is prepared to counter one blow with another.    The DPRK's official representative took a great dislike to  the Russian foreign minister's Friday Duma speech and to the 10  June Kozyrev-Christopher joint news conference, at which the  possibility of the simultaneous introduction of sanctions and  holding of a peace conference on Korea was reported.    "There can be no question of simultaneous sanctions and a  conference," Comrade Son Song-pil said, at the same time adding  that the DPRK is seriously considering the Russian proposals and  that meetings have already been held with representatives of the  Russian Foreign Ministry.    According to the ambassador's report, during his stay in the  DPRK ex-President Carter conveyed U.S. proposals which include  the U.S. abandonment of sanctions, the provision of a light  water reactor to the DPRK through third countries or through  international organizations, and consent to a third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks.    "If these conditions are fulfilled, Korea is prepared to  keep  inspectors at the nuclear installations. But a full-scale  inspection cannot be carried out during the talks, since this  would signify the DPRK's return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty," the ambassador declared, resolutely emphasizing: "If  the talks are held on our terms, the nuclear problem will be  removed!"</p>

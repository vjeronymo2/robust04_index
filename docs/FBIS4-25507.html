			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Britain  already has filed a lawsuit at the EU Trade Court, calling for  lifting the sanctions involving the imposition of quotas on toys  from China.    An official of the British Ministry of Trade and Industry  said in Hong Kong: Many British toy importers have suffered  losses since the EU ministerial meeting in last February decided  to impose import quotas on China's toy products, and some of  them have come close to bankruptcy. Similar situations also  have arisen in other European countries.    The "European Toy Manufacturers' Association" pointed out:  The EU quota imposed on toys from China already has limited the  amount of this kind of imports to 1.8 billion ECUs this year,  which is merely half of the originally expected import volume.  This will drive at least 500 people in the European region out  of employment, whereas many European toy manufacturers importing  finished toy products and spares from China will be hit by a  drop in profits and sales.    According to the British Ministry of Trade and Industry,  this  kind of all-round import quota restriction, which encompasses  the whole European region, is really unnecessary since it is  Spain alone that has opposed the import of toys from China and  has sought protection for its own toy industry.    At present, with the exception of Britain, some other  European countries also have pointed out that these sanctions  are unjustifiable. These European countries, which are  suffering losses, already have started working through legal  channels to urge the EU to change its decision and lift the  sanctions.</p>

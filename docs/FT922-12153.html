			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / An Ecu for Europe's poor: Delors wants to put poverty higher on the agenda THE EUROPEAN Community's leading anti-poverty programme has a budget of Ecu55m (Pounds 38.6m), about one Ecu for each of the 50m-plus deprived people estimated to be living in EC countries. The EC's Poverty 3 programme is consuming its Ecu55m over five years, reducing annual expenditure to around one-fifth of an Ecu per poor person. This is, European Commission officials admit, a pitifully poor sum to be devoting to one of the most challenging social issues of the day. Both in the commission and among anti-poverty organisations, however, a wish is growing for the EC to become more involved in promoting measures to support Europe's disadvantaged citizens. Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, intends to produce a document on poverty and social exclusion aimed, first, at increasing political and public awareness of the issues and eventually establishing a charter of rights. Mr Delors admitted at a conference in Brussels this month that the fight against poverty is an area where the EC has little to boast about. National governments still took the view that 'each parish has its poor people' and did not want the next parish, much less the commission, involved. But he voiced a willingness to use the commission's influence to help lift issues of social exclusion and disadvantage to a higher point on Europe's political agenda. Poverty was a cumulative process, said Mr Delors, and 'if it takes place against a backdrop of indifference in society, at some stage the problem will become intractable.' Definitions of poverty are themselves the subject of frequent disagreement. Current EC estimates that some 50m of its population - 15 per cent of the total - live in poverty are based on a calculation of the number of people receiving less than half the average income in the country where they live. Some politicians would argue with this definition but Mr Wim Van Velzen, president of the European Parliament's social affairs committee, says that on the same basis 30m people were in poverty in 1978. In spite of economic growth and aid to less developed regions, the proportion of poor people in Europe has grown each year. This arises largely from the consequences of industrial restructuring and long-term unemployment, factors which have also helped change the nature of 'typical' west European poverty. Once traditionally associated with such groups as the elderly, it is now far more likely to afflict younger, unemployed families and single parents. The concept of what is meant by poverty is also changing - the phrase 'social exclusion' is increasingly used to indicate that poor people lack not only money but access to a range of other services and opportunities. Notions of poverty being about more than shortage of money have gained strength since the mid-1980s when Faith in the City, the Church of England's influential report on urban areas, described it as being about 'how people are treated and how they regard themselves; about powerlessness, exclusion and loss of dignity'. Some welfare campaigners are concerned that if this view is carried too far, however, the link with lack of money may be lost to such an extent that poor individuals are seen by others as being responsible for their own plight. 'It is right to talk about exclusion but poverty is still about money,' says Mr Quintin Oliver, president of the European Anti-Poverty Network which co-ordinates the work of the voluntary sector. 'It is caused by lack of money, and money helps solve many of the problems.' In late 1990 the EC set up a support group of independent specialists to examine the prospects for developing a European strategy to fight poverty and social exclusion. The group has concluded that the EC has a substantial and potentially useful part to play 'despite its meagre resources for direct action'. Although local projects funded by the EC were unlikely to add up to an effective policy for fighting poverty, they should continue as a means of supporting innovative approaches and exchanging information. The group recommends that the commission produce an annual report on the state of human development in the EC, enabling the social consequences of development to be measured alongside economic ones. Rising EC interest in the problems of poverty and social exclusion reflects fear about the potential consequences of leaving a large section of Europe's population living outside the mainstream, particularly at a time when extreme-right political parties have been gaining ground in some EC countries. Time may be short. The support group's report warns of a 'veritable explosion' for society, with parts of large towns tending to become urban ghettos for marginalised people where 'moonlighting, fraud, delinquency, prostitution and drug-trafficking seem infinitely more remunerative than all the benefits that could possibly be paid out by the welfare system.'</p>

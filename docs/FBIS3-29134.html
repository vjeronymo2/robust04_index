			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States agreed Friday [11 February] to cooperate on global issues  in 15 fields, including AIDS and population problems, saving the  bilateral framework talks from ending in a complete flunk. The  two governments agreed on the global cooperation, one of three  pillars in the trade framework negotiations along with  macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, at the summit talks  between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    Under the accord, Japan and the U.S. together will offer 12  billion dollars over seven years to tackle issues involving AIDS  and population problems. Of the total amount, the U.S. is to  disburse 9 billion dollars and Japan will offer 3 billion  dollars.    The two countries will also cooperate in developing  environmental technologies and developing human resources.    Tokyo and Washington failed to strike a deal on the other  areas of the framework talks to slash Japan's huge trade surplus  and boost the share of imports in its markets. The two sides  remain deadlocked over the definition of "objective criteria" in  accessing foreign access to Japanese markets such as autos and  auto parts, insurance and government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment.</p>

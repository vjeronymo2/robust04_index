			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowie makes second clarification over bid T Cowie, the motor trader which is bidding Pounds 26.7m for rival Henlys Group, has had to make a second clarification over the status of its offer. It said it wanted to remove any impression that its offer may not be revised. It also referred to its offer document which said the offer was 'generous'. The first clarification came on Thursday after a newspaper article seemed to suggest that Cowie's offer was final. Under takeover rules, once a bidder has said an offer is final it cannot increase the offer unless another bidder comes in. Cowie said that a second newspaper article had misquoted a Cowie representative saying 'this is the best offer'. Cowie said the Takeover Panel had advised them to clarify the matter. With Cowie's shares standing at 141p the 1-for-2 share bid is worth 70 1/2 p, against Henlys share price of 72p. That suggests the market does not expect the Cowie offer to succeed at this price. Some shareholders are believed to want a cash alternative to the all-paper bid.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Court ruling fails to defuse chip war - Implications of the Intel-AMD technology decision A FIVE-YEAR arbitration battle between rival Silicon Valley chip-makers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices has resulted in a decision that appears unlikely to end bitter disputes over AMD's rights to manufacture Intel-designed microprocessor chips. The dispute focused on the 386, the chip at the heart of current-generation IBM-compatible personal computers. Until last year, Intel was the sole supplier of the 386. However, in April AMD launched its own 'reverse-engineered' clone of the microprocessor, and has since won a 30 per cent share of the market. In his decision, the arbitrator awarded AMD a 'permanent, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable worldwide right' to any Intel technology that may be incorporated in AMD's reverse-engineered version of the 386. He found that Intel had breached a 1982 technology-sharing pact with AMD, under which the companies agreed to swap microprocessor and related product designs. AMD was also awarded nominal damages of Dollars 15m in connection with disputes over earlier versions of the chips. Intel, however, will be allowed to keep Dollars 23m in disputed royalty payments made by AMD. Commenting on Intel's conduct, the arbitrator said he would have awarded punitive damages against Intel if they were within his powers. He would also like to have been able to transfer a portion of Intel's 386 revenues to AMD. The arbitrator found that the damages to AMD from Intel's violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were 'immeasurable', and that he felt unable to 'even out the balance' entirely. The arbitrator, a retired California judge, said his decision was aimed at 'aborting the incessant warfare which has gone on between these two companies for the past five years'. He said: 'I intend that AMD be permitted to go forward in its production and sale of the AMD reverse-engineered 386 without harassment from Intel from any further law suit. 'After five years, it is now the end of the day . . . the parties have had a full and fair hearing. Now it is time to go home.' However, Intel immediately said it would oppose enforcement of the portions of the decision relating to the 386, and that it expected to continue to fight AMD in the courts. One of several pending lawsuits between the companies is expected to go to trial next month. A new round of legal battles appears likely when AMD introduces its own version of the next-generation 486 microprocessor, which was specifically excluded from the arbitration decision. 'The remarkable thing is how little real impact this decision will have on either company,' said Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive. 'We keep the Intel 386 chip and they keep selling their imitation of it. The only thing new is that the arbitrator sprinkled holy water on their chip and has given them additional defences to help them fight us in court. Financially, the decision is also a non-event.' Not surprisingly, AMD took a different view of the decision. 'Justice has been done,' said Mr W. J. Sanders, AMD chairman and chief executive. 'AMD now has the unfettered, royalty-free rights to manufacture and sell the 386 microprocessor. All past and future 386 revenues and profits are no longer under any cloud of legal uncertainty.' Computer-makers have welcomed AMD's entry into the 386 market. Competition between the two companies has forced Intel to lower its prices, fueling a rapid decline in personal computer prices that is boosting sales of computers and computer software. With both Intel and AMD hailing the decision as a victory, there is, however, widespread confusion within the industry over what the decision means. Both companies can be expected to attempt to use the ruling to gain market advantage. Wall Street analysts, many of whom had anticipated a much larger monetary award, said Intel got off lightly with an award much smaller than the Dollars 2.2bn AMD was seeking. Since its introduction of the 386 clone, AMD has posted record sales. For 1991, the company reported revenues of Dollars 1.bn and profits of Dollars 145.3m, while Intel also unveiled record revenues last year of Dollars 4.78bn and Dollars 819m in profits.</p>

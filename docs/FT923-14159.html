			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Bonds: World Bank launches five-year Dollars 1.5bn global issue THE World Bank yesterday launched its sixth global bond issue, leading a number of sovereign and supranational borrowers hurrying to raise funds in the international market before the summer holiday period. The World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn five-year deal, lead-managed by IBJ International and Merrill Lynch, will be priced today to yield 5 to 7 basis points more than US Treasury securities. On the basis of demand seen yesterday, underwriters are expecting the yield spread to be set at the tighter end of the indicated range. Participants in the deal reported strong buying from investment institutions in the Far East and Europe. However, US investors appeared less enthusiastic. At such a low yield spread, most US investors prefer to buy their domestic government paper. Even so, demand from elsewhere was easily enough to support the deal and most underwriters reported demand well in excess of their allocations. Finland continued its heavy borrowing programme in the international market, raising FFr4bn 11-year funding. The deal, lead-managed by Credit Commercial de France, was the borrower's second issue in French francs this year following a FFr5bn five-year issue in March. Yesterday's 9 per cent issue was priced to yield 41 basis points more than French government bonds of the same maturity. However, the government bond issue maturing 2003 is relatively illiquid. Bankers said the Finland bonds yielded around 39 basis points more than benchmark French government debt. Both the pricing and long maturity of the issue were seen as aggressive by deal participants. Paris-based banks found only lacklustre demand from French investors although international demand for the issue was more buoyant. By the close of trading in Paris, the bonds were trading at 99.20 bid, below the fixed re-offer level of 99.32 but well inside full fees of 35 basis points. At this level, the yield spread over the 2003 government issue was 42 basis points. Norway made a debut issue in the Canadian dollar sector, taking advantage of good currency and interest rate swaps opportunities. The CDollars 500m six-year deal, lead-managed by Paribas Capital Markets and IBJ International, was swapped into US dollars. Another European sovereign borrower is expected to tap the Canadian dollar sector today. The 7 1/4 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.55. At this level the yield was 34 basis points more than Canadian government paper. The yield spread was initially seen as too tight by some participants in the deal. However, most reported brisk sales. The Canadian dollar bond market has rallied strongly on hopes that the debate about the country's constitution will soon be resolved. Slough Estates, the property investment group, became the third UK company this week to raise long-term sterling funding, following issues from Hanson and Boots. The company launched a Pounds 100m 20-year issue lead-managed by Warburg Securities. The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance part a Pounds 147m liability relating to a convertible bond which will probably be put back to the company next year. Since the put option on the convertible is not exercisable for some months, yesterday's issue was launched in partly-paid form. Investors must pay 25 per cent of the purchase price this month, with the balance falling due at the end of December. The company chose to issue yesterday rather than waiting until later in the year because long-dated gilt yields are low and - as shown by the Hanson and Boots issues - demand for long-dated sterling paper is firm. The 11 5/8 per cent unsecured bonds were priced to yield 255 basis points more than long-dated gilts. A secured issue could have been priced to yield around 1 per cent less. However, by issuing unsecured debt, Slough remains free to trade its property assets. See Lex</p>

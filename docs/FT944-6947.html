			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Clough: a top boss but no saint - Soccer / A controversial autobiography It is a common mistake to assume that sporting heroes are all-round lovable individuals. Even though Paul Gascoigne can dribble round defenders and find a colleague with a 40-yard pass, he would not be most parents' choice as the ideal son-in-law. It is thus with a heavy heart that one approaches Brian Clough's autobiography. Much as one admires the man's managerial record, his strident television appearances conjure up fears of a 200-page long taxi driver-style rant. The book is not that bad, although the first chapter might have come from a Monty Python style script conference. The opening sentence - 'If ever I'm feeling a bit uppity, whenever I get on my high horse, I go and take another look at my dear Mam's mangle that has pride of place in the dining-room' - is ripe for delivery by Michael Palin. Later on, we get Clough the philosopher: 'It's not the fashion to say this nowadays, but a woman's job is to be there (in the home).' Thanks, Brian, but Bertrand Russell can rest easy in his grave. One unexpected emotion that leaps out of the footballing section of the book is sadness. His playing career was cut short by a knee injury, without the international recognition that he clearly felt he deserved, and his record appears to justify (204 goals in 222 games for Middlesbrough but only two caps for England). His outspokenness ensured that he never became manager of his country but now, ironically after his retirement, the Football Association has finally appointed a coach with a controversial record and a Clough-like devotion to the passing game. He lingered on as manager of Nottingham Forest too long, as he readily admits, so his distinguished career ended, not with an FA Cup final appearance in 1991, but with relegation in 1993. By that stage, his youthful good looks had gone and his face revealed the ravages of a problem confessed in the epilogue - he drinks too much. Then there are the breakdowns in personal relationships which litter the book. His appointment as skipper split the Middlesbrough team into two camps. He describes his first chairman as 'one of the most evil men I have ever met'. He encountered sullen hostility from the players at Leeds and lasted only 44 days in the job. Saddest of all is the break-up with Peter Taylor. It is easy to forget but the greatest successes of Clough's career - the League championships, the European Cups - were achieved as part of a double act. Taylor spotted the players, Clough motivated them. What kept the duo going was the 'cheeky chappy' element of Taylor's personality. Clough's fondness for Taylor, which excused the latter's habit of 'slipping off' home at the earliest opportunity, was perhaps due to his assistant being the only person at the club who was not intimidated by him. While the odd player gets an honourable mention, such as John Robertson and John McGovern, the book is dedicated to Taylor. Yet in the seven years that preceded Taylor's death, Clough admits that he spoke only a few words on the telephone with his old colleague. They had fallen out when Taylor, then manager at Derby, had poached Robertson from Nottingham Forest. One revealing passage in the book says it all: 'It was an astonishing and bitter end to our relationship, but my conscience was untroubled. I didn't instigate it.' That fierce pride kept Clough apart from his old friend. And pride also lies behind the most controversial part of the book - the section dealing with the Hillsborough disaster. Yorkshiremen are often proud of their plain speaking, of their willingness to call a spade a bloody shovel. When it applies to criticism of chairmen, football commentators or FA bureaucrats, plain speaking can be amusing. But when the subject is a tragedy, when the only result of your words is anger and anguish among the relatives and friends of the dead, then the wise man keeps his silence, however sincerely held his views. Therein lies the paradox of sporting achievement. The same pride that causes Clough to give needless offence is the quality that kept him going through the disappointments of a wrecked playing career, the departure at Derby and the short stay at Leeds. And Clough was undoubtedly in the top drawer of managers. Not only did he win the Championship with two different clubs, but Forest retained the European Cup - both extremely rare achievements. Not only was this done with a slick passing and entertaining style and an excellent disciplinary record, but it was done at clubs with modest resources. Alex Ferguson, with all his Manchester United internationals, is struggling to qualify for the last stages the European Cup. How did Clough do it? Readers hoping for the magic tips to managerial success will be disappointed. Clough insists he kept it simple - defenders had to tackle, and centre forwards had to score. Apart from that, his main secret was to keep the players relaxed and to insist on training with the ball, rather than mindless round-the-field runs. By the end of his career, that admirable precept had become a weakness, as Forest players failed to match the fitness of their opponents. But maybe simplicity was the secret. Sport is too often over-intellectualised. An iron will, allied to a few basic principles took Clough to the top. It did not, as his autobiography reveals, make him a saint.

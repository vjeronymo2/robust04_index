			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;No one should be a member of a survey team unless he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she has successfully completed a training and testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, not only on how to conduct a standard survey, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how to conduct an extended survey as well. Proof of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful completion of this training must be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the facility prior to the initiation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Before a citation is given, the surveyor must be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demonstrate a negative outcome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that the HCFA policy that surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not to be consultants is a great disservice; surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should adopt a role like the JCAHO surveyors. Another said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA should convene a national group of experts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including State and Federal surveyors with extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience, nursing facility providers, and consumers, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify the knowledge and skills needed by survey teams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some said that surveyors should pass not only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial examination, but be tested annually. The passing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scores for the tests should be 85 percent or more,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters said, and the results of the testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remediation must be made available to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that, when surveyors are cross- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained, their expertise in the new area is not good enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to survey facilities' performances in that area. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason, the commenter suggested that &sect;488.314 be revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* to preclude the use of surveyors without demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional training and experience in the substantive area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being surveyed. By professional training and experience,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenter said, ``we do not mean on-the-job or inter- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency in-service training. Rather, we mean graduates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredited or approved educational institutions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that there should be no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``grandfathering'' of surveyors. Another asked the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What validity and reliability studies were conducted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the test measures the ability of surveyors to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their functions in a consistent manner?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Has the test been validated to allow States to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their affirmative action plans?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Are the results of the tests in line with the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for merit systems and collective bargain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The listing of suggested topics for surveyor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training was extensive. Some of the items (for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct application of the applicable statutes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, quality of care standards, and proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation) are already covered in surveyor training. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe others are inappropriate to require as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey training; they should be provided as part of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team member's initial and continuing training within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context of training for his or her area of professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would encourage, but do not require, States to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors in training to act as observers on actual surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the field, and are taking all possible measures to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the demand for surveyor training. For example, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning to use satellite transmissions for training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courses. We have already begun to move ahead with one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other suggestions, interactive video training. As for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider and/or ombudsman input for surveyor training and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, we have convened a national workgroup which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes provider organization and consumer advocacy group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives to assess the surveyor training program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make recommendations for changes. Finally, we will listen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all reasonable suggestions from providers and ombudsmen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but do not agree that the regulations need to be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require this input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Longer reach for enforcing US anti-trust US anti-trust enforcement agencies are expected to be able to expand their reach overseas when President Bill Clinton signs a bill, passed in the closing hours of the congressional session on Saturday, to allow greater co-operation with foreign competition authorities. The bill will allow the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, which share responsibility for enforcing anti-trust laws, to provide information which they would otherwise be barred from divulging to countries which agree in return to share their own information. The US has this sort of legal co-operation agreement only with Canada. Justice department officials credit the co-operation pact with helping them break up a cartel fixing prices of thermal fax paper and plastic cutlery this year. Ms Janet Reno said the new law would 'give us unprecedented access to evidence needed to conduct investigations of international business activity'. In exchange, she said, US laws would be retooled to accommodate similar requests from foreign countries. The US worked closely with European Union competition authorities in an investigation of Microsoft, the computer software giant, that resulted in a settlement this year. In that case, however, Microsoft gave its consent for the exchange of information which the Justice Department would otherwise have been prohibited from divulging. The US signed an anti-trust co-operation deal with the European Community in 1991, but that was overturned this year by the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it should have been concluded by the Council of Ministers, not the Commission. Although the US administration launched its campaign for the bill in June, it was squeezed through the House of Representatives judiciary subcommittee on economic and commercial law less than two weeks ago, and was one of a long list of mostly uncontroversial measures passed by the Senate without a recorded vote in the final hours before members went home to campaign for the November 8 election.</p>

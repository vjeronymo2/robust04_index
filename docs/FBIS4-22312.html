			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter by Oleg Morozov, political commentator of RESPUBLIKA </F> TATARSTAN: "I Cannot Fail To Acknowledge"]    [Text] Today we publish a statement by Oleg Morozov,  ex-candidate for deputy of the State Duma (according to  preliminary results of the elections of 13 March--by now, a  deputy) which he has sent to all newspapers of the republic and  Kazan. This statement is a response to his opponents who held a  press conference on 18 March at which they maintained that  serious voting violations were allowed to occur, and in favor of  just one candidate, Oleg Morozov. The statement is being  published in full.    Esteemed fellow citizens!    On the evening of 18 March many of you had an opportunity to  watch a TV report on a press conference in which my former  opponents in the Moskovskiy Electoral District participated most  vigorously [line(s) missing in the original]. The essence of  their presentations boiled down to the fact that various  violations occurred during the elections which place in doubt  the very outcome of the elections. It is the prerogative of the  district electoral commission to comment on the specific claims  put forth by the participants in the press conference. I am no  less interested than my opponents in getting exhaustive answers  to all the questions.    However, I certainly cannot fail to acknowledge some, to put  it mildly, improper pronouncements which affect me personally.    Let us begin with one participant in the press conference,  M.  Rameyev, who said approximately the following in support of his  thesis that I was supported by the administrations of a number  of rayons: People were forced to vote for Morozov, and for the  sake of this they were paid wages they had not been paid since  November.    I assert with the full weight of responsibility that, alas,  I  had nothing to do with an event as wonderful for many of my  fellow residents as the payment of back wages. Moreover, I know  that many labor collectives still have not received what is due  to them. However, if we imagine for a minute that people were  given the money they had earned on account of a modest  individual like myself, this means that you, esteemed voters,  have made a correct choice.    Another participant in the press conference, V. Belyayev,  stated that it was allegedly indicated on the ballots in some  polling stations that I am a resident of the city of Kazan.  First, I would very much like to look at these ballots: I  believe that they do not really exist. Second, I have never  concealed the fact that I have resided in Moscow for the last  four years--not in the official consent to run, not in  interviews to newspapers, not at meetings with voters. As far as  I know, the city of Kazan was erroneously indicated as my  domicile by the newspaper VECHERNYAYA KAZAN, and then on the eve  of the elections and in the context of a direct appeal to vote  for V. Belyayev. I will recall that a sample ballot was  published in which an appropriate mark was placed against  Belyayev's name.    Likewise, Belyayev stated that his observers were not  allowed  access to polling stations; their work was allegedly interfered  with, and their rights were not explained to them. I would not  venture to maintain anything concerning all the observers of  Vladimir Aleksandrovich. However, by a strange coincidence, at  many of the city polling stations at which his comrades-in-arms  were [line(s) missing in the original]. By an equally strange  coincidence, both engaged in their activities without any  hindrance and even cooperated quite peaceably, helping each  other.    Esteemed voters, M. Rameyev also misleads you by maintaining  that Morozov allegedly came fourth in virtually all the  electoral precincts of Kirovskiy Rayon, but in total came in  second. I cannot speak about all the polling stations of the  rayon; however, according to the data obtained at precinct  commissions, at the polling stations attended by my observers I  came in first in two cases with a considerable lead, third in  one case, and fourth with an insignificant lag behind the second  and third positions in three cases. As you have already guessed,  in total I came in second.    I will not refer to other "trifles." However, I cannot  remain  silent concerning one fundamental aspect reflecting the spirit  of the press conference. As I see it, openly insulting  intonations with regard to voters, especially those in rural  rayons, were heard in the presentations of almost all of my  opponents. Some, as they put it, "old Tatars," forcibly herded  people into the polling stations and made them vote for the  candidate they indicated. I will not comment on these  statements, I am simply ashamed for those who think and talk  about people, about their fellow residents, so pejoratively.    [Signed] With sincere respect,    Oleg Morozov, political commentator of RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN</p>

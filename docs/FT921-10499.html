			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Japanese MPs threaten to hold up budget MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night faced increasing difficulties in securing the passage through the Diet of the 1992-93 budget after opposition demands for a parliamentary investigation into recent scandals. Opposition parties yesterday started a boycott of the Diet, refusing to take part unless the ruling Liberal Democratic party summoned witnesses to give evidence in connection with a bribery scandal allegedly involving Mr Fumio Abe, a former cabinet minister. They also demanded that an aide to Mr Miyazawa should give evidence about the prime minister's role in the 1988-89 Recruit scandal. Although he still has room for manoeuvre, Mr Miyazawa could be forced out of office if he fails to resolve the dispute. The government plans to have the budget passed through the lower house of the Diet by the end of the month. If it misses the deadline, ministers may have trouble winning approval of the upper house in time for the beginning of April, when the new budget takes effect. To make matters worse, the prime minister has been criticised for his gaffe in referring to Americans as lacking the 'work ethic' and for failing to deflect US criticism of Japanese trade practices. Mr Miyazawa also has to steer through the Diet controversial legislation allowing for despatch of Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions. He must also take a delicate decision on opening the rice market to help resolve the impasse in the Uruguay Round talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Even if he clears these hurdles, Mr Miyazawa could come under pressure over the LDP's apparent involvement in a third scandal - the Sagawa Kyubin affair. Sagawa Kyubin, a leading transport company, is being investigated by the public prosecutor's office for alleged links with a gangster organisation. There is said to be evidence the company made extensive donations to LDP leaders' campaign funds. Some of these donations are alleged to have been so large as to have been improper but the prosecutor's office has not aired evidence on this score. Mr Miyazawa's personal reputation could be at stake in the affair of Mr Abe, who was a close aide and secretary general of Mr Miyazawa's faction until last December. Mr Abe is accused of taking Y80m (Pounds 360,300) in bribes from Kyowa, a steel stockholding and property development company, in return for leaking planning information while he held government office in 1989-90. The opposition also wants to investigate details of how Mr Miyazawa accepted cut-price shares from Recruit, a publishing company which offered cheap stock to scores of politicians and other influential people. Mr Miyazawa, who was finance minister at the time of the scandal, resigned after his links became known. But opposition parties aim to embarrass him by seeking more information.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The making and adoption of  the Macao Basic Law is advantageous to the maintenance of  Macao's long-term social stability and economic development and  also a legal guarantee for Macao's bright future, a Chinese  official said here this afternoon.    Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office of the State Council, made these remarks at a  symposium held by the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.    With the adoption of the Basic Law, Chen said, the next  thing  to do is how to publicize the law, adding that it is not only  important to propagate the Basic Law in Macao, but also  important in China's mainland. It is favorable to the  implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems", he  pointed out.    He continued that in publicizing the Basic Law, every thing  to be done during the transitional period must be carried out in  convergence with the regulations of the Macao Basic Law.    He said he was convinced that Macao has a bright future, for  Macao has such a legal guarantee, support of the motherland,  good cooperation between the governments of China and Portugal  and the mass of patriotic compatriots.    At the invitation of the Association for Promotion of the  Macao Basic Law, a delegation led by Chen Ziying and Li Hou,  former deputy director of the Drafting Committee of the Macao  Basic Law, arrived here this morning for a four-day visit.</p>

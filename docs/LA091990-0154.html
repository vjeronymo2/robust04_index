			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NEW YORKERS SEE CASH IN TRASH  </P> <P> More than 100,000 New Yorkers are sniffing around for 2,000 jobs as sanitation  workers, smelling security in the city's mountains of garbage.  </P> <P> It's a record turnout of applicants for any city job, officials said today, and  at least one of them thinks he knows why.  </P> <P> "For somebody who likes the outdoors, it's a good, clean living," Sanitation  Department spokesman Vito Turso said. "You can build up your muscles, and then  get them tanned."  </P> <P> The pay is $23,104 per year to start, with the salary climbing to $35,000 after  five years. Add in overtime, and a likely raise with the next city contract,  and it's obvious that garbage can be golden. The Sanitation Department also  offers comprehensive benefits.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH COUNCIL VOTES TO KEEP BUT CHANGE ITS LOW-COST HOUSING LAW  </P> <P> A low-income housing law, which has been under attack from various quarters  since its inception last year, has narrowly survived another assault.  </P> <P> The City Council last week voted 5 to 4 to reject an effort to repeal the  ordinance, referring it instead to a committee for revisions.  </P> <P> The vote shocked a group of developers and some council members, who had  expected a council majority to scuttle the bill after a court had thrown out a  similar measure in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg, who led the effort to repeal the ordinance on the  grounds that it is illegal, vowed to carry on the battle in committee. "We'll  still repeal it," he said. "It will just take longer."  </P> <P> Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude, Tom Clark, Clarence Smith, Ray Grabinski and  Warren Harwood voted to send the issue to committee. Kellogg, Wallace  </P> <P> Harwood, who made statements favoring the repeal during Tuesday's meeting,  shocked colleagues by voting to refer the matter to committee. Mayor Ernie  Kell, described by Kellogg as one of the behind-the-scenes opponents of the  law, even asked Harwood whether he was sure about his vote. Harwood said he  was.  </P> <P> During a recess called minutes later, Kellogg threw up his arms as ordinance  foes scurried down the aisle to confer with him. "What happened?" asked Rich  Johnson, spokesman for the Long Beach Board of Realtors. "He must have pushed  the wrong (expletive) button!" Kellogg and Edgerton, red-faced and gesturing,  rushed up to Harwood after the vote. They said later that Harwood had  personally promised his support several times, including immediately before the  council met.  </P> <P> Housing activists were ecstatic, but equally dumbfounded. Alan Lowenthal,  president of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, put his hand to his heart. "I  don't know how it happened, but it's a victory," he said.  </P> <P> Harwood said he was swayed by public testimony. "Counting on my vote with much  certainty is not the best thing to do, because I'm listening to what's being  said," he said after the debate. "I heard testimony that said 'let's fix it.' "  </P> <P> Housing activists told the council that the court case is being used as an  "excuse" to destroy housing programs for the poor. Activists also argued that  the ordinance could be revised to comply with the ruling, rather than being  rescinding entirely.  </P> <P> "We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater," Lowenthal said.  </P> <P> The low-income housing law, also known as the city's one-for-one ordinance, was  passed last year by the City Council and went into effect in February. It  requires owners who demolish or convert low-income units to either replace them  with other low-cost housing or to pay compensation fees to the city, which are  to be put into a fund to build low-cost housing. The ordinance is the  cornerstone of the city's low-income housing program.  </P></p>

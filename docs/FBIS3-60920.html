			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Excerpt] A district court has sentenced a mainland Chinese  man to nine years in prison and his wife to six for hijacking a  mainland airliner to Taiwan last September.    The Taoyuan District Court meted out the prison terms for  taxi driver Yang Ming-te and his wife Pan Feng-ying after  finding them guilty of air piracy. The couple said that they  would appeal.    Judge Chiang Hsiao-pei said that the court showed leniency  to  Yang because he surrendered [words indistinct]. His wife  received the shorter term because she was only an accomplice,  Qiang added.    The couple could have been sentenced to death.    The couple armed with a knife and fake explosives brought  their son along when they hijacked the Russian-built Tupelov 154  run by the mainland Sichuan Airlines to Taiwan on September 30  and asked for political asylum.

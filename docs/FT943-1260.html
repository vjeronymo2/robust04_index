			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Back to our African Roots: The Nature of Things Lucy has lost her title as our oldest known ancestor. In her place are the Root family, who lived 4.4m years ago on the wooded highlands of east Africa. Some of this week's publicity about the discovery of 17 Root fossils in Ethiopia suggested that they were the long-sought 'missing link'. In fact they are not quite old enough to represent the putative ancestor of apes and humans; the evolutionary split between the two classes of primates is believed to have occurred at least 5m years ago. Even so, the anthropologists who discovered the new hominid species - officially named Australopithecus ramidus after the local Afar word 'ramid', meaning root - have given the study of human evolution its biggest boost since the 3.2m-year-old remains of Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) were found in the same area in 1978. Most of the Root fossils found so far are teeth and small fragments of bone, which had been chewed up and scattered around the Awash River site by scavenging animals. There is nothing to match the relatively complete skeletons of Lucy and her contemporary known as 'Son of Lucy'. The researchers - Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley; Gen Suwa of Tokyo University; and Berhane Asfaw of the Ethiopian Palaeonthropology Laboratory - have found pieces of skull and arm bones, but unfortunately no remains of hips, legs or feet. Without them, it is impossible to tell whether the Roots walked on two legs or four - or a bit of both. So the latest discovery takes us no closer to knowing when our ancestors came down from the trees and started walking upright. But there is a good chance that the anthropologists will soon turn up some bones from below the waist as they continue to scour the research site. What the fossils already tell us is that our ancestors 4.4m years ago were about the same size as the smallest contemporary forms of chimpanzee, or half as big as us. They had ape-sized heads and, presumably, ape-like mental abilities. Most of the technical analysis in this week's Nature paper describing A. ramidus as a new hominid species concerns its teeth, partly because these are the most plentiful remains and partly because dental evidence is conventionally important for primate taxonomy. The Roots' teeth are smaller than those of later Australopithecus species such as Lucy, though larger than modern human or chimp teeth. Their dental details are mainly intermediate between apes and the later hominids, as you would expect, though there are also some special features such as distinctive diamond-shaped canine teeth. A battery of geological and radio-isotope dating procedures - carried out on the hominid bones, other fossilised animal and plant remains, and the rocks around them - all point to a narrow age range between 4.3m to 4.5m years for the find. The evidence from the other fossils shows that the Awash site, now an arid semi-desert, was lush woodland when the Roots lived there. The researchers found thousands of fossilised seeds of forest trees and plentiful bones of tree-dwelling colobus monkeys. Although the proven facts about A. ramidus are very sparse, they can be combined with what is known about later hominids and modern apes, to give a reasonable speculative view of the Roots' lifestyle. They slept high up in the trees, for safety, and spent a lot of their waking life there too, eating leaves and fruit. Their strong arms and hands enabled them to swing through the branches, though with less speed and agility than a chimp. Sometimes, however, the Roots came down to the ground, to eat fallen fruit and to supplement their largely vegetarian diet by scavenging dead animals. They may even have banded together occasionally to hunt and kill animals. These hairy hominids probably did walk upright, at least for part of the time, but with a waddle that would have looked very different from today's human gait. If the Roots had ape-like minds, they may have picked up sticks and stones to use as primitive tools, for example to pick juicy insects out of crevices in tree trunks or smash open nuts. But they were not clever enough to fashion tools of their own by cutting sticks and stones into more useful shapes. We shall have to wait for the fossil hunters to find more extensive remains of the Roots to know how accurate this picture is and give some idea about their social structure. If the females turn out to be much smaller than the males - as was the case with Lucy and her menfolk - then it would be reasonable to conclude that dominant males competed for control of family groups. For now, the significance of the discovery is its confirmation of the view originally put forward by Charles Darwin, that the roots of human evolution would lie in Africa.</p>

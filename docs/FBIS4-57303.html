			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Freddy Torres] </F>   [Text] The debate begun in MAS as it prepares for the  party's national convention scheduled for 5 June is one big  question mark.    Why did the number of votes won by MAS in the 1993 elections  drop from 86,000 to 38,000 in Caracas and from 59,000 to 22,000  in Miranda? Why did the party lose nearly 200,000 votes between  1988 and 1993? Why did voters who cast their ballots for MAS in  1988 fail to do so this time? Party leader Hector Perez Marcano  is asking himself these very questions.    The debate will focus on alleged internal corruption,  bureaucracy, and the organization's pragmatism, according to  Moises Moleiro.    The Socialist leader claims that the ambiguity of the  Movement Toward Socialism's positions makes it impossible to  distinguish between MAS, Democratic Action (AD), and Copei  [Social Christian Party].    Moleiro says MAS's lack of political clarity was  demonstrated  on 4 February 1992, when the orange party yielded to the  position taken by Social Democratic and Social Christian leaders  defending the discredited government of Carlos Andres Perez.    In contrast, Rafael Caldera detected the causes of the  military uprising and stated that one could not ask the people  to come out in defense of a democracy that is starving the  people.    Moleiro recalled that following the riot on 4 February, a  committee was set up to review the position taken by MAS on such  a crucial chapter of history. The Socialist leader expressed his  discomfort because that committee pigeonholed the conclusions of  the work and thus rejected the debate that the majority of MAS  members were anxiously awaiting.    Moleiro, who ran for the presidency of MAS in past elections  and who now seems inclined to back Victor Hugo D'Paola's  candidacy for the office of secretary general of the party, thus  touches upon a sore point.    He says it is a matter of pure politicking or alliances of  convenience between MAS leaders and the representatives of  certain economic groups. Without sparing criticisms, he has  aimed his fire at Aragua Governor Carlos Tablante, whom he  accuses of accepting financial backing from an economic group  tainted by scandal.    He condemned the fact that in Aragua, the MAS ticket of  deputies was headed by Manuel Capriles, brother of Manases  Capriles, accused of the murder of Lorena Marquez.    He also criticized the fact that Capriles headed the list of  deputies from Aragua even though the Office of Comptroller  General had issued a report condemning his administration as  government secretary.    The observations defended by Moleiro, Rafael Thielem, Jorge  Valero, and Hector Perez Marcano include one concerning the  alleged rigging of the last internal election.    Moleiro says, in connection with "the selection of  candidates  for deputy from the state of Miranda in May of 1990, in  Barlovento alone, the winners gathered more votes than those  obtained by MAS in the 1993 national elections."    To the charge of election rigging, Perez Marcano adds that  of  improper leadership of the political organization.    Moleiro cites this factor as the reason why the party  increased its membership by a scant .5 percent in five years.    "If things continue in this fashion, it will take MAS 10  more  years to grow by one point," the Socialist leader figures. "If  everything remains the same, MAS will have to wait a century to  increase its votes by 10 percent," he warns.    The election stagnation experienced by MAS probably stems  from the fact that the party's national leadership has not  understood the changes that have occurred in Venezuela in recent  years, Perez Marcano points out.    "This explains why a party such as Cause R, which was tiny  in  January 1992, has leapfrogged over MAS, relegating us to fifth  place," Moleiro reflects.    "The reason why MAS lost its way seems to be its pragmatism  and the lack of clarity of the leadership headed by Freddy  Munoz, Moleiro claims.    In Perez Marcano's opinion, the ambiguity of MAS policies  has  prevented the organization from capturing voters abandoning AD  and Copei.    Reformers within MAS say that what is needed is a return to  the times when the party was essentially a critic and questioner.    This position has gained strength considering that MAS has  come to be a government party and that, if it is not careful, it  will become paralyzed, no longer a factor in social struggles.    This possible danger is a risk that MAS can ill afford  because it is a party that proclaims itself to be an alternative  force for change, some members of MAS believe.    "Without an in-depth debate that faces problems squarely and  includes all members, the effects may be irreparable," Moleiro  warns.    Manuel Isidro Molina, candidate for the office of secretary  general of MAS in Caracas, says the party should not shrink from  debate and that it would be impardonable if such issues were to  be discussed in secret meetings.    "Venezuelan society does not deserve to have political  parties debate the issues behind closed doors, particularly when  the other side is proclaiming that the aberrations and  distortions of Venezuelan democracy must be debated  democratically."    Teodoro Petkoff refuses to debate the crisis in MAS, arguing  that these are internal matters that should be discussed  privately.    Argelia Laya, president of the party, has also condemned the  position of those promoting a public discussion of MAS's  internal affairs.    Speaking from the critical faction, Rafael Thielem blames  MAS  Secretary General Freddy Munoz for the election stagnation  suffered by that political organization.    Munoz, who cannot be elected secretary general for more than  two terms because the statutes do not permit it, hopes to ascend  to the presidency in order to conceal his errors and back a man  he trusts for the office, his adversaries say.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In the first Majles session of the new year, the  generalities of the bill for health service insurance were  approved. [passage omitted]    Mr. Nateq-Nuri, who was chairing today's open session,  expressed good wishes for the new year and referred to the  guidance of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the leader of the  Islamic revolution, and his excellency's stress on work ethics  and social discipline and hoped that the Majles deputies,  government, and administrative officials will look sufficiently  towards a culture of labor and social discipline, and will work  for providing better services for the people.    Evaluating developments in the past year, the Majles speaker  said the expansion of Islamism and Islamization across the  world, in particular in the Islamic countries, were among the  political and social achievement of Muslims.    He referred to Serbian and Croatian crimes in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the massacre of Muslims at prayer in the  al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque by Zionists, and the silence and  indifference of international associations that claim the  defense of human rights as the bitter events of the past year,  and said that the destruction of the Zionist regime was the only  way of solving the Palestinian issue.</p>

Gazdik said the reason for this was Hofbauer's bad  performance, especially his callous approach to the removal of  bilingual road signs for towns and villages in southern Slovakia  and the termination by his ministry of an agreement with Radio  Free Europe to broadcast in Slovakia. He said that opposition  parties have discussed their course of action in connection with  Hofbauer's dismissal as they did in the case of former Health  Minister Viliam Sobona.    ADSR Deputy Chairman Rudolf Filkus told CTK that the broader  government coalition which Slovak President Michal Kovac pleaded  for in this New Year's address was a "precondition for the joint  resolution of the decisive questions in Slovak society."    He said it was not just empty talk that foreign capital was  waiting for unambiguous signals of political stabilisation in  Slovakia, and that the stability of the government was a  necessary step towards political stabilisation.    Filkus ruled out the possibility of forming a broader  government coalition under the leadership of the current Slovak  premier and chairman of the ruling Movement For a Democratic  Slovakia, Vladimir Meciar. He said the results of the 1992  parliamentary elections should be taken into consideration while  forming a new multi-party coalition. He also said a member of  the HZDS would be charged with forming a government in such an  event, and that current Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik or  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be the most appropriate  candidates.</p>

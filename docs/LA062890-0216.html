			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA HARDENS ITS POSITION ON ANTI-OBSCENITY PLEDGE;  </P> <P> ARTS: SOME CRITICS SAY THAT MAINTAINING THE RESTRICTION MAY MEAN CONTINUED  REJECTION OF GRANTS BY ANGRY ARTISTS AND GROUPS.  </P> <P> National Endowment for the Arts will retain a controversial requirement that  grantees sign an anti-obscenity pledge, despite the rejection, or threatened  rejection, of more than $1.3 million in 1990 grants.  </P> <P> The NEA and the Justice Department are drafting language to clarify the  obscenity guidelines, according to Julie Davis, the arts endowment's general  counsel, but she said the certification -- which some arts groups have called  the equivalent of an anti-obscenity loyalty oath -- will remain in place for  the rest of the 1990 fiscal year, which ends in October.  </P> <P> In New York, however, a representative of the New School for Social Research,  which has sued the NEA to force the rescinding of what critics contend is an  anti-obscenity oath, said that issuing guidelines without striking the  anti-obscenity language may not stem a continuing stream of rejection of NEA  money by enraged artists and arts organizations.  </P> <P> In a related development, a Senate committee canceled a scheduled Wednesday  meeting that was to finalize the Senate version of a bill extending the  legislative authorization of the NEA. The Senate Education and Labor Committee  now can not take the matter up until at least July 11.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the situation characterized the cancellation as  commonplace in the process of editing bills in committee. But these sources  said the decision to cancel the Wednesday morning session appeared to indicate  that negotiations among four senators central to the NEA debate were far from  producing a consensus proposal.  </P> <P> The four senators -- Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode  Island, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Orrin Hatch of Utah -- are attempting to  fashion a plan on such diverse issues as the wording of an expected restriction  on the kinds of art the NEA can support, and the length of the extension of the  endowment's lifetime, expected to be between one and five years.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the Senate negotiations said the talks are intended to  develop a bipartisan strategy for the NEA reauthorization bill. Kennedy and  Pell are moderate-to-liberal Democrats, while Kassebaum and Hatch are  moderate-to-conservative Republicans. Other sources characterized the  discussions as an attempt to solve the intense NEA political controversy --  anticipating expected opposition to any consensus approach by conservatives led  by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> The NEA's Davis made her comments in a Tuesday afternoon interview. It was one  of the first times a top NEA official has discussed the gravity of protest  among artists and arts groups that has led to rejection, or threatened  rejection, of grants by nine individuals or organizations, totaling $272,050.  </P> <P> In addition, UCLA and the University of California system disclosed last week  that top administrators are considering a proposal -- originated at UCLA -- for  the entire UC system to boycott NEA funding this year. The UC total could be as  much as $1.1 million. At least three Southern California arts institutions are  reported to be actively reviewing their postures on NEA grant acceptance.  </P> <P> "If we want to move toward a common resolution of this very difficult problem,  reason has to return to the discourse," Davis said. "One of the unfortunate  developments out of this whole controversy is that common sense has  evaporated."  </P> <P> Davis made the comments in the wake of the filing of court papers in the New  School lawsuit in New York that disclosed the NEA intends to issue obscenity  guidelines, not later than July 13 -- an attempt to clarify controversial  language inserted by Congress in the endowment's 1990 appropriation bill. The  language bars federal support for obscene work that does not meet high  standards for artistic merit.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Davis and NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer included the  wording of the law in the NEA's form grant letter and began to require grantees  to sign a certification that they would comply with the obscenity provision.  </P> <P> Davis said, however, that though the guidelines are being drafted, the  obscenity certification -- which has directly caused the spate of grant  rejections -- will not be rescinded. "It is my hope that some of the confusion  that has arisen (over the obscenity certification process) will be settled by  the issuance of these guidelines," Davis said.  </P> <P> The legislation including the obscenity wording only applies to 1990, though  most observers expect conservatives in Congress to push successfully for  restrictive language at least as strong as 1990's in both the 1991  appropriation bill and any version of NEA reauthorization that the House and  Senate may enact.  </P> <P> Davis acknowledged that nearly all applications for 1990 NEA grants have been  received and processed. But she said issuing the guidelines now -- nearly at  the end of the endowment's grant-making year -- was undertaken as a result of a  study of NEA procedures by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the  investigative arm of Congress. The GAO, acting at the request of Helms,  reviewed NEA grant-making procedures, exonerating the agency of charges it  funded obscene work this year, but suggesting several changes in endowment  procedures.  </P> <P> "Those individuals who say their rejection (of grants) is motivated solely by  inclusion (of the controversy obscenity language) miss the point, I believe,"  David said. "If I were to remove (the certification), the restriction would  still apply. This prohibition was intended to attach not only to funding  decisions by the NEA, but it was to follow the federal money once it goes out  of the endowment's door and is used by the grantees."  </P> <P> However, Davis' assertion was challenged by Floyd Abrams, a prominent New York  First Amendment lawyer who is representing the New School in its lawsuit  against the NEA. Abrams contended that Frohnmayer and Davis blundered  tactically when they decided to require written certification of the obscenity  language -- a step that, Abrams noted, the National Endowment for the  Humanities chose not to take.  </P> <P> Both the NEA and the NEH are governed by the same obscenity-control language  this year. The NEH has largely avoided being drawn into the increasingly  acrimonious protest movement. Abrams said the New School would probably  continue its lawsuit as long as the NEA obscenity certification requirement  remains in place.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Wednesday, he called the NEA and Justice Department  efforts to explain the obscenity language "a real step forward." But, Abrams  said, "What they should come out with is an abolition of a certification  requirement which was not compelled by Congress and which was imposed only as a  result of the NEA deciding that it should do so."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> Action on two key bills governing the National Endowment for the Arts resumes  when Congress returns from its traditional July 4 recess. Leaders of the House  -- where committee action is complete -- have tentatively scheduled a floor  vote on a bill to reauthorize the NEA for another five years either on July 12,  or during the following two weeks. In the Senate, committee action is expected  to conclude on July 11 or July 18, with a floor vote possible before the end of  the month, when Congress is scheduled to adjourn until after Labor Day. Because  the two versions of the bill are expected to be significantly different, a  conference committee will probably have to be convened to form a consensus -- a  step not expected until after Labor Day. Separately, action is pending on an  NEA appropriation bill for the 1991 fiscal year. House leaders expect votes on  the money measure to follow the reauthorization legislation. In the Senate, no  decision has been reached on timing of the appropriation bill.  </P> <P> REJECTED NEA GRANTS  </P> <P> Bella Lewitzky Dance Co.: $72,000  </P> <P> Ferne Ackerman, choreographer: $7,000  </P> <P> Oregon Shakespeare Fest.: $49,500  </P> <P> Paris Review: $10,000  </P> <P> Gettysburg Review: $4,550  </P> <P> N.Y.

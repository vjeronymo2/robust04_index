			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / As they say in Europe: Exciting times for the Swiss 'THE EXOTIC, mysterious land at the heart of Europe,' is not a slogan of the Swiss Tourist Board. Few would believe it because nobody takes the slightest interest in what is going on there. As a result there is a lack of awareness of the crisis which grips the country. Tomorrow there is the referendum on whether it should join the IMF and World Bank. Switzerland jostles with North Korea and Cuba for the honour of being the most important country outside the two institutions. If it enters it will be in the wake of such riff-raff of the international financial community as Azerbaijan. It would be joining at a time when the IMF is preparing to bankrupt itself in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the economies of the former Soviet Union. So why should a supposedly hardheaded banking nation enter at this juncture? It is essential, says the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, even though 'Switzerland needs no credits from the international community to build schools and hospitals and in the foreseeable future the franc will not be shaken by deficits and speculation.' That such a prospect can even be contemplated may shock outsiders but this is by no means shocking to a nation mired in a crisis of identity. The same edition of the NZZ used its front page as a vehicle for a study of where various European countries stood in the post-Maastricht debate penned by the editor-in-chief, Hugo Butler. The main item on page one of the NZZ is not necessarily the most interesting topic of the day, far from it. Yet the article was not without surprising twists. The headline tried to maintain standards: 'Between economic community, internal market and political union: Paths and cul-de-sacs in the European process,' but the agonising over what Switzerland should do about Europe provided the unexpected. 'The European problem facing Switzerland today is quite different from that of 1940. At that time it was a question of sheltering under the spines of the hedgehog and maintaining a free resistance in the Helvetic Redoubt against Hitler's dictatorial 'New Europe.'' It is astonishing that anyone ever made such a comparison with 1940. It seems the conventional picture of Switzerland needs some revision. Let us begin by returning to that unnecessarily firm denial that Switzerland needs World Bank money, and imagine that it is a very interesting country. Today, bookshops there are stacked with thick, best selling tomes with titles like Switzerland at the Crossroads: The Illusion and the Dilemma. Whatever the NZZ says, uncertainty runs deep for many reasons. A substantial portion of national income has been lost through the global war against drug-money laundering. There has been a savage reduction in the number of corrupt dictators who kept their hands in the national till and needed a safe haven to protect the proceeds. There is the Euro-threat to numbered accounts. The rate of inflation is higher than in Britain and the franc is weaker than the pound. The country is plunged in angst. So it was that the biggest Zurich paper, the Tages Anzeiger, carried a lengthy piece on 'Sullenness, suffering, pain, misery and disgust' on the city's trams. Jurg Rohrer studied personal relationships between passengers. The result provides a nightmare picture of a society in turmoil. 'General sullenness is the normal atmosphere in the tram. It eliminates the power of speech from the passengers the moment they enter; as a result there is no conversation on the tram. Sullenness demands no special cause, merely being in the rattling transport cage with its clammy hanging straps suffices, even without the dandruff on the nearby shoulders and the pungent perfume from under them.' That creates the right atmosphere for the sociological analysis: 'One person is sitting by the window. Another sits down in the next seat: Why beside me? The uneasiness which stems from the proximity of a stranger is expressed by turning the head away, but that brings other problems in its train when the tram is at a stop and another tram stands at the platform. It appears that everyone is caught in a frozen stare, for on the other side yet another stranger sits, thereby threatening eye contact through the windows. So all heads face sternly forward at tramstops, only to twist towards the window at the moment of departure. The measure of the unease on the double seats can be seen in the speed with which the victims flee to any single seat that becomes available.' The fear and horror of life on the Zurich tramway system is of course merely a metaphor for life in contemporary Switzerland. The times are changing. Even so their fellow middle-Europeans, the Viennese, still sneer: 'Our central cemetery is twice the size of Zurich, and twice the fun.'                              *      *      * Nezavisimaya Gazeta of Moscow asked the American economist, Igor Berman, to characterise the state of the Russian economy. 'The situation is hopeless,' replied the distinguished visitor. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

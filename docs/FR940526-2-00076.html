SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;01 and SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;94&hyph;01) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Notice of the proposals appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on March 3, 1994, to solicit comment from interested persons. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  No comments were received by the Commission.

Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Cross-Netting Under Previous Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under OCC and ICC rules, a joint clearing member ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a clearing member which is a clearing member of both OCC and ICC) may elect to cross-net its OCC exercise and assignment settlement obligations in OCC-cleared foreign currency options (``OCC obligations'') with its delivery obligations in ICC-cleared foreign currency futures (``ICC obligations'') on the same foreign currency. Cross-netting occurs when OCC obligations settle on a date that also is a delivery date for ICC obligations. Because such dates coincide only one day each month, cross-netting is performed only one day each month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previously, a joint clearing member that had elected to settle by cross-netting selected either OCC or ICC as its designated clearing organization (``DCO'') and settled its cross-netted obligations with its DCO in accordance with the rules of the DCO. (OCC and ICC have virtually identical rules regarding the settlement of foreign currency obligations.) The DCO, in turn, performed its ordinary clearance and settlement activities and acted as agent for the other clearing organization in settling the cross-netted obligations. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a more detailed description of cross-netting, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24781 (August 6, 1987), 53 FR 30268 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;86&hyph;14]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agreement by one clearing organization to act as agent for the other was contained in the Mutual Agency Agreement for Foreign Currency Settlement (``Mutual Agency Agreement'') between OCC and ICC. The Mutual Agency Agreement set forth the rights and obligations of OCC and ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements and the effect of the default of a joint clearing member on such rights and obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Cross-Netting Under Newly Approved Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICC no longer desires to be a cross-netting DCO; therefore, OCC and ICC are eliminating the ability of a joint clearing member to select ICC as a DCO. These rule changes will have no effect: (1) On the basic procedures under which cross-netted obligations are settled or (2) upon any joint clearing member because no joint clearing member currently or has ever selected ICC as its cross-netting DCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To accomplish the rule changes, OCC and ICC are amending OCC Rule 1605(c) and ICC Rule 1205(c). The two rules deal with the cross-netting of foreign currency obligations and are being modified to state that henceforth joint clearing members can only designate OCC to act on their behalf with respect to cross-netting settlement. OCC and ICC also are deleting from OCC By-Laws Article XV, Section 1 and from ICC Rule 1202 the term and definition of ``designated clearing organization.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC and ICC are replacing the existing Mutual Agency Agreement with the Agreement for Cross-Netting Foreign Currency Settlements (``Cross-Netting Agreement''). The Cross-Netting Agreement, which is based on the Mutual Agency Agreement, has been drafted by OCC and ICC to implement the above-described rule changes. Specifically, the Cross-Netting Agreement provides that: (1) OCC and ICC will furnish a form notice by which a joint clearing member may elect to cross-net its OCC and ICC obligations and which will provide that only OCC will effect the cross-netted settlements; (2) OCC agrees to act as agent for ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements with a joint clearing member; and (3) neither OCC nor ICC will change its rules relating to the margining and to the settling of foreign currency obligations without the consent of the other. The Cross-Netting Agreement also sets forth settlement, default, indemnity, and termination procedures. Those procedures are basically unchanged from the Mutual Agency Agreement except for modifications made to reflect that only OCC can effect cross-netted settlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. The proposed modifications to the OCC and ICC rules, in essence, eliminate a cross-netting option that has never been used. Accordingly, the rule changes should have no significant effect on either OCC's or ICC's ability to safeguard securities or funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly those of section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,  <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  that the above-mentioned proposed rule changes (File Nos.

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Oh what a difference a century makes / A look back to a time when the world was Britain's trading oyster.  But that was 100 years ago ONE HUNDRED years ago, Britain had its own single market. It was called the world. Accounting for 35 per cent of international trade in manufactured goods, the UK in 1893 ruled the waves of global commerce. A large deficit in merchandise trade was habitually more than offset by a healthy surplus in 'invisibles' - exports of services, and remittances from assets abroad. Between the battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the outbreak of the first world war, it chalked up a current account surplus - normally of the order of Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m - in every year except 1827, 1840 and 1847. In 1892, when Britain registered a visible trade deficit of Pounds 95m (and a current account surplus of Pounds 57m), roughly 40 per cent of British exports and imports represented transactions with the rest of Europe. During the last 100 years (particularly since EC membership in 1973), trade has shifted strongly towards Europe. In the first nine months of 1992, Britain ran a trade deficit of Pounds 14.5bn. Last year 56 per cent of British exports, and 52 per cent of imports, were transacted with the rest of the EC. Counting countries outside the EC, western Europe accounted for about 63 per cent of both imports and exports last year. What a difference a century makes] In 1892 Britain's trade with India exceeded that with Germany by about 10 per cent. Last year, British exports to Germany were 15 times those to India, while imports from Germany were 23 times larger than Indian ones. Nearly half of all Britain's imports in 1892 were foodstuffs and livestock. The trade returns for that year read like a colonial warehouse catalogue: grain and flour, sugar, tea, meat, butter and margarine were among the main items purchased from abroad. Britain bought 4.4m cwt of wheat from Russia, worth Pounds 1.47m; 392,679 cwt of oxen from the US, worth Pounds 7.5m, and 671,882 cwt of bacon from Denmark, costing Pounds 1.9m. Australia had already started its marketing campaign for wines: the UK bought 461,007 gallons, valued at Pounds 80,551. But the 1892 drinks trade was then, as now, dominated by the Continent. The British purchased 4.2m gallons of French red wines (Pounds 989,859) and 1.6m gallons of higher-value French whites (Pounds 1.9m). Raw materials and non-manufactured goods made up most remaining imports. Apart from raw cotton, timber, wool, tobacco and hides, Britain bought in large quantities of more exotic items. On the import list for 1892 were 11.5 cwt of ivory, worth Pounds 559,073, and 27.8 tonnes of guano manure, setting back the nation Pounds 189,433. Victorian industrial power is summed up in the figure for imports of machinery in the 1892 trade figures: nil. On the export side, cotton goods made up about one quarter of all sales, followed by woollen goods, iron and steel, coal, machinery and chemicals. At the beginning of 1893, Britain's trading performance looked strong. Yet there were still complaints. 'There is not very much that can be called satisfactory in a review of the trade of the past year,' moaned The Economist in its issue of January 14 1893, recording that in many categories exports and imports had shown declines in the year just passed. If not exactly an annus horribilis, 1892 turned out to have been a year of recession, with modern estimates putting the decline in gross domestic product at about 2.6 per cent. Britain was the world's sole mercantile superpower. Hindsight has confirmed what should, even then, have been obvious. The UK faced only one direction: gradually, though remorselessly, towards 100 years of relative economic decline.</p>

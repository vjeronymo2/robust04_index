			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Sovereign People Should Not Be Forgotten </F> in the Process of Creating New Administration"]    [Text] If you look at it as a slapstick comedy, it may be  quite interesting. But this becomes unbearable when you realize  that this is the process of creating the next administration.  While the factional struggle seen in the election of the party  president, hence, the prime minister, during the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] era was indeed repulsive, the people are  certainly amazed at the present turmoil among the ruling  coalition parties, particularly because this came after the  Hosokawa administration, which upheld "new politics."    The ruling parties have not even been able to decide the  venue for discussions to select the next prime minister.  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New  Party [JNP] insist that the issue should be discussed at the  "representatives meeting" composed of secretary general-level  party representatives. On the other hand, leaders of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party  [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] assert that this should be  decided at a "party leaders meeting." Both sides refuse to  compromise.    The leaders of Shinseito, Komeito, and the JNP did not  attend  the party leaders meeting initiated by SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama on 11 April. The basic reason is: While Shinseito and  Komeito want to make the new Diet grouping "Kaikaku" [Reform]  the center of activities to realign political parties, the SDPJ  and Sakigake are strongly critical of the idea.    Behind the SDPJ and Sakigake's opposition is their antipathy  to the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary  general said to be the strong man in the ruling parties. The  present pattern of balance of forces is exactly the same as that  during the upheaval relating to the cabinet reshuffle--said to  be aimed at "getting rid of [Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi]  Takemura"--last February. Shinseito and its allies are working  hard to attract former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe to  their camp to cut off the SDPJ, Sakigake, and their allies, and  cooperate with a section of the LDP to maintain their hold on  the administration.    On the other hand, the opposition LDP is aiming at  recapturing political power by working with the SDPJ and  Sakigake. Maneuvers to form cross alliances transcending the  existing political framework of LDP versus non-LDP forces are  being attempted beneath the surface. Despite the oft-repeated  claim that "agreement in policy will be the basis of forming a  government," in reality, top priority is being given to the  question of how to maneuver to become the ruling party.    The Hosokawa administration quickly lost its sense of unity  after the passage of the political reform bills. Thus, the  collapse of the government was merely a matter of time all  along. Yet, the ruling coalition parties simply focused their  energy on emotional bickering, without preparing fully for the  creation of a new administration.    The same is true for the opposition LDP. It is quite at a  loss at the sudden collapse of the administration. One cannot  even feel the LDP's ardor in putting up its president, Yohei  Kono, as a candidate to recapture the political regime.    There are numerous urgent issues facing Japan, such as  economic stimulation, tax reform, Japan-U.S. relations, and the  situation on the Korean peninsula. For one thing, the draft  1994 budget has not even passed deliberations by the lower house  Budget Committee. Yet, we see no sense of urgency in efforts to  form a new government.    The people will be totally disgusted if the next  administration is formed solely by the logic of numbers. The  people should be able to see what the basis of the new  administration will be, and the process of who makes the  decision, and where this decision is made.    When the Hosokawa administration was inaugurated, the people  were in the dark as to why it was Hosokawa, and who made the  decision. The formation of a government is a most vital  political decision. True political reform precisely consists of  making this process open for all to see as much as possible.</p>

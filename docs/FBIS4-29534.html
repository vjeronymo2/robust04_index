			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chae-mok] </F>   [Text] Signs of disagreement are emerging between the ROK  and the United States in fine-tuning their policies to solve  North Korea's nuclear issue.    It is obvious that the United States has begun mapping out a  policy of "offensive negotiations" on the basis of the result of  "the Carter-Kim Il-song talks." In contrast, our government is  taking pains to downgrade the significance of the result of  Carter's visit to the North, merely repeating its previous  attitude of pushing for both "dialogue and sanctions."    When U.S. President Clinton's "willingness to hold  high-level  North-U.S. talks" was made public on 17 June, the officials who  are deeply involved in the government's policy-making process  did not hide their displeasure. They said: "We do not know why  the United States has made public its `willingness to have  talks' so early without officially confirming President Kim  Il-song's remarks." The officials expressed their concern by  stating: "The United States seems to be attempting to seek a  turnaround in its domestic political situation by heightening  the dramatic effects of its efforts to solve North Korea's  nuclear issue. The United States needs, first, to closely  examine if North Korea is possibly using tactics to gain time."    Our government continues to be agonizing over that it is  neither easy nor reasonable to refute U.S. logic for "resuming  talks."    It seems that our government's passive attitude originates  from President Kim Yong-sam's "remarks consistently calling for  sanctions against the North" and "his cynical attitude to  Carter's visit to the North." Recently, President Kim  determinedly stated: "There is no way to solve North Korea's  nuclear issue other than sanctions." He has expressed his strong  displeasure several times by stating: "The Kim Il-song regime  will likely make bad use of Carter's visit to the North." As  the strongly worded remarks by the head of state are still  vividly remembered, it is not easy to highly appraise Carter's  "go-between efforts" or to apply logic to a change to a dialogue  phase.    At first, our government had asked that Carter's visit to  the  North be held in abeyance. Rejecting this, the United States  notified our government that "he is visiting the North in a  private capacity and is not carrying any official message from  the U.S. Government."    This notwithstanding, as soon as the result of the  Carter-Kim  Il-song talks were made public on 16 June, U.S. President  Clinton convened an emergency meeting and even issued "a special  statement." Of course, before issuing the statement, the U.S.  Government tried to save the ROK Government's face by going  through the formality of making prior consultations via  telephone talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the early morning of 17  June [Korean time].    It is highly likely that the U.S. Government has also  conveyed its position to North Korea through former President  Carter that UN Security Council debate on sanctions against the  North will be discontinued in case talks between North Korea and  the United States resume. It would not be realistic to continue  both dialogue and UN Security Council debate on sanctions at the  same time. Of course, the U.S. Government immediately denied  the news reports that former President Carter said that UN  Security Council debate on sanctions will be discontinued if  conditions are met. The prevailing opinion, however, is that  this was aimed at relieving the ROK Government's embarrassment.    It has now been learned that the United States is studying  in  an affirmative manner the question of upgrading the high-level  talks as requested by President Kim Il-song through Carter.  Therefore, it seems that the dialogue between the North and the  United States will proceed at a high pace. If the ROK  Government continues to fuss about its delayed involvement in  dealing with this issue, it will further be left out in the cold  in North-U.S. negotiations.</p>

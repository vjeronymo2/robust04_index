			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO DEFENSE TAKES COMMAND;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: MISSION VIEJO A VICTORY AWAY FROM OUTRIGHT LEAGUE TITLE AFTER  STUFFING EL TORO'S RUNNING ATTACK TO WIN, 21-9.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo High School's defense beat El Toro, 21-9, before an overflow  crowd of 8,000 at Mission Viejo Friday with the South Coast League title on the  line.  </P> <P> The operative word here is beat.  </P> <P> "This win will go down in Diablo lore," said Mike Rush, Mission Viejo coach.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo stuffed El Toro's running game and even managed to slow its  passing attack. Except for a touchdown on its first series, El Toro managed  only a safety.  </P> <P> The victory puts Mission Viejo (8-1, 4-0 in league play) a victory away from  the outright league championship and means the Diablos will be the top-seeded  team from the South Coast League.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo also could take over the county's No. 1 ranking next week. El  Toro (8-1, 3-1) had been top-ranked since the season started.  </P> <P> If you throw out that first drive, El Toro seemed like a discouraged team for  most of the showdown.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo could thank Bill Denny, a strong safety who plays more like a  linebacker, and Beau LeBreton, a defensive end, for that.  </P> <P> The two seemed to be in El Toro's backfield constantly, either slamming a  running back to the turf or pressuring quarterback Rob Johnson.  </P> <P> LeBreton had three sacks and swatted away a key third-down pass on the Mission  Viejo 17-yard line late in the game. It was one of many times El Toro drove  deep into Mission Viejo territory but came away without scoring.  </P> <P> "We knew what we had to do . . . shut down Rob, shut down (running back Bret)  Sanders, make the big plays and execute," LeBreton said.  </P> <P> It all worked flawlessly.  </P> <P> In the second half, Mission Viejo:  </P> <P>  -- Held El Toro on downs at the Mission Viejo five.  </P> <P>  -- Intercepted a Johnson pass at its own 36.  </P> <P>  -- Stopped El Toro twice more on downs before game's end.  </P> <P> "I think I'd have to credit their defense," said Bob Johnson, El Toro coach.  "They stopped us when they had to. This is a tough loss for us. Real tough."  </P> <P> Tim Snowden, Mission Viejo quarterback, threw touchdown passes to three  different receivers as the Diablos led, 21-7, at halftime.  </P> <P> After Johnson hit Darren Doalson with a simple screen pass that turned into a  19-yard touchdown play, Snowden got hot.  </P> <P> He completed a four-yard lob to Doug Roberson with 3:41 left in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, he completed touchdown passes of 24 yards to Denny and  14 yards to Anthony Ramirez.  </P> <P> After halftime, Mission Viejo turned the game over to its defense. The Diablos  didn't plan it that way; it just happened.  </P> <P> Snowden completed 11 of 20 passes for 133 yards to Johnson's 16 for 31 for 215  yards and one interception. Snowden came into the game completing 68.4% of his  passes; Johnson 71.4%.  </P> <P> "I told the kids last week that they were special," Rush said. "We've dwelled  on that. Nobody thought much of us at the beginning of the year."  </P></p>

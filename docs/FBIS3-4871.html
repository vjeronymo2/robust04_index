			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kyoto University Associate Professor Hiroshi </F> Nakanishi: "The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in the Post-Cold War  Period: The Cornerstone of Regional Security"]    [Text] The U.S.-Japan relationship is one of the most  important bilateral relationships in the world, and the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is the cornerstone of this  relationship. In this thesis, I will use the general term  "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" for the cooperative relationship  concerning the security of the United States and Japan, which is  based upon the so-called old security treaty and the current  security treaty. This has not changed even following the end of  the Cold War. But the environment surrounding the  cornerstone--the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty--has greatly changed  in the post-Cold War era. Responding to this change, the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should change its nature. Compared  to the Cold War era when security was a global concern, regional  security issues are gaining importance in the post-Cold War  world. Therefore, determining what part it should play in  relation to regional security problems will be an important key  for the future of the U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty. I want to  analyze the functions of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in the  Cold War era and to discuss the role the U.S.-Japan Security  Treaty should fulfill for the security of the Asia-Pacific  region in the future.  <H5>  Four Functions of U.S.-Japan Security Treaty </H5>   When we hear the term U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, we tend to  think of defense cooperation issues between the United States  and Japan. Certainly that is the core of the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty. But security matters today should be  understood to include the economic prosperity of the people.  Also, because the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has made bilateral  cooperation possible in a wide area, including the political and  economic spheres, it is significant for these two countries. I  will divide the functions of the treaty into four groups,  analyze each function during the Cold War era, and discuss the  role each should fulfill in terms of regional security.  <H5>  (1) Maintenance of Economic Cooperation Relationship </H5>   For the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, cooperation in economics  is an important pillar. Article 2 of the current security  treaty provides that "the parties will contribute toward the  further development of peaceful and friendly international  relations by strengthening their free institutions.... They  will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic  policies, and will encourage economic collaboration between  them." Also, in the old security treaty, although there was no  prescribed article, policies the United States adopted to  promote Japanese economic self-sufficiency--such as market  opening for Japan, support for Japanese entrance into GATT,  support for economic exchange between Southeast Asia and Japan,  and so on--reflected the fundamental policy of economic  cooperation between the United States and Japan. Japan had also  chosen the West's free economic system to bring about the  recovery of the Japanese standard of living after the war. When  the old security treaty was concluded, the basis of Prime  Minister Yoshida's judgment was his conviction that Japan's  recovery was possible only within a Western framework, mainly of  the United States and Great Britain. Even after Japanese export  competitiveness became strong, and economic friction between  Japan and other advanced capitalist countries had begun, the  common objective of the "solidarity of the West" contained this  friction within a controlled framework during the Cold War.  After the "oil shock," platforms such as summits were erected,  and a posture of solving economic issues by cooperation was  adopted. This resulted from the recognition of the necessity  for Western unity against the East.    Today the combined U.S.-Japan GNP accounts for about 40  percent of the world's total GNP, so continued economic  cooperation by these two countries is indispensable for world  stability. But in international politics, it is not easy for  two strong counties to cooperate. Since the fall of the Soviet  Union and East European communism, the importance of economic  strength in international politics is recognized. It is  possible that economically strong countries will become more  conscious of each other as rivals. We cannot be too optimistic  about future economic cooperation between the United States and  Japan. This tendency will become more pronounced since the goal  of "Western unity" disappeared when the Cold War ended. The  argument that "Japan is different"--which was popular a while  ago--may be seen as one of the indications of such a trend.    But when sights are shifted from the Cold War context of  the "West" to the context of the Asia-Pacific region, economic  cooperation between the United States and Japan has new  significance. The ministers conference/unofficial leadership  conference by APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) held in  Seattle last November revealed how importantly economic  prosperity is viewed in the Asia-Pacific region. There were  certainly some differences of view about the way in which  concrete economic cooperation should be achieved, as seen in the  absence from the leadership conference of Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahatir. But recognition that each country's own  economic development is vital, and as a precondition that an  open economic system is necessary, are becoming common ideas in  each country within the region. Chinese President Jiang Zemin  attended the leadership conference, along with representatives  from Taiwan and Hong Kong. This symbolizes how much importance  the Asia-Pacific countries place on economics. Such  strengthened recognition that a peaceful international  environment is necessary for each country's own economic  development could become a useful tool in securing future peace  in the Asia-Pacific region. In such a case, it will also be  indispensable for regional security that the two economic  powers--the United States and Japan-- maintain a relationship of  economic cooperation.    Looking at it in another way, we can point out that an  expanded Asia-Pacific economy will make U.S.-Japan economic  cooperation easier. First, by the expanded economy in this  region, the two countries' economic relationship will shift from  a "zero-sum" to a "plus-sum" situation. Both countries need  markets to maintain employment and capital investment to  maintain competitiveness. Under such circumstances, the most  promising way to benefit the two countries today would be to  expand their market in the Asia-Pacific region, and at the same  time transfer funds and technology through investment and  assistance. Second, it is possible the different economic  structures within the United States and Japan could be  reinterpreted as representing "diversity" for the region. This  contains a more positive connotation. Post-war economic  development was based on a horizontal trade structure among  developed countries. But for the economic development of the  Asia-Pacific countries, differences of contributing  conditions--such as natural resources, technology, population,  and so on--are providing the dynamism. In such circumstances,  it may be rather desirable for the region if there are two  different approaches, namely that of the United States which  values the open market and investment opportunities, and that of  Japan which values social stability.    In essence, to maintain U.S.-Japan economic cooperation by  its becoming a precondition for regional economic prosperity  will result in fulfilling its role of promoting regional  security. It also has the reciprocal benefit that regional  prosperity will make U.S.-Japan cooperation easier.  <H5>  (2) Offering a Political Framework </H5>   One of the pillars of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was to  oppose the Communist political structure, to point the direction  of liberal democratic political structures, and to cooperate for  strengthening such efforts. The characteristics of this  security treaty meant the Japanese political direction was kept  within the "Western" framework, which was formed during the Cold  War with the United States as the leader. To be in this  framework brought Japan a number of benefits. First, by leaving  the political leadership of international society to Europe and  the United States, and by concentrating on economic prosperity,  it was possible to avoid domestic political confrontation.  Prime Minister Ikeda's policy of doubling income is one good  example. Second, Japanese participation in the Western  framework also made Japan's return into international society  easier. For instance, the ANZUS [Australia-New Zealand- United  States] Treaty concluded in 1951 was the price the United States  paid to gain support from Australia and New Zealand for a U.S.  peace treaty with Japan. As a matter of fact, in the preamble  of this treaty it was mentioned that U.S. forces would be  stationed in and around Japan, as well as in the Philippines and  the Ryukyus (as they were referred to at that time). In other  words, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was a kind of guarantee  the United States gave to other Asia-Pacific countries that  Japan would not depart from the Western framework, and was a  part of the framework which permitted the post-war Japanese  return to the international scene.    Of course we cannot deny there was another aspect. That was  the feeling that, in exchange for a peace treaty, Japan was  brought into the order of the "West," of which the United States  was the leader. This created dissatisfaction in the Japanese  psyche of self-pride. The revision of the treaty carried out  under the Kishi Cabinet aimed at satisfying the Japanese sense  of independence by using the term "U.S.-Japan on an equal  footing." The reversion of Okinawa, achieved by the Sato  Cabinet, was done to satisfy the self-pride of the Japanese  people. Also, the negative reaction Japanese displayed a few  years ago when the U.S. Marine Corps commander in Okinawa  reportedly described the significance of the U.S. forces in  Japan as a "cap on the bottle" which prevented Japanese  remilitarization, seemed from a Japanese perspective to be  another confirmation that the United States still maintained the  leadership.    In fact, when we analyze the history of the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty, there are more than a few occasions when the  United States made concessions to Japan. Despite the fact that  the size of the Japanese Self-Defense Force in the 1950's was  far smaller than what was required by the United States, Japan  was able to receive American aid. As for Okinawa, Japan's  "residual sovereignty" was recognized at the time of the peace  treaty. At the time of Okinawa's reversion, Japan maintained  its condition of "no nuclear weapons, the same as on the  Japanese mainland." But because the stationing of U.S. forces  has continued since the occupation, the original image the  Japanese had of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty does not seem to  have changed much.    Moreover, when the relative economic strength of the United  States and Japan approached parity, unhappiness both inside and  outside the country increased because Japan would not seek to  make politically oriented statements. When Japan was expected  to shoulder burdens in the security field corresponding to its  economic strength, domestic political decisions also became  necessary. Other countries have also come to feel uneasy  because Japan, which has a large economy, does not clarify its  political positions. The system of dividing the work--politics  by the United States and economics by Japan--lacks rationality,  and the political role which Japan should play is beginning to  become an issue. Since the end of the Cold War, the "Western"  framework is losing its significance, so it is possible this  trend may be further strengthened.    Naturally, it is desirable that Japan actively express its  political position. But it should not be regarded as a  bilateral issue between the United States and Japan--i.e., the  recovery of self-rule from the United States. As stated  earlier, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty contained another side  to begin with. This treaty was in a sense a tacit multinational  treaty. To let Japan return to the international community, the  United States indirectly acted as proxy for demands made by  other countries toward Japan, Asia-Pacific countries in  particular. The structure in which the United States acted as  the coordinator among the countries in the region was rational  because of the Cold War context and the scale of the hegemony  the United States held in the Pacific Ocean area. But today the  Asia-Pacific countries have the ability to speak out  internationally for themselves, so the Japanese political role  should be discussed in the context of a regional multinational  framework which includes both the United States and Japan. For  instance, the "ASEAN Regional Forum," the establishment of which  was agreed on at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference  held last July, would be an appropriate place for dialogue. In  such a place, the presence of the special cooperative  relationship between the United States and Japan would  strengthen Japan's voice. Albeit desiring an American presence  in the Pacific, many Asian nations resist any special  relationships as regards security. Their ideas are also  different from American ideas on human rights and political  systems. While guaranteeing to these countries that it would  not go back to the prewar structure by maintaining its bilateral  relationship with the United States, Japan can help convey Asian  thinking to the United States. Japan should work to create the  concept of a new political framework which would replace the  "West" through a multinational dialogue of Asia-Pacific  countries.  <H5>  (3) Preservation of a Secure International Environment </H5>   For the stability of international society, the maintenance  of minimum order is necessary to guarantee the security of  transactions/negotiations among nations. During the Cold War,  the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty provided a certain order in the  region in the form of ensuring American presence in the  Asia-Pacific. Especially for a maritime nation such as Japan,  it was significant that security of the seas where national  jurisdiction did not extend was guaranteed by the United States.  U.S. bases in Japan and the Japanese Government's support for  them made the U.S. presence in the Pacific easier; that in turn  guaranteed Japan's security for its international traffic, from  the Pacific-Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Of course it  was a policy based upon America's own interests to secure  control of the sea in the Pacific since, an interest dating back  to the days of Admiral Mahan. But the maritime peace secured by  the United States meant that Japan, which had chosen the road  which led to economic prosperity through international trade,  could enjoy a favorable environment.    As the Soviet Union strengthened its Far East Fleet  beginning  in the latter half of the 1970's, Japan took charge of the  defense of the sea lanes extending 1000 nautical mile from  Japanese coastal waters. This took the form of defense sharing  with the United States.    This sharing by geographic division was made in response  to the Cold War. The reason was at that time Soviet naval  forces were the only possible potential threat to the sea lanes  in the Asia-Pacific region. It was believed the Soviet Union  would attack the sea lanes in Japanese coastal waters should it  decide on a world war, and would attempt a naval blockade  against the entire West, including the United States and Japan,  as Germany did during the First and Second World Wars.  Therefore it was believed there was a strong possibility an  attack against U.S. and Japanese vessels would occur  simultaneously. In such a case, the defensive action Japan  would take within 1000 nautical miles of Japanese coastal  waters, by asserting its right of self-defense, would connect  with America's securing the sea lanes beyond 1000 nautical miles.    Now that the Cold War has ceased and Soviet naval power has  been drastically reduced, there is no longer any nation which  could conduct a naval blockade in opposition to U.S. maritime  domination. But in addition to the decline of Soviet naval  forces, there is an important factor which changed the  environment surrounding the waters of the Asia-Pacific. First,  many countries in this region started strengthening their sea  and air defenses because of their increased dependency on  international trade. Second, with the end of the Cold War, the  arms market has become a buyers' market. For countries with  smaller economies, it has become easier to improve their naval  and air forces with equipment which had been difficult to  purchase earlier. Recently, the Chinese are reported to be  strengthening their naval power. Not only China, but Taiwan and  other Southeast Asian countries attach importance to  strengthening naval and air power. Third, the United Nations  Treaty on Law of the Sea was concluded in 1982. As a  consequence, each nation's maritime jurisdiction has expanded  beyond the previous three-nautical-mile limit. To protect these  maritime rights and interests, the improvement of naval and air  power has become necessary. The confrontation surrounding the  Spratley Islands in the South China Sea is one issue which has  been increasing in importance. In other words, while the  possibility of a total maritime war between the United States  and the Soviet Union has disappeared, the number of countries  which possess small to medium maritime and air power is  increasing. This situation itself is not necessarily dangerous,  but neither can we positively say the Pacific Ocean has become a  "peaceful body of water."    In the Pentagon report to Congress entitled "Strategic  Framework in the Asia-Pacific Rim," which was submitted during  the Bush administration, it is stated the United States would  expect in the post-Cold War era that Japan would continue its  commitment of defending sea lanes for 1000 nautical mile. But  will coordination of roles in maritime security, rather than  geographic divisions, become more important? As I mentioned  earlier, considering the overwhelming nature of America's  current maritime supremacy, staving off regional strife and  avoiding danger to ships and aircraft resulting from strife,  rather than securing sea lanes, will become the issue. To  handle this issue, the overwhelming American naval power  maintains its presence as the power ultimately responsible for  preserving maritime order and also as balance for the region.  At the same time, it is conceivable that in the realm of  patrol/maritime surveillance, the purpose of which is primarily  to maintain maritime safety in peacetime, countries such as  Japan and Australia could share the task while fulfilling their  international roles. Naturally, issues such as the maintenance  of maritime safety in peacetime need to be dealt with through  multinational cooperation and understanding. Moreover, in  important regions for international sea routes--such as the  South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca--Japan should make  diplomatic efforts so adjacent countries can make progress on  confidence building and on arms control concerning maritime and  air power. To produce multinational security cooperation in the  Asia-Pacific region where the consciousness of independence and  national defense is strong, all sorts of difficulties must be  overcome. But the maintenance of maritime traffic safety must  be a common interest for the region, so efforts should be made  to accumulate cooperation wherever possible.    To build up the regional security framework described above,  support for U.S. forces stationed in Japan should continue in  the future. But as for its significance, a new way of looking  at it will be necessary. In the past, the thinking was strong  in Japan that "in return for letting Americans use the bases we  will have them protect Japan." But we should rather take the  position of supporting U.S. forces stationed here as a  contribution to the security of the Asia-Pacific region.  <H5>  (4) Defense of Japanese Territory </H5>   The core role of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is that the  United States and Japan are to jointly defend Japanese territory.    The characteristic point of the defense of Japan during the  Cold War was that it became part of the greatest bipolar  military structure in the world intended to deter an offense by  the East against the West. In other words, fundamentally it can  be said that deterring an attack on Japan was important for the  defense of the entire Western world, and the degree of Japanese  defensive strength was regarded in the context of how it would  strengthen the deterrent power of the West as a whole.    According to the "DEFENSE PLAN OUTLINE" produced in 1976,  the  objective of Japanese defensive strength was to independently  eliminate a "limited and small" aggression. This was based on  an analysis of the situation that "due to the balance in  military strength, which includes mutual deterrence of nuclear  arms and various efforts for stabilization of international  relations, there is little possibility for a comprehensive  military clash or major armed struggle which could trigger such  clashes." Naturally, the actual defense against a minor  aggression in case deterrence failed was also an objective of  the outline. It seems that in the basic position of the  Japanese defense policy, the emphasis was placed on deterring  aggression against Japan by contributing to an increase in the  West's deterrent ability--with American strategic nuclear power  at its core--rather than on defending against aggression.    Since the Cold War has ended, the nature of the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty concerning the defense of Japanese territory  will undergo change. First, the significance of the American  nuclear restraint is gradually changing. In the past, the  American position on nuclear deterrence was such that it did not  exclude nuclear retaliation against large, regular military  forces. Now it seems it is moving in a direction where its  significance is limited to deterrence against proliferation and  use of weapons of mass destruction. In that case, a fundamental  posture will be necessary in which conventional weapons should  be used against an attack launched with conventional weapons.    Second, by the end of the Cold War, the relative importance  of the regional context of Northeast Asia--comprised of the PRC,  the Korean peninsula, Russia, and so on--has increased.  Security issues in Northeast Asia also have an aspect that they  have been traditional issues for Japan since the Meiji period.  But when such important factors as changes in an individual  country's political system and technological advances are  considered, we should regard them as new issues.    Keeping these changes in mind, when we think about Japanese  defense we realize there are short- and long-term problems. The  focus of the short-term problem is the handling of North Korea's  suspected nuclear development. As for long-term problems, it is  to create a stable Northeast Asian regional security order and  examine the Japanese defense policy which would conform to it.  The importance the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has in relation  to both of these problems is clear. First, it is indispensable  that the American deterrent against a nuclear attack on Japan be  confirmed. A fully functioning American nuclear deterrent would  not only directly contribute to Japanese security, it would not  permit excuses by neighboring countries for engaging in nuclear  proliferation on the pretext they suspect Japan possesses  nuclear arms. Naturally, in the more distant future cooperation  in the development of a theater missile defense (TMD) is also  significant in the sense of reducing not only Japanese defenses,  but also the incentive for possession of weapons of mass  destruction.    Moreover, what is important for dealing with the long-term  problems is to have continued American participation in  maintaining the peace in Northeast Asia, especially concerning  security on the Korean peninsula. Because of the historical  background, Japan should not directly participate in security  matters involving the Korean peninsula. But if by any chance  some disturbance would occur on the peninsula, Japan would be in  a position in which it could not avoid being affected. It is  also vital for Japanese security, in terms of the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty, that the United States carries responsibility  for stability on the Korean peninsula.    Japan should be resolved to provide support--economic  support  in particular--toward unity and prosperity on the Korean  peninsula. We should not repeat the history of intervention in  domestic disorders by Japan, China, and Russia on the Korean  peninsula. At the same time, Japan should advance security  dialogues with China and Russia. Considering the situation in  Northeast Asia in which territorial issues and differet  political systems exist, multination-based discussions will not  achieve many results. Thus, we should accumulate bilateral  security dialogue and confidence-building measures, and should  work so that the countries will come to an understanding about a  secure order in Northeast Asia. A multinational framework from  which no successful outcome can be expected would be harmful.    It is reported that a revision responding to the  post-Cold War situation is being made in the "DEFENSE PLAN  OUTLINE." But the past method for determining defensive  strength levels took Western deterrence as a major premise, so  this method is not necessarily the best for the future. Of  course, the method for maintaining its defensive strength should  be determined by Japan itself. But in the post-Cold War era, it  should be conceived in conjunction with improved efforts in the  international environment such as diplomatic activities,  security dialogues, confidence-building measures, and so forth  in the region. The objective of defense is securing the safety  of Japanese territory, and defensive power is the means, along  with alliances and diplomatic efforts. For the defense of Japan,  the choice Japan should make under these circumstances is to  secure fundamental security for Japan through the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty and Japanese defense efforts, while  simultaneously forming a new regional order.  <H5>  The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in the Region </H5>   As seen above, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty functioned in  the past with the objectives of strengthening the West  economically, uniting it politically, and deterring the East  from aggression. Because the security treaty fulfilled its  functions well, it has lasted over forty years. But in the  post-Cold War environment, the comprehensive notion of the  "West" will gradually lose significance, and it is natural the  significance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should again be  questioned. But as we have so far analyzed, the security treaty  has a valid meaning for regional security, the importance of  which will increase in the future. As for the security of the  Asia-Pacific region, a comprehensive idea which would be  equivalent to the "West" in the Cold War will not emerge, at  least for some time.    As is often said, the Asia-Pacific region is complex; it is  natural in the multinational framework that things should be  multilayered and diverse. As seen above in the economic area, a  loose organization such as APEC can work well, and in the  political area it would be easier to gain consensus in a context  for dialogue where Asian countries take the initiative. As  regards maintaining maritime order, which means the common  security of the region, it will be necessary to accumulate  agreements layer by layer among the multiple countries as it is  possible. In Northeast Asia, a bilateral approach seems to be  more effective than a multinational framework.    All such approaches should be subject to change, responding  to the fluid situation. In any case, a regional order in the  Asia-Pacific area is just coming into being, so flexibility  rather than adherence to a certain plan will be important.    But in order to be flexible, some fulcrum is necessary. For  Japan, it will be the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. As previously  stated, as a regional security pact becomes necessary, the  framework of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is most stable. But  our consciousness of the current U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is  still largely regulated by the Cold War. It is necessary that  we review the significance and role of the U.S.-Japan Security  Treaty from a new perspective. When the first U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty was concluded in 1951, the Cold War had already  begun. For those Japanese who had been under occupation until  then, they were hardly conscious of participating in an  international order which was in the background of the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Japanese tend to view the world  through the filter of their relationship with the United States.  Looking at it from such an aspect, the drastic change in the  international order may provide an excellent opportunity for the  Japanese. Through the process of creating order in the  Asia-Pacific region, both the United States and Japan may be  able to reconfirm the significance of the U.S.-Japan Security  Treaty.    Of course, the future U.S.-Japan relationship will be  important not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but also at the  world level-- for example, in the United Nations and the G-7.  There may also be efforts which have to be coordinated by each  country, or which must be bilaterally promoted. Such problems  could not be touched upon in this article. But in the current  situation, the adjustment of policies at various levels is a  matter of priority, and they should not be mutually  contradictory. In order to develop the formation of a future  international order--which includes a regional order--the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will continue to persist as the  cornerstone.

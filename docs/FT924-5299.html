			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Personal View: Not such a capital idea It is customary for business to seek bigger tax allowances from the chancellor of the exchequer, and no surprise that Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, used his speech at the recent CBI conference to invite the chancellor to 'think hard' about capital allowances. What is more surprising is that this chancellor should respond to these calls, introducing a temporary increase in allowances in the Autumn Statement. It was, after all, Mr Norman Lamont who so eloquently rejected the idea of raising capital allowances in this year's Budget speech, when he said: 'Good quality private investment will come not from artificial subsidies or incentives, but in response to consumer demand . . . I have concluded that, whatever its superficial attractions, an increase in capital allowances would not be a sensible use of the resources available.' It is tempting to see the chancellor's policy reversal as a clever way of boosting demand, or as a means of promoting the interests of industry. But in fact, while investment in 1993 is increased, this is only at the expense of investment in 1994 and 1995. His scheme is not about helping the economy in the long term. The increase in first-year capital allowances means that companies can claim a bigger deduction against corporation tax in the year they undertake investment spending, albeit at the cost of lower tax allowances for depreciation in subsequent years. It works rather like a loan from the exchequer to a company. At the current corporation tax rate of 33 per cent a 15 percentage point increase in capital allowances - from 25 to 40 per cent  -is like the government giving a 5 per cent interest-free loan on every pound invested. This will not do much to persuade a cash-starved company to engage in new spending if markets are depressed. But a lot of investment occurs anyway: about Pounds 50bn a year by industrial and commercial companies. And while the tax concession will not be enough to generate new investment, it will persuade many companies to bring their 1994 investment spending forward into the year ending October 1993, to enjoy the more advantageous tax rules. Temporary changes in taxation can have important effects on investment spending. The phasing out of high first-year capital allowances announced in the 1984 Budget gave companies a large fiscal incentive to bring investment spending forward. As the table shows, manufacturing investment rose sharply in 1984 and 1985, and then fell back in 1986. The fiscal incentive then was about three times larger than the effect now. Nevertheless the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that business investment in the next 12 months could be as much as 6 1/2 per cent higher than it would otherwise have been as a result of the temporary increase in capital allowances announced last week. So what is the downside? Unfortunately the boost is likely to be short-lived, and investment in 1994 sharply lower than it would otherwise have been. Spending that has been brought forward into 1993 will not be repeated. This is a short-term fix which does not promote investment in the longer term. Where does this leave Mr Lamont if the economy is still in recession next year? It would be stretching his credibility to repeat the exercise to get people to bring their 1995 investment into 1994. Only if he were quite certain that low investment in 1994 would not cause any problems could there be some merit in the chancellor's policy. Given the limitations of economic forecasting, we would favour a less cavalier approach. A further problem with this kind of measure is that it introduces a new element of unpredictability into the tax system with all the attendant costs. What we do not want as we enter the next recession is for companies to delay their investment in the expectation of a special tax concession if they just wait a few months. The chancellor began his Autumn Statement by insisting that 'the government has no intention of engineering a short-lived boom', and proceeded to introduce a supplementary package of time-limited fiscal measures, the sole rationale of which is that they can deliver a short-term stimulus. Long-term business planning is not aided by this interference in the tax system. Norman Lamont was right to reject this policy in March, and wrong to succumb to its superficial attractions now. If he wants to promote industrial investment for the long term, he needs to embrace a more serious restructuring of the corporate tax system than this.

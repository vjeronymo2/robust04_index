			<p>BFN     [Text] "This move is a little strange. I think that he has  lost his nerve." This was the first reaction of Umberto Bossi,  leader of the Northern League, to the decision of Silvio  Berlusconi to suspend negotiations with the League.    People, Bossi continued, can see that Berlusconi has broken  off talks because of the fact that he is the one who wants to  take charge. In that case we have not made a mistake in  understanding that with a virtual party [as received] we are  marching toward an autocratic type of government. We must now  safeguard democracy. His nerves have got to him because he is  used to having everything his own way immediately. He now finds  himself face to face with an entire people. This is a very  powerful force."</p>

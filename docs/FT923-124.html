			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: German industry snubs carbon tax German business leaders attacked their government's support for a carbon tax at last week's German Environment Conference in Frankfurt, estimating that it could cost German industry DM 12bn-15bn (Pounds 4.7bn-Pounds 5.9bn) by 2000. The German government has frequently made clear its support for proposals for a tax to help cut emissions of gases that could harm the atmosphere. At the Rio Earth Summit in June, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he planned cuts of 25-30 per cent in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 compared with 1987 levels. However at a recent meeting of EC environment ministers at Gleneagles, Klaus Topfer, the German environmental minister, said help cut emissions of carbon dioxide 'is absolutely necessary, and very soon' if Germany is to meet those targets. 'It will be a hell of a job to get there,' he added. 'The German government is in favour of a tax, but many parts of German business are against it.' The depth of that opposition was clear at Frankfurt, one of Europe's biggest environmental conferences, where industrialists and union leaders warned that a tax could cost German industry billions of D-Marks and destroy its competitiveness. Roland Turowski, director of the energy department of the German Electricity Industry Federation, said: 'I know Mr Topfer's view and it is wrong. These are high costs which will be passed on to the consumer, DM 3bn-5bn a year and DM 12bn-15bn by 2000.' Dietrich Wittmeyer, energy spokesman for the German Chemical Industry Federation, also accused the government of being 'too much fixed on the environment - they must also consider economic competitiveness'. Several industrialists instead favoured more investment in energy-efficient technology. Dieter Franke, environmental spokesman for the German automobile association, also recommended a price structure that favoured environmentally cleaner cars. However, technological changes alone may not be enough to counter the rapidly rising level of emissions caused by modernisation of the former east German states, which Topfer describes as a huge impediment to his plans. Of the 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by Germany each year, around a third comes from the former eastern states, although they have only a fifth of the combined population. That is partly because of their use of lignite fuel, a particularly dirty form of energy. The government also projects that the number of cars in east Germany will double to the west's level of one car for every two people. As well as the opposition of businesses, the German government must counter the ambivalence of many EC members about the form of such a tax. At Rio EC members gave their backing on the condition that a tax would not be implemented unless all 24 OECD countries agreed to it. Topfer said - in what may be wishful thinking - that he hoped the EC could decouple tax proposals from this condition. However, the German position has the full backing of EC environment commissioner Karel van Miert, who repeated his belief last week that 'we need to go ahead with it'. Because of the importance of transport policy in meeting the targets, Germany has been a vigorous supporter of van Miert, who is also EC transport minister. Van Miert's appointment as environment minister lasts only until December but he recently said: 'I would be happy to stay on after December, subject to the Belgian government's plans, and it is very probable that I will.'</p>

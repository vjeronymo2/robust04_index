			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOH DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> JAPANESE THEATER USES SUBTLE MOVEMENTS, POETIC IMAGERY  </P> <P> Yasko Gamo carefully took the mask of a female demon out of the rosewood china  cabinet in her Corona del Mar home and gently set it on the dining room table.  </P> <P> The horned mask, symbolizing female jealousy, is a replica of one used by  actors in the Noh theater -- the highly abstract and refined Japanese theater  that uses rich poetic imagery and highly stylized movement.  </P> <P> "Some of these (items) were given to me by my late father," Gamo said as a  glass wind chime tinkled softly outside. "Not so many common Japanese go to  theater to see Noh play, but because of my surroundings I have chance to see."  </P> <P> As a child in Japan in the 1930s, Gamo was part of a family steeped in the  tradition of the Noh theater: Her uncle was the 17th generation of the Hosho  family to head the Hosho Noh School in Tokyo, which is still one of the most  prominent Noh theater companies in Japan and is now run by her cousin. Her  father was a scholar and collector of rare books about Noh and owned a  bookstore specializing in Noh books, masks and instruments.  </P> <P> Growing up, Gamo said, she had many opportunities to see Noh plays and observe  the players and musicians backstage. And, until the world war intervened and  she and other high school students were enlisted to work in arms factories, she  even took lessons in shimai, Noh dancing.  </P> <P> All of which helps explain why Gamo, who teaches Japanese at Orange Coast  College, was invited to serve as technical and cultural adviser on a committee  preparing for the upcoming Orange County performance by the Kita Ryu-Noh troupe  from Japan.  </P> <P> The 26-member troupe will perform takigi noh, which simply means Noh theater  performed outdoors by firelight rather than in the traditional Noh theater.  (Takigi means firewood, the source of light when the ancient theater art was  originated.)  </P> <P> The outdoor version of the 15th-Century theater tradition will be performed in  Orange County one night only at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in California Scenario, the  sculpture garden designed by Isamu Noguchi in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The Orange County performance is being presented by the consul general of  Japan, UC Irvine and the Boston Co. (a Boston-based investment management and  private banking firm) as part of a five-show national tour. The Orange County  event is sponsored by a specially created consortium of Japanese and American  individuals and businesses, in addition to the Orange County Performing Arts  Center and South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> As a member of the Orange County Committee for Takigi Noh, Gamo helped write  the Japanese version of the program for the show.  </P> <P> Thumbing through a pictorial book on the Noh theater, Gamo, 61, recalled  enjoying attending performances with her parents several times a year as a  child.  </P> <P> "The costumes are very gorgeous," she said, laughing when asked if the drama  seemed boring to a child: "The Noh play is usually long -- it is quiet, slow  movement so, as a child, sometimes bored. Not all of them are quiet, some part  is pretty wild -- dramatic -- but the basic movement is slow."  </P> <P> Gamo thinks the Orange County audience will enjoy the performance by the Kita  Ryu-Noh troupe, although she acknowledges that people who are unfamiliar with  the Noh theater may think "it's boring because they're not used to seeing such  slow, quiet movement. They (the actors) show deep feeling, (and) the stage is  very plain, so it's quite different from Western drama."  </P> <P> When it comes to discussing the traditions of the Noh theater, Gamo defers to  an expert -- UC Irvine Prof. Robert Garfias, an ethnomusicologist in the  anthropology department. Gamo recommended Garfias to provide background on the  troupe and the art form in a free lecture at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Westin  South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "The Noh is extremely refined theater," Garfias said in a separate interview.  "The Japanese feel that you have to have a lot of knowledge in order to  appreciate it -- knowledge of the history of the period and the language of the  poetry. The Noh drama developed in a period of great social upheaval and civil  war in Japan, and it was designed to serve both as kind of a guide and solace  to the population."  </P> <P> Audiences, Garfias said, have to be prepared to see it. Otherwise, he said,  "you won't know what's going on so you're apt to miss a lot. There are no  large, overt movements -- no great traumatic climaxes. It's an art of great  subtlety. The motion is very, very slow, and there seems to be not a lot of  stage action, but a real connoisseur can watch one of these masked actors  walking across the stage and tell a lot about his character."  </P> <P> "In the opinion of many Japanese," Garfias added, "the Noh theater really  epitomizes the refinement of Japanese culture."  </P> <P> Gamo's own link with Japanese culture was broken in 1958, when she and her  physicist husband, Hideya Gamo, moved to the United States. Hideya Gamo, who is  now a professor of engineering at UCI, was hired as a research scientist at the  IBM research center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.  </P> <P> Not only was her link to Japanese culture broken by the move, Gamo said, but  she was busy "concentrating to adapt myself to life here, and my husband's work  is completely remote to traditional (Japanese) culture."  </P> <P> In 1963, Gamo's husband began teaching at the University of Rochester. It was  while serving as a member of the International Friendship Committee of the  Rochester YWCA, Gamo said, that her interest in the traditions of her Japanese  heritage was reawakened.  </P> <P> She was frequently asked to speak on Japanese culture at schools, churches and  local organizations and so, she said, she began to study traditional Japanese  culture. And, when her cousin's Hosho Noh Company toured the United States, she  said, she made the arrangements for the company's sold-out performance at the  University of Rochester.  </P> <P> Since moving to Corona del Mar in 1968, Gamo has come to be thought of as "a  real pillar of the Japanese community in Orange County," Garfias says.  </P> <P> After "four long years of juggling my studying with being a full-time housewife  and mother," Gamo earned a bachelor's degree in social ecology at UCI and, in  1982, began teaching Japanese at Orange Coast College. That same year she  contributed to Cal State Fullerton's Orange County Japanese-American Oral  History Project by interviewing two of the county's Japanese pioneers. The  interviews, which she translated, were published by the Oral History Project of  Cal State Fullerton in 1986. She also helped translate her cousin Homma  Fusataka's lectures when he visited California to perform in Noh demonstrations  at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, UCI and Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Over the years, Gamo and her husband have collected Noh theater items, which  decorate their home: masks, drums, hand-painted fans, a large Noh screen,  paintings, woodblock prints and videotapes of Noh performances. Some of the  artifacts were given to Gamo by her late father; others were purchased on the  couple's annual visits to Japan, where, Gamo said with a smile, "I feel somehow  I'm foreign to them because I'm Americanized already."  </P> <P> After living in the United States 31 years, however, Gamo nevertheless  acknowledges, "I still feel Japanese." With another smile, she added: "My  children are more American than Japanese."  </P> <P> The Gamos' eldest daughter, Yuriko, who was 17 months old when the family  arrived in the United States, is an art director in New York City. Their  younger daughter, Kay, is a medical student at UC Davis.  </P> <P> In her continued effort to maintain ties with her Japanese heritage, Gamo and  her husband occasionally attend professional tea ceremonies in San Diego. They  also frequent Japanese dance performances and flower arrangement, bonsai and  Japanese calligraphy exhibits.  </P> <P> And, naturally, the Gamos plan to attend the performance of the Kita Ryu-Noh  troupe from Japan Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> Turning the pages of her pictorial book on Noh theater, the wind chime  providing a delicate musical background, Gamo smiled and said, "I think it's  wonderful to have a chance to introduce such ancient Japanese culture to  American people."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 84a(2) of the Atomic Energy Act requires NRC to conform its regulations to EPA's regulations promulgated under UMTRCA. As noted above, the existing NRC criteria while providing a comprehensive response to EPA's general UMTRCA standards did not compel sites to proceed to final closure by a date certain nor did they require monitoring. NRC proposed uranium mill tailings regulations to conform the NRC requirements to EPA's proposed amended standards at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. 58 FR 58657 (November 3, 1993). The proposed regulations amend Criterion 6 and add a new Criterion 6A together with new definitions in the Introduction to appendix A to part 40 of title 10 of the CFR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These CAA and UMTRCA programs duplicate each other by creating dual regulatory oversight, including independent procedural requirements, while seeking to ensure compliance with the same numerical 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard. Concern over this duplication inspired several petitions for reconsideration, most notably from NRC, the American Mining Congress (AMC) and Homestake Mining Co. It was also alleged that subpart T was unlawful because it was physically impossible for some sites to come into compliance with subpart T in the time required. While these petitions remain pending before EPA (at least in part), EPA has taken several actions to address the issues they raise, including publishing the proposal to rescind subpart T, as well as the Final Rule to amend 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (UMTRCA regulations) and a Final Rule staying subpart T pending the conclusion of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After promulgation of subpart T (and receipt of reconsideration petitions), the Clean Air Act was substantially amended in November 1990. Included in the amended Act was an amendment that speaks directly to the duplication issue. Newly enacted section 112(d)(9) provides that no standard for radionuclide emissions from any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or an Agreement State) is required to be promulgated under section 112 if the Administrator determines, by rule, and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that the regulatory program established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act for such category or subcategory provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public health. This provision strives to eliminate duplication of effort between EPA and NRC, so long as public health is protected with an ample margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, Congress expressed sensitivity to the special compliance problems of uranium mill tailings sites through new section 112(i)(3). This provision provides an additional 3-year extension to mining waste operations (e.g., uranium mill tailings) if the 4 years allowed (including a one year extension) for compliance with standards promulgated under the amended section 112 is insufficient to dry and cover the mining waste (thereby controlling emissions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Between EPA, NRC and Affected Agreement States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In July of 1991, EPA, NRC and the affected Agreement States entered into discussions over the dual regulatory programs established under UMTRCA and the CAA. In October 1991, those discussions resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between EPA, NRC and the Agreement States which outlines the steps each party will take to both eliminate regulatory redundancy and to ensure uranium mill tailings piles are closed as expeditiously as practicable. See 56 FR 55434 (MOU reproduced as part of proposal to stay subpart T); see also 56 FR 67537 (final rule to stay subpart T). The primary purpose of the MOU is to ensure that owners of uranium mill tailings disposal sites that have ceased operation, and owners of sites that will cease operation in the future, bring those piles into compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee) with the goal that all current disposal sites be closed and in compliance with the radon emission standard by the end of 1997, or within seven years of the date on which existing operations and standby sites enter disposal status. This goal comports with Congress's concern over timing as reflected in CAA section 112(i)(3), as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. The Settlement Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As contemplated by the MOU, on December 31, 1991, EPA took final action to stay and propose rescission of subpart T under section 112(d)(9), and to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under UMTRCA. See 55 FR 67537, 67561 and 67569. In order to preserve its rights, EDF filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the stay.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 92&hyph;1082 (D.C. Cir.). Litigation had previously been filed by EDF, NRDC, AMC, Homestake and others, challenging subpart T.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AMC, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nos. 90&hyph;1058, 90&hyph;1063, 90&hyph;1068, and 90&hyph;1074 (D.C. Cir.). NRC, AMC and Homestake had also filed an administrative petition for reconsideration of subpart T.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

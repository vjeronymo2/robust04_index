			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current proposal, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options on an ADR without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the underlying security trades, as long as, the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for the underlying foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued trading of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not fall below 30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options on ADRs is the U.S. market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the NYSE has represented that it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires the combined training volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that overlie any of these classes. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4, and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities occurs in the U.S. ADR market, <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (i.e., stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the instrumental market for purposes of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies in conjunction with transactions in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the NYSE, and all the other U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that it is appropriate to view the U.S. ADR market as a single market even though it is made up of several national securities exchanges and the NASD. The Commission notes that all of the markets on which or through which these ADRs could trade are linked together by ITS. The Commission further notes that one market, the NYSE, typically operates as the primary exchange on which trades in U.S. ADRs are executed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendments No. 1, to the proposed rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NYSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market is identical to proposals by the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx to provide for the listing of ADR options that meet this uniform standard. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  The Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals were subject to a full notice and comment period and no comments were received. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33102 (October 25, 1993), 58 FR 58356 (November 1, 1993) (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;38), 33103 (October 25, 1993), 58 FR 58357 (November 1, 1993) (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;28), and 33252 (November 26, 1993), 58 FR 63604 (December 2, 1993) (SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;54).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although Amendment No. 1 to the proposal was not part of the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals when they were noticed for comment, the Commission notes that Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies how the NYSE will determine whether not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in the case of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented by ADRs, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that this amendment does not make a substantive change to the proposal and, thus, raises no new issues. Further, the Commission believes that the Amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets seeking to list ADR options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

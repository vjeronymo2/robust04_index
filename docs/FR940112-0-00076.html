Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States must provide Medicaid to categorical groups of individuals who are eligible to receive cash payments under one of the existing cash assistance programs established under the Social Security Act (the Act). In addition, States may provide Medicaid to the medically needy; that is, to those individuals who meet the categorical group requirements, have sufficient income to meet basic living expenses and, thus, are ineligible for a cash assistance program but who have insufficient income to pay for medical expenses. Sections 1902(a)(17) and 1903(f)(2) of the Act provide that, for individuals applying as medically needy, certain incurred medical expenses must be deducted from income if income exceeds the eligibility standard established by the State. The process is commonly referred to as ``spenddown.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the medically needy program, the spenddown process currently operates as follows: The State selects one or more medically needy budget periods between 1 and 6 months and a medically needy income level, against which countable income is measured. If countable income, after certain deductions are taken, is equal to or less than the income standard (medically needy income level), the individual (or family) is eligible for Medicaid. If the income is higher than this standard, the individual nevertheless may be eligible for Medicaid if, by deducting incurred medical expenses (i.e., spending down the ``excess'' income), the income equals or falls below the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1902(f) of the Act contains a similar provision for deduction of incurred medical expenses from income. This spenddown applies to categorically needy and medically needy aged, blind, and disabled individuals in States using more restrictive eligibility criteria than those of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. These States are known as section 1902(f) States. In those States, section 1902(f) of the Act requires that, in determining how much income is to be counted when determining eligibility, the Medicaid agency must deduct from income: (1) any SSI benefit received; and (2) any additional benefit paid by the State. If, after these deductions are taken, income is equal to or less than the State established income standard, the individual is eligible for Medicaid. If income is higher than the standard, the agency must deduct incurred medical expenses from the individual's countable income to determine whether or not he or she is eligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States using section 1902(f) criteria may elect to have medically needy programs. Individuals who become eligible for Medicaid by meeting the section 1902(f) spenddown are categorically needy unless the section 1902(f) State has a medically needy program. In section 1902(f) States with medically needy programs, an individual who spends down in order to meet the income test will be either medically needy or categorically needy. If he or she is an SSI or State supplement recipient, or meets the income test for SSI or a State supplement, he or she will be categorically needy. Otherwise, when the individual spends down, he or she will be medically needy. Once a section 1902(f) State elects to use more restrictive standards than those which the State is otherwise obligated to use under title XIX for those who will qualify as medically needy, its spenddown rules are governed by section 1902(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory authority behind the general medically needy and section 1902(f) spenddowns is different. Under the general medically needy spenddown in section 1902(a)(17), States must take into account, except to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law. Under section 1902(f), the spenddown language is broader. That is, the Secretary has not been granted the same authority to impose a limit: States must deduct from an individual's countable income incurred expenses for medical care as recognized under State law. However, section 1902(f) allows States to limit the deductible amount of expenses by recognizing only the limited amount under State law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All States are currently required by section 1902(a)(34) of the Act to provide Medicaid benefits 3 months prior to the month in which an application is filed, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are that the individual (a) received covered services under the State plan at any time during that 3-month period, and (b) would have been eligible for Medicaid at the time services were received if he or she had applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

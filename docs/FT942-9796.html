			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Interest boosts Northern Leisure Lower interest payable, down from Pounds 1.66m to Pounds 1.32m, lifted pre-tax profits of Northern Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and amusement park concern, to Pounds 1.03m for the 26 weeks to February 27, compared with Pounds 682,000 previously. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 11.7m. Earnings per share were 3.4p against 2.4p and directors intend to recommend a final single dividend of at least 1p. Thereafter it is intended that interim and final distributions will be paid in May and November. The group proposes to raise some Pounds 4.8m, net of expenses, by way of an underwritten issue of Pounds 5.4m nominal of convertible debenture stock 1996-2001 at par, initially yielding 8.25 per cent. The directors have agreed with a consortium, comprising Royal Bank of Scotland, National Westminster Bank and Bank of Scotland to provide new loan and overdraft facilities initially amounting to Pounds 21.8m. These are conditional upon the issue of the debenture stock proceeding. Directors stated that if all the conditions of both the facilities and issue were not met by July 19, the new banking facilities would not come into effect.</p>

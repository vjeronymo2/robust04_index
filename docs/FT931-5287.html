			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank board rebuilding completed ROTHSCHILD Bank (RBZ), the Zurich-based private bank that has been under a cloud since revealing SFr250m (Dollars 165m) in unauthorised loan losses last year, has completed a rebuilding of its executive board. The bank announced this week the appointment of Mr Michael Trummer to a new position of director of operations. Mr Trummer worked for several years at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich and in New York before joining RBZ. Last September, Mr Guy Wais, the former general manager of Guyerzeller Bank, a Zurich private bank owned by the UK's Midland Bank, joined RBZ as its general manager. Before his appointment, the bank had been without a general manager for nearly two years. RBZ said Mr Trummer's position was created specifically to help prevent the management failures that led to last year's crisis. He would be responsible for accounting, data processing, securities management and external payments. The bank said last September it had discovered irregularities in lending in the spring. Mr Jurg Heer, its credit manager, was sacked and charged by the Zurich police with fraud and embezzlement. RBZ said at the time that no one else was involved. Mr Heer subsequently claimed he was acting with other people in schemes to launder and invest mainly Italian clients' funds. He admitted receiving some SFr30m in commissions as a result of these deals. The bank's loan losses arose mainly from loans made to companies in the Lucern-based York Hannover group, which went bankrupt last year. Mr Karsten von Wersebe, the head of York Hannover, and lawyers associated with the group have claimed that Mr Heer was not acting alone, but they have not produced evidence proving that other senior RBZ directors were involved. RBZ hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand to investigate, and a senior bank official said this week the investigation backed up the bank's view that Mr Heer had been acting alone. The other new member of RBZ's executive board is Mr Urs Meisterhans, a long-time employee who has replaced Mr Heer as credit manager. Mr Oskar Campische remains responsible for asset management.</p>

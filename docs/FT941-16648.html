			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong The Hong Kong equity market rose by almost one third in December, so the 10 per cent decline in the Hang Seng index this week could simply be a good old-fashioned case of profit taking. The index fell 373 points yesterday, but closed some 300 points off the day's low. That might suggest the worst of the selling has passed. The US threat to cut import quotas for Chinese textiles certainly encouraged the slide. Given the colony's role as a corridor for Chinese exports, such punitive action on trade would be a bad omen. But other Asian equity markets have also suffered - Thailand fell by 5 per cent yesterday, Taiwan by almost as much - which hints at wider forces at work. The worry is that bull markets driven by liquidity are notoriously difficult to judge. A change in sentiment which caused US or Japanese investors to lose faith would have profound implications. A sharp rise in US interest rates or an economic shock from China remain the most likely causes of any eventual shift. But the latest US jobless figures are consoling on interest rates while there is nothing to suggest that China's problems have suddenly deteriorated. On a multiple of perhaps 17 times this year's forecast earnings, Hong Kong does not look especially expensive judged against its Asian rivals. But the low depreciation charges of Hong Kong's property companies and banks flatter the market on that measure. Judged against cash flow or asset value, Hong Kong equities are starting to look pricey. Progress from here will be more difficult to achieve.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Philip Morris sues over TV tobacco claim Philip Morris yesterday filed a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) libel lawsuit against the US television network ABC alleging an ABC current affairs programme broadcast false and defamatory statements last month when it claimed the tobacco manufacturer was adding extra nicotine to its cigarettes to make them more addictive. The lawsuit is the latest offensive by Philip Morris and the US tobacco industry, which is facing increasingly intense opposition to its cigarette products from politicians and anti-smoking groups. In the past year Philip Morris has sued the city of San Francisco over its strict anti-smoking laws and the Environmental Protection Agency for its claims that second-hand cigarette smoke causes cancer in non-smokers. The industry also faces a tough fight in Congress over President Clinton's plan to help pay for healthcare reform by a sharp rise in cigarette tax. In its lawsuit against ABC, Philip Morris says that on February 28 the network's Day One current affairs programme claimed the company was 'spiking' its cigarettes with extra nicotine in order to keep smokers 'hooked'. Philip Morris says ABC made the allegations even though it knew them to be untrue, and that the network subsequently repeated the claims in later programmes. Although an ABC spokesman said it stood by the report, Wall Street was unnerved and shares in the network's parent company, Capital Cities/ABC, fell Dollars 16 to Dollars 702 3/4 . Philip Morris said it was seeking Dollars 5bn in punitive damages, and another Dollars 5bn as compensation for the impact the allegations had on the company's share price, which dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 in heavy trading the day after the ABC broadcast. Philip Morris also noted that after ABC made its allegations, members of Congress called for investigations into cigarette manufacturing processes, and both President Bill Clinton and Mr David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, expressed concern. One reason why the share prices of Philip Morris and other tobacco makers fell sharply following the Day One item was that the programme prompted a suggestion by the FDA that if the allegations of 'spiking' were true there might be a legal basis for regulating cigarettes as a drug. Philip Morris insists that while nicotine occurs naturally in a tobacco leaf, it does not add extra nicotine to cigarettes during production.</p>

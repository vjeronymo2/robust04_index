			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Paretsky fires a blank - Reading Matter Sara Paretsky is attempting to create a new genre of detective fiction: the politically correct murder story. Paretsky burst into the world of detective writing in the early 1980s with a striking innovation - VI Warshawski - a hardened, likable woman private detective tramping around Chicago. In the early novels, Bitter Medicine, Deadlock and Burn Marks, Warshawski was charming and credible, the plots were dense with detail and red herrings. But with her latest book, Tunnel Vision, something awful has happened to VI Warshawski: she has become more important than the murder she is investigating. The point of the latest, very long book is the detective herself, not the plot of murder, money laundering and political corruption she uncovers. And that is not the only problem: the heroine's character has become increasingly unappealing. VI Warshawski now seems to be shaped by what appear to be Paretsky's political preferences rather than her reflections upon Chicago life. The book reeks of political correctness: there are women's building co-operatives, exploited Romanian construction workers, a token black boyfriend, child abuse, and homelessness. Warshawski's behaviour is increasingly preposterous and many of the exploits in which she displays her miraculous powers are incidental to the plot - a thinly-built tale of a senator's company making illegal grain sales to Iraq and laundering the proceeds through a local bank which some friends have just bought. Paretsky's decline is all the more striking when compared with the brooding power of White Butterfly, the latest book from Walter Mosely, the rising star of US detective fiction. Tunnel Vision's self indulgence is capped with a sickly surprise birthday party at which Warshawski is surrounded by droves of adoring friends, many of them saved and reformed by their contact with the saintly detective. The only absentee is the long-suffering black boyfriend Conrad. Earlier in the story he gives Warshawski the elbow. On this showing readers should probably follow suit. Charles Leadbeater</p>

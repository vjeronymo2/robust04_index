According to a contract signed here this afternoon, the  Deutsche Babcock Group will provide the equipment for the  Yangliuqing Power Plant Project, which is designed to ease the  shortage of power supply in the areas of Beijing and Tianjin.    Purchasers of the boilers are the China National Technology  Import and Export Corporation and the Huaneng Power Generation  Corporation, which will use a mixed German loan.    Babcock, a major world boiler producer, also agreed to sell  four boilers to the Gaobeidian Power Project in Beijing last  year.    Prior to the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Zou  Jiahua met with both Chinese and foreign representatives  attending the ceremony in the Great Hall of the People.</p>

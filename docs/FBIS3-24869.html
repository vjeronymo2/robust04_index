			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Observers in the Angolan peace process have issued a  declaration saying they believe the time has come to consider  adopting measures that would translate the true progress  achieved in the Zambian capital. The declaration was issued by  the Portuguese Foreign Ministry:    The Angolan Government and the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed on principles which  will govern UNITA's participation in the Angolan national  police. This agreement constitutes an important success for  peace in Angola.    Although the government and UNITA had genuine concerns on  this issue at the beginning, both sides continued with their  efforts in good faith to find mutually acceptable solutions,  thus demonstrating their political desire to bring peace to  Angola.    A lot has already been achieved in Lusaka. The government  and UNITA have reached agreements on various difficult and  complex issues, including the restablishment of a verifiable  cease-fire, the confinement and disarmament of UNITA military  forces, the conclusion of the training of the Angolan Armed  Forces, and the integration of demobilized troops into civilain  society.    The present agreement on police issues means that both sides  have overcome another important landmark toward a just and  lasting peace. The government and UNITA have now begun to debate  national reconciliation and it is our belief that they will be  able to carry out this task with the same political courage and  the same spirit and consensus needed to reach an agreement.    The peace process, which began in Bicesse and which  people--particularly the Angolan people--have awaited for so  long, has now started to become a reality. Thus, we call on all  parties to exercise maximun restraint, taking into account what  has already been achieved in Lusaka and to halt all military  activities because they can undermine the hopes of the Angolan  people and the international community concerning the  establishment of peace in Angola. There is no military solution  for the Angolan problem. We believe the time has come to  consider measures which will translate the true progress  achieved in Lusaka into a lasting peace in Angola.    Although the principal responsibility for peace rests with  UNITA and the government, the international community has an  important role to play in supporting the maintenance of peace  and in responding to the many humanitarian needs facing Angola.  It is our hope and conviction that working jointly, we shall  finally be able to bring the reward of peace to the Angolan  people.</p>

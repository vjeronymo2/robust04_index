			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major dismisses monetary union deadline - Sacked chancellor rounds on PM as politics overshadows economics STERLING WAS unlikely to return to the European exchange rate mechanism for some years - perhaps not before the election - Mr John Major said yesterday as he made clear his belief that the idea of monetary union in 1997 was 'wholly unrealistic'. Prompted by the statement from Mr Norman Lamont, the prime minister expressed some sympathy for the possibility of an independent central bank. During Mr Major's speech itself, which was marked throughout by rowdy interventions from opposition MPs, politics overshadowed econ-omics in the Commons chamber. One Tory backbencher intervened, however, to praise the prime minister for emphasising that for the UK to rejoin the ERM there would have to be greater convergence of the monetary policies of all the main European Community economies, and the mechanism would have to operate to the benefit of all its members. 'I now doubt whether these circumstances will apply for some years ahead - possibly not in this parliament,' Mr Major said. But he insisted that his view that the EC countries would not be ready for a single currency for many years, if ever, was not 'anti-European'. Instead it came from his belief that the conditions would not then be in place and that the damage from a premature move towards monetary union would be profound. While agreeing that there was a case for giving independence to the Bank of England, Mr Major said that the underlying policy was more important than the institutional arrangements. He did not believe, he said, that an independent central bank would have brought inflation down more quickly than the government had achieved. His main concern was that politicians should still be able to call to account those who made decisions about monetary policy. 'Were a way to be found to get the benefits of an independent central bank without a loss of parliamentary accountability, my views would be closer to yours,' Mr Major told his former chancellor. His tribute to Mr Lamont, that 'history will look favourably on your economic and financial skills', provoked Labour jeers of 'Why did you sack him then?'. That question was effectively answered as Mr Major continued: 'But a strong government needs political skills as well when leading a democratic society and, in particular, handling a lively House of Commons with a small majority.' The political impact of the government's likely public spending decisions on Tory backbenchers already worried about the possibilities being floated, was clearly in Mr Major's mind as he set out the basis of the spending review. The criteria would be, he said, whether any changes were fair and whether vulnerable people were protected. 'I did not come into politics to dismantle the welfare state.' But he sought also to dismiss the accusation by Mr Lamont that ministers were more concerned to take popular than right decisions. He said that in tackling the state of the public finances the government was taking long-term views, not going for short-term options. This was in stark contrast to the attitude of the other parties, he said, attacking Labour for 'contracting out' the difficult decisions to be taken on welfare benefits to its commission on social justice. The prime minister also mounted a vehement attack on Mr John Smith, as he contrasted the Labour leader's reputation for honour with the 'scare-mongering' tactics of his party. 'In the Labour party the scares come from the top - behind that moral righteousness is someone who has no scruples whatsoever,' Mr Major said. When he sat down at the end of his speech it was MPs on the opposition benches who shouted for more.</p>

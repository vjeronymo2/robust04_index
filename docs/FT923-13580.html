			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK savings market Talk last week of UK banks and building societies being forced to raise their mortgage rates in response to the government's aggressive marketing of National Savings is probably exaggerated. Nevertheless, the problem is not one which the societies or retail-orientated banks like TSB and Abbey National can entirely afford to ignore. The prospect of National Savings doubling its intake from the retail market this year will have little impact on the outstanding stock of deposits, but it will make a difference to flows of new savings. Net new deposits collected by the building societies and Abbey National last year amounted to some Pounds 20bn, including credited interest. The comparable figure for National Savings was Pounds 2bn, so it must be aiming for a significant increase in market share. On top of that TSB has motives of its own to bid aggressively for retail savers' funds. It says it wants to become less dependent on wholesale money market funding and to position itself better in the retail market for the longer term. All this matters less in an economy where the housing market is depressed and the savings rate is at its highest for 10 years. Since there is no loan volume to chase, lenders can afford to preserve their margins at the expense of forgoing some new deposits. Nor is the broader clearing bank market particularly affected by the National Savings campaign. The large clearers are much more interested in developing fee income than raising deposits to expand their loan books. The picture will look rather different when base rates do finally resume their fall. One cannot assume that will produce an instantaneous economic recovery which will wipe out the PSBR. There will thus be a continuing need for the National Savings marketing campaign - with the attendant probability that its rates will become something of a benchmark for savings products. Mortgage lenders would then face a double squeeze on their margins: through competition for deposits and downward pressure on loan rates. The consequence may well be that mortgage rates will eventually come down much more slowly than the government would like or than the state of the housing market would dictate. Had the authorities succeeded 10 days ago in trimming base rates by a quarter point, for example, mortgage rates would probably not have budged.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- A Cuban female citizen who  had been sentenced to five years for subversive crimes flew to  Spain after local authorities released her before she had served  her full sentence, PRENSA LATINA confirmed today.    The woman is Aurea Genoveva Feria Cao, 51 years old, who was  sentenced in 1990 for spreading enemy propaganda after her  activities to destabilize the Cuban Government were proven.    Reliable sources reported that the woman was released before  she had served her full sentence as the result of talks with the  Spanish Government, particularly Galician authorities.    Asked by PRENSA LATINA last night about the Cuban  authorities' decision to approve her trip to Spain, Feria Cao  said: I appreciate this gesture very much.    Feria Cao, mother of four children, two of whom traveled  with  her, said she was not mistreated while in prison but that  serving time was a very hard thing in her life because she had  been a housewife. I would rather have served my five-year  sentence in the state's security installations, she said about  the time she served in prison.    Asked about her plans for the future, she said: I will not  participate in political activities. She also announced her  intention to reside in Spain. I will devote myself to my  children and my home, she said.</p>

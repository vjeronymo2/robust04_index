			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: YOUNG HUNKS ON HORSEBACK  </P> <P> THE FILM: "Young Guns II"  </P> <P> THE SCENE: Billy the Kid, played with gusto by Emilio Estevez, is chased across  the New Mexico desert by Pat Garrett (played by William Petersen), formerly a  cattle-rustling compatriot and now a well-dressed sheriff. It's the same old  story with a sex-appeal spin. Billy's accompanied on this chase to the death by  his band of Regulators -- Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian  Slater (pictured), Balthazar Getty and Alan Ruck. They are the Team  Testosterone. Their down-and-dirty appeal is enhanced by Dean Semler, the  director of photography, who knows a few things about heroically depicting  renegades, having done the "Mad Max" trilogy, and backed with songs by Jon Bon  Jovi, who is no slouch when it comes to stirring young women into a fever of  lust.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Estevez, Getty and Ruck are dressed prairie style -- bowler hats,  lumpy wool pants, suspenders, muslin shirts and worn-out boots. Slater's  character is an aspiring outlaw, Dave Rudabaugh, who would like the same  notoriety as the Kid. He makes up for his lack of billing by strutting around  in bad guy-black suede pants and a Stetson (pictured). Sutherland's Doc  Scurlock wears a period tweed suit that evolves from natty to nasty as his  character declines from poet and teacher to desperate gunslinger. Phillips as  Chavez y Chavez wears an ethnic mix that reflects the character's  Mexican-Indian heritage -- ponchos, feathers and a shearling vest that looks  decidely as if it was tanned at home, in the tepee.  </P> <P> The fashion victim of the film is Pat Garrett. He is given 50% of his bounty  payment for capturing the Kid up-front and the first thing he does with his  new-found wealth is buy new clothes. And such splendid clothes he buys: a black  ottomon overcoat and a pinstripe three-piece suit. The vest even has jeweled  buttons. Costume designer Judy Ruskin explained his peacock style, saying: "In  my research, I found Pat Garrett was quite a fashion plate. He was always very  well dressed and incredibly vain."  </P> <P> THE LABELS: Ruskin had almost all of the wardrobe for the principals custom  made, although some of the accessories were bought off the rack. Estevez's  suspenders are from Perry Ellis Menswear and Getty's are from Cole-Haan. The  black cowboy hat that Christian Slater wears carries the Outback Trading Co.  label. Estevez's long-john shirt was also bought and then customized with a  muslin placket for period authenticity.  </P> <P> THE PAYOFF: So what if "Young Guns II" is a heavy-metal version of the 48-times  told tale of Billy the Kid? These guys are a visual delight. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

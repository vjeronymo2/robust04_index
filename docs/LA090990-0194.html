			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR INDUSTRY TRIES TO MAKE A COMEBACK;  </P> <P> ENERGY: DESPITE SOARING OIL PRICES, THE OUTLOOK FOR NEW PLANTS IS BLEAK. BUT  THE INDUSTRY SEES SEVERAL HELPFUL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE HORIZON.  </P> <P> Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices soaring, America's nuclear  power industry was on the offensive. Its advertising, already scheduled to run  in several national magazines, showed a menacing cobra whose body was made of  oil drums. The message: Continued U.S. reliance on foreign oil is dangerous.  </P> <P> When Iraqi tanks crossed the border, the U.S. industry was ready. Within two  weeks, the ad campaign was expanded to 18 major daily newspapers, at a cost of  $150,000. But the extra spending -- and the discomfort of rising oil prices --  marked only a small and temporary blip in the $6-million-a-year media campaign  by the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness, an arm of the nuclear power industry,  to revive the long-dormant business of building power reactors.  </P> <P> Rather than rely on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, suppliers of nuclear power  are placing their bets on longer-term hopes: continued steady growth in  electricity demand and new designs for reactors that are cheaper to build and  easier to operate.  </P> <P> "Our policy is pretty much 'steady as she goes,' " said council spokesman Carl  Goldstein. Indeed, analysts say, there may be no other viable strategy for an  industry that hasn't received a new construction permit since 1979.  </P> <P> Nuclear power provides 19.5% of the nation's electricity. But these days the  industry makes its domestic profits doing repairs and maintenance on existing  plants rather than designing and constructing new ones.  </P> <P> There are 114 operating plants, but only nine under construction -- and only  two of those have firm completion dates. "There simply are no more in the  pipeline," said Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the federal Nuclear Regulatory  Commission. "We suspect several of (the plants under construction) may never  get finished." Meanwhile, Ingram noted, the agency is concentrating on making  sure that existing reactors run safely.  </P> <P> The major reason that the utility industry has shunned new orders for reactors  is that it simply takes too long -- usually a decade or more -- before a  utility can win final approval from regulators to begin operating a new nuclear  power plant.  </P> <P> Prospective customers for nuclear power plants do "not trust the regulatory  system on (both) the state and federal levels," said Goldstein of the Council  on Energy Awareness, whose membership consists of utility companies, equipment  manufacturers and builders of power plants. "They have no confidence that if  they make investment decisions, these will be supported when the plant is  built," he explained.  </P> <P> Indeed, in many areas, state regulatory bodies are prohibiting utilities from  increasing their prices to help pay for nuclear power plants, effectively  forcing them to take the construction costs out of their profits. During the  1980s, the amount of construction costs that public utility commissions refused  to include in rate-setting totaled a staggering $15 billion.  </P> <P> Although the nation's appetite for electricity keeps rising -- it has jumped  54% in just seven years -- the future of nuclear power looks comparatively  bleak.  </P> <P> California, with nearly 30 million people the nation's biggest state, gets 14%  of its electricity from nuclear power plants, but prospects are virtually nil  that more will be built there. State law forbids licensing of new plants until  there is a demonstrated safe method of disposing of nuclear waste. And the  federal Energy Department isn't expected to complete its work on waste disposal  methods and site selection until well into the next century.  </P> <P> "I don't see nuclear power representing a viable option in the foreseeable  future," said Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission.  </P> <P> Even if the waste-disposal problem is solved, the high cost of building nuclear  power plants -- and lingering questions about their reliability -- still pose  massive obstacles, Imbrecht said.  </P> <P> Nuclear power "commands an enormous amount of capital over a long period of  time and is simply not going to attract customers" unless the technology  becomes more competitive, he said. If it has any future at all, he asserted, it  lies with smaller-sized plants -- not the behemoths that were built in the  1960s and 1970s.  </P> <P> Imbrecht insisted that California's diverse sources of power -- from natural  gas, underground steam fields, hydroelectric power and purchases of electricity  from other regions -- have made the state less vulnerable to foreign  interruptions. Only 1% of California's electricity is generated by oil, down  from a whopping 48% during the 1973 Arab oil embargo against the United States.  There is "absolutely no danger of the lights going out in California any time  this decade," Imbrecht asserted.  </P> <P> As a result, even nuclear power enthusiasts don't foresee any easy expansion.  "Clearly, we favor nuclear power," said Tom Dennis, Southern California  Edison's Washington representative. The company's nuclear power plant at San  Onofre "has a great record," he asserted.  </P> <P> Dennis said Southern California Edison has been bullish on nuclear power, "and  we think it can work." But he conceded that even the crisis in the Persian Gulf  won't move Congress to ease the licensing process. "I doubt any fast-tracking  will be done as a result of what takes place in the Middle East," he said. "I  don't think the crisis will result in anything but a clearer recognition that  there needs to be a national energy policy."  </P> <P> Strategists at the Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. say they believe that the  United States needs both coal and nuclear power to meet its future energy  needs. But Herb Woodeshick, special assistant to the company's president, said  it would take major regulatory reforms to persuade the nation's utility  industry to construct new plants.  </P> <P> Among them: A one-step licensing process to replace the separate construction  and operating permits now required, resolution of the waste-disposal issue and  a standard new design for nuclear plants. "When someone starts to build a  plant, you need to be sure it can be done in six or seven years," Woodeshick  said.  </P> <P> With even its friends still reluctant, the nuclear power industry recognizes  that it is unlikely to make a comeback any time soon, even in the face of the  gulf crisis.  </P> <P> "Our campaign is consistent, our message is clear -- that imported oil is  dangerous," Goldstein said. "Fortuitously, our latest series of ads fit right  into the world situation."  </P> <P> Goldstein emphasized that, every day, nuclear power displaces the use of  740,000 barrels of oil in producing electricity -- about the same amount that  the United States imported from Iraq and Kuwait before the crisis began.  </P> <P> Only 6% of America's electricity is generated by burning oil, but almost 20% of  total generating capacity is oil-fired, he warned. "If utilities had no other  choice but to use this spare capacity," he said, "oil consumption could shoot  up as much as 3 million barrels a day."  </P> <P> Despite the industry's pessimism, there are some changes on the way:  </P> <P> * Analysts expect that a new generation of nuclear reactors -- a standard  design that would be far less complex and easier to operate -- will be  certified by 1994, or possibly sooner.  </P> <P> * The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has adopted a proposal recommending a  single-permit procedure to replace the current two-step system. But industry  officials believe that they will need new legislation to make the procedural  changes unassailable to challenges, and Congress is likely to balk at such a  plan.  </P> <P> * The industry hopes to wage its future public relations battles partly on  environmental grounds, arguing that nuclear energy is clean and emits no  "greenhouse gases." "Our polls show environmental concerns are more telling  than energy issues," Goldstein said.  </P> <P> If the industry is politically skillful -- and lucky -- utilities may be  ordering new plants by the middle of the decade, Goldstein suggested.  </P> <P> But an air of pessimism still prevails. A publishing and economic consulting  company has scheduled a conference in Washington later this month on the theme  of standardization of nuclear power plants. "Can it save the nuclear industry?"  the program asks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Plants with operating licenses: 114  </P> <P> Plants under construction: 9  </P> <P> Last construction permit issued: 1979  </P> <P> Share of U.S. electricity produced by nuclear power: 19.5%  </P></p>

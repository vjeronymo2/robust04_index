			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the approach that the student's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit should be evaluated realistically, the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations would recognize that those individuals admitted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of their ability to benefit who met one or more of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several statutory requirements would nevertheless be regarded as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not having had that ability if they had a physical, mental, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal impediment to employment in, or performance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical duties of, the occupation for which the program was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed. Individuals with certain kinds of criminal records or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a history of mental illness may be barred from some positions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the school proposed to train them, and these students could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not benefit from the training even if they successfully completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test sanctioned by both the industry and school's accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency. Other students may lack the physical ability to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a job for which their grades on an industry and accreditor-approved test might otherwise show an ability to perform. Both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kinds of students would qualify (or qualify the parent PLUS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower) for relief under these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of other kinds of falsification were considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential grounds for discharge of the loan under this provision,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including a school's acceptance of a student into an ineligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, but they were not adopted in these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained earlier, the statute uses fairly precise language to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describe the grounds for discharge under this provision, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language, by authorizing discharge where there has been a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification ``by the eligible institution,'' does not authorize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief where the falsity relates to the eligibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution itself. Thus, although misrepresentations regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the school's financial or administrative capability, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the school's placement services or the quality of the school's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, faculty, or equipment, may well have induced the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual to enroll at the school, those representations are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the process of ``certification'' of the student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility to borrow, tend to constitute claims that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution was in fact not an ``eligible institution,'' and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not the kind of representations for which this statute authorizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief. These proposed regulations therefore do not treat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falsifications by the institution about itself as grounds for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the vocational schools that are the primary focus of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this statutory provision, representations about the eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution include representations about the eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its programs, and, under the statute and regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is virtually defined in terms of the programs it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offers. 20 U.S.C. 1088 (1992); 34 CFR 600.7, 668.7(a)(2)(v).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, because the statute confines relief precisely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of false certifications regarding the eligibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student, not on representations that would tend to show that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution itself was not eligible, the Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the statute authorizes relief where the alleged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misrepresentation goes to the eligibility of the program in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student was enrolled. For these reasons, relief under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would not permit a borrower to secure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation by challenging the eligibility of the program or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school itself, but would require a demonstration by the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the school failed to test (or tested improperly) his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to benefit and that he or she did not secure employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the occupation for which the school stated its program was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to prepare the student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Bankruptcy Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 437(a) of the HEA as amended by the Higher Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1992 allowed a lender to submit and receive payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a bankruptcy claim on the date on which the borrower filed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief in bankruptcy, an action that ``stays collection'' of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan, rather than when the loan was discharged, as under prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law. The proposed regulations submitted to the negotiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process would have revised current regulations as needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement this change. Other features of current bankruptcy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim processing were to remain unchanged. Section 2(c)(63) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 103&hyph;208 reinstated standards for payment of bankruptcy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims consistent with those now found in FFEL Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5); pursuant to section 5 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 103&hyph;208, this most recent change took effect as if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted as part of the 1992 amendments. Any regulations needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement this change, moreover, are not subject to negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking requirements of section 492. To implement the new law,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary is here withdrawing those proposals found in 34 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 682.402(f)(5) and (g)(2) (iv) and (v) as presented to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators prior to the enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;208, and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave in effect the provisions of current 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated here as &sect;682.402(g)(5), and current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;682.402(e)(2)(ii), redesignated here as &sect;682.402(g)(2)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

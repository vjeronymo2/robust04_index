			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Nigerian general strike suspended The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday suspended its general strike to enable the military government to negotiate with union leaders without duress but will resume its action on Monday if opposition leader Moshood Abiola is not released. Oil workers, however, who have forced a 20 per cent cut in Nigerian production over the past week, are set to continue their strike. The NLC has been reluctant to confront the government in the past 12 months. But last week it decided to call the general strike - which started on Wednesday - in protest at the arrest of Mr Abiola, who faces treason charges after declaring himself president on the strength of his presumed victory in last year's annulled general election. NLC leaders said that they would re-convene tomorrow but that if the negotiations with the government in Abuja had not secured Mr Abiola's release, the strike would be resumed. The core of anti-government protest, which is strongest among members of Mr Abiola's Yoruba tribe in the south-west, has been the crippling strike by the two oil workers' unions and this is set to continue. Nupeng, the blue collar union, was the only one of the 41 unions of the NLC to strike a month ago, backed up by the senior staff association, Pengassan, made up of managers and engineers. Their strike is to press demands not only for elected civilian rule but also for a fairer share of national wealth in the oil-producing areas and an end to government under-investment in the oil industry, which has led to thousands of job losses. Both Nupeng and Pengassan have made clear that they will not end their strike until the government meets their main demands, which go much further than the NLC's position. The stoppage has almost halted fuel distribution in the south-west, which accounts for 50 per cent of industrial and domestic demand, and has disrupted production of crude oil, Nigeria's major export, cutting output by about 25 per cent. Staff at Brass River oil terminal operated by Agip were evacuated from the facility yesterday in apparent compliance with the strike. The NLC's general strike has had vastly differing support across the country. It has brought a total stoppage in Lagos and the other cities of the south-west, where factories, petrol stations and banks were already shut due to earlier strikes. In the east and in north of the country, most areas are working normally. In the south-west, suspension of the NLC strike is unlikely to have much effect today because it is a half-day for Moslems, transport to work is scarce, many plants are idle due to lack of power or spare parts, and workers may fear going out in the streets after recent violence. The test of the NLC will be on Monday. If it secures Mr Abiola's release, some unions in the south could break away from the NLC and continue to strike for an early end to military rule. If Mr Abiola is not released, the NLC will be seen as stooges manipulated by the government.</p>

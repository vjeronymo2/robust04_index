			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MFI expansion MFI plans to add 20 stores to its 46-strong chain of kitchen and bedroom furniture shops in France this year. The company is looking at further expansion into Spain and Portugal. MFI has been in France for 10 years, and picked up seven stores with its Hygena acquisition in 1987. 'We accelerated last year, adding a net nine new stores, and were delighted with the results. We seem to have a format that works,' said Mr Derek Hunt, chairman. That format is of stores much smaller than MFI's in the UK, but selling mainly UK-manufactured products. 'I enjoy going into the stores and knowing that the kitchens they are buying were made in Hull,' said Mr Hunt. Last year French sales grew by 33 per cent, with like-for-like growth of 6 per cent. The operation broke even after substantial store opening costs, and since 80 per cent of its sales were manufactured in-house it made a contribution to group profits. Most of the stores are in shopping malls. COMMENT MFI shares have had a nervous few weeks amid increasing signs of a slowdown in the UK housing market. So it was the 13 per cent growth in sales since the year-end which particularly reassured the City yesterday. Of course, that may not last - MFI's markets remain fundamentally volatile. But it is more adept than most at riding the swings and roundabouts. It is not a company to sit back and rely on an economic upturn to generate continued profits recovery. It is working hard on refining its formats and broadening its product range while all the time chiselling away at costs. It still has room to grow in the UK and it might even join the select band of British retailers to make a go of it across the Channel. Assuming it can match last year's profits, without the Pounds 19.6m Carpetright gain, the shares stand on a forward multiple of about 14.5. Not expensive at this stage of the cycle.</p>

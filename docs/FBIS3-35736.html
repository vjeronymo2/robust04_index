			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] The results of Russia's December election can  somewhat be repeated in Moldova's general elections,  Presidential Adviser Anatol Cebanu told Interfax. He spoke of  similar mentality on the ground and disarray within the  democratic camp.    Cebanu does not rule out that the Agrarian-Democratic Party  may win at least 30 percent of the vote. However, the Alliance  of Socialists and Unity Movement has the chance of doing the  same, he believes.    The Women's Association may perform well if the vote follows  a Russian scenario, Cebanu said adding that the Peasants and  Intelligentsia bloc and the Alliance of Christian Democratic  People's Front which may win 10 percent of the vote each are  likely to forge a single parliamentary group.    Cebanu is sceptical about the chances by the Socialist  Democratic, Democratic and Reform Parties to overcome the 4  percent barrier needed to form a faction.    It is most important that people caring for internal peace  and stability came to power, Cebanu stressed. But we will be in  for the worst time if ant-independence forces win the election,  he said.</p>

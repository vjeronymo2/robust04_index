			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the Press Service of the President of Ukraine and </F> Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: "How To Stabilize Prices and  Production"]    [Text] On 19 April, a session of the Presidium of the  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine convened under the chairmanship  of Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. A number of urgent  economic issues were examined at the session.    In his presentation, Deputy Minister of Economics Viktor  Kalnik provided information on the course of implementation of  the Edict of the President of Ukraine "On Measures To Restrain  the Rate of Price Growth." It was noted that thanks to  implementation of the edict, which put limits on profitmaking  levels in production and on markups in trade turnover, a certain  degree of success was achieved in limiting the rate of growth of  prices and, accordingly, the rate of inflation. Whereas the  average monthly increase in wholesale prices in industry last  year was above 146 percent, in January of this year this index  was 123 percent, in February--116 percent, and in March--106.9  percent. The rate of inflation in January was 19 percent, in  February--12.6 percent, and in March--5.7 percent. For the first  time in the past two years, price projections were confirmed  providing a basis for planning and budgeting. These indices  would have been much better if the sectors had standard  regulations for calculating the producer cost of output. Through  the fault of a number of ministries and departments, such  regulations were not developed. Insufficient supervision on  their part, and in some cases their connivance with violators,  constitutes the main reason for excessive overstatement of  producer cost of production output and wholesale factory prices.    Inspections conducted during the first quarter uncovered  violations of existing price formation procedure in 58 percent  of over 9,000 entrepreneurial activity entities inspected.  Economic penalties were exacted from the violators amounting to  over 260 billion karbovantsy.    The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers determined  specific  measures for intensifying supervision and responsibility with  respect to compliance with state price policies. Ways to perfect  the price formation mechanism were also specified.    Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs Yuriy Karasyk  reported  on the status of formation and placement of state contracts and  state orders for agricultural production output, raw materials,  and foodstuffs in 1994. The underlying causes of complications  in effecting timely settlements with agricultural producers were  comprehensively analyzed. A number of measures were specified  with respect to providing farms the resources for producing  output sold to the state.    The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers also examined  issues related to the manufacture of automated cash registers  and their introduction at trade enterprises, public kitchens,  and everyday facilities. These devices significantly improve the  supervision exercised over trade turnover and, accordingly--over  revenue going to the budget. More than 320,000 units are  presently required. But their rate of production at enterprises  of the Ministry of the Machine Building Industry still does not  conform to the standard prescribed by governmental decree.  Additionally, automated cash registers are slow to be introduced  in the trade sector. The Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers  therefore adopted a resolution providing for significantly  closer cooperation between the concerned parties in this  question.</p>

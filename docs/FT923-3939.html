			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK poultry losing out to low-cost competition BRITISH POULTRY producers face a gloomy future as imports from countries with laxer legislation and lower costs eat into the UK market, according to a report published yesterday. Food from Britain, which promotes British products both at home and abroad, estimates that the cost of UK legislation over and above European Community regulations on the industry is adding more than 4p a bird to UK costs, making the UK one of the highest cost producers. The trade deficit between exports and imports, which rose from Pounds 22m in 1989 to Pounds 83m last year, was Pounds 63.3m for the first half of this year alone. Imports could take 20 per cent of the UK market for the whole of this year, Mr Paul Judge, FFB chairman, said yesterday. He called on the government 'to act quickly to ensure the poultry meat industry can compete effectively and equally with its major competitors'. In addition, British producers should identify and exploit niche markets overseas. UK exports in 1991 amounted to 88,000 tonnes worth Pounds 123m. Mr Judge asserted that the UK industry faced much higher charges for compliance with EC legislation than did competitor countries, which stuck to the minimum prescribed levels. 'Even more important is the distorting effect of UK legislation which was mainly put in place with the laudable aim of protecting the British consumer.' The industry fully supported this aim, said Mr Judge, but the government did not apply the same standards to poultry imports, some of which were produced to standards that 'would be seriously illegal in this country'. Mr Robert Haynes, chairman of Buxted Poultry, part of the Hillsdown group, warned that the British poultry industry, which has retail sales of Pounds 1.4bn a year, was in danger of going 'the way of British motorcycles, British textiles and British fishing'. It had already suffered substantial closures and redundancies in the last two years, and 'I fear we have not seen the last'. He pointed out that the EC had reduced the levies on chickens from Thailand, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and had ended the levy on US imports - 'all for political rather than agricultural reasons'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuk: "Finnish Mediation Discussed </F> During Rybkin's Visit"]    [Excerpt] Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian parliament's  lower house, the Duma, thinks it would be good if Finland could  mediate in the conflict between Russia and Estonia regarding the  withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonian territory.    The question of troop withdrawals and potential Finnish  mediation was on the agenda during the speaker's visit to  Finland, which was concluded yesterday.    "I think it would be quite good," said Speaker Rybkin and  said that it could be useful to have a third party in the  negotiations between Russia and Estonia.    This, at least, was the conclusion that could be drawn from  the not too complete interpretation of Rybkin's message.    The negotiations between Russia and Estonia have not been  completely suspended, but they also have not progressed. Russia  has pledged to withdraw its troops from the Baltic states by the  last day of August of this year. But no agreement with Estonia  has been reached as yet. The fact that the troop withdrawal can  be accomplished according to the established timetable is one of  the conditions for Russia's acceptance by the European Council.    The Russians have not submitted any actual appeal for  mediation help, but the question was discussed with both  President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto.    Rybkin did not want to enter into how the Finnish hosts  reacted to the question.    Aho has previously taken a reserved position on a potential  mediation task, while President Ahtisaari has said that if  Finnish advice is needed the question must be treated seriously.    In any event, Ivan Rybkin is of the opinion that the sooner  the Russian troops are gone from the Baltic the better.    "Best of all would be if not a single Russian soldier  remained outside the borders of Russia."    [passage omitted]</p>

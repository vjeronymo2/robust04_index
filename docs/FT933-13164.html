			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Skoda Plzen nears Siemens pact SKODA Koncern Plzen, the Czech republic's largest engineering combine, is on the verge of finalising a joint venture with the German company Siemens to manufacture steam turbines. The deal ends two years of uncertainty over the future of Skoda Plzen's turbine division. Mr Lubomir Soudek, Skoda Plzen's chairman, indicated last week that he had given the Siemens team until the end of this week to agree to five main conditions. An official has confirmed that arrangements for the signing of the memorandum of understanding will be made this week. Discussions with Siemens relating to a transportation joint venture are not being pursued. Skoda Plzen already has joint ventures with Brown &amp; Root, and Dorries Scharmann and Secheron, and is separate from Skoda Auto, the car maker now owned by Volkswagen. The company is undergoing internal restructuring which has involved cutting the number of employees from 38,000 to 21,000. All 34 divisions had to show plans last month, the first time management had seen a breakdown of basic input costs like power consumption. New investment areas include eco-technology such as incinerators and nuclear waste fuel containers. A subsidiary is discussing with an American company plans to develop its prototype electric car. Skoda Plzen has also teamed up with Alcatel Alsthom to bid for a metro contract in Prague. In addition Skoda Plzen has signed a preliminary agreement with a Russian partner and is lobbying the Czech government to sell its inter-government discounted debt to finance the project. Skoda Plzen has also brought together a consortium of 12 Czech companies to produce arms to modernise the Czech and other east bloc armies. Mr Soudek, who was appointed managing director by the first post-revolution government and then sacked, was reappointed last autumn to turn the company around. His approach to the company's restructuring problems is to strike hard deals and look again at traditional markets like Russia, China and India. After falling into crisis last autumn, the company is owed Csk5.6bn (Pounds 127m) by other companies, equivalent to more than half last year's production, plus Csk1.3bn by the Czech government for 60 locomotives the state railway no longer wants.</p>

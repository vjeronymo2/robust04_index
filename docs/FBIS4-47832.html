			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulundi May 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday [4 May] said it was  extraordinary that claims of electoral fraud were being levelled  against his party in KwaZulu/Natal when provisional results  showed the IFP was "whipping" the African National Congress and  National Party [NP] in the province.    Speaking to the press during a break in a caucus meeting of  the KwaZulu legislative assembly in Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi warned  a Pandora's box could be opened if the allegations against the  IFP were accepted. The IFP leader said: "Our election has been  straight-forward."    He said the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] had  assured him on Wednesday morning that counting of votes in  Durban would continue after a hitch in the process because of  disputes.    Mr Buthelezi questioned why irregularities, which were  widespread, had been singled out in KwaZulu/Natal. He said this  was unusual since National Party leader F W de Klerk,  Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler and ANC leader Nelson Mandela had "huddled together"  and declared the elections free and fair.    According to provisional results the IFP was "whipping" the  ANC and NP in the region, Mr Buthelezi said, adding this proved  he was the undisputed leader in the province.    Having entered the election race at such a late stage and  with very little campaigning, the IFP's success was inspiring,  he said.    "That kind of confidence in me and my party inspires  me...and  braces me for the very hard road I know lies ahead," Mr  Buthelezi said.    He said he would be prepared to re-run elections in the  region "tomorrow" if it could be proved the process would be  foolproof.    Mr Buthelezi said the row over claims against his party by  the ANC was typical of what he was used to. "When the ANC  sneezes everyone catches cold; when I say something it's  ignored," Mr Buthelezi said.</p>

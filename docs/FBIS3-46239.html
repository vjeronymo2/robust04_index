			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the provincial government and  provincial military district held a joint meeting on protecting  military facilities. Liu Guoyu, member of the provincial party  committee's Standing Committee and commander of the provincial  military district, attended and addressed the meeting.    In his speech, Liu Guoyu said that the protection of  military  facilities involves military and civilian interests and requires  better cooperation on both sides. All kinds of interests should  be correctly handled. Leading groups in charge of military  facilities should carry out their responsibility to protect  military facilities. Regions without these leading groups  should form such groups as soon as possible according to the  relevant documents and should maintain relative stability among  their personnel. Towns, townships, and villages where military  facilities are situated, as well as enterprises, institutions,  and mass organizations near military facilities should,  coordinated by the local People's Armed Forces departments and  public security departments, form backbone contingents with  grass-roots-level cadres and militiamen as the main component  and should mobilize and rely on the masses to form a defense  network comprising soldiers, policemen, and civilians. They  should form organizations, work out plans, and frequently  supervise the implementation of these plans.    The relevant military departments and People's Armed Forces  departments should sign contracts with the protectors on  protecting military facilities and clarifying their duties and  responsibilities. Organizations in charge of military  facilities should take the lead in studying and enforcing the  law and should, according to legal standards and procedures,  handle problems arising in the protection of military facilities  so that the protection of military facilities can be carried out  under the legal system.    Vice Governor Su Xiaoyun presented a written speech to the  meeting.</p>

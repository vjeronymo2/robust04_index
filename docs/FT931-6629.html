			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Allies still sceptical about US air-drop: The need to find a balance between effectiveness and risk CONSULTATIONS and careful preparations for the US air-drop in eastern Bosnia have failed to disperse scepticism about the operation among Washington's allies and UN forces on the ground. Officers with UN forces in Bosnia, frustrated at their own inability to get relief supplies through to some of the communities most in need, say it will be difficult to achieve a balance between effectiveness and risk. Military experts believe an operation of this kind can in any case be no more than a temporary measure. The drops by four-engined C-130 Hercules aircraft are expected to made from anywhere between 5,000 and 15,000 feet, avoiding risks from small-arms fire and some kinds of anti-aircraft artillery. But although special parachutes designed for high-velocity drops will be used, accuracy cannot be assured. The bundles, containing up to 700kg of food and medicine, may land in the wrong area or cause casualties or damage in the intended zone. Leaflets dropped over the weekend warned people to wait until the containers have landed. Unlike most operations of this type, there will be no logistics troops on the ground to receive the supplies, organise distribution and recover equipment. Some of the apprehensions about the dangers of the operation - and the possibility, as Serb leaders warned, that it would lead to an escalation in the conflict - have been lessened by its reduced scale. Initial discussion of the plan, launched last month at a time when the UN High Commissioner for Refugues had suspended current aid supplies in Bosnia, pointed to an operation of greater dimensions and a more overtly military nature. However, although the US transport aircraft flying from Germany are now due to carry out the drops without cover from carrier-based fighters, there is concern about possible US military reaction if the C-130s come under attack. The danger is similar to that facing the aircraft ferrying relief to Sarajevo. A two-engined Italian G222 transport aircraft was shot down near the Bosnian capital last September, killing all four crew, and other aircraft have been hit by small-calibre weapons. The threat is seen as coming not only from uncontrolled Serb forces, who may not be satisfied by assurances that the supplies do not contain arms, but also from Moslem militiamen seeking to bring the US and its allies directly into the conflict. Many Bosnian Moslems and Croats criticise the aid effort for attempting to deal with the symptoms rather than the cause of suffering. UN forces are worried that if the US is provoked into using air power they will be exposed to direct attack. They have only limited means for defending themselves. The British army has some light artillery and locating radars waiting in reserve aboard a navy task force in the Adriatic. French forces have already moved in Mistral missiles to defend their positions in northwest Bosnia against air attack. Any escalation involving UN forces would threaten the running of aid convoys by land, which are the only practical means of providing the large volumes required, The US operation also raises questions about command arrangements for any future international action in former Yugoslavia. Like the warships monitoring shipping in the Adriatic, the air-drop operation is on UN authority but not directly under UN command. US military commanders favour a similar arrangement for any future US-Nato peacekeeping force.</p>

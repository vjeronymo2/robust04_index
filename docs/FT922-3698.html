			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Telegraph issues pathfinder prospectus THE offer for sale of The Telegraph, which owns the UK's largest selling daily quality newspaper, will cut the stake held by Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group from 87 per cent to 68 per cent. Hollinger will not then sell more shares, at least until the next accounts are published. The pathfinder prospectus issued yesterday promised investors a 10p net dividend for the current year, up from 9p for 1991. The prospectus shows earnings per share for 1991 were 25.4p, or 20.3p on a fully taxed basis. Pricing of the offer will be announced in the final prospectus, to be published on June 23. But analysts yesterday suggested the shares merited around a market rating. That indicates a value for the group of around Pounds 440m, with Hollinger raising about Pounds 85m. No new shares are being issued. Trading prospects for the group depend for the foreseeable future, the prospectus says, on the main titles' ability to increase advertising revenue which has been depressed in the recession. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 40.5m in 1991, up from Pounds 38.5m in 1990 and near to the 1989 peak of Pounds 41.5m. Further ahead, The Telegraph is expected to make acquisitions in the media. Analysts said that the offer should not suffer seriously from the announcement on Monday that the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers is to be the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation. Mr Black said he felt it his duty to look at buying the Mirror but that he was not enthusiastic at the prospect. However, Hollinger is in talks to buy the New York Daily News, and if successful The Telegraph could take a share of that. The prospectus details safeguards against Hollinger misusing its majority stake, such as having a majority of independent directors on the board and an audit committee. Applications in the public offer will close on July 1 and dealings should commence on July 8. Half the 26m shares to be sold will be offered to the British public. The rest of the shares will be placed with institutions, mainly in the UK but also in Canada. NM Rothschild is the merchant bank to the issue and Cazenove and Panmure Gordon are brokers.

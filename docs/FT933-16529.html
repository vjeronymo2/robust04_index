			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rohm to claim royalties from Intel ROHM, a Japanese semiconductor maker, said its US subsidiary would claim royalty fees from Intel of the US and other manufacturers of 'flash memory' chips. The move follows a US court ruling in a patent dispute between Rohm and Intel. Exel Microelectronics, a division of Rohm's US subsidiary, said the US Court of Appeals had set aside an earlier decision by the US Patent Office granting Intel 'priority' on the flash memory patent. The issue has been referred back to the patent office. 'No makers can make flash memories without using Rohm's patent,' Mr Junichi Shikita, managing director of Rohm's semiconductor operations, said. Intel, however, said it expected the patent office to reaffirm its earlier ruling. The process could take one to two years. It said: 'We don't believe that Rohm has a basis upon which to collect royalties.' Flash memory chips represent the fastest-growing segment of the memory chip market. Although world sales last year were only Dollars 310m, analysts project 'explosive growth', to Dollars 2.8bn by 1997. Flash memory can be used as an alternative to personal computer disk drives for storing programs and data. The chips are smaller, lighter and more rugged than magnetic data storage devices and are beginning to be used in the latest pocket-sized and notebook computers.</p>

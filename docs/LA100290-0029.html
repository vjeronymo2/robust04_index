			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CHANGE CONSIDERED IN FLOOD-PLAIN LAW  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors may change the county's flood-plain ordinance to  require that mobile homes be elevated when they are installed in parks to  prevent flood damage.  </P> <P> The supervisors will consider amending the ordinance Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ordinance change would apply to mobile homes at parks in flood-hazard  locations in the unincorporated area.  </P> <P> According to the revised ordinance, floors must be elevated one foot above the  ground. If they are not, the chassis must be placed on supporting foundations  three feet above the ground.  </P> <P> The change will bring the ordinance in line with what the Federal Emergency  Management Agency already requires to prevent excessive loss from flooding.  </P> <P> The county flood ordinance now has no elevation requirements for mobile homes  in parks.  </P> <P> The ordinance change would not affect mobile homes already in parks in  flood-plain areas, unless they suffer significant damage in a flood, said Bill  Haydon, senior engineer for the county public works agency. Then, the home must  meet elevation requirements after repairs are made. JANE HULSE  </P></p>

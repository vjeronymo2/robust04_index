			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Social Democratic Party politician  Hans Gottfried Bernrath has harshly criticized the reform of the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) planned by FRG  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union).  "I cannot imagine that in case of police operations a  leadership team, some sort of executive committee, would be able  to react quickly and with responsibility," the chairman of the  Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee said on Monday [7 March] in  an interview with Saarland Radio.    Bernrath criticized the steps taken by Kanther as a result  of  the failed antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen as  "half-hearted measures." They consist of "personnel questions  and not organizational tasks." If the minister is of the  opinion that BKA chief Hans-Ludwig Zachert is not able to  fulfill his task, Zachert must be replaced. It is "certainly  not correct" for the ministry to have greater influence on the  BKA either, because the ministry is "even more tangled than the  BKA and its structure is even less manageable."    In his 46-page final report on Bad Kleinen, which became  known to DPA at the weekend, Kanther lists many mistakes  committed by the security forces. In an interview with  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG he also announced that he will include  Zachert in a BKA "leadership characterized by teamwork" and  intensify the ministry's influence on this authority. For  reasons of civil service law, the 56-year-old official cannot be  transferred.    During the operation in Bad Kleinen, a small town in  Mecklenburg, more than eight months ago, Wolfgang Grams, a  suspected terrorist of the Red Army Faction (RAF), as well as a  GSG-9 man were shot dead. Kanther's final report affirms that  the judiciary assumes that Grams committed suicide. His  companion, suspected RAF terrorist Birgit Hogefeld, was arrested.    In the meantime, experts have obviously come to a new  assessment of the terrorist group: "The RAF no longer exists as  one single entity," Norbert Wingerter of the Bavarian Office for  the Protection of the Constitution writes in the technical  journal MAGAZINE FOR ECONOMICS, CRIME, AND SECURITY [Zeitschrift  fuer Wirtschaft, Kriminalitaet und Sicherheit]. He is the head  of the "Extremism/Terrorism Assessment" Department and  summarizes his views: RAF command, arrested terrorists, and  sympathizers are profoundly split, in particular regarding the  issue of armed operations.</p>

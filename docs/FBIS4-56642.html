			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brasilia, 5 May (EFE) -- A Brazilian Foreign  Ministry spokesperson told EFE today that Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu today guaranteed his Brazilian colleague,  Celso Amorim, that Uruguay will not withdraw from the  negotiations to establish the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) import tariffs.    Abreu got ahold of Amorim in Paris, where he is on an  official visit, and during a telephone conversation denied a  report published in Montevideo claiming that Uruguay had decided  to withdraw from the negotiations due to disagreements over the  Brazilian initiative to create a free trade zone in South  America.    The Uruguayan delegation today continued its participation  in  Mercosur's Common Market Group, the main technical level for the  integration mechanism, which is meeting this week in the  Argentine capital.

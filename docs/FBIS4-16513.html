			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview in Bishkek with Askar Akayev, president of </F> Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], by Valeriy Konovalov, date not given:  "Askar Akayev Sets Precedent in Solution of Problem of  Russian-Speaking Population"]    [Text] Bishkek -- In the past two years 120,000 people of  Slav nationality, mainly Russians, have left Kirghizia. But the  remarkable fact is that 20,000 have already returned.    "Our native Russians" -- that was the term frequently used  in  our conversation by President Akayev when talking about the  local Russian-speaking population, and it would seem that this  is not a question of my interlocutor's eastern character.  Akayev acknowledged that the opposition constantly accuses him  of pro-Russian feelings. And this is not without reason. There  are too many factors linking the Kirghiz president with Russia  and Russian culture. His 17 years of life, study, and  scientific work in Leningrad, and his family tree.    It turns out that he is the direct descendant of the Kirghiz  khan who sent the first Kirghiz envoys to Russia back in the  18th century. Another of Akayev's forebears took part with  General Skobelev in the annexation of Kirghizia to Russia.    Akayev tells of another curious and, to some extent,  sensational fact from his family history. He is quite closely  related to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. Askar  Akayev's mother is a Kazakh. Once, when (briefly) head of the  science department of the Kirghiz Communist Party Central  Committee, he was in Alma-Ata [Almaty] for an interrepublic  event. On that occasion a member of his family pointed to a man  and said: That is Nazarbayev, our maternal second cousin....    Meanwhile, Akayev does not fear the charges of  "pro-Russianism" because he is convinced that the  interdependence of Kirghizia and Russia is an objective fact.  Why?    The problem of the ethnic Russians in Kirghizia is more  acute  than in other Central Asian republics because there are far more  of them here -- almost a quarter of the population. In the main  the Russian speakers are employed in industry, 90 percent of  which consists of military-industrial complex enterprises. They  constitute the most highly skilled workers and the  intelligentsia -- in other words, a valuable pool of manpower  which the republic could ill afford to lose. That is how things  stand from Kirghizia's viewpoint.    But Russia, too, must objectively have an interest in  preserving the mighty Russian diaspora in our country, Akayev  believes. For any country its diaspora in any other country is  a factor of influence, a geopolitical factor.    Akayev and his team are now completing work on a state  program of measures aimed at retaining the Russian-speaking  population in the country. This unprecedentedly large-scale  action is already bearing its first fruit. Until quite  recently, according to the opinion polls, the language problem  was top of the list among the causes of distress to the  nonindigenous population, but that problem has now slipped down  to sixth place.    This has happened, the president explained, because this  problem was entirely within the bounds of our competence to  resolve. But, unfortunately, not everything depends on us  alone. That was why we needed major support from Russia -- and  recently we got it.    It proved possible not only to give Russian the status of  the  second state language, Akayev explained, but also to insist on  the ratification in the Constitution of a standard forbidding  any infringement of people's interests on the grounds of their  lack of knowledge of the state language. A special law is now  being prepared which will enable the law-enforcement organs to  combat any discrimination in this regard.    Akayev's main pride and joy is surely the Kirghiz-Russian  Slav University, which is into its second year's work in the  republic now, enjoys considerable popularity, and is being  maintained on principles of parity. There are not only Slav  students but Kirghiz, too. There are also students from  neighboring republics. Incidentally, President Nazarbayev of  Kazakhstan has already shown an interest in making the  university interregional.    This is of great significance for our native Russians,  Akayev  said. This has given them the confidence that their children  can get a good education in their own language.    But all of these things, let us recall, relate only to the  Kirghiz side. Other factors -- economic ones -- have now risen  to the top among the factors causing distress to the  Russian-speaking population in Kirghizia.    We have been forced to suspend production at the majority of  enterprises, Askar Akayev stressed. Primarily because of a lack  of orders and shortages of components. We are talking about  enterprises in the military-industrial complex. Mainly  purpose-built enterprises. For example, they produce submarines  at a level which is unparalleled anywhere in the world. In  addition, we also have a purpose-built test base at Issyk-Kul, a  deep-water clear lake. There are unique electronics  enterprises, too. I am convinced that closing them down would  be a mistake. After all, there is a social problem here, too:  That of Russian specialists left without work. That is why we  put a suggestion to Russia -- let us share this problem equally  and perhaps involve third countries. For example, we could  issue shares in unique production units in such a way that  Russia would have a large bloc of shares, perhaps the main bloc.    There is another painful problem -- citizenship.    I have always favored dual citizenship, Akayev said.    But your relative Nazarbayev is a fundamental opponent of  it,  I pointed out, and you can see his point of view. In the event  of the introduction of dual citizenship in Kazakhstan an  enormous proportion of the ethnic Russians will become citizens  of Russia and there is the potential danger of a territorial  conflict.    There is a great difference here, Akayev explained. We do  not have a border with Russia and there can be no territorial  problems here. Thus dual citizenship can only be a benefit for  the Russian-speaking population in our country. The Uzbeks are  a different matter, however. They live in the border region in  our country and Kirghiz live in the border region of Uzbekistan,  so in this case dual citizenship could play a negative role.  Islam Karimov and I have agreed that for our countries the  problem of dual citizenship is a closed question. In principle,  I advocated and continue to advocate dual citizenship not as an  abstract norm, but as a subject of interstate agreements. As  for Russia and the Russian-speaking citizens, we should have no  problems here.</p>

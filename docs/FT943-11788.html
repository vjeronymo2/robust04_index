			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fairline boarded by South Africans The Newington family has relinquished majority control of Fairline Boats, the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker which has enjoyed a resurgence in demand and profits over the last 12 months. It has sold a 29.9 per cent stake to Renwick Group, a Devon-based maker of yachts and motor cruisers owned by Kangra Holdings, a South African group. Renwick paid 350p a share for 1m shares against an unchanged closing price of 400p. The Newington family will retain a 24.74 per cent stake. Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said the intention of the sale was to 'free up the family holding.' Fairline would 'continue to operate independently under its existing management' and Renwick had not sought representation on the board, he said. The agreement states that no Newington family member can sell shares for 6 months. Mr Newington said there were no rationalisation plans and the dividend policy remains unchanged.</p>

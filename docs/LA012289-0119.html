			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN NATURE?  </P> <P> Escondido Police Officer Martin Hewlett shot Robert Scriven at least 11 times  at close range, and Police Chief Vince Jimno defends the action by saying,  "It's human nature to shoot until the attacker stops."  </P> <P> If it took this much firepower to stop the 170-pound Scriven, then Officer  Hewlett was certainly in grave danger, more than anyone can possibly imagine.  </P> <P> The "human nature" factor that Chief Jimno cites is probably the reason why  officer Hewlett fired 15 rounds total, but does it excuse him? Law enforcement  officials have a great responsibility to the public, and part of that  responsibility is to have a better control of their "human nature" than the  average citizen.  </P> <P> If I'm out of work and homeless and my children are hungry, and I take up a gun  and rob a gas station to get money to buy my children food, will Chief Jimno  defend me by pointing out that it is only human nature for me to want to feed  my hungry children?  </P> <P> WILLIAM HOMANN  </P> <P> San Marcos  </P></p>

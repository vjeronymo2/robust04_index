			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV REBUFFS EFFORT TO NAME YELTSIN TO KEY POST  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing his first political rebellion in the  Soviet Union's new national legislature, rebuffed attempts Wednesday to name  Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist politician, as the head of the  government's principal watchdog body.  </P> <P> After more than an hour of very sharp debate, Gorbachev secured the Supreme  Soviet's confirmation of Gennady V. Kolbin, the Communist Party leader in the  Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, as chairman of the People's  Control Commission, which oversees the government's activities and audits its  spending.  </P> <P> But, for Gorbachev, it was an unexpected challenge in which the central issue  was not the popularity of Yeltsin nor the qualifications of Kolbin but what  kind of legislature the new Supreme Soviet will be and what kind of leadership  Gorbachev will exercise as its chairman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Prove More Difficult  </P> <P> Gorbachev will be able to have his way -- that was never seriously in doubt --  but it could prove difficult and more costly as the deputies insist on the  independence of the new 542-seat legislature, which was elected from within the  larger assembly, the Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> Speaker after speaker rose to say, "I'm for Yeltsin," and the clamor did not  diminish even after Gorbachev's announcement that the popular Siberian  politician, former leader of the Moscow party organization and deputy minister  of the building industry, would -- by agreement -- instead head a legislative  commission overseeing capital construction.  </P> <P> Some disputed Kolbin's qualifications for the watchdog role, although he has  been appointed three times in the last two decades to purge party organizations  after the dismissal of leaders accused of corruption.  </P> <P> "Where is the democratic alternative?" one young deputy asked Gorbachev. "To  prove that this is a real democracy, please offer us an alternative candidate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Same Pattern Appears'  </P> <P> "Consistently, the same pattern appears -- we are approving your appointees,  but not making the selections ourselves," he added. "In fact, Comrade  Gorbachev, we are just voting in people you selected and nominated."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, irritated by this and other criticism, replied bluntly: "Under the  constitution, you can accept or reject my choice. Put me at the starting point,  and I will think again. But first you must do that."  </P> <P> In a plea to "trust the Supreme Soviet, trust the people," half a dozen  deputies urged Gorbachev to include both Kolbin and Yeltsin on a secret ballot.  </P> <P> Even those who expressed their uneasiness with Yeltsin's populist style,  particularly the large following he has built in Moscow and other major cities,  said that he should be on the ballot simply so that people would not contend  that the Establishment is trying methodically to isolate him and exclude him  from real power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservative Support  </P> <P> Strong support came, however, from Central Asian deputies who form the  Congress' conservative wing and who have shown themselves in the Supreme  Soviet's first meetings to be the group most responsive to Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, called upon to save the situation, lumbered up to the rostrum at  Gorbachev's request. Describing himself and Kolbin as "both comrades and  friends," Yeltsin said: "I consider that he is a person who, from a political  viewpoint and from his experience, his businesslike qualities, his adherence to  principle and his attitude to people, is completely suitable to be entrusted  with this post."  </P> <P> Calling for a vote, Gorbachev tallied 34 votes against Kolbin, who was the only  nominee, 53 recorded abstentions and the rest were presumed in favor of his  nomination.  </P> <P> But probably half of the 542 members, all but about 30 of whom were present,  appeared to observers in the press balcony and viewers on television not to  have taken part in the vote.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, attempting to curtail the free-wheeling debate in the Congress, now  a week beyond its original schedule, later won approval for a timetable that  would bring the session to a conclusion Friday, with a further session of the  Supreme Soviet on Saturday.  </P> <P> With an important four-day trip to West Germany starting Monday, Gorbachev  clearly hopes that this will prove sufficient excuse to bring the two bodies  back under at least the restraints of time.  </P> <P> In the first analysis of the composition of the Supreme Soviet, which will be  the country's permanent legislature but still subject to the Congress of  People's Deputies, the weekly Moscow News reported on Wednesday that 370 of the  members in its two chambers were government or party officials, that 99 were  blue- or white-collar workers or farmers, 68 were highly qualified specialists,  such as scientists, and five were pensioners.  </P> <P> Comparing the composition with the last Supreme Soviet, which was effectively  appointed by the Communist Party rather than elected, the newspaper found that  the role of the leadership and top and middle echelons of officials has  declined -- as has that of the workers and farmers. But the share of seats held  by lower-level officials and the intelligentsia has increased.  </P></p>

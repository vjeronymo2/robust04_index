			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Deng's homeland struggles to match coastal China: Inland Sichuan's efforts to close the development gap Governor Xiao Yang of Sichuan, China's most populous province, feels a bit like an oriental Sisyphus pushing endlessly a large boulder to the top of a mountain. Trying to close a yawning development gap between his rugged, landlocked province and the booming coastal regions brings more than its share of frustrations. 'I haven't seen the peak yet,' he says. 'Of course, I understand how difficult it is to balance development in this period of China's economic transformation.' Sichuan, with its population of more than 100m, many of whom live in remote mountainous areas, lags far behind the wealthier coastal provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong and the 'city states' of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Sichuan's problems of distance from markets and poor infrastructure are typical of those of 'inland' provinces. Unbalanced development in which poorer provinces are getting relatively poorer threatens the cohesiveness of China's reforms and risks feeding dissatisfaction among the disadvantaged such as the peasants of the hinterland. For the proud and resourceful Sichuanese whose favourite son is Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, it is painful to contemplate existence as 'poor cousins' to the prospering residents of the east coast, especially as Sichuan was the crucible of groundbreaking agricultural and industrial reforms in the late 1970s. It was, ironically, Mr Deng himself who fuelled the surge of new investment into coastal areas when he launched the second stage of his economic revolution - the first phase began in 1978 - with a visit early in 1992 to southern regions, including Guangdong, adjacent to Hong Kong. Governor Xiao notes wryly that when he goes to coastal areas these days he is reminded constantly by fellow officials that Sichuan now is the source of a flood of vagabond itinerant workers or mangliu (literally 'blind roamers') who have streamed out of the province in search of work. It is in the crowded streets of Chengdu and Chongqing, the province's main cities, and in the verdant but overpopulated rural areas, that the development gap - and enduring poverty - is most obvious. Human 'beasts of burden' - men and women dragging heavily laden two-wheeled carts - are commonplace, and in the fields there is little sign of the mechanisation that is transforming the lives of prosperous coastal peasants, freeing them to engage in more remunerative activities such as work in township and village enterprises. Chen Kuan Jin, senior economist in Sichuan's Planning Commission, says that in spite of a concerted effort to attract new investment and enliven the local economy through hastening economic reforms the gap with coastal provinces is 'growing larger'. Sichuan's economy grew last year by 12.8 per cent compared with the national average of 13.4. Ten years ago it ranked fourth or fifth in China in gross national product: now it is down to sixth place. But it is in new investment that the contrast is starkest. Last year Sichuan attracted Dollars 850m in pledged foreign investment. Utilised investment for Guangdong, whose growth rates were about twice the national average, was Dollars 9.65bn. Capital investment in Guangdong last year reached Yn300bn (Pounds 22.5bn) against Yn63bn for Sichuan. Unemployment rates, at 3.4 per cent, are higher in Sichuan than the national average of 2.6 per cent. Wages are about 15 per cent lower than the national average. Some 80 per cent of Sichuan's population of 100m live in rural areas. Of these, 44m are classed as 'able bodied workers' but surplus rural labour totals about 20m. This means that Sichuan has China's largest pool of surplus labour - about one-sixth of a huge army of rural workers nationwide whose livelihoods cannot be sustained by small family holdings. Sichuanese officials estimate that about 5m peasants have left the province in search of work, drifting to the coastal regions and the larger cities. In a way this has proved a blessing for Sichuan's economy since these itinerant workers are remitting Yn15bn annually to support their impoverished families. But feelings have been running high among hard-pressed rural workers who sense they are being left behind in China's economic boom. One of China's worst cases of recent rural unrest occurred in June last year when peasants protesting against higher taxes besieged officials in a county headquarters near Chengdu, Sichuan's capital, holding them hostage for several days. Apart from its problems of excess rural labour and an undeveloped infrastructure, Sichuan is also burdened by a slew of heavily indebted and over-manned state-run industries. A number are defence-related, re-located in the inland province in the 1960s to protect them from attack after Chairman Mao Zedong concluded that a third world war involving China was inevitable. But the news for Sichuan is not all gloomy: indeed, the central government in Beijing, sensing there are flaws, not to mention risks of social unrest, in a policy of allowing the coastal provinces their head economically in the hope that this would drag the hinterland along with them, is now giving more attention to balancing development. Additional funds are being allocated for spending on infrastructure such as new airports, railway lines and telecommunications. Tax advantages accruing to the coastal regions are now also being made available to inland provinces. But for Governor Xiao the task of restoring Sichuan to the front rank is not proving easy. Not least of his difficulties is persuading people, and investors in particular, that Sichuan is more than, in his words, 'very remote, full of peasants and a place of exile'.</p>

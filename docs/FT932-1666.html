			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Treuhand to tighten upcontrol of contracts: Department set up to oversee agreements THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, is setting up a department aimed at tightening control and supervision over the implementation of purchase contracts. Mr Hero Brahms, vice-president of the Treuhand, who will oversee a department of 350 to 550 accountants and lawyers, said it was crucial to introduce greater accountability into contracts signed between the Treuhand and investors since it was set up in late 1990. 'We have to make sure that the investments the Treuhand have earmarked for environment clean-up, for instance, are honoured by these enterprises,' he said at a press conference in Berlin yesterday. 'Moreover, we have to monitor that investment commitments and job guarantees undertaken by purchasers are also implemented.' Since late 1990, the Treuhand has signed more than 40,000 contracts, including sales of real estate. Most of the contracts are anchored on two principles: guaranteeing a certain number of jobs coupled with investment programmes spread over several years by the purchaser. Under these contracts, the Treuhand has secured DM179bn (Pounds 71.8bn) investment commitments, and 1.46m job guarantees. Privatisation receipts are less than DM50bn. Few Treuhand officials, however, are prepared to forecast how many workers will lose their jobs in these privatised industries once the contracts end. The proportion of unemployed, including those in part-time work, or on job creation and training schemes is more than 30 per cent in each of the five east German states. So far, 3,000 enterprises have asked the Treuhand to amend the contracts. But Mr Brahms said most of these amendments were minor. 'Some investors found that they had to retrospectively deal with outstanding claims on property rights, and others have asked for reductions of guaranteed work places of between one and 10 employees. The contracts were unclear. These problems are manageable,' he said. Of that number the Treuhand yesterday said it was renegotiating 400 contracts, or 1 per cent of the agency's total amount. Some involve non-payment by German and foreign companies, mismanagement of Treuhand grants, corruption, and enterprises facing difficulties caused by the collapse of the markets in eastern Europe. But Mr Brahms insisted that the Treuhand would not take back any of the enterprises. 'Our job is to privatise. Taking back any enterprise would set a very bad precedent,' an agency official said. The Treuhand has already started monitoring 6,405 job guarantee contracts concluded in 1992, which secure 411,519 jobs. Of those, Mr Brahms thought fewer than 8,000 jobs would not have been honoured. However, the system of penalties whereby the enterprise would have to compensate any job losses outweighed any short-term advantage in cutting the workforce.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHANNON RECALLED  </P> <P> Unfortunately, in real life rock singer Del Shannon couldn't "Runaway" from his  problems, which included periodic bouts of depression, alcoholism, perpetual  lawsuits over his share of royalties, missed opportunities, loneliness, a  broken first marriage and a lifelong inability to accept the cold and cruel  fact that fame is fleeting.  </P> <P> However, in spite of his problems, Shannon remains a rock 'n' roll legend.  </P> <P> He was not only a great singer with an impressive string of hits ("Runaway,"  "Hats Off to Larry," "Little Town Flirt," "Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the  Sun)"), but one of the few early rockers to write his own material.  </P> <P> His success in the early 1960s kept rock 'n' roll alive at a time when its  popularity was beginning to wane. He will indeed be missed.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN, Cypress  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: NatWest clashes with Maxwell pension funds A DISPUTE has broken out between the Maxwell empire's beleaguered pension funds and National Westminster Bank over the ownership of shares worth Pounds 28m in Teva Pharmaceutical, an Israeli concern. NatWest said yesterday that it had not made a decision on whether to keep the shares, in which the Maxwell pension funds claim an interest. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, confirmed that the bank had been approached by Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which acted as both manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds. Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, said the bank had been given no conclusive evidence that the shares were the property of the pension funds. He said the bank had been given the shares as security against a modest loan to the Maxwell private companies shortly after Mr Robert Maxwell died last November. Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Robert Maxwell's son, had pledged the shares to NatWest. 'We took them in good faith', said Mr Melbourn. 'We cannot simply give them back without investigating the pension funds' claim. What would our shareholders say if we did?'</p>

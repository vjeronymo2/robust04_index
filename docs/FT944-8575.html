			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Kenya central bank to halt widespread fraud The Central Bank of Kenya is introducing new banking regulations, including the vetting of directors and managers of commercial banks, to prevent the recurrence of fraud and other financial malpractices which robbed it of hundreds of millions of dollars last year. The Kenyan parliament is expected to approve amendments to the banking act next week which will allow the central bank to scrutinise the 'moral and professional suitability of persons proposed to manage or control financial institutions'. The bank will have the power to withdraw a bank's trading licence if it is not satisfied. Another amendment aims to end the practice of 'insider lending' - through which the owners of some Kenyan banks help themselves to cheap credit - by lowering a bank's maximum permitted exposure to a single borrower from 100 per cent of shareholders' capital and reserves to 25 per cent. Mr A Wanguria, director of the central bank's supervision department, believes the reforms will bring more professionalism to Kenya's financial sector. 'Twenty-eight banks have failed in the past 10 years,' Mr Wanguria said. 'They all had weak boards of directors, who knew little about banking. There was also a lot of mismanagement, insider lending, and few of the banks were properly capitalised. 'If we want a stable banking system,' he said, 'we must start by ensuring that the board of directors, main shareholders and managers of banks are competent professionals.' The central bank recorded a net loss of 4.5bn shillings (Pounds 42m) in the financial year which ended in June 1993, partly as a result of making large unsecured loans to three local banks which have since been liquidated. Known as 'political banks' for their ties to influential Kenyan politicians, the banks had acted as conduits for government funds to ensure support for the ruling Kanu party in the run-up to the 1992 general elections. After the elections, the 'political banks' ran into severe liquidity problems, and used their influence to obtain irregular credit from the central bank. Mr Micah Cheserem, who took over as governor of the central bank after the losses were incurred, is still trying to recover some 6bn shillings of monies owed to the central bank. Not only were the loans unsecured; Mr Cheserem believes there was also a conspiracy to defraud the bank. Senior treasury and central bank officials are under investigation. The owner of one of the banks liquidated last year is in detention awaiting trial.</p>

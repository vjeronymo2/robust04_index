Weinberger,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974) stopped SSA from recovering overpaid Social Security benefits without giving each member of the plaintiff class adequate written notice of the overpayment determination, the right to contest such determination and the right to a pre-recoupment hearing. Moreover, the court stopped SSA from taking any action to recover the overpayments before affording the class member the opportunity for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The court ordered that the written notice must include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A statement of the alleged overpayment, an explanation of the basis for the overpayment and SSA's proposed action to recover the overpayment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A statement of the individual's right to a pre-recoupment hearing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instructions and forms for requesting a pre-recoupment hearing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation that if the person did not request a pre-recoupment hearing within 30 days of the date of mailing of the overpayment notice, it would be presumed that the person waived his/her right to the hearing and recovery of the alleged overpayment would begin;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A statement of any other administrative relief available (i.e., reconsideration of the fact and/or amount of overpayment and waiver of recovery of the overpayment); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A statement that the local SSA office would help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The court also ordered the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. SSA had to restore all benefits withheld from the named plaintiffs pending an opportunity for a pre-recoupment hearing. The person had to be given the opportunity to examine his/her claims file at least 5 days prior to the date of the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The pre-recoupment hearing had to be conducted by an SSA employee who had no prior knowledge of the events leading to the overpayment determination and the decision to recover the overpayment. At the hearing the person requesting waiver had to be given the opportunity to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Personally appear, testify, and cross-examine any witnesses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

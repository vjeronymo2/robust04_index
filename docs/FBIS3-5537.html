			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japan Communist Party Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa </F> by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date  not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Japan Communist Party  [JCP] criticizes the relationship between the ruling coalition  parties and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] for being a  "single seat constituency Yokusan [The Yokusan Seiji Kai was a  political organization created by the militarist government in  1942 to promote national solidarity] system."    [Fuwa] During the deliberations on the political reform  bills, the Diet's Yokusan nature after the coalition  government's birth became evident. This was demonstrated by the  Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] endless, repeated  compromises. Even the "heiritsu" system proposal, combining  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, was  initiated by the LDP, which calls itself a strong opposition  party, when it was in power. It is more than clear that the LDP  is supporting the coalition through policy coordination. Mr.  Hosokawa increasingly resembles his grandfather, former Prime  Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Like the Taisei Yokusan Kai [national  organization for political control created in 1940] during the  Konoe administration, most of the former opposition parties were  coopted into the political regime, and a "new Yokusan  structure," which has even made the LDP fall in line, was  formed. This made the passage of the reform bills possible.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As a result of the House of  Councillors' rejection of the bills, the system for proportional  representation was changed into a bloc system, which is  disadvantageous to the JCP. Was it a strategic error on your  part?    [Fuwa] Some people said that it would have been better for  the upper house not to reject the bills. That is a criticism  that came after everything was over. For once, at least we  succeeded in pushing for the bills' rejection. That is very  different from accepting without putting up a fight.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will you put up your own candidates  for all 300 electoral districts under the new system? How would  you campaign in the electoral blocs?    [Fuwa] It goes without saying that we will do our best under  whatever electoral system there is. We will put up candidates  and fight in both the single-seat and  proportional-representation constituencies. Even if the  proportional representation elections will be fought in several  blocs, we will fight in these elections and try to avoid making  them impersonal campaigns.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you stand by your decision to  refuse any government subsidy for your party?    [Fuwa] There will be no change in that policy even after the  system of subsidies for political parties goes into effect. It  is our goal to work for an end to this system as soon as  possible. From the experience of other countries, it is clear  that official subsidies will only corrupt the political parties.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of future political  alignment under the new system?    [Fuwa] There has been talk of political realignment since  the time of the LDP regime. The political regime has become a  more nasty one after they experimented. Under the present  political framework, no matter how hard the political forces  other than the JCP try to create two or three major forces, they  will be nothing more than alliances of convenience, and there  can be nothing new. What we need now is to create a new trend of  working for the people's interests.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There has been dissension among the  ruling parties on account of the national welfare tax and other  issues. Do you think this will be the start of a realignment?    [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration's strategy is to take  care of hiking the consumption tax rate before the upper house  elections in summer 1995. The SDPJ is said to have resisted  this. However, its counterproposal is not much different from  the national welfare tax. The SDPJ's opposition and resistance  consists of nothing more than postponing the issue for one year.  I do not think the SDPJ will ever part ways with the  administration and be the receptacle of the people's criticisms  against the tax hike.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How would you confront the Hosokawa  administration at the Budget Committee and on other occasions?    [Fuwa] The Hosokawa administration is a successor to LDP  politics. There is a tremendous gap between its slogans of  reform and its real substance. We will vigorously oppose the  budget draft, which has done nothing about subsidies and  preferential tax treatment to big business and which is  one-sidedly in favor of arms expansion, as evidenced by  increased appropriations for U.S. military bases, and the  purchase of AWACS (airborne warning and control system). Of  course, we will also pursue the issue of the prime minister's  alleged acceptance of 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin  Trucking Company.</p>

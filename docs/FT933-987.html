			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Fashion: Black is back for a Puritan's night out - But layers of chiffon help lighten the mood IF AUTUMN'S new style has the minimalist, monochrome appeal of a nun's habit, then evening wear can provide some light relief. Dressing for a celebration is, surely, an excuse for some jolly jewellery or the glint of a gilt button? Not in the view of fashion purists. High evening wear for winter festivities will indeed be rich with beading and the multiple textures of velvet, chiffon and lace, but it will all be black - or the most sombre of medieval shades. And for anything less formal, 'plain' is the only word that counts. Evening wear is the final area to succumb to the new Puritan simplicity. Last winter women who had already pushed their sharp little suits to the back of the wardrobe were happy to step out at night in pert bustiers and short, bright skirts. But now, as the key recessionary mood lingers, even celebration is in soft focus. Although evening style is simple and unadorned, it is not heavy or dull. Instead it is based on a delicate lightness and the finest of fabrics. In the past, the philosophy of evening wear has too often been 'more is more' with attention on decoration rather than clever cut. But a plain dress relies on the cutter's art and the choice of fluid, flattering material for its success. The way to achieve subtle evening fragility is with transparent but matt fabrics, primarily chiffon. The newest way with sheers is to layer them. One layer is completely transparent; two are tantalisingly veiled; three and you might as well wear a solid fabric unles the outer one is cut to float free and create a diaphanous lightness. Single-layer chiffon is often contrasted with a rich, deep texture in the form of devore, or cut, velvet. Chiffon now is about softness, not nudity. At a summer party in Cambridge in the 1960s I remember earnest male undergraduates crowding round a girl better-known as a dollybird than a brainbox. They were probably not hanging on her every word - she was wearing the university's first recorded see-through blouse over nothing at all. By the hardened, unshockable 1980s, a sheer blouse over a worn-to-be-seen Wonderbra was standard nightclubbing gear for teenagers. The inevitable reaction has now set in. The underpinnings for chiffon should be as concealing as possible and the puffed-up cleavage has all but disappeared. So, along with sheer layers, you may need some new lingerie. The Wonderbra illustrates the point. At fashion-forward stores, its sales are now being matched by those of Gossard Glossies, Pounds 11.99, another 1970s revival but this time a totally smooth, plunge-fronted, lightly underwired 'no-bra' style that gives a natural shape. Alternatives include Jockey's plain cotton, almond-coloured, elasticated edge briefs, Pounds 3.99, and crop-top, Pounds 6.50, though this has rather wide shoulder straps, and Knickerbox's cotton/Lycra, cup-stitched crop-top, or camisole, both Pounds 6.99 from their Brilliant Basics range, available in black or white. There is also the more grown-up version of visible lingerie, such as Marks and Spencer's pretty black or burgundy stretch lace tank top, Pounds 9.99, which looks equally good under chiffon or on show. Sheer layers are strong at every market level. Chanel and St. Laurent revel in them for couture, but realistically the most luxurious is Flyte Ostell, who produces plain and beautiful layers, either tunic-style or bias-cut and sometimes mixed with satin or cashmere. Ellis Flyte was previously a lingerie designer with a gift for bias-cutting while Richard Ostell was known for high-quality, understated daywear. Their teaming has proved a winning combination. Zoran is the more exotic American equivalent, available at Browns in London, and English Eccentrics has had a great success with its classical motif devore chiffon and velvet. Evening transparency need not be expensive. Jigsaw, Whistles, River Island and Marks and Spencer all use synthetic chiffon and georgette to great effect and at reasonable prices. Ex-film designer Andrea Galer has a new ready-to-wear range of simple evening pieces in heavy silk crepe but will make to order in other fabrics and sizes.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Woodchester declines to IPounds 35m despite purchases THE RECESSION in the UK and last autumn's ERM crisis were the principal causes of an 11 per cent fall in 1992 pre-tax profits from IPounds 39.6m to IPounds 35.4m (Pounds 35.6m) at Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group. The results were in line with market expectations for the company, in which Credit Lyonnais has a 48.7 per cent holding. Over the year the asset base rose 25 per cent to IPounds 1.4bn (IPounds 1.12bn) and the deposit base 65 per cent to IPounds 571m, largely as a result of the March 1992 acquisition of UDT First Southern Bank. Analysts estimated that bad debt provisions have only marginally risen from IPounds 15m to about IPounds 17.5m, a far better performance, they say, than many leasing companies in the UK, which have been badly hit by recession. An estimated IPounds 2.5m was incurred in hedging costs during the last quarter as short-term interest rates soared during the ERM crisis and the punt came under pressure following sterling's devaluation. The funding base comes largely from corporate deposits at one-month rates, while the group had hedged at longer rates of three and six months, analysts say. A similar loss is estimated for the first part of 1993, before the crisis ended with the punt's devaluation. Earnings per share were 15.1p, compared with 17p last time. A final dividend of 2.69p (2.24p) is recommended for a total increased from 3.75p to 4.5p.</p>

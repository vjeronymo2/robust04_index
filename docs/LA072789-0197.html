			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFBEAT SPORTS ATTRACT 38 COMPETITORS FROM COUNTY  </P> <P>  -- They can not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered typical  spectator sports.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, very few Southern California high schools give out varsity  letters in field hockey, team handball, canoeing or kayaking.  </P> <P> It is only at the national and international levels that these very low-profile  activities manage to gain a measure of recognition.  </P> <P> The U. S. Olympic Festival, which began last Saturday and concludes Sunday, is  an event which provides such an opportunity.  </P> <P> And the 38 Ventura County athletes participating in the three sports are taking  full advantage of it.  </P> <P> In the men's field hockey competition, exactly half of the 50 participants  split among the four regional teams list Ventura County cities as their  hometown.  </P> <P> A first-round game between the West and the South last Sunday resembled a  Conejo Valley all-star scrimmage. Of the 30 players taking part in the game, 24  were from the East end of Ventura County, former home of the sport's national  federation.  </P> <P> Appropriately enough, the game ended in a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> Mark Ruvalcaba of Thousand Oaks scored the South's only goal 7:55 into the  game. The West's scoring came from Ventura's Benjamin Maruquin, whose goal came  with four minutes left in the half.  </P> <P> The South missed a chance to go ahead on a penalty attempt when John O'Neill of  Newbury Park kicked a shot over the top of the goal with seven minutes left in  the game.  </P> <P> A Festival single-session record crowd of 1,084 watched goalkeeper Tom Vano of  Simi Valley secure five saves for the West.  </P> <P> After two games, the South and West are both undefeated. On Monday, the South  got four goals from County players in a 5-2 decision over the North. Meanwhile,  Vano accounted for six more saves as the West tied again, 2-2, in a match  against the East.  </P> <P> The medal games will be played Friday night at Cameron Stadium in Lawton, Okla.  </P> <P> In team handball, members of the Condors, a Ventura club, have accounted 39 of  the 58 goals scored by the West as it won two of its first three games.  </P> <P> Denny Fercho of Camarillo scored five times in a 17-16 decision over the North  on Saturday, then followed it up with four goals in a 27-21 loss to the East on  Sunday. He had three more in a 20-17 win over the South on Monday.  </P> <P> Against the East, Kevin Withrow of Thousand Oaks led all scorers with seven  goals. He added four more against the South.  </P> <P> Monday was Jeff Fruin's turn to lead the team in scoring. Fruin, of Camarillo,  made a game-high six goals, including four in the last 12 minutes of the first  half as the West fought back from an early deficit.  </P> <P> A family team brought the County its first gold medal of the Festival on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Buena High graduates Fred and David Spaulding won the two-man canoe 1,000-meter  race at Lake Overholser with a time of 3:55.87. Earlier in the day, Fred won a  silver in the individual 1,000-meter race with a time of 4:17.74. David took  the bronze in 4:21.83.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the Spauldings combined efforts again in the 500-meter doubles  event, but this time had to settle for silver. Fred won another silver in the  500-meter singles race with a time of 2:01.98. David was fourth in 2:05.64 and  Jim Harper of Ventura was sixth.  </P> <P> In all, there are 50 County athletes and coaches participating in the Festival.  Among the other top local performers are figure skater Tisha Walker and men's  basketball player Don MacLean.  </P> <P> Walker, a 5-1, 101-pound 15-year old from Thousand Oaks, was fifth in women's  figure skating.  </P> <P> MacLean, a UCLA sophomore from Simi Valley, scored 31 points in three games for  the West team.  </P> <P> EIGHT IS ENOUGH  </P> <P> Eight field hockey players from Ventura County competing in the U. S. Olympic  Festival are selected to the U. S. team in the Junior World Cup. Page 14.  </P></p>

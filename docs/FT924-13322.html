			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Perot defies history books ROSS PEROT is not a typical independent, or third-party, presidential candidate. He springs from no party, cannot be said to have created his own other than informally, did not hold a convention and has no defined regional base, other than possibly in Texas - all characteristics of most of those who have previously sought to upset the establishment applecart. There is always a small multitude of such candidacies on the ballot. Mr Perot is on the ballot in every state, as is Mr Andre Marrou of the Libertarian party, a fixture in almost every state since 1976. Others have qualified in less than the full complement. The most successful this century was that of Theodore Roosevelt, the former Republican president, in 1912. His Progressive, or Bull Moose, party won 27 per cent of the popular vote, behind Woodrow Wilson's just under 42 per cent but ahead of the official Republican candidate, William Taft, with 23 per cent. He carried six states and won 88 electoral college votes, compared with Mr Wilson's 435 and Mr Taft's eight. In 1924 Robert Lafollette, a former Democrat also under the Progressive banner, pulled in over 16 per cent, but carried only his native Wisconsin. In 1968, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, also a former Democrat, headed the American Independent party, got 13.5 per cent of the vote and carried five southern states with 46 electoral college votes. In 1948 Strom Thurmond, campaigning as a States Rights Democrat, but later a Republican, won only 2.4 per cent of the popular vote but won four southern states and 39 electors. Henry Wallace, FDR's vice president from 1941-45 and the Progressive candidate that year, got only 12,000 fewer votes, but won no state. In 1980 John Anderson, the former Republican congressman and official Independent, scored 6.6 per cent but won no state. No third party or independent has taken the presidency, but both Theodore Roosevelt and George Wallace won enough to determine who did, since both had been identified with one of the two main parties. Though the electoral college margins were wider, Wilson's 41.84 per cent and Richard Nixon's 43.42 per cent in 1968 are the lowest popular vote scores for a successful candidate this century. John Anderson hurt Jimmy Carter in 1980, but not enough to bridge the gap with Ronald Reagan. Most independent candidacies wither as election day approaches. Mr Anderson, for example, once enjoyed 20 per cent-plus ratings in midsummer opinion polls. But history again is no useful guide in assessing Mr Perot because he started to run, then quit, and only got back in with a month to go.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES 100;  </P> <P> THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> THE FAST TRACK;  </P> <P> TRYING TO MAKE THE BIG LEAGUES;  </P> <P> AN ACQUISITION WITH IBM'S HELP MAY ALLOW SILICON VALLEY GROUP TO BECOME A MAJOR  SUPPLIER OF CHIP MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  </P> <P> The Silicon Valley Group is not one of those overnight corporate successes that  seem to overflow within the San Jose ZIP code. It only looks that way.  </P> <P> Last year, after more than a decade of relative obscurity and modest sales, the  small maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment burst into the national  spotlight on the news that IBM, among others, had agreed to help it buy a  technology company that had been much sought after by the Japanese.  </P> <P> Silicon Valley Group's purchase of the optical lithography division of  Perkin-Elmer is scheduled to become final shortly, and when it is, the company  will be one of the world's major suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing  equipment.  </P> <P> The purchase will, of course, cause the company's sales to make another  remarkable jump -- repeating the performance of the past two years, when its  revenue grew annually by an average of 82.6% to $131.1 million at the end of  its 1989 fiscal year last September. The accomplishment earned the company the  No. 5 spot on The Growth 100, which ranks the fastest-growing companies in  California.  </P> <P> But the deal will also thrust SVG into the middle of one of the most promising  new semiconductor-making technologies. Perhaps more important, it will assume a  leading role in a business increasingly recognized as critical to maintaining  the competitive edge of the nation's entire electronics industry.  </P> <P> "The deal is a strategic play for us," said Papken S. DerTorossian, the  company's 51-year-old president and chief executive. "This will help us become  a world-class player."  </P> <P> This is not the first time DerTorossian, an MIT-trained engineer, has gone  after a strategic acquisition to expand his company. In 1988, the company more  than doubled its size by buying Thermco Systems Inc. in Orange, a maker of  furnaces used in computer chip production.  </P> <P> Founded in 1977 and a public company since 1983, SVG has been on a fast growth  curve for three years, a period that coincides with increasing Japanese  dominance of the market for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment.  </P> <P> Despite the tough foreign competition, DerTorossian, a native of Turkey who has  been at the helm of SVG since 1984, says he is determined to put up the best  fight possible on behalf of the U.S. semiconductor industry. To that extent he  has become active in international trade and competitiveness issues and is the  chairman of the American Electronics Assn.'s International Public Affairs  Steering Committee.  </P> <P> His extracurricular activities apparently served the company well, because  several of his contacts have reportedly agreed to help SVG purchase the  Perkin-Elmer optical lithography business. Some, such as IBM, are making a  direct investment in the company; others have made purchase commitments.  </P> <P> Clearly DerTorossian feels that SVG is finally moving into the big leagues of  the industry. "If you want to be successful, you have to choose your friends  well," DerTorossian said of his new partners. "You can't fight a war with  sticks. You gotta have some guns."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER DEEDS LAND FOR SCHOOL  </P> <P> A developer has deeded six acres of land worth more than $1 million to the  Pleasant Valley School District for construction of a new school in eastern  Camarillo, where district officials say more classrooms are badly needed.  </P> <P> Under an agreement reached between Pardee Construction Co. and the school  district, the developer is handing over the property on Woodcreek Road, north  of Mission Oaks Boulevard, in lieu of developer's fees.  </P> <P> Such fees, required under state law, are used to help districts finance new  schools in fast-growing communities.  </P> <P> The district, which projects it will have 6,250 students next school year, has  been growing at a rate of about 150 students a year, and in recent years has  started busing children from schools in the eastern part of the city to western  Camarillo schools to help ease overcrowding, said Howard Hamilton, assistant  superintendent for administrative services.  </P> <P> School officials approached Pardee with the proposal because the district is  short on cash for new school construction, Hamilton said. Under the agreement,  the district will credit the developer with future development fees equal to  the value of the property.  </P> <P> School officials are now seeking ways to pay for the estimated $6 million in  construction, including a possible bond measure on the ballot.

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Mandela and Botha play their referendum cards BOTH African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and former President PW Botha made strong interventions yesterday in the run-up to next week's whites-only referendum on ending apartheid, the former appealing for strong 'yes' vote and the other saying approval would mean suicide for the Afrikaner people. Neither, however, will have helped the cause of President FW de Klerk, who has staked his political future on achieving a landslide 'yes' vote in the March 17 referendum. Mr Mandela's plea, carried in the mass circulation Sunday Times newspaper, was aimed at white members of the ANC, who are very few in number. But the ultra-right Conservative Party can use his message of support as proof that he and Mr de Klerk are in alliance together - a charge which the Conservatives have exploited to frighten whites. At a weekend Conservative Party rally, one poster showed Mr de Klerk as a tiny figure begging at the knee of Mr Mandela, with the slogan 'No to Mandela and his Klerk.' Mr Mandela yesterday promised a political system 'in which all the country's inhabitants feel secure'. But he warned that a 'no' vote would be read as a declaration of war by blacks, adding 'if the hopes of the majority of South Africans. . . are once more thwarted, the stress and upheavals of the past will be like a game of marbles.' Mr Botha's call for a 'no' vote will also bolster the Conservative campaign. He told a weekend newspaper that a 'yes' vote would lead to a government dominated by the ANC and its close ally, the South African Communist Party. Ironically, it was Mr Botha who initiated the political reforms pursued so dramatically by Mr de Klerk. But the two have often quarrelled since Mr Botha resigned as President in August 1989. The threat of a Communist takeover was also raised by right-wing parties at their weekend rally, with Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, the most powerful orator of the right, claiming that the referendum was a choice between 'God and the communists.' However the rally, organised by the Conservative Party, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) and the Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party) was clearly a disappointment to the organisers. They had predicted tens of thousands would attend, but only around 3,000 people turned up, some dressed in the khaki uniform of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Right-wing leaders opened the rally by galloping into Pretoria's Church Square on horseback, though paramilitary leader Eugene Terre'blanche fell from his horse during the procession. Meanwhile Mr de Klerk outlined his 'bottom line' demands for a new political system, saying these included a free market economic system, measures to prevent the domination of minorities and ensure that 'standards' are maintained in white areas, effective protection for private property, job and pension security for white civil servants, devolution of power, an impartial security service and traditional liberal protections such as a bill of rights and independent judiciary.</p>

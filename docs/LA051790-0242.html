			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DRUG CZAR SNIPES AT 'SIMPSONS'  </P> <P> g czar William J. Bennett, who is on a crusade against crack dealers, took a  swipe at a celluloid bad boy -- Bart Simpson.  </P> <P> During a tour Wednesday of the Foundation for Abraxas drug-treatment center,  Bennett spied a poster of the cartoon miscreant and told recovering addicts  that they shouldn't follow Bart's lead as an underachiever.  </P> <P> "You guys aren't watching 'The Simpsons,' are you? That's not going to help you  any," said Bennett, director of the national drug policy office.  </P> <P> Bart is the spike-haired son on "The Simpsons," the Fox network's highly rated  cartoon sitcom featuring the adventures of a bug-eyed family of five.  </P> <P> "We have great respect for Mr. Bennett's task and responsibility," said Brad  Turell, a spokesman for the show. "But I am not aware of any one TV program  that will help teen-agers kick the drug habit."  </P></p>

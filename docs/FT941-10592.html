			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Indian exports up 22% India's exports rose 22.2 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.74bn) in December 1993, extending a surge which began in April, according to government figures. The data will comfort the government as it prepares its 1994-95 budget, due to be announced later this month. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who launched economic reforms in mid-1991, hopes rising exports will help fuel broad-based growth in the Indian economy. Exports in the year to March 1993 grew by just 3.6 per cent due to a slump in sales to the former Soviet Union and because of unrest following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. In early 1993-94 exports recovered sharply although the underlying improvement was exaggerated by the late shipment of orders initially delayed by the riots. More recent figures indicate exports are continuing to grow and suggest the government's pro-export policies are starting to produce results. For the nine months to the end of December, exports rose 19.9 per cent to Dollars 15.7bn - well ahead of the government's target of a 15-16 per cent rise.</p>

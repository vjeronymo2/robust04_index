			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 PROTESTERS ARE EXECUTED IN CHINA;  </P> <P> 17 CONDEMNED TO DEATH, U.S. EXPRESSES 'REGRET'  </P> <P> China executed three protesters in public today and up to 17 others were  condemned to die for their roles in student-led demonstrations that challenged  the power of the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The executions of the three Shanghai men were carried out hours after futile  appeals for clemency by President Bush and other Western leaders.  </P> <P> The Shanghai workers were convicted of setting a train on fire on June 6 after  it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters, killing six people.  </P> <P> They were shot to death in front of a crowd just 2 1/2 hours after Shanghai's  highest court rejected their appeals, a spokesman at the city's Foreign Affairs  Office said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Nations Revolted  </P> <P> Washington called the executions regrettable but said it planned no further  sanctions, while other Western nations expressed revulsion.  </P> <P> "We deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward," Secretary  of State James A. Baker III said in the first official U.S. reaction.  </P> <P> But Baker, speaking outside the White House, added: "The United States is not  contemplating any additional action at this time" because President Bush  believes that the U.S. sanctions taken thus far have been "appropriate."  </P> <P> Reaction elsewhere in the West was less measured.  </P> <P> West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the executions filled  him with "abhorrence, bitterness and deep sadness." In London, Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher said she was "utterly appalled."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Atrocious' Executions  </P> <P> France, Spain and the Netherlands said the European Community will take up the  question of its relations with Beijing at next week's EC summit in Madrid.  </P> <P> French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said links with Beijing will be reviewed  after the "atrocious" executions.  </P> <P> Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van den Broek said: "This new, sad development can  only lead to a further deterioration of relations."  </P> <P> Chinese Premier Li Peng denounced the foreign criticism.  </P> <P> He told visiting Foreign Secretary Humayun Khan of Pakistan that most of the  millions of Chinese who took part nationwide in marches, sit-ins and hunger  strikes for a freer society will be treated leniently "even if they had  extremist opinions."  </P> <P> But Li said, "The tiny minority of criminals will be punished according to the  law."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Army Fired on Students  </P> <P> The meeting was the first top-level contact with a foreign delegation since the  crackdown began June 3-4, when the army fired on students and supporters in  Beijing to end their pro-democracy demonstrations.  </P> <P> In addition to those sentenced to death today, 11 -- including the three  executed -- were condemned previously.  </P> <P> Beijing radio said 45 people who "seriously endangered public order" were tried  in front of an audience of 10,000 people in Jinan in eastern China's Shandong  province.  </P> <P> It did not give details of their alleged crimes, but said some were given the  death penalty.  </P></p>

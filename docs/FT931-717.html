			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (10): A positive but highly uncertain outlook - In conclusion . . . LATIN AMERICA'S new capital inflows have undoubtedly to be seen in part in the context of important changes in capital movements at a global level - the growing integration of capital markets across borders, institutions and financial market sectors. Traditional markets have matured. Businesses have become international in perspective, looking beyond their national borders for new products, customers and inputs. Improved transport and communications have facilitated this as has technological change and innovation. Such changes suggest that, provided an open world trading system remains in place, long-term external structural reasons exist for continued flows of capital to Latin America. Much still depends on a continuation of the developments in the region in the last five years: in particular, the better economic management and greater political stability. This will in turn hang on the results of the coming round of presidential elections in Latin America. In some countries, these elections will be taking place in a transitional period: the initial glow from renewed capital inflows will have worn off, the shrinking of industry brought about by economic and trade reform will start to bite and the longer-term benefits of investment will have yet to become apparent. Indeed, economic forecasts suggest slower growth for 1993. Widening trade deficits seem set to act as a drag on economies, as will interest rates set higher either to support a weak currency or to tackle high wage demands. There will thus be the temptation to abandon the fight against inflation in a bid to restart growth. The World Bank points out that in a global marketplace there is a sharply-reduced tolerance for poor policies; yet this does not mean that governments will not try them. In part, longer-term prospects will be determined by how investors fare in Latin America in these transitional years. They also depend on investor behaviour in a US economic recovery and as US interest rates start to rise. According to the International Monetary Fund, in a study published this month: 'Swings in private capital outflows from the United States play a key role as external impulses that affect the size of capital inflows into Latin America.' Furthermore, despite the Brady settlements, some governments remain vulnerable to interest rate increases on their foreign debt. Foreign capital has been likened to an umbrella that opens in the sunshine and closes in the storm: it flows abundantly only when least needed. This underlines the importance of efforts under way to enhance domestic savings to reduce the reliance on foreign capital. For example, the pension fund reforms proposed in Argentina might add 2-3 percentage points to the domestic savings rate. However, increasing domestic savings is not something that can be achieved overnight and dependence on external savings seems likely to continue in most countries for some time. And even though there are many reasons why substantial capital inflows should continue through the 1990s, that is not to say that these will occur. There may well be significant year-to-year volatility in capital flows, and therein lies the rub. If there is confidence in economic policy, then inflows may well be sustained. But if for whatever reason - perhaps something external to the economy - inflows slow dramatically, then confidence in economic policy could ebb, inducing further capital outflows. The chances of a collapse in confidence are greater when the exchange rate is seen as overvalued, a risk now being run both in Mexico and Argentina. Latin American governments can play their part in reducing volatility by making sure their economic policy 'fundamentals' are strong. But they are not masters of their own destinies, by any means.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Yeltsin acts to protect business at local banks PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, bowing to the demands of powerful Russian banks three weeks before parliamentary elections, has banned most foreign banks licensed to do business in Russia from dealing with Russian customers until January 1996. The ban, described yesterday by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, as 'gentle protectionism', affects all banks in Russia that are more than 50 per cent foreign-owned and have not begun serving residents  - the label for Russian-registered companies, including lucrative joint ventures. The decree reverses the terms of most of the licences given to about a dozen western banks in the last few months by the Russian central bank, which favours foreign competition as a means of improving the performance of Russian banks. Only a few western banks' subsidiaries, such as Credit Lyonnais Russie and BNP-Dresdner Bank Rossija, are already open for business and have Russian customers. Most of the others, such as Chase Manhattan of the US, have not yet started their planned subsidiaries but had intended to do so in the next few months. The decree means they may be able to serve only foreign companies and individuals  - operating on an offshore basis. Chase insisted: 'We believe it won't affect us, because we received our licence before the cut-off date.' However, like other US banks which have already received licences to operate in Russia, it had yet to see the details of the decree. The banks' plans in Russia are based largely on acting for clients elsewhere in the world who want to trade with or invest in the country. However, business with Russian customers also figures as a high priority. Although Russia is not the only country to impose such restrictions, they mark a rethink of the government's earlier unbridled liberalism. Moreover, the decree reverses commitments made by a state which is desperately trying to bolster foreign investor confidence.</p>

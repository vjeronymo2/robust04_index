			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Losses reach Pounds 0.88m at Reject Shop Losses at the Reject Shop, the USM-quoted houseware retailer, rose from Pounds 587,000 to Pounds 884,000 pre-tax for the 28 weeks to September 27. Turnover expanded from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 9.13m. The directors said the figure was better than they had budgeted for. However they were cutting the interim dividend from 1.05p to 0.5p. Losses per share widened to 6.01p (3.97p). The second half traditionally compensated for a weaker first half. However, sales during September, October and November were 'very disappointing' and although the crucial Christmas period was 'considerably better', sales were 'below expectations'.</p>

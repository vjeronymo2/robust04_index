			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: CEI develops scheme to utilise US tax losses CAMBRIDGE Electronic Industries, the medical products, control and instrument company, has developed a scheme to allow it to use US tax losses following its takeover last July of Tace, the environmental monitoring group, and its sister company Goring Kerr. CEI is also changing its name to Graseby, a name used in 50 per cent of its sales prior to the acquisition. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said the company was no longer centred on its roots in Cambridge where it demerged from Philips, the electronics multinational, in 1981. Mr Bob Brown, finance director, said the tax scheme should allow the company to offset about Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.2m) of past US tax losses against future profits made by the Andersen Group of environment monitoring companies, which were part of Tace in the US. He said the integration of Tace and Goring Kerr had been completed without any significant surprises. The source of most institutional investor criticism of the previous management had gone with the removal of most of Tace's head office costs. Mr Jock Mackenzie, Tace's former chairman, and Mr Dick Richardson, managing director, had commanded combined salaries of Pounds 500,000 and the company would be able to save Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 1.7m head office overhead this year. Mr Brown said that CEI had been given considerable access to Tace's books which meant there were few surprises other than a possible higher tax charge relating to some acquisitions Tace made in the US.</p>

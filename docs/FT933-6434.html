			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Gibbs and Dandy back in the black Gibbs and Dandy, the builders' merchant, swung from losses of Pounds 92,000 to profits of Pounds 292,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30. Dividends are resumed, after a three year lapse, via a 1p interim. Barring unforeseen circumstances, a second interim of at least 1p will be payable on April 5. Earnings of 2.5p compared with previous losses of 1.2p. Directors said the profits improvement largely reflected the cost benefits of actions taken in the previous two years and continuing tight management of overheads. Interest costs fell from Pounds 213,000 to Pounds 74,000. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 11.3m) and generated operating profits of Pounds 366,000 (Pounds 121,000).</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREEDING BIRDS: RED-TAILED HAWK  </P> <P> RED-TAILED HAWK  </P> <P> (Buteo jamaicensis)  </P> <P> Description: About 22 inches long, with a 50-inch wingspan. Wings are broad and  fairly rounded, plumage is variable. Reddish upper-tail, paler red under-tail;  pale mottling on shoulders,  </P> <P> contrasting with dark mantle and often forming a "V" in perched birds.  </P> <P> Habitat: Woodland and open country with scattered trees; often seen perching on  light poles.  </P> <P> Diet: More than 85% rodents; also amphibians, crayfish, fish and refuse.  </P> <P> Displays: Aerial display: pair spiral, recross, male usually circling behind  and above female.  </P> <P> Nest: Bulky nest of sticks and twigs built in crotch of large tree with  commanding view. Alternately uses several perennial nests.  </P> <P> Eggs: White to bluish white, spotted with brown or unmarked; about 2 1/2 inches  long.  </P> <P> Natural history notes: The most common and widespread of the buteos  (high-soaring hawks that are among the easiest daytime birds of prey to spot).  While it shuns the deepest woodlands and most heavily-urbanized areas, it is a  common suburban bird in the county. In addition to the local breeders, many  migrating red-tails visit the county in spring and fall.  </P> <P> Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or  to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final  year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714)  962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.  </P> <P> Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society  volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.  </P> <P> Sources: Sea and Sage Audubon Society; "The Birder's Handbook," Ehrlich, Dobkin  and Wheye, Fireside Books (1988); "Field Guide to the Birds of North America,"  National Geographic Society (1987); "Birds of Southern California: Status and  Distribution," Garrett and Dunn, Los Angeles Audubon Society (1981).  </P></p>

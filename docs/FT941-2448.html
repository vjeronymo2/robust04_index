			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: A semi-detached vision - Colin Amery finds London's Ideal Home Exhibition short on ideas and good design For 86 years they have come annually from all corners of the kingdom, to honour the gods of hearth and home gathered in a great temple in the capital. They come to perform ablutions in special cabins, to worship the wok, to conduct arcane rites with potato peelers and chant to the rhythms of silent pianos (courtesy of Yamaha). All this to the glory of the ideal home. The Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition is in London at Earls Court until April 10. It ought to be a great celebration of domestic virtues and a practical demonstration of ways to make your home more ideal. It should give purpose to our work and its creation should be one of the most creative exercises that we perform. I would like to think that an ideal home, or at least an exhibition of ideal homes, had something about it of architecture and design and that the visual and design ideals were at least matched by ideas. When I went there the other day, full of pious hopes, I was expecting to see the vision that the the thousands of worshipping homemakers had come to witness. Mrs John Major was there, a comforting figure who clearly likes the quiet domestic virtues and is not seduced by the shallow glamour of passing fame. I can imagine her Hoovering in Huntingdon and enjoying it. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, sometimes I think the whole world has been especially laid out for the housewife to enjoy while her chap is sealed up in some air-conditioned box trying to find ways of paying the DIY bills. It was Jane Austen's Emma who said: 'There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.' And then there was that famous chic American decorator, Billy Baldwin, who said: 'I have been thinking lately how comfort is perhaps the real luxury.' It was also Jane Austen who seems to have invented the idea of 'English comfort', when she described a pleasing English country view: 'It was a sweet view - sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a bright sun without being oppressive.' It must be this sense of peaceful harmony that most people are thinking about and longing for when they think of home. Any housewife, of either sex, who can achieve this has worked a miracle. Is it this sense of peace and perfection on earth that is at the back of the minds of all the exhibitors at Earls Court? Are the side chapels on the endless aisles of Earls Court full of manufacturers praying to find ways to achieve this domestic miracle? I would like to think that this was the case, even if only at some subliminal level. I particularly hoped to find it in the village of show houses; in previous years I remember this being the absolute heart of the exhibition. It was here that I hoped to find not just the hearth of the nation, but some inspiration for the future of domestic design. I was not sure whether to cheer, or not, at the sight of the Marks and Spencer show house. I wondered whether this successful retailer was about to join the design revolution started by Terence Conran and his Habitat stores, which brought the simplicity contemporary design to the mass market. Or is Marks and Spencer going down a cut-price Ralph Lauren route? After all, you can now take off your M&amp;S underwear and slip into your M&amp;S dressing gown, take a bath with your M&amp;S soap, dry yourself with a M&amp;S towel and sleep between your M&amp;S gingham sheets. When you wake you can revive yourself with some M&amp;S blood orange juice and slump in your traditional club arm chair or venture on to the terrace to sit in your M&amp;S rattan chair from 'Siam', to enjoy a glimpse of your Lichfield or Lyndhurst or Newbury or Cadogan furniture that graces your drawing room. This is the vision: a semi-detached view of tradition that remains neither one thing nor the other. Neither cheap nor expensive, not actively bad but not particularly good design. Is this the ideal home? Or is it the 'Ducal' show house - untouched by modernism and yet equally unaware of any real tradition of domestic architecture? Why are these ideal homes so bad? Is it the fundamental poverty of modern architecture that has allowed this reactionary mediocrity not just to continue, but to be the norm when it comes to the average British house for sale on the speculative market? The architectural profession seems to have no interest in improving the design of the average British house. Why is it not possible to buy a house extension or a new bathroom or kitchen that is as well-designed as the average car? What happened to prefabrication that it can produce loos for a developer at Broadgate but nothing for the domestic market? As disappointing as the show houses is the design that won the Daily Mail Design Award. This design was by a student from the Royal College of Art, Graham Powell, who designed something called a mollusc, which he described as 'a series of separate units or rooms which lock together to form a customised living space'. They looked like curved Portakabins piled one on top of the other - not unlike the erections you see on the corners of building sites - with no design distinction in spite of their attached 'solar assist kits'. The Ideal Home Exhibition has one virtue. You can go there with your own ideals of domestic bliss and emerge with them untouched. The tragedy of this great national event is how it fails to capitalise on the one area of life that is important to all of us. It is without ideals, and sadly without any significant ideas, for the future of our lives at home.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Management: If you can't say something nice . . . - Are references worth more than the paper they are written on? Britain's House of Lords ruled recently that employers have a duty to take reasonable care when writing references about former staff members. The ruling was hailed as a victory for employees, but how much will it really affect the current processes of vetting job applications? Geoff Armstrong, director general of the Institute of Personnel and Development, believes the ruling will make little difference to the private sector where, he says, recruiters are already circumspect about references because of the various pieces of anti-discrimination legislation that have emerged over the years. The Law Lords ruled by a majority of four to one that Guardian Assurance, a subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange investment group, had not taken sufficient care when writing a reference on a former insurance salesman. The reference stated that the salesman had 'little or no integrity and could not be regarded as honest'. The salesman said the statement was untrue and meant that he could not get another insurance job. Clearly the impression of a single reference can be dangerous. Whatever motivated this particular reference, it demonstrates that employees who leave companies in some circumstances could, without the duty of care imposed by the Law Lords, be exposed to malicious comment. The case has yet to return to the Court of Appeal which will look at a claim for damages but the decision makes clear that organisations that give poor references can now face legal actions for claims of negligence. Armstrong believes the ruling will encourage recruiters to do what they often do now anyway - take references over the telephone. That way only they know what is said. Fraser Younson, an employment lawyer, says that a possible problem could arise from this when a job offer is conditional on references. If the prospective employee challenges a subsequent rejection, alleging that it was made for some other reason such as racial discrimination, the employer would have no written evidence of the reference to support the decision. In practice, says Younson, the ruling is likely to mean that employers will have to be more circumspect and careful about covering their backs. Some referees may err on the side of praise or resort to euphemism. When an organisation had an ineffective employee it wanted to get rid of, one well-known ruse used to be to give him a glowing reference to help send him packing. Some did quite well out of it, moving up the career ladder, propelled by their very mediocrity. As it is, recruiters must often read a reference for what it leaves out as much as what it says. If the judgment leads to more anodyne references it could further deprive recruiters of one of their most important sources of information about job applicants. 'If you are looking to make a selection decision, the best predictor you can get of the likely success of a candidate is how they performed in their previous jobs,' says Armstrong. 'It is better than the interview, the psychometric test and all the other devices.' The broader recruitment industry could learn something from the practices of headhunters. If they do their job properly, they will make several checks on a candidate among peers and colleagues at previous places of employment. The process is all very discreet, often over the telephone or in person and an experienced selector should be able to sift out sufficient useful pointers.</p>

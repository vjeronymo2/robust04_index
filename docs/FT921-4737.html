			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Travel: Go home to a real fire BATTERED by the north Wales elements, the temperature in the great hall of Plas Uchaf, a 15th century manor house, hovered just above freezing until the electricity finally gave up the ghost, writes Tim Burt. Manweb the electrician, summoned from Wrexham by Jones the caretaker, restored the power after seven hours with a fuse the size of a shotgun cartridge. Clearly, he thought it amazing that people paid good money to shiver in a building not much modernised since the 1400s. Then, as now, the centrepiece of the heating system was a hearth large enough to spit-roast an ox. Today, visitors huddle by the fire just as the Barons of Cymmer did several centuries ago. The barons earned a tidy sum living at Plas Uchaf, from where they are thought to have taxed the local peasants and farmed the meadows in the Dee valley. Since then their ancestral home has changed hands frequently: housing farmers, tailors, gamekeepers and even hosting religious services before falling into disrepair and neglect in the 1960s. Now it is a moneyspinner again, for it is leased by the local council to the Landmark Trust, the charity which rescues and restores historic buildings. Plas Uchaf is one of 150 buildings saved by the trust, which rents everything from castles to pigsties at rates up to Pounds 1,500 a week. Plas Uchaf is a spectacular example. Unprepossessing from the outside, it conceals a vaulted chamber with a unique hammer beam roof and weathered aisle trusses. But like many of the trust's properties, preservation of the old does not allow for modern conveniences such as central heating. In winter, residents must be able to endure some fairly Arctic conditions in exchange for a medieval atmosphere. In spring - presumably - it gets better. The Landmark Trust, Shottesbrooke, Maidenhead, Berkshire, tel: 062-882-5925. Plas Uchaf, sleeping five, costs from Pounds 192 per weekend to Pounds 555 per week in peak season.</p>

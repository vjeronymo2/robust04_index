			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h) For States offering habilitation services that include prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or a combination of these services, consistent with the provisions of &sect;440.180(c) of this chapter, an explanation of why these services are not available as special education and related services under sections 602 (16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. section 730);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For States offering home and community-based services for individuals diagnosed as chronically mentally ill, an explanation of why these individuals would not be placed in an institution for mental diseases (IMD) absent the waiver, and the age group of these individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In &sect;441.304, paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) are revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;441.304  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Duration of a waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to provide home and community-based services approved under this subpart is established by HCFA prospectively on or after the date of approval and after consultation with the State agency. The initial approved waiver continues for a 3-year period from the effective date. If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended for additional periods unless_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) HCFA's review of the prior waiver period shows that the assurances required by &sect;441.302 were not met; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) HCFA is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation provided by the State in regard to the extension period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HCFA will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request or a request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to the existing group of recipients covered under the waiver (as defined under &sect;441.301(b)(6)), HCFA will consider it to be two requests: One as an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended for additional 5-year periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) If HCFA finds that an agency is not meeting one or more of the requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, the agency is given a notice of HCFA's findings and an opportunity for a hearing to rebut the findings. If HCFA determines that the agency is not in compliance with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, HCFA may terminate the waiver. For example, a State submits to HCFA a waiver request for home and community-based services that includes an estimate of the expenditures that would be incurred if the services were provided to the covered individuals in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR in the absence of the waiver. HCFA approves the waiver. At the end of the waiver year, the State submits to HCFA a report of its actual expenditures under the waiver. HCFA finds that the actual expenditures under the waiver exceed 100 percent of the State's approved estimate of expenditures for these individuals in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR in the absence of the waiver. HCFA next requires the State to amend its estimates for subsequent waiver year(s). HCFA then compares the revised estimates with the State's actual experience to determine if the revised estimates are reasonable. HCFA may terminate the waiver if the revised estimates indicate that the waiver is not cost-neutral or that the revised estimates are unreasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;441.305  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Redesignated as &sect;441.307]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Section 441.305 is redesignated as &sect;441.307.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A new &sect;441.305 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;441.305  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement of recipients in approved waiver programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regular waivers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A State's estimate of the number of individuals who may receive home and community-based services must include those who will replace recipients who leave the program for any reason. A State may replace recipients who leave the program due to death or loss of eligibility under the State plan without regard to any federally-imposed limit on utilization, but must maintain a record of recipients replaced on this basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

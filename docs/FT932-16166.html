			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: New Morning - London Theatre Go to a play, see people in worse situations than you are, watch them talk out their problems, leave the theatre with hope. Then go home, chat to friends who are in some ways more comfortably situated than you are, listen to their crises and despondencies, go to bed feeling disconsolate. I am amazed at the number of serious new plays that end on some bright or tentatively optimistic note. Declan Hughes's New Morning, the latest new play at the Bush, is a case in point. Two sisters spend the weekend together, camping in the open. They rake over their relationship with each other, with their dead parents, with life in general. They are sometimes at loggerheads, and one sister, Mary, fails to respond fully to all the gunge from her subconscious that the night dredges up. But they get from A to at least B, maybe further, and the play ends with them helping each other to pull down the tent that they never slept in anyway. (A problem shared . . . ) And, since the play, by Declan Hughes, is well acted and is often very funny, you can be sure the audience leaves with a smile on its collective face. My trouble, to be blunt, is that I just didn't believe it. This is partly because I have only limited points of personal contact with two Irish sisters who were raised to know every littlest thing about Elvis Presley, and who remind each other of good yarns from the Old Testament. But then I don't have too much in common with Electra or Macbeth, whose plights I nonetheless follow with interest. Deborah and Mary speak to my condition sufficiently for me to laugh repeatedly at their jokes (mainly Mary's). The problem is that they approach their problems by way of Elvis and the Old Testament. Deborah is the idealist, Mary the cynic. Ironically, it is Mary to whom a spectral Elvis appears in the night. 'You bitch,' says Deborah in the morning. 'I believe in visions, and you get to see Elvis.' Through all this, the sisters raise the unburied memories of the accident in which their mother died and the unfairness of their father in subsequent years. There is enough melodrama on the one hand and wisecracking on the other to keep an audience held. Lynne Parker, directing, yokes together these two contrary elements fluently. Anne Byrne (Deborah) and Gina Moxley (Mary) give flawlessly natural performances, in which the twitch of a mouth, or a momentarily prolonged facial expression can make the audience chortle. But Declan Hughes's writing never persuaded me that this was a story I needed to know, or that it would naturally end on so positive a note. At the Bush Theatre W12. (081) 743 3388</p>

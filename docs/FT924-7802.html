			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Malcom Rifkind visits Rolls-Royce's Bristol factory Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary (left), with fitter Mr James Iles in front of the EJ200 engine for the European Fighter Aircraft. Mr Rifkind yesterday visited Rolls-Royce's Bristol factory, where the engine is being built. He said he was 'considerably more optimistic' over the future of the project following talks with Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister. Mr Ruhe indicated his country's wish to remain in the EFA development phase which has so far cost Pounds 5bn. Germany had been threatening to pull out of the multi-billion pound joint project with Britain, Italy and Spain, saying costs were too high. Mr Rifkind pointed out that a recent review of production costs had indicated possible savings of up to 30 per cent - the figure sought by the Germans. The first flight engine is being tested and is due to make its debut in the third prototype EFA next summer. The first two prototypes will fly soon, powered by RB199 engines, the power packs for Britain's Tornado aircraft. The EJ200 project employs about 2,000 peopleat Patchway, near Bristol.</p>

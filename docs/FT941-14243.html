			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Galloway reprimanded Labour yesterday tried to contain its embarrassment over a trip to Iraq by Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, by issuing him with a 'severe reprimand', James Blitz writes. Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, gave Mr Galloway 'a final warning', following an appearance on Iraqi television earlier this week in which the MP appeared to praise President Saddam Hussein. It was understood yesterday that some shadow cabinet members were considering raising Mr Galloway's behaviour at the next meeting of the party's national executive committee, with a view to having him removed as a candidate at the next election. Mr Galloway yesterday promised the whips that he would obey all their future instructions, and apologised for his television appearance, expressing 'deep regret for any offence or pain' given to families of Gulf war victims.</p>

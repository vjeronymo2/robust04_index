			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Packer, Murdoch in joint satellite TV licence bid TELECOM Australia, the government-owned telecommunications carrier, has joined forces with News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-based media group, and Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network to bid for Australia's first satellite television licence. If the bid is successful it would establish Mr Packer, proprietor of the Consolidated Press Holdings media group, as the dominant force in Australian commercial broadcasting. It would also mark the return to Australian broadcasting of News Corp, which controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation through its News subsidiary. The consortium said other investors might join the consortium before the end of the week - the bidding deadline for two four-channel satellite broadcasting licences being offered by the government. Australia's two other commercial television broadcasters are believed to be seeking a role in satellite television, as are a number of US media groups, including Time Warner, Times Mirror and the Los Angeles Times. Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper and a subscription television group run by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, the US food manufacturer, have expressed a wish to become involved. The inclusion of Telecom gives the consortium significant technical flexibility if problems emerge in the development of the digital transmission system which will be a condition of both licences. The formation of the consortium clears the way for a US-based bid for the second licence, which was reserved for new entrants in an attempt to reduce the concentration of Australian media ownership. The uncertainty about the shape of subscription television services adds to confusion about the future of the John Fairfax Holdings newspaper group, the main competitor to News Corp. The government agreed last week to allow The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK newspaper group, to increase its shareholding in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent to 'safeguard' its investment. In spite of its small shareholding, The Telegraph has management control of the group, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age, the Australian Financial Review and Business Review Weekly. Mr Packer recently acquired 10 per cent of Fairfax, but is unable to launch a takeover bid unless he reduces his controlling stake in the Channel Nine network to less than 15 per cent. An article published last week referred to Mr Dan Colson as deputy chairman of The Telegraph. In fact, Mr Colson is vice-chairman of the board. The deputy chairman is Sir Frank Rogers.</p>

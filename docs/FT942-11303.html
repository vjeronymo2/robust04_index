			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / 98% of schools order tests Copies of national curriculum tests which 14-year-olds in England and Wales are due to take next week have been ordered by 98 per cent of schools, government officials announced yesterday, John Authers writes. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority which supervises the tests, said: 'Clearly, schools have taken heed of the improvements made to the tests.' He added that the time taken for the majority of pupils to sit them had been cut by about a half since last year, when a boycott by teachers' unions meant that scarcely more than 100 schools, out of more than 4,000, completed and reported test results. The NUT union, which is continuing its boycott this year, played down the figures' significance. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'There's a big difference between asking to see the tests and the results being sent back to the government. We are confident that the boycott will be very strongly supported.' Next week the SCAA will launch the biggest educational consultation that England and Wales have seen, when it publishes the preliminary version of the new national curriculum. More than 1.5m documents will be distributed to parents, schools and other interested parties at a cost of between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m. Complete new guidelines for the national curriculum will be in schools by the end of next January, ready to be implemented from September 1995.</p>

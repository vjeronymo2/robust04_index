			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RESTORE THE PUBLIC TRUST'  </P> <P> Our so-called representative government is in very sad shape indeed. A short  list includes (former Atty. Gen. Edwin) Meese, (House Speaker Jim) Wright, (Los  Angeles Mayor Tom) Bradley, (House Whip Tony) Coelho, (state Sen. Joseph)  Montoya, and on and on, ad nauseam. It is sickening to see these guys running  for cover with that Cheshire cat grin on their faces; all the while mumbling  some variation of the infamous phrase, "I am not a crook!"  </P> <P> Great merciful heavens! Don't these highbinders realize that the question is  not one of breaking the law? The average Joe Citizen assumes his elected  representatives are law abiding. What we are talking about here is unethical  and amoral conduct, about cronyism, about cupidity, yes, about "sleaze." To the  average man these things are more important than the law.  </P> <P> When the historians of the next century try to make some sense out of this  period they will stumble badly over the question, "Why did this freedom-loving  people spend their hard-earned dollars on policeman to eradicate prostitution,  and then elect whores to public office?" Maybe we should try and answer the  question ourselves!  </P> <P> R.A. HUGHES  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

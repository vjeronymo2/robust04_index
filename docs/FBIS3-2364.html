The Chinese sturgeon, an important endangered  aquatic animal protected by the Chinese Government, used spawn  in the Jinsha River, a branch of the Yangzte at its upper  reaches. [sentence as received] With the construction of the  Gezhou Dam, this species of fish was greatly reduced in number  since their way back upstream for spawning had been cut off by  the dam. In order to protect this variety of fish, considered a  precious "living fossil", the Chinese Sturgeon Research  Institute succeeded in developing an artificial sturgeon  reproduction programme in 1984 and since that time they have  sent back 2.35 million young sturgeons into the river. A survey  conducted in 1991 showed that the number of this fish in the  river has nearly reached the level before the construction of  the dam.    According to experts, the above success has offered  beneficial experience for the protection of precious endangered  species facing similar environmental problems with the  construction of the three Gorges Project.</p>

After  more than a decade, and with their rapid development in the last  two years in particular, they are beginning to take shape and  are flourishing and prospering. They have become one of the hot  points in our economic life.  <H5>  The Four Stages of Development of China's Securities Markets </H5>   The first stage was the beginning stage during the years  1981-1988. At first, they still bore the marks of the planned  economy and were haphazard government bond markets. Even though  some 45.5 billion yuan's worth of bonds were issued during that  period, because they were distributed under the method of  government-assigned purchases and were not transferrable, nor  could they be circulated, there was never a secondary market for  government bonds in the standard sense. It was during this  period that enterprise bonds, financial bonds, and stocks began  to appear. In regions where reform had begun first, especially,  not only were fairly standardized forms of stocks issued to the  public -- for example, Shanghai's Vacuum Electronic Apparatus  Co. Ltd. and Feiyue Shareholding Co. Ltd. stocks, Shenyang's  Jinbei Automobile Co. Ltd. stocks, and Shenzhen's Development  Bank stocks -- but Shenyang and Shanghai and other localities  also piloted the transfer of enterprise bonds and stocks,  accumulating valuable experiences for the opening of secondary  securities markets.    The second stage was the development stage from 1988 to  1990.  The turning point was the opening of the secondary securities  markets. In April 1988, with the State Council's approval,  Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and other  localities began testing the exchange markets for state treasury  bonds. At the end of that year, the state treasury bond trading  business quickly spread to the large- and medium-sized cities  across the country. The opening of secondary markets for state  treasury bonds not only spurred a large increase in the kinds  and the volume of issuance of government bonds but also changed  the concept of many purchasers, making the purchase of  government bonds purely an act of investment. At the same time,  it changed the traditional way many Chinese enterprises raised  capital: they began to enter directly into the capital markets  to gather funds. In Shanghai and Shenzhen in particular, the  stock exchanges really developed. By 1990, Shanghai had seven  shareholding companies listing their stocks in the exchange;  Shenzhen had five listing companies. Over-the-counter trade was  very brisk at that time, but for various reasons, the black  market also ran rampant, and stock prices soared because of  excess demand.    The beginning of the third stage was marked by the opening  of  the Shanghai Securities Exchange in December 1990. China's  securities markets ended their disorganized over-the-counter  trade and turned to organized market trading. The opening of the  Shanghai Securities Exchange not only brought the trading of  securities into the exchange but also introduced computerized  match-up and paperless transactions, and in one stroke it caught  up the technological development that took the Western stock  markets nearly a century and the Asian Pacific region several  decades to accomplish. It not only improved market efficiency  but also practically eliminated black market transactions,  taking the standardization of the securities market a big step  forward. Subsequently the installation of the Beijing National  Securities Trade Automated Quotations (STAQ) system was put into  operation (on 5 December 1990), which was followed by the formal  opening of the Shenzhen Exchange in July 1991. The development  of China's securities markets entered a new historical phase.  As securities trading became increasingly active, the market  for securities issuance also expanded. At the end of 1991,  special RMB stocks (B-shares) were issued, opening up a new  channel to attract foreign investments via the stock market.    The fourth stage began in 1992. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  South China speech reaffirmed the reform experiments with the  shareholding system and the securities markets. It became a  strong force behind the reform and opening up. The securities  markets and the entire process of the restructuring of the  economic system helped propel each other into a new  developmental phase. In early March 1992, the State  Restructuring the Economic System Commission and the State  Council's Economic and Trade Office convened the "Summary  Meeting on the Experiences of the Trial Implementation of the  Shareholding System" in Shenzhen. Based on the conclusions drawn  at that meeting, the State Council handed down a document  confirming the positive nature of the pilot shareholding system.  Subsequently, the State Restructuring of the Economic System  Commission and other related departments jointly issued the  "Suggestions on Standardizing the Shareholding Limited Liability  Companies" and more than a dozen of other individually drawn up  laws and regulations, which played an active role in putting the  shareholding pilot project on a legalized and standardized  course. The pace of reform toward the shareholding system  clearly picked up. Experimental points set up to issue stocks to  the public spread from Shanghai and Shenzhen to Guangdong,  Fujian, and Hainan. Nationwide, more than 5,000 enterprises  converted to the shareholding system, issued stock publicly, or  implemented the directional capital-raising system. In 1992, 53  enterprises in Shanghai and 10 in Shenzhen issued stocks  publicly, and adding the six kinds of out-of-town stocks from  Hainan, Wuhan, and Shenyang traded in the Shenzhen and Shanghai  exchanges, the scope of stock trading further expanded.  Meanwhile, many new types of financial goods -- such as  investment funds, stock subscription warrants, negotiable bonds,  and investment profit bonds -- began to appear in the securities  markets. The bond market and the stock market set each other off  as both entered a phase of prosperity.  <H5>  The State of China's Securities Markets </H5>   1. The scope of the securities markets is constantly  expanding: From 1981 to 1992, 381.7 billion yuan's worth of  assorted negotiable securities were issued. They consisted of  108.4 billion yuan in state treasury bonds, 39.7 billion yuan in  financial bonds, 20 billion yuan in special state bonds and  value-guaranteed public debts, 40.7 billion yuan in state  investment bonds (including state construction bonds, state key  construction bonds, and basic construction bonds), 96 billion  yuan in enterprise bonds, 61 billion yuan in financial bonds,  and 15.9 billion yuan in stocks. Securities issued in 1992 were  worth 128 billion yuan. The bulk -- nearly one-third -- of  securities in the securities issuance market were government  bonds, and if we add the government-guaranteed state investment  bonds, they would exceed 40 percent.    The securities circulation market was also extremely active  last year. Volume of exchange in the organized markets topped  104.4 billion yuan, among them, bond volume (primarily state  bonds) topped 35.1 billion yuan. Volume of trade in stocks was  69.2 billion yuan, 12.4 times more than the 5.1 billion yuan  traded in 1991. Specifically, the Shenzhen Exchange's volume  was 44 billion yuan while trading in the Shanghai Exchange was  worth 24.8 billion yuan.    So far, a total of 110 companies are listed in Shanghai and  Shenzhen. There are 108 A-shares and 30 B-shares. Their combined  market value is nearly 300 billion yuan. Transactions in the tw  o exchanges so far this year are worth more than 170 billion  yuan.    2. An exchange market system is gradually taking shape:  China's securities exchange markets are gradually taking on a  format that combines organized and decentralized trading. The  organized exchange markets include the "two exchanges" and the  "two networks." The "two exchanges" refer to the Shanghai  Securities Exchange and the Shenzhen Exchange, and the "two  networks" refer to the National Securities Trade Automated  Quotations Syste m (STAQ) and the National Electronic Trading  System (NET). Securities traded on the two Exchanges are mainly  personal shares issued by the listing companies. After the STAQ  system began piloting the trading of state treasury bonds and  legal person shares, the NET system also began trading legal  person shares. The decentralized exchange markets refer to the  3,000 securities business outlets around the country. They  include securities companies, outlets of the securities business  department of trust and investment companies, and securities  agencies of banks and credit cooperatives that trade bonds the  over-the-counter.    3. A securities market management system is taking shape:  The  State Council's Securities Exchange Commission (the Securities  Commission for short) and the Chinese Securities Supervisory and  Administrative Commission (Securities Supervisory Commission for  short) were founded in October of last year. The Securities  Commission is in charge of the macroeconomic management of the  country's secur ities markets. It is made up of leading  comrades of the State Council's relevant ministries and  commissions. Its basic duties are to formulate laws and draft  legal provisions pertaining to the securities markets; to study  and formulate general and specific policies and rules and  regulations pertaining to the securities markets; to darw up the  securities markets' development program and annual plans; to  guide, coordinate, supervise, and check the performances of  securities market-related tasks of different regions and  departments. It is also in charge of the Securities Supervisory  Commission.    The Securities Supervisory Commission is the executive organ  of the Securities Commission. It is made up of experts with  professional knowledge and practical experiences in securities.  Its main responsibilities, as empowered by the Securities  Commission, are to formulate securities market management rules;  monitor the way companies in the securities business handle  their trade, especially how they handle their stock trading  business; legally supervise the issuance and exchange of  negotiable securities and the companies that issue stocks  publicly; supervise and monitor domestic enterprises that issue  stocks abroad; work with the relevant departments to compile  securities statistics, study and analyze the securities market  and promptly report to the Securities Commission and make  suggestions. The State Council's relevant departments and local  governments also have specific securities management  responsibilities . The State Planning Commission is responsible  for formulating and balancing the securities plans. The  Financial Ministry is responsible for matters relating to  national debt and is in charge of the chartering of accountants  and accounting firms. The People's Bank is responsible for  examining and approving and managing the securities business  companies. Local governments are in charge of securities  exchanges within their jurisdiction. The securities industry's  self-disciplinary [ZILUXING] organizations consist mainly of the  Chinese Securities Trade Association and the Chinese National  Debt Association.    4. Securities organizations and intermediaries are growing  rapidly: As the securities industry continues to expand,  financial institutions that can handle securities business and  intermediaries serving the securities industry also continue to  increase. At the end of 1992, among the financial institutions  approved to manage securities, there were 85 securities  companies, 386 trust and investment c ompanies, and more than  1,200 securities departments set up within the trust and  investment companies and multipurpose banks. In addition, there  were 2,000 outlets set up by banks and credit cooperatives, and  we also had more than 500 securities intermediaries, primarily  accounting firms, auditing companies, law firms, property  appraisal companies, credit assessment companies or offices,  securities investment consultation companies and so on. To  strengthen the management of intermediary service organizations  and improve their service quality, the Chinese Securities  Supervision Commission and other relevant departments have  evaluated the credentials of intermediaries dealing with  securities. In addition, membership in the Shanghai and Shenzhen  exchanges have also been increasing. At the end of last year,  the Shanghai Securities Exchange had 171 members and the  Shenzhen Exchange had 151 members.    5. Laws regulating the securities markets are gradually  being  perfected. When stock market pilot projects were first set up in  Shanghai and Shenzhen, the main laws we had were the "Temporary  Regulations on Managing the Shanghai Securities Exchange,"  "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange  in Shenzhen," and the "Temporary Method for Managing the  Securities Companies." Here it should be pointed out that  socialist China has just promulgated the first set of "Temporary  Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" on 4 May of  this year. It was drawn up based on Shanghai's and Shenzhen's  and other localities' laws and regulations. It marked the first  step toward creating a set of unified national laws and  regulations for China's securities markets, and it was also an  important result of the restructuring of the economic system. It  was no small accomplishment. The "Regulations" starts out from  China's actual conditions and also references usual  international practices. Its purpose is to protect the interests  of the investors and promote the standardization of the  securities markets, especially the stock market, so that the  stock market has regulations to follow and laws to abide by. Of  course, this is just the beginning, and in the future, we still  have much work to do with regard to setting up a legal system  for the securities markets.    Clearly, the birth and development of China's securities  markets played and is still playing a positive role in the  country's economic reform and development. To sum up, first,  they raise capital for economic construction. The securities m  arkets' main function is to turn society's scattered funds into  long-term capital through the issuance of stocks and bonds; they  provide a source of long-term capital to fund the nation's  economic constructions. This is more obvious in regards to  government bonds and enterprise bonds. However, although the  scope of stock issuance is smaller, it is growing rapidly, and  for this reason, enterprises that raise capital by issuing  stocks are also growing rapidly. Second, they help curb  inflation. Generally speaking, stocks and bonds are direct  means of raising capital. Compared to indirect means of  gathering funds through banks, direct fund gathering does not  change the total money supply and does not produce the  multiplier effect of increased money supply; instead, by  absorbing society's idle funds, they change the mix of society's  financial assets and ease the pressure of society's total  demand. Furthermore, direct fund gathering puts more stringent  demands on enterprises, prompting them to improve efficiency,  thus it accelerates the flow-back of credit funds and helps to  curb inflation. Third, they promote changes in the state-owned  enterprises' management mechanisms and accelerate enterprises'  market-orientation process. Conversion to the shareholding  system has clarified enterprises' property rights, changed the  old situation where nobody would take responsibility for the  management of state-owned enterprises' properties, and has  brought about the separation of ownership rights and management  rights. As a result, enterprises can gradually end their  dependence on different levels of government and can make their  own management decisions and take responsibility for their own  profits and losses. When shareholding enterprises issue stocks  and raise capital in society, it means they must accept the  supervision of tens of thousands of shareholders, and this  forces them to improve management and administration and to  diligently improve their economic efficiency. Fourth, they help  achieve optimal allocation of resources. The securities markets  have smashed the pattern of planned fund allocation and have  made the market the basis of resource allocation. Implementing  the shareholding system not only subjects the incremental assets  to the market's regulation but also puts the existing asset base  in the market where they can be readjusted. Today, local  governments are very selective and strict about enterprises that  issue stocks, and this gives the nation's bottleneck industries  and well-managed and efficient enterprises ample opportunity to  develop. How well or how poorly the enterprises are managed  also determines the flow of society's funds, creating the  competitive mechanisms whereby the inferior are eliminated by  the superior, and in turn society's funds are guided to the  profitable industries and enterprises, achieving optimal  allocation of resources. Last, they promote the formation of a  socialist market system. A fairly complete market system should  be a system that integrates the commoditi es market and the fund  market. The securities markets are an important component of the  fund market, and their development and improvement not only  promote the formation of the fund market but also accelerate the  improvement of the commodities market. This is because  enterprises are the market's principal players. The better they  can compete in the commodities market and the better off they  are, the more they can raise capital in the fund market. These  are flip sides of the same process. Increasingly , the  development of China's securities markets is proving that they  can play a positive role in this area.  <H3>  Existing Problems in the Development of the Securities  Markets </H3>   Looking at the course of development of China's securities  markets, today, we still have some major problems that need to  be considered carefully and resolved.    1. The question of regulating enterprises' conversion to the  shareholding system:    Enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system must be  regulated; their public issuance and listing of stocks must meet  very strict standards. This is the cornerstone of the stock  market's healthy development. Today, the lack of standardization  in enterprises' conversion to the shareholding system is  manifested in the following ways: One, in converting to the  shareholding system, some enterprises fail to assess their  properties accurately, resulting in underestimation of the book  value and loss of the state's assets. Two, when they engage in  directional capital raising, they often do not limit themselves  to issuing shares internally to their own staff and workers, and  as a result, "internal shares are made public and legal person  shares are sold to individuals," which in turn leads to the  black market trading of equity rights. Three, some regions do  not follow the central government's legal instructions when they  convert to the shareholding system; they do not follow procedure  and submit reports as required and often lower the examination  and approval standards. Four, share holding companies that have  issued and listed their stocks are slow in changing their  management mechanisms; their shareholders' meetings exist in  name only, and there is no safeguard for the shareholders'  rights and privileges. For these reasons, the State  Restructuring of the Economic System Commission in conjunction  with other relevant departments have issued some documents on  standardization, asking the localities and enterprises to comply  with their requests and work diligently when enterprises conv  ert to the shareholding system. Only when an enterprise is truly  ready should it issue stocks and become a listing company; we  must not blindly pursue quantity by sacrificing quality.  Enterprises' asset appraisal must be accurate; the delineation  of property rights must be clear. We must follow the accounting  system formulated for the shareholding system when changing  enterprises' accounting system. We must set up and perfect  enterprises' internal management system. The shareholders'  meetings, board of directors' meetings, and supervisory meetings  must be organized according to standard proposals. We must truly  change enterprises' operating mechanisms and improve their  ability to discipline themselves. It should be pointed out that  as we open up to the outside world and as enterprises get into  the market, the transformation of the shareholding companies  should follow international standards even closer to become  internationalized.    2. The question of the publicly owned shares:    In changing to the shareholding system, we must uphold the  primary role of the socialist public ownership system and  guarantee the preservation and appreciation of the value of the  state-owned assets. This is a fundamental premise. From the  point of the scope of the pilot project to set up shareholding  enterprises, enterprises involved with national security and  state-of-the-art national defense technologies, projects  involving the mining of rare metals of strategic importance, and  industries and enterprises that must be monopolized by the  state should continue to be run by the state. For the energy,  transportation, and communications and other fairly monopolistic  industries which are the focus of development under the state's  industry policy, the state must retain controlling interest when  they test the shareholding system. At the same time, we must  stipulate that a natural person cannot hold more than 0.5  percent of the stocks of any one enterprise. This will basically  guarantee the primary role of the public-ownership system in the  national economy.    A major problem we are facing today is that the publicly  owned shares cannot be traded in the market. The presence of  these shares and the fact that they account for a fairly large  percentage of all equity rights are important characteristics of  China's shareholding system. The inability of large numbers of  publicly owned shares to circulate not only violates the  principle of equal equity rights and fails to guarantee the  preservation and appreciation of the val ue of the publicly  owned shares but also hinders enterprises' efforts to change  their management mechanisms, making it difficult to achieve the  original goals of the shareholding system. But the trading of  pubicly owned stocks will involve a host of other reforms --  such as reform of the system of property rights in state-owned  properties, and it involves the state-owned properties  management and administration system and the question of the  stock market's ability to handle those stocks. We must study  this matter carefully.    3. The question of the pattern of development of the  securities markets:    From the point of the internal structure of the securities  markets, today, only about 10 percent of the directly-raised  capital is raised by stocks. For some time to come, we will  still rely mainly on bonds, supplemented by stocks. But  currently, the bond market, especially treasury bonds, is in a  slump, and we are "crippled." Those involved are working hard to  review the experience and are taking effect ive measures to  enliven the national debt market. Secondly, from the point of  the distribution and the number of exchanges, there is a fairly  wide east-west gap and a north-south gap in the development of  the securities markets. Currently, the exchanges in Shenzhen and  Shanghai are growing very rapidly; other regions are also  actively setting up exchanges. Looking at international  experiences, securities exchanges are always spread out in the  beginning, but gradually they become relatively centralized.  International experiences also show that a centralized market  facilitates the proper allocation of fund resource, but it also  tends to create monopoly and leads to inefficiency. More  spread-out markets facilitate competition and improve  efficiency, but if they are too spread-out, it can lead to  market separatism and improper resource allocation. Thus, we  must learn from other nations' experiences and lessons in  developing securities markets, avoid detours, and make sure that  the markets are neither too centralized nor too spread out.    4. The question of setting up a unified securities  monitoring  and administration system:    To make sure that the monitoring and administration of the  securities markets is uniform, efficient, and fair, nations have  set up specialized securities monitoring and administration  organs. Countries that rely mainly on government departments to  administer the stock markets have also set up specialized organs  to strengthen market supervision and administration after  experiencing stock market disasters. The creation of the State  Council's Securities Commission and Securities Supervisory  Commission was a first step toward smashing the old pattern of  putting too many departments in charge. These two agencies have  done much to smooth the relations among different departments  and between central and local governments, laying the foundation  for our monitoring and administrative tasks.    Based on the securities markets', especially the stock  market's, characteristics, we must gi ve full play to the  self-disciplinary organs. Therefore, we must turn the Securities  Trade Association into a bona fide self-disciplinary organ and  strengthen the securities business organizations' own  administration and monitoring procedure. In particular, we must  give full play to the accounting firms, the law firms, and other  civilian "economic police," so as to strengthen social  supervision. We must give full play to the securities exchanges'  functions, strengthen the supervision and administration of the  listing companies, stock exchange members, and the exchange  process. In short, while we strengthen the government's  supervision and administration of the stock market, we must give  even more play to the market mechanisms and set up a securities  market supervision and management system to oversee the  government management organs, the securities industry's  self-disciplinary organs, and the intermediaries at separate  levels and make them take responsibility for themselves while  working together harmoniously. China's securities supervision  and administration system will be perfected gradually as the  securities markets develop and as we accumulate experience. The  preliminary supervision and administration system we have set up  today is a major breakthrough, but there are still many problems  and contradictions which have not been completely sorted out,  and they must be gradually resolved.    5. The question of developing institutional investors to  improve the mix of investors:    Because it is a relatively young market, currently, most  investors in China's stock market are individual households.  They know relatively little about risks and can afford to take  little risk. They are susceptible to rumors and tend to follow  others blindly in and out of the market, making the market more  volatile and bringing losses to themselves. As the scope of the  stock market continues to expand, developing institutional  investors becomes a pressing issue. Today, we are in the process  of implementing reform of the social security system. We should  permit all kinds of insurance funds to get into the stock market  in the form of long-term investment. At the same time, we should  develop mutual funds and let professionals invest money for the  medium-sized and small investors, so as to lower the risks of  individual investors and make more profit for everyone.  Institutional investors have special significance in China: Once  organized, they will turn into legal entities and will no longer  be private investments, thus satisfying the principle of making  the public-ownership system the primary system and accelerating  the development of the shareholding system and the stock market.  Meanwhile, investing funds can effectively combat the rich  clients' improper manipulation of the market, and we can make  investments less of a gambler's game and turn short-term  investments into long-term investments. The development of funds  will make it easier for the publicly owned shares to be traded  in the market and for the party and go vernment cadres to  participate. But we must formulate laws as soon as possible, and  fund development must be orderly and gradual. We should not  develop closed-end funds, however. Some comrades say that  closed-end funds are "more like stocks than stocks," and some  say they are conducive to "speculations at both ends": At one  end, money can be pooled to speculate on stocks, and at the  other end, people can also speculate on the fund certificates  which are traded in the market. In addition, issuing funds  through internal allocation can cause more serious problems than  those created by stock issuance. In my opinion, we should  develop open-end funds. People can get in and out; the  securities are not traded on the market. This is safer and  better.    6. The question of using the securities markets to attract  more foreign capital:    Since the 1980's, circulation of international capital has  been achieved primarily through the raising of share capital  rather than debt financing. In the early days of refo rm and  opening up, we relied primarily on foreign businesses' direct  investments and commercial loans to attract foreign funds. In  the wake of the development of China's securities markets,  especially with the rise of the stock market, we have been able  to adapt to the changing trends and satisfy foreign business's  desire to invest in Chinese enterprises through stock purchases,  and the issuance of stock to attract foreign capital has been  put on top of the agenda since. Generally speaking, the goal of  investing in China and sharing the economic fruits and profits  can be reached equally through direct investments and stock  purchases; the results are basically the same. But buying stocks  makes the foreign businesses' investments even more versatile.  They can buy and sell stocks as a way to choose their investment  style and make more profit. Meanwhile, if China should modify or  change its policies (or if foreign businesses believe that  things are risky), they can promptly reduce or abandon their  investment plans in China. Direct investments are not as  convenient. Thus, issuing stocks to attract foreign capital is a  new, more versatile way of raising capital. For this reason, in  1991, we began experimenting with issuing B-shares which were  sold only to people living outside of Chinese territories. It  was the first time we used equity rights to raise foreign  capital, and it marked the first step in opening up the  securities markets. Looking at the results of that experiment,  it was a success. Since last year we have been studying Chinese  enterprises that listed their stocks overseas. The merit of  this approach is that it helps to make Chinese enterprises  better known abroad and encourages enterprises to get into the  international markets. It also introduces us to the advanced  management experiences of foreign securities industry and helps  us improve our own management of the securities markets. Through  consultation with the Hong Kong United Stock Exchange and  Securities Commission and others, and after reaching a  consensus, four companies, including the Shanghai Petrochemical  Company and Qingdao Brewery, have gone public in Hong Kong with  their H-shares since July. They are traded on the Allied  Exchange. This move has successfully opened up a new channel for  utilizing foreign funds.  <H5>  Further Developing and Perfecting the Securities Markets </H5>   As the socialist market economic system develops further,  the  securities markets must also become more sophisticated in order  to adapt to the ever accelerating rate of economic growth.  Thus, our main task in the next stage is to perfect the  securities markets' many imperfections.    1. Let the securities markets operate within the scope of a  complete legal system:    It is a long process to draw up securities laws and  regulations from scratch, and it is a long process to perfect  those laws and regulations. Since the formation of the  specialized supervisory and management organs last year, we have  immediately worked on the formulation of other relevant laws and  regulations. The State Council has just formally promulgated the  "Temporary Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange,"  and the "Trial Method of Managing the Securities Exchanges" has  also been announced by the Securities Commission. These are  important steps toward standardizing the ways the securities  markets operate.    But China's securities law and regulation system is still  imperfect. In particular, the "Corporate Law" and "Securities  Law" and other basic laws and regulations are still being  formulated. Today, besides focusing on the formulation of the  "Corporate Law" and "Securities Law," we must work on the  introduction of the "Method To Prevent Inside Trading and  Fraud," "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Stocks,"  "Code of Conduct for Securities Industry Personnel," "Method of  Managing Domestic Enterprises' Issuance and Listing of Stocks  Abroad," and other pertinent laws and regulations and the  "detailed rules" of their implementation, so as to he lp the  securities markets operate and develop steadily under a perfect  legal system.    2. Smooth out the market's operating mechanisms:    We must have smooth and coordinated market mechanisms in  order to give full play to the functions of the securities  markets. To perfect China's securities market mechanisms, we  must not only learn from international experiences but also take  into consideration China's own conditions.    First, we must make the market more transparent, that is, we  must make sure that all market information are made public. We  did not do this a few years ago. The managing departments only  asked that some information be disclosed at the time stocks were  issued, and the investors knew very little about the listing  enterprises. We did not have a system requiring full disclosure  of information about the listing companies. The system of full  disclosure is stipulated in the just-promulgated "Temporary  Regulations on Managing Stock Issuance and Exchange" and  "Detailed Rules on Disclosure of Information on Companies  Issuing Stocks." We must strictly enforce this provision.    Second, we must smash separatism and promote the creation of  a unified market. We have made great improvements in this area  in the last few years, but there are still incidents of regional  blockade and disregard of regulations, which obstruct the  formation of a unified market. To solve this problem, we must  work hard on the system as well as on the technical aspects. For  example, we must have uniform laws and reg ulations, improve the  exchanges, and acquire the technology and equipment to  accommodate out-of-town membership.    Third, we must study the question of circulation of publicly  owned shares. In the pilot projects in the past, those shares  basically could not be traded, and only personal shares could be  traded in the market, which made it impossible for the stock  market to fulfill its function to make structural adjustments of  the state-owned asset base. This problem must be solved, but it  is a complicated problem, because it involves the property  rights system and the system of management and administration of  state-owned properties.    Furthermore, we must also reform and unify the listing  companies' tax, financial, personnel, and wage systems and so  on. We must actively give play to the functions of the  intermediaries in the securities markets. We must further  improve the securities markets' settlement and trusteeship  systems and support the markets with modern technologies.    3. Standardize enterprises' transformation under the  shareholding system:    The shareholding companies operate very differently from the  way the state-run enterprises operate. There are strict  requirements put on the formers' internal power structure,  profit allocation, reward policy, and administration and  management. Today, everybody is going all out to transform  enterprises under the shareholding system. They ignore  standards, procedure, or requirements when reorganizing  enterprises, and they have created many problems. Some  enterprises just put a new label on the same old thing; their  internal management mechanisms and decision-making structure  have not changed. Others conceal important information, and  shareholders incur losses as a result. Thus, we must exert some  pressure and demand that enterprises follow regulations when  converting to the shareholding system and that they truly change  their management mechanisms, so that we can be sure that the  listing companies are of high quality, and in turn, we can  promot e the stock market's true prosperity.    4. Actively but steadily expand the scope of the stock  market  pilot project:    To develop the market economy, we must greatly expand the  stock market's capacity to meet the demands of enterprises'  diverse fund gathering activities. When we improved the markets'  laws and regulations and market mechanisms, we also set the  policy to expand the stock market pilot project nationwide. This  year, in accordance with the relevant economic growth policies  and based on the listing capacity of exchanges, every province  (municipality) will have one or two enterprises issuing stocks  to the public to raise capital. This is an arduous task, because  it is a large-scale, far-reaching, nationwide project, and many  localities have no experience. We have a lot of work to do. But  it is a very important task. It represents a big step forward  for China's stock market experiment. The securities markets will  make it increasingly easier for enterprises to gather funds. As  far as the securities markets themselves are concerned,  expanding the pilot project means an important test and  promotion of the development and improvement of their management  system, the securities exchanges' operating mechanisms, the  securities merchants' services, and other intermediary service  organizations. On the one hand, it will help us uncover problems  and deficiencies, so that we can promptly make remedies, and on  the other hand, it will train different types of professionals  and lay a sound foundation for future market development.    5. Continue to explore ways to utilize the stock market to  attract foreign investments:    So far we have issued 30 B-share stocks. The experiments  with  B-shares prove that using the stock market to attract foreign  capital is both versatile and effective. With regard to some of  the problems in the B-shares market, we will step up efforts to  come up with measures of improvement and will continue to  experiment with the market.    The trading of H-shares in Hong Kong has basically been a  success. The series of documents on laws, accounting, and joint  supervision worked out between us and the Hong Kong Allied  Exchange and Securities Commission can be valuable when we make  use of the securities markets of other major countries to raise  funds.</p>

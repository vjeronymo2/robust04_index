			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masashi Kunimitsu: "Hosokawa Coalition </F> Government Neither `Temporary' Nor `Two-Tiered'"]    [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which has  not become accustomed to its role as the opposition party, finds  itself in a predicament where it uses the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] in its former role as opposition party as  a model. On the other hand, we would like to see the coalition  parties become accustomed to their governing role quickly and  fulfill their public pledges.    The coalition cabinet has enjoyed smooth sailing in its  initial days. According to mass media public opinion surveys,  support ratings for the Morihiro Hosokawa cabinet are running at  the lowest level of 70 percent recorded by the NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN published in its morning edition of 24 August 1993,  while others ranged above 75 percent, including a surprising 82  percent by the SANKEI SHIMBUN. The highest rating in the past  was the 62 percent immediately following the inauguration of the  Kakuei Tanaka cabinet in 1972 in a survey by the ASAHI SHIMBUN.  These ratings reflect the fact that a majority of the general  public welcomes the collapse of "1955 system."    "Even in a questionnaire survey of bureaucrats in deputy  department head and higher positions in central government  agencies, conducted by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 72 percent of the  respondents welcomed the coalition government. The results of  that survey clearly reflect discontent held against the former  LDP government. When one views the reasons for the welcome such  as "We can expect the implementation of new policies" and "We  will be afforded the possibility of major policy options," one  can visualize the rigidity that had set in because of the  collusion between officials of the central government agencies  and LDP zoku Diet members and the resulting discontent generated  among middle and junior bureaucrats. During the past 20 years,  no change whatsoever has been made in budgetary allocations  concerning public works projects, welfare, and other areas. In  summary, what this means is that even bureaucrats did not have  freedom relative to policy options ever since the Tanaka cabinet  or since control by Tanaka. This means that the LDP is indeed  the organization that must undergo a thorough awakening and  fundamental self-reform."    Seeing that the coalition parties appointed popular Prime  Minister Hosokawa and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata to the most visible positions, the LDP attempted to  regain public support by appointing Yohei Kono who enjoys  national popularity as LDP president, Ryutaro Hashimoto as  Policy Research Council chairman, Shintaro Ishihara as acting  chairman of the newly created 21st Century Council (Hashimoto  serves as chairman) and a two-term junior House of  Representatives Diet member to the Executive Council.    "The fact that the LDP lost its majority status even in the  House of Representatives when the Hata faction (current  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) and Takemura group (current  Sakigake [Harbinger]) seceded and was not able to regain its  majority in the summer 1993 elections cannot be attributed  solely to the lack of public popularity on the part of the then  LDP president and prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. If it were a  case where elections can be won by purely pushing candidates  enjoying public popularity, why is it that the momentum of the  Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club petered out and eventually forced a  disbandment and return to the LDP? Why is it that when Ishihara  took over the former Nakagawa faction after the sudden death of  the late Ichiro Nakagawa the faction failed to expand and  eventually joined forces with the Fukuda faction (current  Mitsuzuka faction)? Why is it that when Hashimoto became LDP  secretary general and assumed overall leadership, the LDP lost  the House of Councilors election and its majority ranking. It is  a case where none of these circumstances was favorably  influenced by the popularity of the principal role player."    The LDP is not being asked by the public to pursue policies  aimed at running a popularity contest or temporizing. They seek  a fundamental alteration of its diathesis.    "A `prominent leading political party' is not supposed to  create an exaggerated brouhaha over a simple administrative  error wherein administrative bureau employees of the House of  Representatives misread the roll call and demand a repeat of  house elections. If there should be an omission in the roll  call, all that needs to be done is for the speaker to ask  whether any ballot omissions exist and to correct any omissions.  Further, such elementary roll calling systems which are subject  to errors should be abolished and action should be taken to  submit a resolution or bill to implement a push-button balloting  system as once proposed by the LDP itself. The LDP is acting  just like the Social Democratic Party of Japan did at one time  in a manner which is a metamorphosis of the latter's ox-walk  [delay] tactics. We can only view such conduct as signifying  that the LDP believes the SDPJ was once the model for opposition  parties."  <H5>  Heckling Leads to Questioning of LDP Character </H5>   "When nationwide attention was focused on Takako Doi's  selection as the first female speaker of the House of  Representatives and her acceptance speech, LDP Diet members  heckled her in a very intolerable manner. Because, as expected,  that situation was singled out for severe criticism by female  LDP Diet members during their first talks with LDP President  Kono and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, we anticipated that  such conduct would not be repeated. However, when Prime Minister  Hosokawa gave his general policy speech on 23 August, senseless  heckling, which could be better described as angry outcries,  almost drowned out the speech to the point where it was  inaudible. That conduct made one believe that the LDP is  convinced that savage behavior manifested in angry outcries,  irrespective of substance, plays a constructive role in making  the Diet a place of lively activity. There is no way that  creatures who cannot listen attentively to others are qualified  to represent the public."    Heckling is not an appropriate tactic in the Diet unless it  is sharp, graceful, and humorous as well as "pithy, terse, and  to the point." The late Takeyoshi Miki, who was called the  "heckling general" in the prewar Diet, used heckling tactics  that were typical of that standard. "Heckling tactics" used by  current Diet members make one question their character. Reform  of diathesis of this nature is required of today's LDP.    "Since general policy speeches will be broadcast live by the  Japan Broadcasting Service, close-up shots of Diet members  shouting senseless utterances should be broadcast along with  full name and electoral district. We must do so because the LDP  is not about to take corrective action, unless forced to do so  under such exposure."    Considering that LDP politicians will not act unless under  "external pressure," the public has no choice but to apply  pressure externally to make the LDP take corrective action.    There is no doubt that the Hosokawa cabinet enjoys a very  high degree of support, but only the future will tell whether it  will be able to respond to such expectations. When the LDP and  Communist Party engaged in representative questioning they  asked, "What's different between what you've said and the words  of the former LDP?" and "You lack specifics," but so-called  criticism voiced with an ulterior motive should be disregarded  and Hosokawa should endeavor to fulfill his convictions.    "The prime minister's first general policy speech was  favorably received by the public. He clearly declared a change  in era and launched anew a program for "responsible reform."  Further, in connection with World War II, he recognized Japanese  aggression and colonial control and apologized to the Asian  people who suffered as a result. Germany took similar action  immediately following defeat which means that Japan was late by  about 50 years, but such a performance was something you  obviously could not expect of the LDP. He also unequivocally  pledged political reform within the year. The prime minister has  stated that he will assume responsibility if that goal is not  reached within the year. We must recognize that as a courageous  stand."  <H5>  General Policy Speech Worthy of Recognition </H5>   The national image launched by the prime minister in the  form  of a goal to "create a simple and sincere nation encompassing a  lifestyle rich in substance and abundant in cultural traits" is  strongly reminiscent in terms of renewed memories of something  long forgotten rather than nostalgic feelings for those who can  recall the days when the theme of a "cultural nation" was overly  stressed in the postwar era. You might say the prime minister's  words reflect a very harsh criticism of the "1955 system" which  was contaminated by the principle of almighty money under  economic supremacy.    In connection with Japan's position relative to World War  II,  the prime minister has clearly determined it to be a war of  aggression and honestly apologized to people of other nations  who suffered damage and in his general-policy speech stated, "I  once again express profound remorse and apology for the  unbearable suffering and sorrow experienced by many people  because of past acts of aggression and colonial control by our  nation." Those Japanese officers and enlisted personnel who died  during the war did not even dream of it as being a war of  aggression, and more than just a few were convinced that they  were fighting for the sake of emancipating the greater East  Asian nations from imperialistic control of West European powers  for the establishment of a coprosperity sphere while some  members of surviving families of the dead probably sense  inconsistency in the determination that it was a "war of  aggression." However, mankind cannot demonstrate progress unless  he is willing to recognize facts as facts and to follow up with  the necessary corrective action. We must give recognition to the  attitude herein that reflects a determination not to whitewash  the past. However, if we were to refer to that war as the  "Pacific war" as labeled by the United States, we would have to  say that the description is reflective of the "historical view  of the Tokyo war tribunal" which provides a distorted view of  facts subservient to the U.S. perception of the war. The war  that was waged by Japan did not cover only the Pacific, but  covered Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, and should  accurately be titled the "East Asian war" or "Asian war." Then  and now, the United States, which treats the Pacific as a  national defense zone, felt it would be difficult to draft young  men for service as officers and enlisted personnel in an Asian  war and used as a national policy the slogan, calling for  protection of the Pacific defense zone. Therefore, to accept  that term indiscriminately would be incorrect and tantamount to  saying, "World War II was an unavoidable defensive war that was  forced upon the nation."    Now, we turn to the important topic of political reform, but  an "ideological confrontation" exists within the coalition  governing parties as to whether they should strive for a two  major-party system or a form of government calling for a  coalition of a fixed number of several parties such as three or  four. Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party  favor the two major-party system, while the Japan New Party,  Sakigake, and the SDPJ prefer a multiple party coalition.  Further, these differences have led to differences in the  subject concerning a system combining single-seat constituencies  with proportional representation in terms of increasing the  authorized seats for the small electoral districts over those  authorized for the proportional electoral districts or vice  versa and in terms of whether priority should be given to a  one-ballot system or a two-ballot system.  <H5>  Spreading "Fear of Ozawa" </H5>   "The SDPJ feels it will face a crisis in the disappearance  of  the party itself, if a one-ballot small electoral district  system is implemented. It would be better for a SDPJ unchanged  from the past to disappear. However, ever since the SDPJ became  a member of the coalition governing parties, its officials have  made an honest attempt to change. For example, when South Korea  published new information on the Kim Dae-jung incident of South  Korea, the SDPJ in the past would have reacted boisterously as  if it were Kim Dae-jung himself, but Deputy Chairman Kanju Sato  of the SDPJ, who is chairman of the National Public Safety  Commission, stated at a news conference that the issue is one  which has already been settled in diplomatic channels, but that  if something is still at issue concerning the incident, the  matter should be handled through diplomatic channels, not an  incident which should require action on the part of  investigative authorities. His statement was completely in  order, but for someone who viewed the SDPJ in light of past  practices, his response was astonishing. Further, relative to  the Defense Agency's airborne warning and control system (AWACS)  budget, the SDPJ has not altered its basic policy of opposition,  but even Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Hokkaido  Development, Okinawa Development, and National Land Agencies,  who previously spearheaded opposition, said in a news conference  that we should handle the issue with caution but that he would  comply with any decision made by the prime minister or director  general of the Defense Agency. This may be somewhat of an  uncomplimentary remark, but one wonders if there is such a  "reorientation effect," just because the SDPJ became one of the  ruling parties." However, the situation reflects a change for  the better and support for the SDPJ is growing for that very  reason."    The Japan New Party and Sakigake fear that if a two  major-party system is formed that they cannot ally themselves  with the LDP and that, if they were to unite with the non-LDP  forces, they would risk being controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, thus  putting them in a position where they advocate a two-ballot  system. This situation reflects the "fear of Ozawa" which also  exists within the LDP.    "A look at the process for forming the coalition cabinet and  the lineup for the cabinet clearly indicates "Ozawa  initiatives." Because Mr. Ozawa made an early decision to  support Mr. Hosokawa for prime minister and formed Shinseito and  unified faction after making four officials including Mutsuki  Kato secede from the LDP, even if Sakigake including Masayoshi  Takemura were to join hands with the LDP, it would have resulted  in two more seats being controlled by non-LDP forces, making an  LDP government impossible and forcing Mr. Takemura to join the  non-LDP elements. It is fact that the intensity with which the  situation was handled had a negative effect on unity."    "As one views the cabinet lineup, it is only logical that  Shinseito members with governing party experience filled  important cabinet posts, because a decision had been made  basically not to make any major changes from policies of the  previous government. However, even then, they are all filled by  Shinseito members, such as Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister  and foreign minister; Hirohisa Fujii, minister of finance;  Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry;  and Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry, and  fisheries. Further, even the post of director general of the  Defense Agency was filled by Keisuke Nakanishi, a confidant of  Mr. Ozawa who ranks equally with Mr. Kumagai. This means that  from the standpoint of universally accepted concepts, Shinseito  controls the innermost core posts, including those covering  diplomacy, basic industry (including agriculture), and the  military. From a human sentiment viewpoint, it is not a case  where one cannot understand the fear exercised against Mr. Ozawa  in any potential confrontation."    However, it would be a case of a fool judging everything by  the one thing he knows, and it would show a lack of thorough  analysis and shortsightedness "not seeing the forest for the  trees," if one were to conclude that the situation with Mr.  Ozawa is treated as a "two-tiered power system" like that which  existed in the LDP under Tanaka, Takeshita, or Kanemaru as  reported by the mass media.  <H5>  Election-System Reform Will Require Time </H5>   "A two-tiered power structure represents a system under  which  an individual like Kakuei Tanaka--who, although a member of the  Diet, has seceded from the LDP and is no longer a member of the  ruling party; and above all, he is unable to perform in an  official capacity and is unable to assume official or political  responsibility because he is criminally accused--assumes an  absolutely irresponsible position by influencing official  authority. However, Mr. Ozawa is currently a representative  official, or so-called secretary general or chief secretary of  the second ranking coalition party, is a member of the governing  party liaison council treated as an official agency and a member  of the House of Representatives Political Reform Special  Committee that must implement political reform, the most  important problem facing the cabinet, and thus placing him in a  position where he must assume responsibilities both officially  and politically. He reflects qualitatively an entirely different  individual compared to the two-tiered undercover kingmaker of  the LDP government days. This is a case where the mass media  does not have an accurate grasp of the facts or where they  merely distort the facts to sensationalize their reports."    "Moreover, under circumstances wherein there was no  opposition party that would attempt to overthrow and replace  the LDP, which established a stable government after winning a  majority of Diet seats, there were many individuals including  enough to spare who would truckle up to authority to become  prime minister in the LDP, even after rebelling against Tanaka  or even if Tanaka fired the last prime minister. And, even the  LDP acted in such a disorderly way or the opposition party were  to voice criticism, there was no chance whatsoever that the LDP  would lose governmental power. It was under those circumstances  that Tanaka, Takeshita, and Kanemaru were able to wield  unlawful power. However, no longer will Ozawa fire Prime  Minister Hosokawa because he dislikes him. Moreover, if Hosokawa  resigns on his own volition and there are many people that want  to replace him, the situation would be the same. As a minimum,  the Japan New Party and Sakigake will probably secede from the  coalition. And when that happens, the coalition will lose  governing power. A strong opposition party known as the LDP will  be vigilantly observing the situation with the intent of  recovering governing power. The situation is now entirely  different from the days when they spoke of control by the Tanaka  faction or control by the Takeshita faction and Kanemaru or the  Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa days. Even if Ozawa wanted to become an  undercover leader he would not be able to."    If Shinseito loses governing power and the LDP resumes  government control, it is quite obvious that the LDP will use  its authority to "destroy Ozawa." Unless Ozawa is willing to  tolerate that which is intolerable and bear that which is  unbearable, he will be unable to realize even a single political  conviction. Wherein lies the "two-tiered authority?" The answer  is obvious.    Further, the "theory of a temporary Hosokawa cabinet" is a  topic that is popular with the mass media. If the main  components of the political reform-related laws are not passed  within the year, the prime minister will resign as he publicly  pledged. Moreover, even if the main components are passed as  law, the allocation of electoral districts must be handled by a  third-party agency and decisions must be made on the  establishment of the agencies and selection of staff. Even if  the third-party agency is established, additional time will be  required for allocation of districts if the laws provide for a  two-ballot system centered on a proportional representation  system as advocated by the Japan New Party.    "The process to be handled by the third-party agency will be  relatively smooth if the law provides for 300 single-seat  districts and 200 seats for proportional representation with a  one-ballot system, because a trial plan covering that approach  was completed by the government's Election System Council during  the LDP government days. However, if they decide on a different  system, it will mean that district allocations will have to be  completely revamped. It would seem that a reduction from 300 to  200 electoral districts would be a simple matter, but  reallocation involves breaking up existing districts and merging  several districts or altering traditional urban districts,  inviting intense resistance. Even the establishment of the  proposed 300 small electoral districts caused a lot of  commotion. Changing that once more poses a very difficult task."    The district allocations must be included in a legislative  proposal and approved by the Diet, which means that even if the  principal components of the reform legislation are passed into  law as pledged by the prime minister during the extraordinary  session of the Diet in the fall, the earliest that the district  allocation plan can be submitted to the Diet will be during the  next extraordinary Diet session where it will require debate,  providing for passage next summer at the earliest. Moreover,  since it will be a major reform, provision must be made for  familiarization and preparatory periods. Since such a period  will require at least "several months" according to veteran  member of the Election System Council Tan Horie, professor of  Keio University, actual general elections cannot be held until  year after next in 1995 at the earliest. Moreover, there is the  possibility that Diet deliberations can be delayed because of  the myriad of issues outstanding, such as economic  countermeasures and international economic negotiations.  <H5>  Hosokawa and Takemura Are Shrewd Individuals </H5>   By just looking at the near-term political agenda limited to  political reform, even if the Hosokawa cabinet endeavors to  realize reform and enjoys the support of the public, it is  obvious the task cannot be accomplished in one year. This means  that the Hosokawa government must remain in power for more than  one year. Needless to say, if the mass media forms a collusive  relationship with the LDP for the sake of frustrating attempts  at reform and thinks in terms of an early exit for Mr. Hosokawa,  then the story will be different."    If one were to analyze why a seemingly fragmented opposition  group formed a coalition, one will find that they realized that  any LDP government would dissolve and call for general elections  of the House of Representatives whenever it was to the latter's  advantage and recover its majority in both the lower and upper  houses, forcing the opposition to resign itself into being  permanent elements of that fate. The coalition was formed  because the parties involved realized that it was necessary to  control the authority to dissolve the House of Representatives  as well as the authority to govern. I would think that they are  determined to preserve unity, conduct concurrent upper and lower  house elections two years later under the new system and  continue in government. Now that they are in power, they must  have realized the "value of being in power." Having come to that  realization, they probably will not relinquish power so easily.  To begin with, the purpose of political parties is to serve as  the group and the means for implementing policies reflecting  pledges made to the public whose goals cannot be achieved  without being in control of the government. To embrace that  thought process is logical whether it be the LDP or any other  party and any party in power that says, "We are not ardently  attached to our government authority," would be displaying an  attitude that is tantamount to the abandonment of duties or  position as politicians and party members.    Further, the inaccuracy of the "theory of Ozawa authority"  lies in the fact that advocates of that theory are not aware of  the shrewdness of the Prime Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura.    "The Hosokawa clan included Makitaka Hosokawa (pen name  Yusai) first-generation head of clan who served and sustained,  during the turbulent war days, prominent figures with strong  personalities such as Akiyoshi Ashikaga, Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi  Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa. After Mitsuhide Akechi conquered  Nobunaga at Honno Temple and his daughter Tama (Christian name  Galatia) married into the Hosokawa clan, the former asked the  Hosokawa clan to ally itself with him, but the latter rejected  the request, while not allying itself with Hideyoshi, preserving  the clan and demonstrating the presence of considerable  resourcefulness and skills in conducting unflagging  negotiations. It is said that that resourcefulness originated  with experience gained during the feudal age and Chinese  classics, while the current prime minister has been trained in  the "Hosokawa clan discipline." The prime minister was tutored  in Chinese books such as the Analects of Confucius, was exhorted  by his grandfather Moritaka to meet with "first-class  personalities" and has observed politics through frequent  meetings with the late Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Hosokawa  is also of a lineage including ancestors with brutal powers to  act in connection with reform such as father of the revival of  the Hosokawa clan Shigenori (8th generation) and Morihisa (14th  generation). He has also observed the actions of his late  grandfather Prince Fumimaro Konoe. He is no one to be  disregarded."    "Mr. Takemura is also an individual who has served as  governor in the Omi region (Shiga Prefecture) whose `merchants  are known for their shrewdness.' He vacillated somewhat between  remaining an LDP member or becoming a non-LDP Diet member and in  the end shrewdly assumed the key cabinet position of chief  cabinet secretary. Moreover, he appointed as deputy chief  cabinet secretary Yukio Hatoyama the eldest son of a  distinguished family and member of the same Sakigake, while  appointing as the prime minister's special assistant Hideyuki  Tanaka also a member of Sakigake, thus consolidating the Prime  Minister's Official Residence with close associates. Typical of  Ministry of Home Affairs bureaucrats, he is of a character that  defies conjecture."    The LDP has been relegated to the status of opposition  party,  is overwhelmed by a on-rushing sense of desolation, lacks  factional leadership, is short of funds, controls no cabinet  posts, and is plagued with a psychological disintegration  phenomenon. There's even the observation that it is more  vulnerable than the coalition parties. Even in that sense, we  are at a "new historical departure point."</p>

Under the resolution, the most important task of the State  Duma is to ensure legislative support for the development of the  Russian Federation in order to create an integral and stable  democratic country with due respect for human rights, efficient  economy, and which persistently realises principles of federal  relations and ensures the rights of nations and nationalities.    The government of the Russian Federation is entrusted to  work  out measures for overcoming the socio-economic crisis in the  country. Lawmakers pointed out that the State Duma should  continue its work to prevent further decline in Russia's  industry and agriculture and create an efficient  socially-oriented system of the industrial complex aimed at the  constructive revival of the industrial and agricultural  potential.    In accordance with main provisions of the presidential  message and sharing his concern over the situation in the  country and stemming from lawmakers' commitments and electors'  wishes, the State Duma intends to prepare and work out the most  important laws aimed at taking the country out of crisis and  stabilising its economy, carrying out the reform of budgetary,  taxation, credit and financial system and protecting domestic  manufacturers.    Priority should be given to federal constitutional laws,  federal laws in the sphere of franchise and civil rights, the  right to work and housing, judicial reform and human rights.    Proceeding from the fact that the insolvency crisis and  overdue wages pose a special threat, fraught with serious social  upheaval, the State Duma decided to turn to the president and  the government with a proposal that this problem be resolved  without delay and in the shortest possible time.</p>

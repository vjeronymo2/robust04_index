			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev commentary: "Elections Financing: "None </F> Will be the Wiser?"]    [Text] Today is the deadline for submitting to the Central  Electoral Commission documents about the sources of financing  for the election campaigns of deputies and electoral blocs.  While some blocs will have no difficulty providing the  documents, a sizable number of deputies and parties have nothing  to line up. One need not be surprised at a situation where, for  example, the special account of "Zhirinovskiy's party" will show  "zero" both in income and outgo in addition to the 50 million  rubles issued by the Central Electoral Commission. Whereas the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] had to disclose this  account if only to receive the government subsidy for television  in the election campaign, for many deputies doing so simply made  no sense.    The fact is that the election regulation is only very  particular about the use of special election accounts, whereas  no one proscribes the use of any other accounts belonging to  these persons and parties or to totally extraneous ones. This  is something that virtually all blocs and deputies did. More,  the extremely detailed rules on the use of special accounts  envision no concrete sanctions for their violation. Therefore,  neither the use of foreign sources nor the receipt of state  funds to finance an election campaign can really endanger one's  deputy seat thus received.    However, accountants for newspapers, radio stations and,  first and foremost, television have all the documents in payment  for ads and air time. The content of these documents is no  commercial secret or even simply confidential information. No  one is preventing television and the newspapers from publishing  the sizes and sources of payment of these election campaign  expenses -- and thereby to fulfill their moral and civic duty  since the poorly compiled election regulations leave society at  sea about who finances today's people's choices.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Corruption of Kim Yong-sam Group" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  has never let a chance pass by without saying "he would not  receive or request political funds from anyone."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands his remarks  as  a lie.    Though the traitor is still advertising his "uprightness,"  the offensive smell is coming from "Chongwadae [presidential  office]," the analyst says, and goes on:    A few days ago, the president of the Democratic Party of  South Korea told a special press conference that Kim Yong-sam  was involved in the large-scale sangmudae political fund scandal  which has caused quite a stir and urged him to make the case  clear.    The scandal means that a big part of some 150 billion won  earmarked for the project of the transfer of the Sangmudae  Military Training Centre of the puppet army in Kwangju flowed  into "Chongwadae," "the Democratic Liberal Party" and "the  administration."    With the opposition party's offensive intensified over the  scandal, "Chongwadae" and "the DLP" are now trying hard to hush  it up.    Kim Yong-sam, the chieftain of corruption, is crying in  public for "a thorough investigation into the scandal," while  covertly manipulating the prosecution to hush it up.    It has been revealed once again that the "civilian" clan  including the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "DLP" and  "administration" is a gang of robbers.    To cap it all, it has been brought to light that the second  son of the traitor took 120 million won as a political fund from  the Han Yang Business Relief Committee with a promise to "settle  the public appeal."    With public resentment growing in this regard, "the  civilian"  regime is trying to shift the blame for the Sangmudae scandal on  to "Chongwadae in the Sixth Republic" and the blame for the  scandal related to the second son of the traitor on to the  former "chief secretary of Chongwadae in charge of  rectification." The traitor Kim is a master hand in dodging the  blame by shifting it on to others.    The "civilian" regime's advertisement about "uprightness"  and  "liquidation of corruption" has fallen on the ground. The  reality shows that the "civilian" regime is more corrupt than  the "Fifth and Sixth Republics."    The Kim Yong-sam group had better step down from power  before  it is too late.</p>

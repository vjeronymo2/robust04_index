			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACID-WASH PATENT HOLDERS TARGETING DEEP POCKETS OF JEANS MAKERS  </P> <P> Acid-wash jeans are being put to a litmus test.  </P> <P> The outcome could decide a burning issue in the denim business: Can anyone  freely make acid-wash jeans? Or do jeans makers need to pay hundreds of  millions in fees for the right to corrode pants and jackets?  </P> <P> The dispute, which involves past and future patent royalties, comes at a time  when the popularity of acid-wash denims is, well, fading somewhat.  </P> <P> "It's not a wash we even carry anymore," said Nancy Rosen, a buyer for  fashion-forward Judy's Inc., a women's apparel chain based in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> But, Rosen added, two or three years ago "when it was hot, it was incredibly  hot. Everybody had to have acid-wash."  </P> <P> And acid-wash clothes still are a very big seller at many less fashionable  retail chains, continuing to account for an estimated 35% of U.S sales of denim  pants this year.  </P> <P> Acid-washing fades denims in a variety of ways. On dark blue denim, it can add  white splotches. On black denim, it provides a white "topping."  </P> <P> Likewise, among different manufacturers, variations of the process have an  array of names: blizzard wash, ice wash, powder wash and white lightening.  </P> <P> The two firms trying to enforce acid-wash patent rights say they are entitled  to royalties from such U.S. jeans giants as San Francisco's Levi Strauss &amp;  Co. and the East Coast firms that make Lee, Wrangler, Jordache and Gitano  jeans. They claim that Levi Strauss alone owes $100 million in back royalties.  </P> <P> Waging the fight against the jeans makers are Golden Trade S.R.L. of Italy and  its U.S. licensee, Greater Texas Finishing Co., an industrial laundry in El  Paso, Texas. Golden Trade won a U.S. patent for acid-wash in 1988 and sold the  exclusive U.S. rights to Greater Texas Finishing four months ago.  </P> <P> Soon afterward, Greater Texas Finishing notified jeans makers that they were  violating patent rights and would need to pay up.  </P> <P> That drew some caustic comments from the jeans industry. Jordache Enterprises  Chairman Joe Nakash scored Miles Rubin and Eric Rothfeld, the Stanford Law  School-educated businessmen who own Greater Texas Finishing, for seeking  "exorbitant" payments.  </P> <P> "It is unfair for American retailers and consumers to pay higher prices so that  a couple of lawyers could make a killing on their purchases of the patent  rights," Nakash said in a recent news release.  </P> <P> Rothfeld replied that he has nothing to apologize for.  </P> <P> "We're in an industry of opportunism and opportunity," Rothfeld said.  "Businesses aren't in it for philanthropic purposes."  </P> <P> Rothfeld added that he found it "peculiar" that a firm such as Jordache, which  vigorously protects its own trademarks, would "fail to acknowledge and  recognize someone else's property rights."  </P> <P> In fact, Rothfeld said it was concern that Greater Texas Finishing might be  infringing on Golden Trade's rights that prompted the El Paso firm to acquire  licensing rights for acid wash in the first place.  </P> <P> The legal battle is shaping up largely as an argument over whether acid-washing  meets the standards for a patent under U.S. law. Levi Strauss and Jordache  haved filed suits in federal courts in Louisiana and Washington, D.C., to try  to invalidate the existing patent, on the grounds that Golden Trade's process  was neither original nor a genuine advance.  </P> <P> "It's an industry process that was available to any company before the patent  was applied for," argued Robert A. Spiegelman, a Jordache lawyer.  </P> <P> The process is roughly akin to the way many college students beat up their  jeans using pumice stones and bleach. Still, Rothfeld describes acid washing as  the work of a "genius inventor" and says that the patent covers the use of  other types of stones and oxidizing agents, too.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> SALES OF JEANS  </P> <P> An estimated 400 million pairs of denim pants are expected to be sold in the  United States in 1990, with market shares divided as follows:  </P> <P> Acid wash: 35%  </P> <P> Stone wash: 30%  </P> <P> Pre-washed: 15%  </P> <P> Untreated blue jeans: 15%  </P> <P> Bleached: 5%  </P> <P> Source: Levi Strauss &amp; Co.  </P></p>

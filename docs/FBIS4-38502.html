			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliamentary  delegation, which began a four-day visit to Moscow on Saturday  [21 May], met Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Duma (lower chamber  of the Russian parliament) today.    The four-member delegation, led by Chairman of the Slovak  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Ivan Laluha, also met  first deputy chairman of the Duma, Mikhail Mityukov, Deputy  Chairman of the Council of the Federation (upper house) Valerian  Viktorov and members of parliament and parliamentary committees.    No meeting was scheduled with the radical nationalist  Liberal  Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.    Discussion centered on the Partnership for Peace Programme  and cooperation with NATO, Laluha said at a press conference.  The Russian parliamentarians emphasized that Moscow's position  on the question in no way constituted a threat to the security  of the countries of Central Europe, he said. The view prevalent  in the Duma is that integration into European structures is  exclusively an internal political matter of the Central European  states themselves, he said.    The delegation also extended an invitation to visit  Slovakia.    Laluha declared the visit a success. He stressed the  delegation had comprised members of both the government and the  opposition because the foreign policy aim of full integration  into Western economic and security structures found consensus in  Slovakia.    The delegation received assurances that the Russian-Slovak  treaty signed by presidents Boris Yeltsin and Michal Kovac last  August would be debated by the Duma as a matter of priority.  The delay in ratification was not due to any misunderstandings  but the need to work out some essential procedures, he said.</p>

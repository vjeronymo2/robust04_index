			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (29): Lots of attractions - Tourism Tourism may well have the largest potential for growth of any industry in Bolivia. At least that is the way the government sees it. A plan to develop tourism - the first in the history of Bolivia according to government officials - aims to boost industry income from Dollars 115m at present to Dollars 1bn within a decade. Instead of the present 265,000 visitors a year close to 1m are to be enticed to the country. 'We want more tourists; have them stay longer; spend more money; and speak well of our country when they leave,' says Mr Ricardo Rojas, secretary of tourism. 'If you look at other countries that have been successful in tourism, you'll notice that they've focused on a few well-targeted, key development projects,' says Mr Rojas. A new tourism law, which the government hopes to have approved by March 1995, will provide long-term tax exemptions to attract foreign investment to several so-called 'mega-projects.' In exchange for foreign capital, the government pledges to provide the basic infrastructure for a project, train the personnel, and promote tourism abroad. A list of proposed sites is to be made known shortly. The government is aware that it faces a challenging task. Not only is there an enormous information deficit about Bolivia among international tour operators, but it also suffers from an image problem - that of a politically unstable and drug-ridden country. Many tourists still only visit Bolivia as part of a two- or three-country tour. 'We get many tourists venturing into Bolivia on a brief excursion following an extensive tour of Peru: that needs to change,' says the manager of a leading tour operator. As part of its promotional activities, the government inaugurated a tourist office in New York on August 1 and plans to open others in Spain and Germany by next year. A toll-free information line is operating in the US, and Bolivia plans to attend international tourism fairs, including the World Travel Market in London between November 14 and 17. The image which the government will be trying to sell to the public is that of a safe and cheap country boasting enormous diversity and friendly people. One promotional brochure says that 'Bolivia is the new undiscovered tourist destination' and that 'Bolivia is definitely the last frontier' for those seeking ancient cultures or ecological adventure. The potential exists. Tourist attractions in Bolivia abound. Only an 1 1/2 hours from La Paz, for example, are the crystal-clear waters of Lake Titicaca, 4,000m above sea level and fed by the melting waters of the snow-capped peaks of the Cordillera Real, which forms a breath-taking backdrop. On the island of Paco, the villagers of Suriki demonstrate their skills in constructing balsas, or reed canoes, which the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl used in his voyages and which the Spanish adventurer Kitin Munoz is soon to take on a world tour. Nearby, Tiwanaku is probably Bolivia's most important archaeological site, featuring monumental stone figures and the so-called Sun Gate, which give testimony to what was once the capital of one of the world's longest-reigning empires. The pre-Incan Tiwanaku civilisation, famed for advanced agricultural systems that are now being revived, is said to have had significant cultural influence on the subsequently larger Inca empire. Opportunities for mountain climbing or trekking are numerous near La Paz. Peaks such as the Ilimani or Huayna Potosi, rising over 6,300m are easily accessible and can be climbed in two days. Stone-paved Inca trails, still employed by farmers and their produce-laden llamas, are ideal for treks through the Andean mountains. A trip out to Bolivia's Amazon region is worthwhile. Visitors can see Jesuit missions some 220km north-east of Santa Cruz in the middle of the tropical rain forest. Missionaries from Bavaria, Switzerland and Bohemia went there in the early 17th century to convert the Chiquitano Indians to Christianity and train them as musicians and artisans. Today, half a dozen of the world's most unique churches make the story of The Mission come alive. They still serve as community centres for thousands Chiquitanos. Eastern Bolivia, with its rich biodiversity has enormous potential for eco-tourism. A large number of local bird species, among them the blue-throated or red-fronted macaws, make it an ornithologist's paradise. Access to, and facilities within, the country's protected areas - which boast a wealth of natural beauty - are rather limited, however. A lack of infrastructure is also evident at other tourist sites such as Samaipata, which features important vestiges of an Amazon tribe in the Andean foothills but is still rather unprotected and unexplored.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HEIGHTENED hopes for a German interest rate cut at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting prompted a squeeze and fuelled a strong performance in stock index futures, writes Christine Buckley. Dealers, anxious not to be caught short should their interest rate cut hopes come true, moved back into the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index. The interest boosted volume to 12,150 lots, only a little short of double the previous day's amount. The appeal of the contract was bolstered by its healthy premium to the underlying cash market, which at times touched a lead of 20 points. It finished 10 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Increased volume in the cash market also stimulated interest in futures. The September contract opened at 2,867 and gave up only a point in early trading before pushing steadily upwards. The day's high came in the last half-hour when it reached 2,897, and a little selling brought it back to a close of 2,894. The December contract finished at 2,904. Investor interest was mixed, coming from large institutions and independent traders. Traded options saw active trading, with volume swelling to 36,760 lots. Equity options business was stimulated by today's expiry of the July option. The most heavily traded stock option was British Steel on 4,688 lots dealt.</p>

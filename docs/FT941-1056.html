			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Motoring: Ford raises the coupe stakes At Pounds 19,350, the Ford Probe 24v, 2.5-litre V6 raises the sports coupe stakes. This elegant, Mazda-inspired and US-made three-door went on sale this week at prices undercutting those of most rivals. A 16v, two-litre version is cheaper still at Pounds 15,995. The Probe, Ford's first sports coupe since the Capri, has gone too far up-market to be called a Capri replacement. The 24v I drove last week was a swift although silky performer: quiet on the motorway, flexible in traffic, eagerly responsive when required. Young (or just young in heart) business motorists used to driving mainly on their own would find one a nice change after several Granadas or Scorpios.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Jakarta urged to ban plutonium ship Indonesia's leading environmental group urged the government yesterday to ban a Japanese ship transporting plutonium from passing through its waters in the straits of Malacca, Reuter reports from Jakarta. 'We ask the government to refuse the ship carrying plutonium the right to enter Indonesian waters,' the Indonesian Environmental Forum said.

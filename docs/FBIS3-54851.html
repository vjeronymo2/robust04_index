Your political rating is very high. Currently, you are first  in all the polls. Tell me, please, how the former first  communist secretary of Lithuania has managed to gain this  authority? What is the "secret" of your political success?    [Brazauskas] You know, I have been the first secretary for  quite a short time....    [Fris] However, your reforms have scared the nonflexible  communist majority....    [Brazauskas] It is possible. I was a party leader for only  two years. During the first year, we were looking for ways out  of the CPSU membership. The second year was devoted to reforms  within the party. Next, two years of opposition followed. Only  the 1992 elections demonstrated surprising results.    [Fris] [passage omitted] If I understand you correctly, you  differentiate between economic cooperation and the true  independence of Lithuania.    [Brazauskas] Of course. We are an independent state which is  recognized by the international community. Our economic  cooperation is built on mutually beneficial relations. Some  representatives of our opposition propose to eliminate such  relations. As for me, I do not worry about our foreign economic  contacts.... There is no returning to the past.    [Fris] What are your relations with Mr. Landsbergis  [opposition leader]?    [Brazauskas] Mr. Landsbergis could have run in the  elections,  however, he did not do so for unknown reasons. It seems to me  that he did not want to take the risk. As for our opposition,  it is very powerful. It has done a lot for Lithuania and I  cannot deny this fact. The opposition had, of course, created  its own political structures when it was in power. Currently,  four parties out of five represented in the legislature are in  opposition to us. Nevertheless, we are working. I am trying to  meet with representatives of various parties and discuss  political issues with them. Mr. Landsbergis and I meet quite  often and debate various issues. However, I do not see any  dangers facing Lithuania, which, in the opinion of Mr.  Landsbergis, is in itself threatening to our Republic. Our  organs of power have been elected in a democratic manner. I  invite all our people to work for the state. Let us resolve  complicated issues together.    [Fris] [passage omitted] Mr. Brazauskas, my interview cannot  be finished without your comments on Lithuanian-Ukrainian  relations. They can be called rather weak....    [Brazauskas] To my regret, our relations are weak with many  countries. The first reason for this includes broken economic  relations, privatization, new addresses, new leaders.... In  addition, our governments have changed too often. In a word,  these reasons are of an objective character. At the same time,  however, many of our companies have stable economic contacts  with Ukraine and these relations are deepening. We have several  intergovernmental agreements, including the agreement on free  trade. So, we have the necessary agreements but lack specific  conditions. I know that Ukraine is experiencing an energy  crisis and a high rate of inflation. You will overcome these  difficulties. I would like to bring something new to our  relations.    [Fris] Thank you.</p>

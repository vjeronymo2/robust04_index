			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG LORDS VOW WAR ON COLOMBIA;  </P> <P> 4 NEW BOMBINGS BLAMED ON CARTELS; GOVERNMENT INTENSIFIES CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> With a renewed wave of terror, bombings and death threats, Colombia's fugitive  drug lords declared "total and absolute war" on the country's political and  business leadership Thursday, ominously targeting even the families of those  who resist them.  </P> <P> "We prefer a tomb in Colombia to a jail in the United States," the drug lords  declared in an inflammatory communique left early Thursday at the site of one  of four new bombing targets.  </P> <P> One man died in blasts at the Medellin headquarters of Colombia's two leading  political parties. Another man was injured in one of three other attacks in and  near Medellin that left the homes of two prominent politicians in flames and  another pockmarked by bullets. Police said the attacks and the bombings in the  early morning hours appeared to be coordinated.  </P> <P> On Thursday evening the government issued a series of new decrees aimed at  pressing an official offensive against the drug traffickers. Included in the  decrees are measures for destroying unauthorized private airstrips and  disposing of property confiscated from suspected traffickers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'All Who Have Persecuted'  </P> <P> The earlier statement from the drug lords said: "We declare total and absolute  war on the government, the industrial and political oligarchy, the journalists  who have attacked and outraged us, the judges who have sold themselves to the  government, high court extraditing judges and presidential and sectorial  (social, business and labor) associations, and all who have persecuted and  attacked us."  </P> <P> It was signed "The Extraditables," a group that has been identified in the past  as the top leadership of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, all of them wanted  men in the United States.  </P> <P> Their warning added that "we will not respect the families of those who have  not respected our families."  </P> <P> "These people are serious," said a leading Colombian newspaper editor who asked  to remain unnamed because of the direct threat contained in the drug lords'  message. "This is the most serious thing I have seen in my life," he added,  noting that more than a dozen journalists and hundreds of government officials  have been killed by cartel hit squads here in recent years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revulsion After Assassinations  </P> <P> Colombia's current crackdown against the drug cartels was begun against a  background of national revulsion following the assassinations last week of an  appeals court judge, a police chief and a leading presidential candidate who  had vowed to combat narcotics trafficking.  </P> <P> Minutes after the murder Friday of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan as  he was about to begin a campaign speech, President Virgilio Barco Vargas issued  emergency decrees allowing extradition of drug suspects to the United States  and confiscation of their property. Since then, police and military units have  conducted more than 300 raids, detaining more than 10,000 people and seizing an  estimated $200 million worth of drug suspects' property.  </P> <P> A Defense Ministry spokesman said Thursday that the "great majority" of those  detained have been released without charges after questioning.  </P> <P> Under one of Thursday's additional decrees, owners will be required to  personally claim seized properties and prove that they were acquired with  legitimate funds within 10 days. It is unlikely that suspected traffickers will  emerge from hiding to make their claims.  </P> <P> If they do not, their properties will be turned over to government agencies for  redistribution, according to the decree. Farms and ranches will be broken up  and distributed to landless peasants, urban properties will go to a family  welfare agency, cash and automobiles will be given to a judicial fund to  improve court working conditions, and planes and boats will be turned over to  the armed forces.  </P> <P> Another decree requires provincial officials to inventory private airstrips.  Unauthorized landing strips, often used for cocaine trafficking, will be  destroyed.  </P> <P> The decree also requires distributors of aviation fuel to report to the  government on their customers.  </P> <P> Under Colombian law, the country's Supreme Court is required to review the  decrees and rule on their constitutionality within 40 days. One of Thursday's  decrees provides special protection for justices conducting the review.  </P> <P> An American narcotics expert involved in the government crackdown said  Thursday's bombings and threats fit the pattern of Medellin cartel behavior.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Are Cornered'  </P> <P> "We're not surprised," he said. "They are cornered, and their only hope is to  intimidate and bend the will of the government.  </P> <P> "They have been very good at following through on what they say they will do,"  he said, adding his hope "that the government stands tall to this challenge."  </P> <P> "I'm very confident that if they (the government) can stay in there, they are  going to win this war," the drug expert said.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy in Bogota, which normally operates under tight security  measures, appeared Thursday to have heightened its alert. About 100 U.S.  officials are attached to the embassy, and about two dozen agents of the Drug  Enforcement Administration work in this country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Passer-by Dies  </P> <P> The early morning wave of terror in Medellin, an industrial city of 2 million  that has long been the headquarters of the biggest drug cartel, began with  shattering explosions at the headquarters of Galan's faction of the ruling  Liberal Party and the opposition Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Liberal Party office manager Gustavo Garcia said that a passer-by was killed in  a blast that took the roof off the one-story concrete-and-brick building and  shattered windows throughout the downtown business block.  </P> <P> At about the same time, the vacation homes just outside Medellin of former  Finance Minister Edgard Gutierrez of the Liberal Party and Sen. Ignacio Velez  Escobar of the Conservative Party were burned down. A third home, that of  prominent industrialist Augusto Lopez Valencia, a top official of the  Bavaria-Bouverie industrial conglomerate, was assaulted and shot up by a gang  of about 10 armed men, according to a police spokesman.  </P> <P> Police also found and defused two suitcase bombs, each containing 22 pounds of  explosives, at the Medellin stations of the nation's two top radio networks,  Caracol and RCN, owned by families that are among Colombia's wealthiest.  </P> <P> The Medellin drug lords are known to be hostile to the old-money families of  the industrial city in which they have made their headquarters. Their  communique warning of attacks against the oligarchy was left with the suitcase  bomb at the Caracol radio station, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Destruction Vowed  </P> <P> "We will burn and destroy the industry's properties and mansions of the  oligarchy," said the threatening statement of the drug lords.  </P> <P> A European diplomat said the warning to "the oligarchy" was clearly meant to  scare the country's dominant upper classes so that they will press for a  relaxation of the Barco government's crackdown on the traffickers.  </P> <P> "They are the target," the diplomat said. "The cartel is saying, 'If you are  going to play ball with Barco, we're going to hit you.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whereabouts Unknown  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the major drug lords remained a mystery. The  three top Medellin drug traffickers -- Pablo Escobar, estimated to worth more  than $3 billion; Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and Jorge Ochoa -- are believed to be  in hiding somewhere in Colombia, despite reports that they may have fled to  Panama, according to the American drug expert.  </P> <P> Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma branded the reports as "false and  tendentious" in a letter to Barco on Thursday.  </P> <P> "We're getting a lot of information of their being in many places," the drug  expert said. "But my gut feeling is that Escobar is still here in Colombia.  </P> <P> "My educated guess is they prefer to stay in areas where they feel some sense  of control, they feel secure. They know if they make a mistake in a third  country, their chances of being extradited are significant."  </P> <P> The drug expert said that the American legal documents necessary to extradite  Eduardo Martinez Romero, so-called finance minister of the Medellin cartel, who  remains the top drug figure arrested since Saturday, are expected to arrive in  Bogota today, in plenty of time to continue holding him until he can be sent to  the United States.  </P> <P> Under Barco's emergency decree, Martinez would have been eligible for release  early next week if the U.S. documents failed to arrive on time, the expert  said.  </P> <P> He added that two other drug figures whom he described as "Class 1, in the same  class as Pablo Escobar," also face quick extradition. They are Ana Beatriz  Rodriguez Tamayo and Bernardo Londono Quintero, both under indictment in the  United States.  </P> <P> In their threatening communique Thursday, the drug lords sought to portray  themselves as peace-loving nationalists who had sought in vain to find accord  with the government but had been persecuted by "anti-nationalists."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Will Continue Our Struggle'  </P> <P> "We will not lower our flag, and we will continue our struggle and our total  war against the anti-nationalists and the sellers of the motherland," their  statement said.  </P> <P> "We have been asking the government for peace since the talks in Panama in  1984, when violence could have been avoided," the statement said. It apparently  referred to a 1984 meeting between cartel representatives and former President  Alfonso Lopez Michelsen in Panama during which they proposed repatriating $2  billion a year in return for a blanket amnesty from the government.  </P> <P> "The only reply we have received from the government has been repression -- the  arbitrary searches, unjust arrests of our families, the plundering of our  homes," said the declaration.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Israel's government sought to distance itself from actions of  Israeli citizens in Colombia reported to have trained assassination teams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Permit Was Given  </P> <P> The Defense Ministry announced that a firm linked with drug lords in Colombia  had never received a permit from the government to sell arms or give training  to anyone in Colombia.  </P> <P> The firm, Hod Hahanit, a Tel Aviv company that specializes in security and  military know-how, approached the Defense Ministry a year ago to ask permission  to do business in Colombia but was turned down, according to the a Defense  Ministry announcement. It was not clear why permission was withheld.  </P> <P> The announcement went on to say that another, unidentified firm violated  Defense Ministry controls and worked for clients in Colombia.  </P> <P> In Israel, companies selling weapons or giving military training abroad must be  licensed by the Defense Ministry. There are an estimated 800 such firms  operating in scores of countries.  </P> <P> The operator of Hod Hahanit has been identified as Yair Klein, a retired  Israeli army colonel. Government radio said he was expected to return to the  country from a trip abroad next week. Government sources in Tel Aviv said that  between 10 and 12 emloyees of the company had been in Colombia recently and  left during the past few days.  </P> <P> American television broadcast videotape purporting to show Israeli mercenaries  training "hit teams" of Colombian drug dealers. Colombian newspapers reported  that foreigners, including Israelis, may have carried out the recent  assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential candidate campaigning  against the drug trade.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Daniel Williams, in Jerusalem, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

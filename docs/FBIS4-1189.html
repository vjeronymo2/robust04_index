			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Merton and N. Lewis] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- A stand-off between  African National Congress supporters holed up in the Ulundi  police station, KwaZulu, and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] members  gathered outside the premises seemed to have ended on Saturday  [23 April] evening following the intervention of IFP leader  Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    The ANC supporters and Independent Electoral Commission  monitors sought sanctuary at the police station earlier on  Saturday after two people were killed and two vehicles torched  in clashes between the ANC members and IFP supporters in  downtown Ulundi.    At least five other members of the ANC contingent,  canvassing  political support in the northern Natal town -- where the IFP  has its headquarters -- are still missing.    ANC lawyer John Wills told SAPA that six ANC members and  four  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] monitors were in the  police cells "in protective custody", awaiting the arrival of  armoured-plated vehicles to transport them out of the area.    He said at least 200 IFP supporters were gathered outside  the  police station. "The ANC and IEC members have been holed up in  the station for the past four or five hours. The situation is  really tense, but the crowd outside is dispersing now," he said  from the Ulundi police station at about 7.10PM on Saturday.    Chief Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State election  roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi on hearing of the  news of the fighting in Ulundi.    He arrived at the police station shortly before 7PM to  resolve the stand-off.    Clashes erupted in the KwaZulu capital on Saturday afternoon  after an ANC convoy entered the town to distribute election  literature and canvass political support.    The IFP claimed the ANC members attacked its supporters  after  they refused to accept ANC pamphlets, but this was strongly  denied by the ANC in Johannesburg.</p>

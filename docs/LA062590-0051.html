			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: THE ELDERLY  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY SEARCH: The Social Security Administration is looking for  hundreds of thousands of older people with very low incomes who are eligible  for federal cash payments but don't know it.  </P> <P> The government plans to spend $3 million on demonstration projects around the  country to educate people about Supplemental Security Income, a program for  poor Americans over 65, and blind or disabled persons of all ages with scarce  funds. Eligible persons generally have incomes below $406 a month, or $718 a  month in California, which provides an extra benefit to supplement the federal  payment.  </P> <P> "I firmly believe that the Social Security Administration has a moral  responsibility to identify those who are not receiving SSI benefits they are  entitled to," said Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King.  </P> <P> The maximum benefit for a person with no other income is $386 a month for an  individual, or $579 for a couple.  </P> <P> EQUAL BENEFITS FOR ALL: Advocates for older Americans are hopeful Congress will  pass legislation requiring business to give older workers the same fringe  benefits -- health and life insurance, vacation pay, sick leave -- enjoyed by  younger employees. The Supreme Court ruled last year that companies could  discriminate in employee benefits on the basis of age.  </P> <P> "We fear that employers will offer older people jobs without benefits," said  Michele Pollak, legislative representative for the American Assn. of Retired  Persons. Committees in both houses of Congress have passed legislation that  would override the Supreme Court's ruling, and the prospects on floor action  look favorable, Pollak said. The proposed legislation says employers must spend  as much money on benefits for older workers as for younger persons.  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S AID: Alzheimer's disease costs billions of dollars in nursing home  care for its victims, but the federal budget for research into the cause of the  deadly disease is a modest $150 million. Four out of five research projects  reviewed and approved by the National Institute on Aging don't get funded  because of a lack of federal dollars.  </P> <P> The Alzheimer's Disease Assn., an organization of family members of victims,  has enlisted strong congressional backing for its drive to boost the budget.  "We're fighting for a substantial increase to $300 million," said Judy Riggs,  director of federal issues.  </P> <P> The inexorable mental deterioration of victims, who may remain physically  healthy for years, imposes a terrible emotional and financial burden on  families. Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Aging  Committee, is promoting legislation to provide money to states to establish  local respite care programs for families. The bill would pay for hiring someone  to come into the home and give the care-givers time off from the grueling chore  of living with an Alzheimer's victim.  </P> <P> MEDI-GAP MADE EASY: The Senate Aging Committee has issued a guide to buying  Medi-gap insurance, the private policies that supplement Medicare benefits.  </P> <P> The guide also contains advice on health maintenance organizations, the  Medicaid program for the poor and veterans benefits. Copies are available from  the Senate Aging Committee, Room G-31 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C.,  20510. ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT  </P></p>

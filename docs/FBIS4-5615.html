			<p>BFN     [Text] A symposium on "U.S. military bases on Okinawa and  the lawsuit against noise caused by U.S. military aircraft"  (under the auspices of the Committee on Creation of Peace on  Okinawa) was held at the Yashioso Hotel in Matsuo, Naha City, on  the afternoon of 9 April, to look at the present state of U.S.  military bases on Okinawa and to discuss ways to resolve  problems arising from them. At the symposium, a lawyer, a  resident, a scholar, and other participants reported on the  damage caused by U.S. military bases from their respective  positions, and nearly 50 participants discussed ways to handle  the lawsuit against noise. The symposium unanimously adopted a  "statement protesting against a series of aircraft crashes on  U.S. military bases."    Speaking at the symposium, Yasuhide Oshiri, secretary  general  of the committee, said: "The special forces of four U.S.  services are stationed on Okinawa and the importance of these  military bases in U.S. global strategy remains unchanged. The  number of facilities used by NBC (nuclear, biological, and  chemical) units has increased from 15 in 1988 to 27." He also  stressed that peace will not return to Okinawa as long as the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is not repealed.    Explaining the ruling on a lawsuit against noise caused by  U.S. military planes on Kadena Air Base, attorney Noho Ikemiyagi  said: "The ruling dashed all the hopes expressed by plaintiffs  for calm sleep. Nonetheless, for the first time, we succeeded  in having the court hand down a judgment that residents are in  an illegal situation and the task before us is how to use the  judgment in the future."    Explaining the residents' position, Tsuguyasu Tokeshi from  Chatan town said emphatically: "Crashes involving U.S. military  aircraft have actually occurred. Residents have always been  concerned about a recurrence of those crashes." He also  stressed the only way of keeping U.S. military airplanes from  causing noise is to remove U.S. military bases from Okinawa.    Reporting on the health problems of residents at the  symposium, Kazuhiko Taira, a professor at Ryukyu University,  said: "The aircraft-caused noise has become a cause of stress.  It has caused hearing problems and adversely affects hormone  secretion and the nervous system. It has also caused major  problems in the educational climate, making it difficult for  children to concentrate."    During a question-and-answer session, a participant said:  "The judge who wrote the ruling in the lawsuit against  noise--before quitting his office--stated: A group of lawyers  from Osaka city was in charge of defending the case and they  might have been unable to present solid evidence to back up  their claims because they did not have a full understanding of  circumstances surrounding the noise case. I had no choice but to  write the ruling that way. I could not understand why all the  lawyers came from Osaka city and why Okinawans from all walks of  life were not rallied."</p>

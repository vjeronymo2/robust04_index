			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Richards sharply lower at Pounds 61,000 Richards, with interests in woven pile carpets, wool weaving and cotton spinning, experienced a fall in profits from Pounds 433,000 to Pounds 61,000 pre-tax for the half year to end-March. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 37m (Pounds 37.95m) but exceptional provisions accounted for Pounds 40,000 more at Pounds 250,000. Earnings declined to 0.45p (1.13p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.07p. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.5m (nil) represented the anticipated costs of the withdrawal from the Irish linen manufacturing operations.</p>

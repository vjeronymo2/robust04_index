			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Malawi aid tied to rights progress WESTERN aid donors yesterday told Malawi that it will get more development money from them only if it improves its human rights record. The troubled southern African state came away from a World Bank-sponsored meeting with nothing towards the Dollars 74m (Pounds 42m) of development assistance it needs this year and next. They were ready to meet again within six months if Malawi could show 'substantive progress' in basic freedoms and human rights, said the donors' communique. Donors pledged Dollars 170m of food aid for victims of the drought which has hit Malawi and its neighbours. This was Dollars 100m less than needed, but officials stressed the shortfall on humanitarian, as opposed to development, aid had nothing to do with human rights and that drought assistance would be handed out as required through a plan for the whole region. Malawi has worried donors because of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda's continued intolerance of any opposition, and the recent outbreak of industrial unrest and looting in which 38 people were reported killed. Unrest has spread this week to tea plantations. Tea is Malawi's largest export after tobacco. Mr Louis Chimango, Malawi's finance minister, said in Paris the government would allow the Red Cross to inspect prisons, and give a court trial to Mr Chakufwa Chihana, a trade unionist arrested last month after calling for multi-party elections. Beyond that, Mr Chimango refused to give further details of how Malawi planned to satisfy donors and said he had no idea how to fund the aid shortfall. Three international labour leaders were allowed to visit Mr Chihana yesterday.</p>

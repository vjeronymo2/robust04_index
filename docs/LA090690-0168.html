			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S PANEL POSES OPTIONS FOR LATC;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE STUDY GROUP OUTLINES THREE PLANS, INCLUDING ONE TO CONVERT THE  FACILITY INTO A CITY-OWNED COMPLEX WITH DIFFERENT PRODUCTION COMPANIES. IN THE  MEANTIME, THE CRA URGES ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> The staff of the city Community Redevelopment Agency has recommended an  additional $998,390 subsidy to the Los Angeles Theatre Center -- while a  commission studying the facility has produced three draft recommendations,  including a plan to convert it into a city-owned stage complex with the  existing LATC company just one of several producers.  </P> <P> The CRA will deliver a staff report to its board today calling for the  additional grant, which would continue city payments to defer debt service and  building maintenance costs, without which LATC managers have said they might  not be able to complete the 1991 season.  </P> <P> The draft recommendation to restructure the LATC, from the Mayor's LATC Study  Group, is one of three options presented in a closely held report placed in  limited circulation late last week. The document also proposed two other draft  options: outright closure of the four-stage LATC pending extensive  re-evaluation of how to make use of it, and, at the opposite extreme,  preservation of the status quo.  </P> <P> The new grant, which would require City Council approval, is in addition to  $750,000 in subsidy money approved in July. The nearly $1.75 million in the two  grants would bring total city financial commitments to the LATC to $20.4  million since the redevelopment agency proposed luring a theater complex to  Spring Street in 1978 and 1979 as a means of revitalizing the historic core of  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The report now under review is the first of three drafts expected to emerge  from the study group. A second and more detailed draft is expected to be  finished early next week, with the final version scheduled for completion as  early as Sept. 20.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the study group emphasized that the three options in the  initial draft report do not necessarily indicate the precise recommendations  the study group may make. These sources, speaking on the condition of  anonymity, characterized the options as among a larger and more varied number  of possible solutions the study group has discussed.  </P> <P> Details of the draft report were obtained by The Times and confirmed  independently by three sources familiar with the document. The study group was  appointed earlier this year by Mayor Tom Bradley. It is headed by William  Wingate, a New York City consultant who previously served as executive managing  director of the Center Theatre Group.  </P> <P> Ongoing financial difficulties at the LATC stem from overly optimistic  projections of the theater center's ability to sustain itself financially and  to absorb costs of buying the converted former bank building that serves as its  lobby, building the connected four-theater structure itself and defraying  ongoing capital expenses.  </P> <P> The theater center has never been able to break even and initial projections of  the quick end to city subsidies have given way to ongoing needs for continued  support. Earlier this year, the LATC submitted a proposed five-year plan  calling for infusion of $32 million more in redevelopment agency or other city  money -- including complete forgiveness of outstanding capital loans and  interest and establishment of a $15-million endowment.  </P> <P> The three possible LATC alternatives are presented in an initial draft of the  study group report, which was was placed in limited circulation among study  group members and a few other theater officials and civic leaders late last  week.  </P> <P> City Councilman Mike Woo, a supporter of the LATC, said the financial problems  the city and the theater center have been struggling to change may mean that  the option of retaining the status quo is simply not possible. "The status quo  would mean that the city would have to make a substantial ongoing financial  commitment to keeping the current structure in place," said Woo. "I don't know  that we can afford to do that and I don't know that there is the political will  in council to do that."  </P> <P> Woo said a combination of the status quo and conversion to a multi-producer  complex may emerge as the solution. Other local theater experts suggested that,  under such an arrangement, the existing LATC organization might emerge as a  first-among-equals, responsible for the bulk of the complex's programming, but  with outside producers of original productions or presenters of touring plays  filling in the schedule for perhaps a third of the year.  </P> <P> Reorganizing the LATC as a multi-tenant center would adapt, with certain  modifications, the basic design of the county-owned Music Center complex.  There, six tenant organizations -- technically called "resident companies" --  share space and facilities and are responsible for their own operating costs,  with maintenance and capital improvement expenses paid for by Los Angeles  County. The tenants range from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to the Center  Theatre Group.  </P> <P> The county, in turn, recoups some of its expenses from parking revenues. The  county cannot hope to earn a profit on the Music Center, but most experts agree  the value of a government-owned downtown cultural center in Los Angeles  justifies the financial downside.  </P> <P> Under this system, said a Music Center spokeswoman, the county pays for  everything from routine janitorial services to replacement of worn carpeting in  the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion lobby and worn-out ventilation machinery. The  arrangement recognizes a reality widely perceived in the creative community --  that both mainstream-establishment and experimental-innovative theater and  music have extreme difficulty in sustaining themselves in terms of production  and operating costs, as well as providing for real estate-related costs like  debt-service and repairs.  </P> <P> The Music Center operating design is widely perceived as one of the better  models across the country -- superior, for instance, to Lincoln Center in New  York and the Kennedy Center in Washington, which is currently mired in a  financial crisis of its own largely caused by a crisis in building maintenance  and other capital costs.  </P> <P> Establishing the LATC as a city-owned facility where stage producers would not  be financially responsible for building upkeep has long been the preferred  option to the management of the existing LATC, led by artistic director Bill  Bushnell, producing director Diane White and managing director Robert Lear. The  LATC, however, has not advocated conversion of the center to a multi-company  facility.  </P> <P> At the redevelopment agency, commissioners are scheduled to review a report  today from John J. Tuite, the agency's administrator, that concludes the new  infusion of city money is essential to permit orderly review and implementation  of recommendations by the Wingate commission. For the study group's report to  be properly reviewed and decisions based on it to be reached, Tuite concluded,  the LATC must receive subsidy money to carry it through June, 1991.  </P> <P> "Because it is anticipated the study groups findings will require extensive  review and consideration," Tuite wrote in the report to be received by the  redevelopment agency board today, "the recommended funding is necessary in  order to enable the LATC to complete the fall-winter season."  </P></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Taipei near to Dollars 11bn fighter deal TAIPEI's plans to buy 210 advanced fighters from the US and France came a step closer yesterday when a joint legislative committee approved NTDollars 318.7bn (Dollars 11.4bn) in funds for the purchases, reports Dennis Engbarth from Taipei. Formal approval by parliament to purchase 150 F-16 Falcons from the US and 60 Mirage 2000 fighters from Franceis expected later this week, even though the lack of clear provisions for technology transfers to Taiwan will attract widespread criticism from lawmakers in both the ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive party. Mr Sun Chen, minister of national defence, said the 210 advanced aircraft would join 130 IDF (indigenous developed fighters) now in production and 90 remaining F-5E fighters in the island's revamped air defence force. The 430 jet fighters are expected to meet all Taiwan's air defence needs until the year 2000 without more purchases from foreign suppliers, Mr Sun said.</p>

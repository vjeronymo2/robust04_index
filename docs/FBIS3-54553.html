The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and  was expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the  former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,  Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.    On the sidelines of the two-day meeting, organised to  discuss  economic cooperation, the ministers of 10 Muslim countries in  the region put forward several "practical proposals" to help end  the conflict, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said.    Speaking to reporters, Velayati acknowledged the difficult  task of restoring peace to Afghanistan, but added that Iran and  other countries in the region "were determined to continue their  search." He declined to explain what the "practical proposals"  were.    Several participants in the meeting revealed that "a certain  number of ideas" have been put foreward by the ministers, among  which is establishment of a regional conference under the  auspices of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC),  which comprises 50 Muslim countries.    The OIC's Secretary General Hamid al-Qabid, who took part in  the seminar, said an OIC delegation was currently in the Afghan  capital to try and secure a ceasefire.    He said that he would himself go to Kabul if asked to start  mediation among rival Afghan forces.    Qabid told AFP that the accord reached between the factions  in Islamabad last spring, at the prodding of Pakistan and Saudi  Arabia, was no longer effective but could be used as "a basis  for future discussions".    Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala told AFP that he  favored a comprehensive solution searched for by the United  Nations or OIC rather than mediation efforts undertaken by  Afghanistan's neighbors, whose "objectives are not clear so far."    "After all, finding a solution is primarily the  responsibility of Afghans themselves," he said.    The ministers also addressed other regional crises, namely  the civil war in Tajikistan between the pro-communist government  and the Islamic opposition, as well as the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    Azerbaijan did not appear to have gathered the solid support  it expected in a bid to impose widespread economic sanctions  against Armenia, according to participants.    The Tajik minister, for his part, categotically rejected  mediation offers by several ECO members, saying his country  prefered wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations.    On the economic front, the countries agreed to cooperate on  setting up a regional trade and development bank, establishing  insurance links and creating a joint airline and shipping  company.    Cooperation in transportation and communication were also  given priority during the conference, as many of the ECO member  states are land-locked and need access to the sea and outside  world, Velayati said.    The ministers also discussed cooperation between the ECO and  several international organisations. Memorandums of  understanding were signed Tuesday between the ECO and the United  Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as United Nations  Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anita Kratz report: "Center Party Said a Clear `Yes' to </F> the EU"]    [Text] After figures of 184 yes votes and 92 no votes to  the European Union [EU] a relieved Center Party leader Olof  Johansson was able to acknowledge the standing ovations from the  delegates at the Center Party's extraordinary congress.    "Let me say immediately that this vote has no winners and no  losers either," Olof Johansson said after the vote in the hall  of Aso High School in Stockholm.    He invited representatives of the no side to consultations  in  the framework of the party's executive committee to discuss how  the work of the referendum campaign is to be tackled. All to  try to keep disappointed opponents of the EU from losing heart  and to keep them feeling like real Center Party people.    Olof Johansson is aware of the no camp's dilemma. Despite  everything, they have to mobilize themselves for an election  campaign where the EU will be one of the central issues. And  right up to 13 November they will have to put forward arguments  explaining why they do not believe in the EU without having the  party leadership's backing for their views.    With tears in his eyes in an emotional closing speech  immediately before the vote, Olof Johansson stressed that  membership of the EU is not a goal in itself for the Center  Party, but merely the means to an end -- a means that Olof  Johansson considers to be effective, even though it took him 30  years to reach this view.    "We hold fundamental values in common and they remain."    The unexpected result of the congress with such an  overwhelming majority for a yes must been seen as strong support  for the party's chairman and his way of handling the EU  question. Olof Johansson has received a lot of criticism from  inside and outside his party because he as party leader did not  make any pronouncement on EU membership until the final phase of  the debate.    But there has also been the opposite criticism from many  Center Party members. They would have preferred to see that  neither the party congress nor the party leader had to make up  their minds about the EU, in order to avoid a split in the party.    "I have the support behind me now for the party's position,"  Olof Johansson said at a news conference after the congress.    In the referendum campaign the Center Party leader intends  to  be cautious with his slogans.    "I do not want to produce propaganda, but instruction. I  will try to be honest with regard to my analysis and convictions  even if this might sometimes help my opponents."    The party executive also received the congress's backing to  work on the answers to the nine questions Olof Johansson put in  his opening address to the congress on Saturday [7 May]. For  example, he said that the EU's convergence criteria should not  be an obstacle to social welfare, and also spoke of trying to  create blocking minorities in the environmental field in the EU.    "We have retained the right to make the decisions relating  to  our nonalignment. This could be an issue that would need a  referendum," Olof Johansson said.    At the news conference the Center Party leader was unwilling  to go into excessively hypothetical arguments, as he put it.  But a new referendum on the EU does not seem completely out of  the question for Olof Johansson, if Sweden is a member and the  EU is about to enter into even more intimate political  cooperation.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Straw welcomes extensive local gains Labour holds the largest number of council seats in England for the first time ever, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday. Mr Straw said a dossier compiled by Labour showed that the Conservatives had lost 541 council seats in England since February last year, when Mr John Major, the prime minister, called for a 'renaissance' in local government to bring back Conservative values. The dossier shows that the Tory losses have occurred in every region of England and in every tier of local government. Mr Straw said Labour held 7,543 council seats, compared with 7,408 for the Conservatives. He added that local councils had lost power to an increasing number of quangos. The dossier shows that Labour controls 56 of the 124 major spending authorities in England, and is the largest party in two-thirds of authorities. Labour controls the three main local government associations, including the district and county council organisations, which have traditionally had Conservative majorities. The dossier sets the stage for the local elections in May, in which the Conservatives are widely expected to lose further seats. It demonstrates that Labour's effective grip on local government will make it difficult for the party to make sweeping gains. The dossier accuses the government of creating a powerful array of quangos which form 'an unelected, unaccountable state which is now almost as large as elected government'. It says that quangos control Pounds 24bn of annual public spending which was formerly controlled or influenced by local government. Much of the transfer had been in education, transport, urban development, health and training.</p>

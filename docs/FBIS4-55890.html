			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Excerpts] A new copyright law comes into force in Poland  today. Illegal producers of cassettes, records, or computer  programs can now be fined or even receive prison sentences.  Just last year, out of a total of 65 million records and  cassettes sold on the market, as many as 90 percent were pirate  recordings. [passage omitted]    Illegally produced cassettes of Polish music cost 20,000 to  30,000 zloty. Cassettes with foreign music cost 60,000 zloty.  Beginning today, all records and cassettes will have to bear  special holograms, and they will cost two to three times more  than before. [passage omitted]    World record producers made over 30 billion dollars in  profits last year. In Poland, such profits amounted only to 66  million [currency not specified]. The reason for such small  profits was the activity of illegal producers. Record company  profits were reduced even further by the existence of compact  disc libraries, as records borrowed from the library could be  rerecorded on cassettes. [passage omitted]    The authors of literary or musical works, or their  inheritors, will obtain royalties for 50 years, as opposed to  the 25 years envisaged by the law until now. Offenders who  break the copyright law--for example, by illegally producing and  copying books, records, cassettes, or computer programs--may be  punished with high fines or even sentenced to prison for up to  five years.</p>

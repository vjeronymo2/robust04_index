"He makes $1  million, and some of the guys covering make $65,000. He's a great quarterback."  </P> <P> Majkowski also was the Packers' leading rusher with 88 yards in eight carries.  </P> <P> "I needed to come through to get some confidence back in the team and in  myself," said Majkowski, who has averaged nearly 400 yards total offense in the  five games he's started against Detroit. "I think now we'll really start to  come together."  </P> <P> Majkowski connected with Ed West on a three-yard touchdown pass play, with  Michael Haddix on a four-yarder and with Jeff Query from 26 yards out with 55  seconds left.  </P> <P> "The final drive really reminded me of last year," said Majkowski, who helped  Green Bay win seven games by four points or less as the Packers compiled a 10-6  record in 1989. "We were relaxed and confident because we had been there before  in that situation."  </P> <P> While Majkowski was enjoying one of his better days, Detroit kicker Eddie  Murray turned in one of his worst, missing four field-goal attempts --  including a 44-yarder with three seconds left that would have tied the score.  </P> <P> "There is no excuse for the misses," Murray said. "I let a lot of people down,  and it's tough to swallow right now, but I'll be back.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, this will be the worst day I ever have."  </P> <P> Rodney Peete completed 17 of 34 for 200 yards and one touchdown for Detroit  (1-3). He also scored one on a seven-yard run.  </P> <P> The Lions had a 21-10 lead when Majkowski found his touch late in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> First, Majkowski capped a 61-yard drive with the touchdown pass to Haddix with  11:01 left that brought the Packers to within 21-17.  </P> <P> After Murray missed field-goal attempts from 50 and 51 yards, Majkowski drove  the Packers 66 yards in nine plays, hitting Query for the go-ahead score.  </P> <P> Detroit then drove to the 26, where Murray was wide-left on his 44-yard attempt  with three seconds left.  </P></p>

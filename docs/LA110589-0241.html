			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY ROOM, KITCHEN RATE HIGH IN CONSUMER SURVEY  </P> <P> A total of 45% of home buyers said they want kitchens and family rooms that are  open to each other, but with a divider, such as a counter, according to a  January, 1989, consumer preference survey conducted by the National Assn. of  Home Builders and Better Homes and Gardens.  </P> <P> Seven out of 10 home buyers said that even with a den, a family room or great  room is a must, and 64% said the basic price of a house must include a family  room.  </P> <P> The survey concluded that an open kitchen-family room will make a home sell  better.  </P> <P> In another survey, Better Homes and Gardens Consumer Panel respondents said  that if they were building their own home, the most important room would be the  kitchen, followed by the family room.  </P> <P> It's not just the newer houses that are featuring family rooms. Many home  improvements in the $102-billion industry focus on remodeling or adding a  family room. The Better Homes and Gardens Home Improvement Contest showed that  9,160 homeowners who entered the 1988 contest spent $172.2 million on  remodeling projects, a 28% increase over the amount spent by those who entered  the 1986 contest.  </P> <P> The entries showed that family togetherness often prompted remodelings. Parents  who wanted to spend more time with their youngsters inspired open  kitchen/family room arrangements.  </P> <P> Family rooms were one of the most common additions. Desired features in this  room included vaulted or cathedral ceiling with ceiling fan, skylights,  fireplace, hardwood floors and lots of glazing, often with elaborate  circle-topped windows. Bookcases and built-in cabinetry for sophisticated  stereo and television video systems were also popular.  </P></p>

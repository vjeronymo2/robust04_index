			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Canadian cinema group optimistic CINEPLEX ODEON, the Canadian cinema and film distribution group controlled by the Montreal Bronfman family, expects to return to profit in the third quarter of this year, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The group made a first-quarter loss of USDollars 10.8m on revenues of Dollars 116m, against a loss of Dollars 13.9m on revenues of Dollars 129m a year earlier. Debt had been reduced from Dollars 700m to Dollars 385m, cash-flow was positive and operating expense was under control, Mr Allen Karp, president, told the AGM. In 1992 Cineplex lost Dollars 41.3m on revenues of Dollars 518m. Although Cineplex has been heavily restructured, and theatres in several marginal US markets have been sold, it is still one of North America's largest cinema operators. The group has 1,614 screens in 363 locations.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots Tories in office shake-up THE SCOTTISH Conservative party dismissed six staff at its central office on Monday, including one of the architects of the party's general election campaign in Scotland. Ms Alice Luce, who ran the Tory media campaign north of the border and had been employed by the party for four years, said yesterday: 'I feel extremely let down. It makes the party's commitment to employing women in high places sound very hollow.' The Scottish Conservative Party last night described the shake-up as part of a post-election process of taking stock and a 'slimming down'.</p>

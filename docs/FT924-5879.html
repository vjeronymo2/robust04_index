			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading AN EARLY squeeze in stock index futures sent the December contract to its highest level to date, in a session marked for a lack of other features and poor turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,747, the December contract on the FT-SE was squeezed higher by independent traders (locals) and reached 2,769 which not only proved to be the day's peak but also the highest level reached by the current contract, within the first hour of trading. This early momentum helped pull the underlying cash market higher and briefly through its all time high. But with trade rather thin as the large institutions remained on the sidelines, December lost some of the early momentum and traded in a narrow range of 2,745 and 2,760 for the middle part of the session. The late morning release of balance of payment figures had no significant impact on trading. However, it was the early weakness on Wall Street that caused a change in sentiment sending the contract into retreat. December closed at 2,723, the day's low point, and around 5 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. turnover was a poor 5,470. Traded options were dull with total volume reaching 22,176 lots of which 9,233 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Actress Kathleen Turner may be evicted from her New York cooperative apartment  house, if the building's board members have their way. Turner allegedly sublet  her apartjment to her sister-in-law without the board's permission, according  to court papers. A hearing on the conflict, scheduled for Thursday in  Manhattan's state Supreme Court, was re-scheduled for June 29. Turner now lives  with her husband, Jay Weiss, in a Greenwich Village townhouse. After a year of  being unable to find a buyer for the 10th-floor apartment at 148 W. 23rd St.,  they decided to sublet it and asked the board's permission to do so. Turner  said in court papers that she got no reply, so a year later she renewed her  request, specifying her sister-in-law Laurie Weiss Howell and her husband as  subtenants. On May 1, the Howells moved into Turner's apartment. On May 2, the  board notified Turner she had violated co-op rules and threatened to terminate  her apartment lease. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

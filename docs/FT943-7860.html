			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pioneer sees signs of profits recovery Pioneer, the Japanese maker of audio and video products, believes it is on the way to recovery after a series of operating losses blamed on the strong yen, domestic recession and price-cutting by competitors. Foreign exchange gains and royalty income, together worth nearly Y2.7bn (Dollars 27.2m), enabled Pioneer to report a marginal group net profit of Y257m for the first quarter ended June, down steeply from the previous Y6.86bn. Last year's quarterly figure was larger than the Y6.57bn achieved for the whole of the year, as the profits decline deepened through 1993. Pioneer is curtailing capital spending by a further 2.5 per cent, to Y28.3bn, this year. However, it is boosting research and development outlays by a modest Y200m to reach Y29.9bn, as its seeks new products to stimulate consumer demand. The group warned of 'stiff and unrelenting competition in our major markets', and said the direction of the Japanese economy and the yen were uncertain. However, it is forecasting Y8bn in consolidated net profits for the year. First-quarter sales fell 6.6 per cent to Y116.3bn, with domestic and overseas demand both down. Video products were up 4.9 per cent, but car electronics, its biggest sector, showed a 9.5 per cent decline. Sales of audio-visual software such as compact discs dived 35.1 per cent in the absence of hit records. The sector, which the company separated out yesterday for the first time, contributed Y8.85bn, less than one-tenth of all revenues. The decline in profits was made more acute by the inclusion last time of a Y4.88bn extraordinary credit reflecting a change in tax accounting. Stripped of that, quarterly net earnings per share a year ago were Y11.02 compared with Y1.43 in the latest three months.</p>

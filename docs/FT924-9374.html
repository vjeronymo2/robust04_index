			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Amnesty offered to Lloyd's Names LLOYD'S of London made a sharp turn in policy yesterday by offering a six-month amnesty to Names who have refused to make good their debts to the insurance market. The move contradicts Lloyd's determination until now to pursue with legal action any outstanding debts from Names, the individuals whose assets underwrite the market. It follows assessments showing that less than Pounds 10m will be foregone as a result of the amnesty, and comes after an intensive series of meetings with politicians and distressed Names over the difficulties of repayment. It also appears to mark a change in approach following the appointment in September of Mr Peter Middleton as chief executive of Lloyd's. Mr Middleton said the decision had been taken because 'the sums involved are so small and the action will be of such huge benefit'. But Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, called the action 'a very cynical operation' which would sever funding to legal action being taken by Names already served with writs. The outcome of their cases will apply to all Names. Lloyd's will also allow Names' action groups to have access to full lists of members of syndicates for the first time so they can contact each other. Mr Paul Marland, Conservative MP for West Gloucestershire and a Lloyd's Name, said he was 'very, very pleased' by the announcement. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said action groups may call off legal action against Lloyd's: 'If these proposals turn into concrete ones then we will obviously tone down and stop our actions.' At least two Names - one in Wales and one in Canada - have committed suicide in the past few weeks after apparently being unable to cope with cash calls  -requests by their agents to cover underwriting losses. Yesterday's decision could potentially help hundreds of Names who have been unable or have refused to meet cash calls for the 1990 and 1991 underwriting years, but it will do nothing for the 194 Names who have already been issued with writs. When Names refuse to pay cash calls, Lloyd's issues a letter establishing that they have a legal debt. After 28 days, it follows this with a writ. Some 3,500 letters were sent out in October. It will now issue no further writs until April.</p>

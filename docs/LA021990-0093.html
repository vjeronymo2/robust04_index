			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COASTAL ECOSYSTEM HAS NO ROOM FOR ERROR;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: ANY APPRECIABLE OIL SPILL POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE FRAGILE  AND DWINDLING WILDLIFE RESOURCES HERE, THE EXPERTS SAY.  </P> <P> Almost every morning since the tanker American Trader poured 394,000 gallons of  crude petroleum into the sea, Kennon Cory has gone to the Bolsa Chica wetlands  to sit among the thickets of pickle weed and look for oil-soaked birds.  </P> <P> Since he was a child, Cory has been drawn to the quiet of this marshy expanse  where scores of rare and migratory waterfowl have found sanctuary in an urban  landscape. Protected pockets of nature like Bolsa Chica and Upper Newport Bay  shaped Cory's interests -- and future.  </P> <P> Now a graduate student studying ornithology, Cory hurried back to Bolsa Chica  after the Feb. 7 spill to patrol with binoculars the mud flats and tiny nesting  islands for incoming grebes, Forster's terns and willets coated with blackish  goo from the offshore slick.  </P> <P> "It is very sad that these areas, already under such stress, face this kind of  threat," said the Cal State Long Beach student.  </P> <P> Luckily, the wetlands at Bolsa Chica -- like those near Seal Beach, the Santa  Ana River mouth and Upper Newport Bay -- have not been seriously damaged by the  Alaskan crude that blackened miles of shoreline. The timing of the spill,  Mother Nature and cleanup efforts have combined to minimize the damage  inflicted on the wetlands, tide pools and marine life.  </P> <P> But any appreciable oil is a serious threat to Orange County's fragile and  dwindling wildlife resources. And many naturalists, biologists, bird watchers  and fishermen bristle at suggestions that the environmental threat in Orange  County has been exaggerated, that it pales by comparison to the  11.2-million-gallon Alaskan oil spill of a year ago.  </P> <P> Wildlife refuges in the county are measured in acres, not miles. And various  bird species and marine mammals that live here number in the hundreds, not  thousands.  </P> <P> What natural and protected areas do exist on the county's coast are critical,  experts say, because much of the shoreline has been developed or dedicated to  high-intensity recreation.  </P> <P> "It makes me so mad when they compare this to Alaska," said Marielle Leeds, an  environmental activist from Laguna Beach. "A few hundred birds here is like  thousands of birds up there because that's all we've got. . . . We're getting  attacked from all sides -- sewage, oil, malathion spraying and development."  </P> <P> It is too early to assess the long-term consequences of the spill, biologists  say. And perhaps, when all is said and done, the spill may prove to be only a  short-term setback for the birds and marine mammals that frequent local  estuaries and coastal waters. But some observers contend that the noxious oil  came close to destroying what precious little contact Orange County has with a  rich natural world of organisms and wildlife that inhabit local wetlands, tide  pools and kelp beds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Years to Dissipate  </P> <P> Jacqueline Michel, a science adviser to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, said it takes one to three years for the effects of an oil  spill to disappear.  </P> <P> As a result, humans as well as birds and marine animals will have to contend  with oil on the shoreline.  </P> <P> For example, oil that washed ashore has seeped as deep as three feet into the  sand in some areas, according to cleanup officials. As the hot sun heats the  sand, the oil will percolate to the surface as tiny pools of fresh tar, meaning  thousands of beach-goers who flock each summer to Newport Beach and Huntington  Beach may have to watch their step on the sand.  </P> <P> "As soon as people start lying on the beach, they're going to find out, because  their skin will burn," said businessman Jerry Rusher, who specializes in oil  cleanup products.  </P> <P> Swimmers and surfers may have to contend with swirling pools of foamy oil sheen  for weeks, although much of the brownish muck should be gone by summer. City  officials in Newport are worried about beach erosion because so much of the  oil-soaked sand is being hauled away.  </P> <P> Environmentalists are also concerned about what lives under the sand now laced  with North Slope crude.  </P> <P> "There is a whole world of organisms that live in the intertidal zone that are  going to be affected as oil washes up on the beach," said Dorothy Green of Heal  the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental group. "Just think of where the  shore birds usually are, following the waves in and out and poking at the  beach. Those birds are feeding on those organisms."  </P> <P> The primary concern, however, remains the wetlands.  </P> <P> "Ninety percent of the wetlands that were here (historically) are gone, and  they're gone forever," said Pat Baird, an ornithologist at Cal State Long  Beach. "If you keep chipping away at habitats, with pollutions, with oil spills  . . . there's just so much these birds can take."  </P> <P> Said Gordon Smith, chairman of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy:  "Biologists consider the wetlands to be the most productive ecosystems on  earth. . . . Coastal property is so valuable, conservationists are fighting to  preserve every square foot. Any damage is critical."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breeding Concerns  </P> <P> In the initial hours of the spill, state fish and game officials focused on  stopping the slick from reaching entrances to wetland areas. Dozens of  migrating waterfowl inhabit the estuaries, including the endangered California  least tern, a gull-like bird that nests on the sandy islands.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the spill did not occur during the spring, the height of the  breeding season for the least tern and most other birds. Studies show that  birds ingesting even a small amount of oil may suffer reproductive problems.  Because most sea birds produce only a small number of chicks -- only one per  season for some species -- any impact on the breeding rate could have long-term  consequences. It could prove disastrous for an endangered species like the  least tern.  </P> <P> Thousands of feet of protective boom eventually safeguarded Anaheim Bay, which  leads to the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge and the Bolsa Chica Ecological  Reserve. Newport Harbor also was closed with a series of booms -- floats with  mesh skirts attached -- to keep tainted seawater from filtering into Upper  Newport Bay.  </P> <P> At the Santa Ana River mouth, surging tides breached several booms at one  stage, prompting officials to erect earthen dikes to stave off the frothy goo  that lapped within a few hundred feet of the newly restored Huntington Beach  wetlands -- a success story in the long, sad decay and disappearance of  saltwater marshes.  </P> <P> For years, the 25-acre plot was neglected, but last year enough money had been  raised to reclaim the wetlands. Thus, when the spill's leading edge threatened  the area, wildlife biologists, county officials and members of a private  conservancy banded together to build berms and dikes.  </P> <P> "We have worked too long to get this far, and we're determined not to lose  this," said Smith, who spent several sleepless nights monitoring the oil  slick's movement in the river mouth near the wetlands. "We want this to be a  place where the sound of birds can be heard again, where people can appreciate  what was once a common sight on our coast."  </P> <P> Efforts to defend the landlocked estuaries generally succeeded as the bulk of  oil from the American Trader washed up on the broad sandy beaches of Huntington  and Newport. In fact, cleanup officials and some environmentalists cheered the  arrival of the lava-like crude on the beaches, contending that it is easier to  capture on the flat sand than at sea, or worse yet, to the south in the craggy  rocks and coves of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tide Pool Peril  </P> <P> Late last week, a thin brown residue from the dissipating slick worked its way  into the rocky tide pools that dot Crystal Cove State Park south of Corona del  Mar. Teeming with sea stars, urchins, anemones and crabs, the tide pools are a  magnet for wide-eyed schoolchildren.  </P> <P> "It's one of the richest environments to observe, and it's one that holds an  inherent interest for children," said Harry Helling, director of education at  the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point. "All the animals have such  strange adaptations that it's a wonderful lesson in life forms."  </P> <P> In the shallow waters just offshore from Crystal Cove, scores of skin divers  often probe the fish-filled kelp forests which are part of a 1,000-acre  undersea reserve.  </P> <P> "At times, diving off Crystal Cove is like diving into an aquarium," said Frank  Wilton, a La Habra electrician who has dived off the Laguna coast for nearly  two decades. "The giant kelp lures in all kinds of fish and creatures. The  bottom has abalone, crabs and occasionally a lobster or two."  </P> <P> The ocean and tide pools were posted off-limits over the weekend as dozens of  cleanup workers in yellow slickers battled wind and rain to remove the filmy  sheen from the rocks.  </P> <P> Scouring oil from rocky coastline, such as that in Alaska's Prince William  Sound, is far more difficult than extracting oil from the kinds of sandy  beaches that have so far been blackened in Orange County. Fortunately, the oil  washing up near Corona del Mar and as far south as Emerald Bay in north Laguna  was not the thick ugly crude that was six inches deep along stretches of  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> However, Helling expressed concern about the long-term effect of the spill on  intertidal areas like Crystal Cove. Tide pools in Orange County -- already  impacted by human trampling and pollution -- support as little as half to  two-thirds the number of species as those in the more remote Channel Islands  near Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "Our tide pools, even here in Dana Point, are not in full, pristine condition  to begin with. If you start looking at the full impact of an oil spill in the  intertidal (zone), nobody knows the long-term picture," biologist Helling said.  "I would say that the subtle impacts of this could go on for months afterward,  at least."  </P> <P> To assess the oil's impact at Crystal Cove, state officials said, monthly or  bimonthly surveys of marine and plant life will begin immediately.  </P> <P> The kelp -- a hearty, fast-growing sea plant -- is not expected to be adversely  impacted. Visible from Corona del Mar south to Dana Point, the large, thick  beds of brown kelp have adapted to increasing levels of ocean pollution, marine  experts said.  </P> <P> The prospects for marine mammals are less certain. Dennis Kelly, a marine  biologist at Orange Coast College, said the bodies of several sea lions have  washed ashore in  </P> <P> recent days, but so far none apparently died as a result of the oil spill.  Kelly is more concerned about the long-term impact on dolphins, often seen off  the Orange County coast.  </P> <P> "I've received reports of at least 10 sightings of dolphins in the slicks,"  said Kelley, who has studied the mammal in local waters for more than a decade  and wants to establish a dolphin research center in Anaheim Bay. He said that  if the dolphins ingest too much oil by feeding on contaminated sea life, their  livers might stop functioning.  </P> <P> "In time we might see a lot of dead dolphins," he said. "We just don't know."  </P> <P> Depending on the level of exposure, clams and mussels may also become  contaminated from the spill, based on studies of shellfish following the Valdez  spill in Alaska.  </P> <P> The most visible victims of the spill have been the birds, which have been  found injured or dead from Long Beach to south Laguna. More than 360 waterfowl  have been treated, and several dozen have been released back into the wild.  However, another 299 have died, including 15 brown pelicans, an endangered  species, and experts say several hundred more birds may never be found.  </P> <P> How will the Orange County spill effect local shore birds in the future?  </P> <P> "We don't know what's going to happen," said Marge Gibson, director of the Bird  of Prey center in Villa Park and a wild bird rehabilitation specialist who  spent several months in Alaska monitoring bald eagles after the Valdez spill.  "It sometimes takes several years (for problems) to show up."  </P> <P> Jack Anderson, director of the Long Beach-based Southern California Coastal  Water Research Project, said the spill should have no lasting impact on the  food chain.  </P> <P> But Pat Baird at Long Beach State is not convinced, saying it's too early to  draw any firm conclusions. "It's just like caffeine. Fifty percent of the  people say that it hurts you, the rest say that it doesn't."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lanie Jones contributed to this story, along with Danica  Kirka and Shannon Sands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threatened: Orange County Coastal Habitats  </P> <P> Wildlife in the aquatic habitats along Orange County's coast, already suffering  from development and other human activities, must now cope with the effects of  the 394,000-gallon oil spill from the ruptured tanker American Trader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wetlands  </P> <P> Orange County's most significant wildlife resources are its coastal estuaries,  rich habitats that support a variety of marsh and shore birds. Wetlands near  Seal Beach, at Bolsa Chica and near the Santa Ana River mouth and in Upper  Newport Bay are important for scores of migrating waterfowl. Much of the spill  containment effort was directed at keeping oil out of these areas. Among the  endangered species mating in local wetlands is the light-footed clapper rail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shoreline  </P> <P> Much of the oil washed upon the sandy beaches of Huntington and Newport, where  it can be mopped up relatively easily and where damage to wildlife was  apparently mininmal. However, there is concern about microscopic bacteria and  protozoa in the sand that provide food for larger invertebrates, which in turn  are eaten by sasnderlings and other shore birds. Grunion came ashore ahead of  schedule last week to lay their eggs and died in the oil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tide Pools  </P> <P> With their rough, rocky surfaces, tide pools are much tougher to clean than  sandy beaches. Also, they support a wider variety of life: about 200 species in  local pools, from octopuses to sea stars. Tide pools are a popular destination  for school field trips. Some of the county's richest, in Crystal Cove State  Park on the Irvine Coast, were fouled by oil from the spill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coastal Waters  </P> <P> Most of the wildlife affected by the oil as it drifted on the open waters in  the first few days after the spill were birds. S ome birds, such as surf  scoters and Western grebes, were vulnerable because they spend much of their  time floating on the surface of the water; others,such as the endangered brown  pelican, were slicked when they dived in after fish. Some of the oil may have  settled to the bottom sediments, where it could affect such bottom-dwelling  fish as halibut. Long-term effects on local marine mammals, meanwhile, are  difficult to predict.  </P></p>

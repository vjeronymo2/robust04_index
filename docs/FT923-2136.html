			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (7): Tribulation on Tyne ON THE south Meadowell estate, amid boarded-up properties and graffiti, stands an occupied house set in a cottage-style garden, with roses climbing on a trellis arch and a pitched-roof bird box, painted white. On the same estate, near a shopping parade which looks like a war zone, Brian and Joyce Grant are sunning themselves beside their manicured front lawn edged with bedding plants. The Grants have brought up two sons on the Meadowell. Aged 21 and 24 and unemployed, the young men spend their days fishing and dog-walking. 'They aren't in trouble: I've been blessed,' says their mother. Last September's riots made the Meadowell estate on the edge of North Shields internationally notorious. Recently, Mrs Grant was travelling on Tyneside's Metro as it approached the estate. 'There was this teacher on the train, with his class, and he said to them: 'You are now entering Apache territory.' I was fuming. I wanted to say, we aren't all like that.' Stigma is just one of the problems facing Meadowell residents. Others include poverty, unemployment, crime and vandalism. To these could be added uncertainty: as the search for a solution to Meadowell's problems enters a new phase, the Grants have been told they are to be decanted, and their carefully tended home demolished as part of a proposed Pounds 30m Estate Action 'remodelling'. Like many such deprived estates, Meadowell is initiative-rich: City Challenge is the latest in a long line of brave new worlds. The difference this time is that residents are being officially placed centre stage, and even challenged to show that their grassroots knowledge can provide more realistic, enduring improvements to their estate than officialdom has achieved. 'Of course, I don't want it to slip back again,' said the inner cities minister, Mr John Redwood, during a recent visit to City Challenge winners in Tyne and Wear. 'But that is in part up to the people who live there and the local community surrounding.' Meadowell residents, who have been painstakingly working on a feasibility project for a 'community village' redevelopment on the site of the community centre burned down in the riots, have to come up with firm proposals by next month. As part of the Pounds 37.5m City Challenge funding awarded to North Tyneside council in July, Pounds 8m has been allocated to the Meadowell. Projects include a child-care training centre and a community village, which would consist of self-build housing, workshops, projects like the 'Bangers and Smash' motor repair scheme, and premises for the estate's successful Credit Union and bulk-buying food co-operative. Among the residents involved, and their many public and private sector partners in City Challenge, there is a strong commitment to working together. 'It's working tremendously well,' says John Foster, North Tyneside council's City Challenge co-ordinator. For the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, responsible for regenerating riverside land alongside some of north-east England's most deprived housing areas, it is vitally important that the Meadowell and the TWDC's Pounds 280m Royal Quays dockland redevelopment, where building work has just started, do not become polarised extremes of jobless deprivation and employed affluence. For the private sector, which has learned to shun places like the Meadowell, there is everything to gain if the estate can be made more attractive for investment, and its residents more skilled. This, too, would complement the work of the police, who have set up their own Meadowell community policing team since the riots. North Tyneside's City Challenge programme covers the town centres of Wallsend and North Shields and the Meadowell and Howdon estates each side of the A19 trunk road corridor, where there are a number of substantial industrial employers. The inclusion of the partly-industrialised A19 corridor, running through the middle of the Challenge area, emphasises that the reduction of unemployment is a key objective. But the Challenge bid recognises that in areas like the Meadowell, where male unemployment is over 40 per cent, other work is needed before disaffected or demoralised residents can get jobs. As well as the Pounds 8m community village, City Challenge will bring the estate an innovative Pounds 5m childcare training centre, designed to help women gain childcare qualifications and offer them a good environment in which to leave their children while they take up training or work. But even though there is wide acknowledgement that Meadowell's problems cannot be solved simply by spending money, the estate still needs investment beyond City Challenge's scope. The council's Pounds 30m Estate Action programme, in which the Cheviot Housing Association is heavily involved, is intended to diversify housing tenure. The government last month gave the go-ahead for the first Pounds 8m phase of Estate Action work in the Meadowell. As part of the scheme, every domestic property on the estate, which currently has 1,776 council homes, will be upgraded by better security on doors and windows, energy insulation and external environmental improvements. Residents involved in City Challenge have the support of many local people - but not all. The nihilism of those who, in the riots, burned down their own estate's meagre facilities and who are still wrecking property and threatening those who 'grass' has yet to be vanquished. 'They should get a big shed and put them in there and make them work and stop their benefits if they don't - that would solve it,' says grandmother Mrs Caroline Atkinson, who is disgusted at the decline of the estate where she has lived for 40 years. It's the kind of approach that few respectable politicians have dared publicly to suggest - yet.</p>

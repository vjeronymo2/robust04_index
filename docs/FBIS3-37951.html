			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference at Reiterna House today,  Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis indicated that Polish  President Lech Walesa's visit to Latvia has helped to open a  political door for the parliament of our country, the executive  power, and other institutions to enter. Guntis Ulmanis related  that during the meeting with Walesa they also discussed  bilateral cooperation between the two countries on a European  scale, as well as issues related to the process of the  withdrawal of the Russian Army and the Skrunda radar station.    Problems concerning minorities in Latvia have also been  discussed. Latvia has to look for grounds to prevent it from  being accused of ethnic cleansing and violation of human rights.  During the talks, cooperation between the two countries in  defense, trade, and the economy was also examined. The Latvian  president noted that it would be necessary for representatives  of the ministries of foreign affairs and the councils of  ministers of the two countries to meet in the near future. The  Latvian and Polish prime ministers will have to meet to conclude  a cooperation agreement between the two countries.    Polish President Lech Walesa for his part told the news  conference that the heads of the two states take the same  approach on the most important issues, therefore, it is possible  to tackle many problems together. Walesa stressed that Latvia  and Poland also have a common mission in guaranteeing security  and welfare in Europe.    Speaking of the influence of Russian foreign policy on  European security, the Latvian president explained that on the  one hand it is a megaphone policy, especially in relation to the  countries which were once parts of the USSR, but on the other  hand, it is Russia's real policy. Ulmanis added that in the  event that the policy set forth in Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev's speeches is implemented, the Baltic countries  will be directly threatened. Guntis Ulmanis expressed the  opinion that Russia's attitude toward the NATO Partnership for  Peace program is not clear either, because on the one hand  Russia apparently supports it, but on the other, Russia's action  in that direction cannot be seen.</p>

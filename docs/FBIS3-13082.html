			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 7 Mar (MENA)-A group of PLO cadres in Tunisia  has called for halting the negotiations with Israel at all  levels and for suspending the promises and agreements until the  Israeli settlers have been disarmed, the settlements in the West  Bank and Gaza have been removed, and international protection  has been provided for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories.    The group--which includes 120 members of the PLO, the Fatah  Movement's Revolutionary Council, and the Palestine National  Council--has demanded the rejection of the suspicious calls to  change the venue of the negotiations or to resume them before  the settlements are removed.    This is said in a statement issued and signed by this group,  a copy of which was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.  Zuhdi al-Tarazi, the Palestinian president's adviser;  Abu-Ja'far, director of the PLO's Political Department; and a  number of Palestinian writers and journalists were among the  signatories.    The statement denounces the massacre and says that the  Israeli enemy, which is backed by world imperialism under U.S.  leadership, will not be satisfied with anything less than the  liquidation of the innocent owners of the land and the seizure  of their lands and possessions.    The statement adds that Israel's involvement in  reconciliation and negotiations is merely a maneuver to give  them a better chance to minimize their losses and avoid blame.</p>

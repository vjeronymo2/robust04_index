			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SLOW-GROWTH LEADER TO RUN FOR COUNCIL  </P> <P> Scott Weiss, the founder of a burgeoning slow-growth movement in a city known  for courting developers, announced his intention Thursday to seek a seat on the  Oxnard City Council.  </P> <P> Weiss resigned last week as chairman of Citizens to Protect Oxnard, a  slow-growth, grass-roots organization, to concentrate on his November election  campaign.  </P> <P> He founded the organization in January and presided over its seven-member  steering committee.  </P> <P> The four-year council terms of Councilman Manuel Lopez and Ann Johs expire in  November, as does the two-year mayoral term of Nao Takasugi. Johs has announced  her intention to seek reelection.  </P> <P> Lopez and Takasugi have yet to announce their plans.  </P> <P> The filing period begins Monday and closes Aug. 10.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who recently advocated residential development  limits in the city, announced that she will run for mayor in November.  </P> <P> If elected, Weiss, a self-employed public accountant, said he would try to  advocate reasonable growth limits in the city and would try to address the  city's financial problems.  </P> <P> "Our current council members seem to feel that more growth will solve  everything, when in reality, the growth they have approved has led to many of  the fiscal problems that now plague our city," he said in a statement.

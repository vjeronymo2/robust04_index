			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giorgi Chanturia, chairman of the National- </F> Democratic Party, by unidentified DRONI correspondent; place and  date not given: "We Are Coming and Singing"]    [Text] There exist differing views in society on how to  overcome the sociopolitical situation that has taken shape in  Georgia: Some believe that, in spite of the problems, the  authorities should see their term of office through to the end;  here and there in the corridors, they view the use of military  methods again as a matter of urgency. At the same time, the  National- Democratic Party [NDP] adheres to a different  position: the holding of early elections. According to the  party's leader, Giorgi Chanturia, this already means their  accession to power.    [Chanturia] The NDP has been ready to assume power for a  long time now. There exists only one way of achieving this aim  -- elections. However, there is another reason for making this  demand: One cannot go on living in such a way. Dilettantism has  destroyed Georgia; Parliament does not resemble a parliament.  Naturally, the present authorities and their criminal policies  are the result of its activities. Yet, in the final analysis,  everything leads us to the electorate: Parliament is composed  of members chosen by the people. It is possible to make a  mistake once, twice, three times, but, in the end, we should  make sure the following French saying does not apply to us: The  people have the government that they deserve. Opponents are  demanding the guarantee of a better choice. However, such a  thing does not exist. This Parliament, in spite of its  failings, is better than the former Supreme Council. Early  elections will at once spare us many possible misfortunes. For  example, military actions, events resembling a palace coup, and  innumerable other processes. No matter how many Monday  interviews [reference to Shevardnadze's weekly radio interview]  and captivating smiles we give, this will not bring any results.  In spite of their differing views, the people are fed up with  hearing only that we have overcome provincial fascism; surely we  should be doing other basic things. However, it is wholly  impermissible that Eduard Shevardnadze should resign before the  holding of early elections as he will be replaced by that force  that is oriented toward Russia and has a lot of weapons and  money. Of course, such authorities will hold unfair elections  and we will be needed only to embellish the facade. In this  case, of course, we will boycott the elections.    [DRONI] Does this mean that, if the elections are  conducted according to the "rules" of another country or if  there are any military actions, the NDP will adhere to a certain  neutral position?    [Chanturia] When the game is lost, we always remain silent.  When executive power was recently being ratified anew, the  majority and minority were summoned and told that, if the  government should fall, Parliament would be dissolved. Of  course, we did not determine our position as this would have  been in vain. At the same time, we did not vote for the  government. People often talk about the transformation of the  NDP and its change of position, something which has never  happened. For example, the severing of relations between us and  Shevardnadze came about due to a difference of opinion on  several issues. As soon as he moved into the Russophile camp,  our ways parted.    [DRONI] If a common position is found, do you think it  will again be possible to cooperate with Eduard  Shevardnadze?    [Chanturia] Naturally, if he conducts the right policies, we  will support him. However, we will not help anyone to promote a  Russian policy. I believe that, in spite of Georgia's  membership in the CIS, Eduard Shevardnadze does not hold a  pro-Russian stance today. Simply, he did not have enough power:  The easier it is to free oneself from ideology, the more  difficult it is to escape a way of life. Shevardnadze believed  that it was possible to construct the country without any kind  of team and by giving priority to foreign policy and on the  basis of his own authority. As can be seen, this has not  happened. Reforms have also not been carried out and the  country has been taken over by criminal bands and corruption.  However, I believe that all possibilities have not yet been  exhausted.    There are fairly powerful pro-Russian forces in Georgia; for  example, [Parliament Speaker] Goguadze and [Socio-Democratic  Party Chairman] Muchaidze are struggling against Shevardnadze  for the reason stated publicly and with typical naivete by  [ex-Defense Minister] Kitovani: Shevardnadze is not trusted in  Russia. Incidentally, Muchaidze also said the same thing. Such  a statement is a criminal offense: To demand the resignation of  one's own government because it does not meet with the approval  of a neighboring state. We have another wing as well; I have in  mind the Liberal-Conservative coalition that apparently  criticizes the head of state for being a Russophile, but  believes that Georgia was too late in joining the CIS. A game  is also being played here. Our politicians have acquired a  simple understanding of the Russian factor and have formed  queues in the waiting rooms of various special services in  Moscow. Frankly speaking, these are agents, and specific  measures have to be taken against them.    [DRONI] Realistically speaking, to what extent was it  possible to change executive power? In this regard, the general  secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens [Zurab Zhvania]  stated that not only their union but also other political forces  were not ready for this change.    [Chanturia] In our time, we even proposed to the authorities  the composition of a coalition government and gave this list to  Zurab Zhvania. However, for some reason, changes were made to  it before it was disseminated and the head of state did not  react to this in any way. The interests of both the majority  and minority were protected in this proposal and, most  importantly, a completely different mentality was taken into  account.    [DRONI] Don't you think that the total failure to form  an opposition played a specific role in the ratification of the  old government?    [Chanturia] We were actually the initiators of a meeting of  parties following Georgia's entry into the CIS, but several of  them took such steps that there was no longer any sense even in  holding consultations. I am surprised that the [Union of]  Traditionalists agreed to Basilia [one of its members] becoming  deputy prime minister, especially as they know very well that he  can do nothing in those conditions when there is no unified  team. This, in the final analysis, will bring the  Traditionalists nothing but discredit.    [DRONI] The view exists that Basilia's candidacy  apparently was a unifying force in the matter of ratifying the  government.    [Chanturia] Of course. I do not exclude the existence of  this factor, but everything was much simpler: It was a matter  of Traditionalist votes.    [DRONI] In your view, apart from the NDP, what other  political force has the ability to govern the state?    [Chanturia] Unfortunately, I cannot see any such serious  force. I have great respect for the Republicans, but they  represent more an intellectual association than a party. In  this respect, the Traditionalists are closer to being a party  but they are also deficient in many things. The NDP, without  belonging to any coalition, is able to form a government; this  team has been in existence for a long time; moreover, we also  have smaller teams. Incidentally, we viewed the Union of  Georgia's Citizens with great hope; we thought it could have  been a worthy opponent, but it has taken the form of neither a  party nor an organization.    [DRONI] If the authorities decide to hold early  elections, these will not take place before the fall. It is  possible for the Union of Citizens to form itself into a  realistic if not dominant force before then.    [Chanturia] They have been unable to create structures in  any region that are better than ours. The fact that they have  automatically transformed gamgeobebi [local administrative  boards] into regional organizations of the Union of Citizens  indicates an antistructural trend, which was the undoing of the  Popular Front, the Rustaveli Society, and all such mass  organizations that were created on a tidal wave.    [DRONI] In our country, a politician's actions are for  some reason assessed by the display of positive or negative  feelings toward him. You stated at a conference that, in order  to satisfy such feelings, the nation needed a fatherly figure  and you said that the best example would be a monarchy. If your  party wins the elections, will this institution be  introduced?    [Chanturia] Of course, the best variant would be to have a  king, although we are neither republicans nor monarchists. I  believe that it is altogether too early to speak about the state  system at the moment as these issues are dependent upon the  regulation of the Abkhazian and Samachablo [South Ossetia]  problems; that is to say, the state is dependent upon external  factors.    [DRONI] If the current authorities assume  responsibility for the prevailing socioeconomic situation and  the temporary loss of Abkhazia, don't you think that the future  new authorities will be freed of such a "burden?"    [Chanturia] It is impossible to relieve oneself of  responsibility regarding the Abkhazian question. If the old  government assumes responsibility for its loss, the problem of  its return is the prerogative of the new government. However,  in the socioeconomic sphere, our task will be somewhat lighter.  The standard of living today is at such a low level that it  cannot drop any further. This creates a fine background against  which to conduct reforms.    [DRONI] Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of address]  Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, leader of the NDP faction in  Parliament, former deputy prime minister] has already given an  assessment of that act that occurred in Parliament [on 28 April,  deputy speaker Rcheulishvili, after being insulted by Popular  Front chairman Nodar Natadze, retaliated by splashing a glass of  mineral water in his face]. Do you think that a crisis in  Parliament has begun or do you view this as one negative event  in the life of Parliament?    [Chanturia] Naturally, it is very difficult not to excuse  Rcheulishvili from the human point of view. When you are  insulted in this way, you can quite easily pour Borzhomi  [mineral water] over the person and, moreover, hit him over the  head with the bottle. At the same time, it is very difficult to  argue against Natadze when his microphone is constantly being  switched off and when he is being called an idiot or imbecile.  Quite simply, we are all human beings who, on occasions, are  capable of losing our tempers. However, we should not view this  as one normal tense day in the work of Parliament; it is a sign  of the crisis that has already begun.    [DRONI] If the NDP takes part in the future elections,  what will Giorgi Chanturia personally do?    [Chanturia] Basically all those problems that were the  reason for my not participating in the last elections have been  removed. In particular, all party structures have been formed,  which will give powerful assistance to [our] faction. Other  party leaders have come to the fore, whereas my presence in  Parliament would have delayed this process. Third, my position  as a deputy would have resulted in our party losing political  points. Given that a battle for survival is being waged today,  I have no right to lock myself up in Diogenes' barrel.    [DRONI] However, will Giorgi Chanturia be satisfied  with being just a deputy?    [Chanturia] If the party achieves complete victory, that  hierarchy that exists in the party will be transferred to the  state structure.</p>

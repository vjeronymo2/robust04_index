			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (CNS) -- Now is not a suitable  time for China to undertake land option trading judging from the  actual situation of the country, the Director of State Land  Administration Mr. Zou Yuchuan said today in an interview with  this agency.    So-called land option trading, according to Mr. Zou,  amounted  to land speculation from the viewpoint of the actual situation  in China. When taking into consideration the market concept,  land option transactions should not be undertaken until a more  complete market system has taken shape.    Mr. Zou said he was convinced that it was necessary for the  land market to be exploited for a period of time before land  option trading was adopted in the country. The provisional  regulations issued by the State Council in 1990 for the use with  payment of state-owned land in urban and rural areas, Mr. Zou  said, were aimed at keeping the land market under regulation and  control. The regulations which govern the affairs in this  sector are still operating. A draft law for administration of  real estate in urban areas put forward by the Ministry of  Construction, the State Land Administration and the Bureau of  Legislative Affairs of the State Council was recently approved  at a routine meeting of the State Council and then submitted to  the National People's Congress for final approval. The draft  law covers the real estate market and will be the main law and  rule for regulation and control as well as administration of the  real estate market if endorsed. The land administration is now  drafting regulations for land registration in a bid to greatly  improve the land market in the country.</p>

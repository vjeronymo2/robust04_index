			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Iraq bows to UN pressure to scrap Scud equipment IRAQ BOWED to United Nations pressure yesterday by agreeing to destroy manufacturing equipment related to its Scud missile programme in an effort to defuse the threat of possible military action to enforce UN resolutions. The move was welcomed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, director of the UN special commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as indicating a new willingness in Baghdad to comply with UN demands. He called the Iraqi decision a 'change of policy'. British officials said cautiously yesterday that the Iraqi agreement to destroy the Scud equipment was 'one of the benchmarks' they were seeking as indicating Iraq's willingness to comply with UN demands. Mr Ekeus told a New York news conference his commission was 'satisfied there are undertakings that the Iraqis are willing to go along with destruction (of) capabilities' which they had not previously been willing to destroy. The Iraqi assurances were contained in a letter handed to Mr Ekeus yesterday by Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Baghdad's ambassador to the UN. Iraqi officials originally refused to destroy the Scud-related equipment, which was discovered by a team of UN ballistics inspectors in the vicinity of Baghdad last month. The refusal prompted the UN Security Council to warn of 'serious consequences' if Iraq did not comply fully with Gulf war ceasefire resolutions ordering the destruction of its conventional, chemical and nuclear weapons programmes. At the same time the US issued a series of warnings that a further military strike might be launched against Iraq. The message was drummed home to Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, in person last week during his delegation's appearance before the UN Security Council. It has been backed up by reports that the US had drawn up a list of targets in Iraq for a possible bombing raid. Yesterday's letter to the UN is the first sign that Iraq is prepared to respond to the Security Council's warnings. In a further sign of Iraqi acquiescence, Mr Ekeus said Baghdad had also supplied him with 'important new information' about its ballistic and chemical weapons programmes. He said the Iraqi letter included a claim that Baghdad had itself destroyed hundreds of missiles not previously declared to the UN inspectors. Although Iraq was thought to have up to 800 Scud missiles, inspectors have so far discovered and destroyed only 62. The letter also contained Iraqi agreement to offer 'full, final and complete' disclosure of its weapons programmes, Mr Ekeus said. A fresh team of UN ballistics inspectors, due to arrive in Baghdad today, will verify the Iraqi information. The next big test of strength will probably be on nuclear weapons-related equipment at a plant at Al-Atheer, south of Baghdad. A further team of nuclear inspectors is to visit the country early next month. The International Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna is expected to make recommendations soon on what should be destroyed in the plant, left untouched during the Gulf war.</p>

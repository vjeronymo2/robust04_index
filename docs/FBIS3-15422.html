			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Dmitriy Chubarov]    [Text] Moscow March 4 TASS -- Russia is prepared to  withdraw its troops based in Estonia before August 31, 1994 but  only if a treaty on social protection of Russian military  pensioners is signed, Vasiliy Svirin, head of the state Russian  delegation to the talks with Estonia, told a news conference  today in connection with the completion of the 17th round of the  Russo-Estonian negotiations earlier this week.    Estonia, he said, does not implement its statement made at  the 14th round of the Russo-Estonian talks as regards the draft  agreement on social protection of military pensioners and  members of their families. Russia wants all retired ex-Soviet  servicemen to be granted permanent resident status which is  rejected by Estonia. Besides, the Russian side has not yet  received the confirmation that Estonia will allocate financial  means for building housing in Russia for servicemen of the  Russian troops to be withdrawn.    "Taking into consideration an Estonian side's actual refusal  to fulfill the promises earlier given by it, which served the  basis for Russia's proposal about August 31, 1994 as a final  date of the withdrawal, the Russian side states that its troops  pullout will be implemented according to the timetable worked  out by Russia," Vasiliy Svirin stressed.    The problem of territorial claims, he noted, is raised  practically at each round of the Russo-Estonian talks and causes  certain tension. However, this problem has no direct influence  on the talks on the troops withdrawal and the condition of  military pensioners.    "We have never linked a troops pullout to any other  problems,  but at the 17th round of the talks the Estonian side suddenly  stated that it invited Russia to The Hague International Court  to determine the legality of the established borders. Moscow is  guided in this issue, the Russian side replied, by the United  Nations Charter which legalized the inviolability of frontiers  in Europe, as well as by other international and legal documents  to which Estonia also became a party", the representative of the  Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized.</p>

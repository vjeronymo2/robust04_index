Wlodzimierz Kicinski, head of the NBP's foreign department,  told reporters that export earnings in January reached 1,054 bn  dollars, up 21.6 percent on January, 1993, while payments for  imports reached 1.25 bn dollars, up 10 percent on January last  year. Poland's leading trade partners both in exports and  imports were Germany, the United States, Britain, France and  Austria.    Gross official reserves of foreign exchange reached 4.3 bn  dollars in January, recording a slight increase on December,  1993.    Yesterday the president of the State Foreign Investment  Agency said he expected an inflow of foreign investment and loan  capital to Poland as a result of the agreement signed by Poland  with the creditor banks associated in the London Club. He put  the expected inflow at 1 bn dollars annually.    In the last five years foreign investments in Poland  totalled  3.5 bn dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A gas blowout occurred  on June 1 while a prospecting team were drilling in the Luliang  Basin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, proving that the  province is rich in natural gas resources.    With an area of 770 square km, the Luliang Basin is 145 km  east of Kunming, capital of the province.    Wu Lingying, an engineer of the oil exploration bureau in  charge of the prospecting, said that the prospecting began in  April this year. No gas or oil had been found in the province  before.    Experts say that the well has been gushing out a million cu  m  of gas every day since June 1.    Wu said that the Luliang Basin is of the Cenozoic Era. The  gusher is a breakthrough in Yunnan Province's oil prospecting  history.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- The opening day of the  Geneva negotiations ended this evening with extremely reserved  assessments and forecasts by its participants, but with  agreement that the dialogue be continued tomorrow.    Following the conclusion of bilateral negotiations with  Muslim representatives, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  stated that the degree of understanding is "to put it mildly,  very, very modest." He added that he does not wish to judge it  in advance, because they agreed to continue the negotiations  tomorrow.    According to Milosevic, the Serb side has practically  fulfilled European Union demands that the Muslims in Bosnia get  33.3 percent of the territory, but, as he put it, the Muslim  side has rejected this.    Milosevic said that the conditions exist for this bloody war  to end, and this is the essence of everything. However, he  noted that an endless dialogue is being conducted with the  Muslim delegation, as it has continued to put forward fresh  demands. "It is high time that peace was signed, after which  bilateral or trilateral talks on coordinating contentious issues  can continue," Milosevic said.    Referring to a Serbian-Croatian dialogue in the Palais des  Nations this afternoon, Milosevic said that a high degree of  understanding was achieved. He added that an identical approach  to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina exists.    Haris Silajdzic, prime minister in the pro-Muslim  government,  said that no progress was made in the talks with the Serbian  side. He found it appropriate to express his regret that the  "international community and the Western diplomacy do not  support Bosnia, are maintaining the arms embargo and thus  enabling an aggression and spread of fascism in Bosnia."    Silajdzic stressed that the Muslim side did not put forward  fresh demands in this round of negotiations, apart from  insisting on 33.5 percent of the territory and the return of  "territories seized by force."    According to Silajdzic, the biggest concession made by the  Muslim delegation was that it accepted three ethnic republics  within a union, to the detriment of keeping an undivided Bosnia.</p>

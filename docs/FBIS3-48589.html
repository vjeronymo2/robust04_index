			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] BANGKOK, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Recent attempts by the  Burmese junta to improve its image are purely "cosmetic," while  the situation in the country remains highly "volatile," a  Rangoon-based diplomat said here Thursday. Speaking with  reporters, the diplomat, who requested anonymity, said members  of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)  had "come to the conclusion that they need to change their  image."    But he dismissed hints of political reform -- such as the  proposition of a new constitution put forward by the National  Convention, whose delegates are handpicked by the junta -- as  pure "flummery."    "There is no disposition to yield power to anyone else in  any  way," he said, stressing that "the changes are only cosmetic."    The diplomat predicted Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San  Suu Kyi, whose National Democratic League (NLD) overwhelmingly  won elections in 1990, would remain under house arrest though  her sentence technically ends next July. She has been under  house arrest since July 1989. Soldiers and wooden guard boxes  at the entrance of her home were removed last Saturday.    The junta's current concern about image might result in "a  public relations coup of some sort," such as allowing a single  foreign diplomat to visit her. So far, only her husband,  British academic Michael Aris and their two sons have been  authorized to visit her. If she were released, he said, it  could touch off spontaneous demonstrations.    "They're a volatile population," he said. "We know that from  1988," the year pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed  nationwide by the military. He also called current peace  negotiations between the council and ten ethnic minority groups  an example of "divide and conquer" and added: "There is still a  policy of Burmanization."    Meanwhile, life for the Burmese has failed to improve,  despite surface changes in the capital Rangoon and Burma's top  tourist draw in the northern city of Mandalay, he said. SLORC  had allowed select members of the military and their families to  invest in businesses which had injected funds in those cities,  he said. But "the rest of the country has been left untouched,"  he said. Food has become prohibitively expensive, while the  salaries of civil servants and pensioners have been frozen since  1989, he added.    People continue to be regularly rounded up for mock  demonstrations of support for the SLORC, but "look like  zombies," he said.    The diplomat's evaluations echoed a just published report  from Amnesty International which said that small improvements  have been made by SLORC in human rights during the second half  of 1993, but that the use of torture and other form of  ill-treatment against its opponents remained "endemic."    Still, the diplomat remained optimistic that foreign  investment and increased exposure of the Burmese people to  foreign media could pressure Rangoon for real reform.    Turning to China's influence in Burma, he said: "Chinese are  everywhere in Rangoon, and Mandalay in particular." But "the  driving power of the relationship is Kunming and Yunnan," he  said, referring to the province on China's southern border with  Burma and its capital, "not Beijing."    "There are rumours of resentment" with Chinese investors, he  added.    Satellite dishes, while not widely available, are  "ultimately  beyond (SLORC's) control," he said, and promised to improve the  flow of information.    He said he hoped that member countries of ASEAN -- the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations, grouping Brunei,  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore --  would demand that certain conditions be met before granting  membership to Burma, which some diplomats think is on the agenda.    In the short run, "the military is here to stay." Rumors of  tensions between some top leaders may be true, but for now,  "none can move against one another."    Furthermore, he said, "there is a sense that every order is  followed from the top."</p>

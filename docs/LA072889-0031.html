			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TEAMMATE'S BAD BREAK OPENS DOOR TO U. S. TEAM;  </P> <P> HEAT FORWARD JEFF HOOKER GETS HIS CHANCE TO PLAY, COMES UP WITH MIXED FEELINGS  </P> <P> After a three-year absence from the U.S. national soccer team, Jeff Hooker knew  he would need a break, any kind of break, to play in a World Cup qualifying  match this year.  </P> <P> He got it. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a painful break for Billy  Thompson, Hooker's running mate in the front line of the Torrance-based Los  Angeles Heat.  </P> <P> On July 2, Thompson suffered a clean fracture of his right tibia while taking a  shot in a game between the Heat and the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks. It was a  freak injury. Thompson was alone on the San Francisco wing ready to shoot, but  his shin bowed when he planted, and he was lost to the Heat -- and the national  team -- for at least six weeks.  </P> <P> Thompson had been slated to be one of the forwards on the U.S. team for its  World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador the following week.  </P> <P> Instead, it was Hooker, then the hottest player in the Western Soccer League,  who got the call from national team officials.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Hooker, the El Salvador game was indefinitely postponed when  soccer's international hierarchy, the Federation Internationale de Football,  couldn't agree on a stadium for the match.  </P> <P> So Hooker replaced Thompson in New Britain, Conn., last week on the American B  team for a Marlboro Cup tournament. But he didn't get the chance he wanted to  show his coaches what he could do.  </P> <P> He twisted his ankle in training, then played only 30 minutes of both games --  the first a 1-0 victory over a team from Northern Ireland and the second a 3-0  shelling at the hands of the championship team from the Polish professional  league.  </P> <P> In the first game, the U.S. team circled into a defensive shell by the time  Hooker checked in at forward. And in the second game, the Americans were worn  down when Hooker entered, and the hopes for a comeback against Poland -- and of  Hooker getting any shots on goal -- were slim.  </P> <P> "It was the chance I was waiting for," said Hooker, 24. "But I ended up with  mixed feelings. I guess it worked out well for the team, but individually not  so well."  </P> <P> So Hooker is waiting for another break.  </P> <P> Five years ago, when Hooker was 19, he was a rising star and a well-known face  on the national team. He had been one of the most highly touted prep players in  the nation at Walnut High School and was a dazzling forward as a freshman at  UCLA.  </P> <P> Hooker wore the U.S. colors in the 1984 Olympic Games and again in 1985 when  the Americans failed to qualify for the World Cup under national team Coach  Alkis Panagoulias. In 1984 Hooker was one of only four American amateurs on the  Olympic soccer squad -- the rest were drawn from the erstwhile professional  North American Soccer League.  </P> <P> He played in front of 78,000 cheering fans at Stanford University when the U.S.  routed Costa Rica, 3-0, in its first Olympic preliminary round match. But for  Hooker and the rest of the American team, the Olympics ended in disappointment.  </P> <P> In the second preliminary match, Pietro Fanna's second-half goal led Italy to a  1-0 victory over the U.S. at the Rose Bowl. In the third game, the Americans  dueled Egypt to a 1-1 tie -- but the Egyptians sat on the ball for much of the  second half and moved into the quarterfinals ahead of the U.S. by scoring more  goals in the round.  </P> <P> For Hooker, more disappointment followed. After 1985, Panagoulias was gone,  replaced by Lothar Osiander, who brought a host of new faces with him. Hooker  admits he let himself down -- and his chance of sticking with the U.S. team --  through a clash of personalities with Osiander.  </P> <P> "I'd been with the national team so long, I guess I took things for granted,"  he said. "I wasn't playing at the top of my game. But I also had a bad  attitude. After a while, it didn't matter how well or how badly I played, I  wasn't going to play for Lothar."  </P> <P> Hooker's discipline slipped, and with it his standing with Osiander. He was  snubbed time and again when invitations went around for national team berths.  </P> <P> But this spring, Hooker decided to let his play speak for itself. With Bob  Gansler, a new coach, in charge of the national team's quest for a spot in  Italy for the 1990 World Cup, Hooker figured he might open some eyes again.  </P> <P> "I tried to play this season (with the Heat) with the idea of getting hot and  getting back on the national team," Hooker said. "Scoring a lot of goals is the  most obvious way to get noticed."  </P> <P> He did just that. In the Heat's offensive scheme, Hooker is the target man up  front, with his back to the goal, taking balls at his feet and playing them out  to other attackers, or spinning into the box himself. He's responded with seven  goals and five assists, and he leads the team in scoring with 19 points.  </P> <P> "I'm not the flashiest player on the team," he said. "I'm not the type of  player who's going to step over the ball three times and put it into the back  of the net and make the crowd go crazy. And I'm not all speed and skill like  Billy Thompson."  </P> <P> But Hooker is a solid piece of the Heat's winning puzzle. He has scored a pair  of goals in a game twice this season -- once in 102-degree weather at Tempe,  Ariz., against the Arizona Condors when he was battling the flu.  </P> <P> The second time Hooker turned the trick was against Real Santa Barbara, and  with his first goal of that game -- a breakaway through Santa Barbara's defense  in the 28th second -- he scored the fastest goal in league history.  </P> <P> "He's the key to our offense," said Heat Coach Bobby Sibbald. "He's what makes  things run for us. Even though he's not very big, he's very tough to take the  ball away from."  </P> <P> Hooker is looking for another invitation to the national team -- there is  another Marlboro Cup scheduled for Los Angeles in August and Hooker hopes his  name will be on the roster.  </P> <P> "The ideal situation would be to play well through the WSL playoffs, get an  invitation and then play well and carry it over from there," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Clinton's policy options shrinking on Haiti A new US approach on refugees and the dispatch of a Navy amphibious assault group may have bought some time for the Clinton administration over Haiti, but critics charge that it is quickly sinking into a policy crisis. Haitians have gone to sea in record numbers since May when President Bill Clinton reversed a standing policy - begun under the Bush administration - of returning all Haitians picked up at sea to Haiti for US processing. Asylum hearings started on naval ships stationed near Jamaica and on the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting reports that the floating processing centre near Jamaica was granting asylum at three times the rate of the processing in Haiti. In an attempt to stem the tide of sea-borne refugees prompted by such reports, the administration switched policy again. The US now will no longer offer boat people asylum but will provide up to 10,000 of them safe haven in Panama, under a six-month bilateral agreement. Other safe-haven agreements are being arranged with the Caribbean states of Dominica and Antigua. Mr William Gray, Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, defends the new policy as a continuation of Mr Clinton's decision not to return all Haitians to a country where they face possible persecution. The new policy was necessary, he says, to prevent more drownings at sea, while providing safety for those fleeing the Caribbean state. Mr Gray has also said the dispatch of more warships to the region was necessary to safeguard the lives of US citizens and dual nationals - 4,000 of whom are still in Haiti - as well as the lives of 2,700 other foreigners, including UN officials. Mr Gray is confident that the administration will be able to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, either by diplomacy or by force. He said yesterday that Haiti's military regime would not be in power six months from now. For the Clinton administration, the clock is ticking and the number of policy options is shrinking. The safe havens being set up under the new US policy are only temporary. Amnesty International and other groups have documented an increasing number of human rights violations - including the use of rape to intimidate Aristide supporters - and there are varying reports on the effectiveness of sanctions against the regime of Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras. Many observers believe Gen Cedras's links to Colombian drug cartels - which shipped by some estimates Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) to Dollars 500m worth of cocaine through Haiti last year - and to the government in the neighbouring Dominican Republic will enable him to hang on indefinitely, raising the spectre of US military intervention. The Pentagon's decision to send four amphibious assault ships carrying 2,000 Marines to the region is an attempt to put pressure on Gen Cedras, whose army consists of no more than 7,000 ill-trained and ill-equipped men, to step down. The US is reported to have offered him and other leading members of the military regime money and promises of amnesty if they leave Haiti. But there is a risk that the military junta will call Mr Clinton's bluff, forcing US military action. Experts warn that Haiti is fast becoming a defining issue for Mr Clinton. As the Marines sail for Haiti and the state department scrabbles for a diplomatic solution, the next few weeks will determine if US policy on Haiti sinks or swims.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  and Norway began a new round of high-level talks here Sunday [6  March] over a fisheries dispute which is blocking Oslo's entry  into an enlarged union along with Austria, Finland and Sweden.    Diplomats said Norway was sticking firmly to its  longstanding  refusal to give EU fishing fleets, mainly Spanish, increased  access to fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of its price for  membership.    Spain has been pushing for the right to take 14,000 tonnes  of  fish a year from Norwegian waters when Oslo enters the grouping  -- less than one percent of the annual Norwegian catch.    Norway's ministers of fisheries, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and of  trade, Grete Knudsen, pursued talks on the issue here Sunday  with several EU ministers including Theodoros Pangalos, chairman  of the EU's Council of Ministers.    Knudsen would say only that the two sides had been engaged  in  "positive dialogue." The talks are expected to continue through  most of the week.    Agreement must be reached by Thursday if Norway is to meet a  target of January 1 to enter the European Union with the other  three newcomers, which agreed on membership terms last Tuesday  after a year of tough negotiations.    The issue is crucially important for Norway, where  preservation of fishing communities is an emotional political  issue, and in Spain, which is trying to wring maximum benefit  from bringing newcomers into the EU.    "We want a satisfactory conclusion in fish and  institutions,"  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in an interview with  Spanish television on Sunday.    His reference to "institutions" applies to a row over voting  rights in the EU Council of Ministers -- its main  decision-making body -- which is threatening to torpedo the  enlargement negotiations for all four applicants.    Britain and Spain are trying to freeze voting procedures so  that entry of the newcomers does not tilt the balance of power  from bigger to smaller EU countries and so that it is easier to  block controversial decisions.    Both countries have said they will not budge on the issue,  which will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers  here on Monday and Tuesday.    Diplomats say the meeting might drag on through the week  because, without a solution, the Union will be unable to  complete the enlargement negotiations in time to submit the  result to the European Parliament by Thursday.    This would mean, in turn, that it would become almost  impossible to complete ratification of the negotiations in time  to admit the newcomers on January 1.    A British official said: "There are two good card players at  the table. The Spanish are very good and everyone knows the  Norwegians are unbeatable.... I don't think the Norwegians know  yet what they can get away with."    The Norwegian negotiators say they must return home with a  good result on fish, otherwise the Norwegian electorate might  say "no" to membership of the EU in the mandatory pre-entry  referendum.    This happened before. Norway was set to join the European  Economic Community, as it was then called, in 1972 along with  Denmark, Britain and Ireland.    But Norway voted "no" because it would not submit to  fisheries policies from Brussels.    Compromise might be easier this time because, with Finland  and Sweden ready to join the Union, Norway would be isolated in  Scandinavia if it said "no" again. But nobody is ready to  predict the result of this week's talks.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS REPORTEDLY MAKE TAYLOR HIGHEST PAID DEFENSIVE PLAYER  </P> <P> Lawrence Taylor reportedly became the highest paid defensive player in the NFL  when the linebacker ended a 45-day holdout and signed a new three-year contract  with the New York Giants Friday.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Taylor's agent, Joe Courrege,  said he was the highest paid defensive player in the NFL, meaning $1.6 million  was the probable figure.  </P> <P> "Nobody gets exactly what they wanted," Taylor said at a news conference that  was supposed to be for Coach Bill Parcells to discuss this week's season opener  against Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Taylor, 31, was in the final year of his contract, which would have paid him  $1.21 million, but he wanted to renegotiate and asked for $2 million per year.  The Giants reportedly had offered $1.4 million.  </P> <P> Although contract terms were not disclosed, Taylor would have to make more than  $1.6 million this season to do better than Minnesota defensive end Chris  Doleman, reportedly set to sign for $1.6 million a year.  </P> <P> Before the Taylor deal, the Eagles' Reggie White was the highest paid defensive  player at $1.51 million, with Buffalo's Bruce Smith next at $1.5 million.  </P> <P> "I'd look kind of stupid (complaining about) the money I will be making because  it is good money," Taylor said.  </P> <P> The linebacker says he will be ready for Sunday's opener against the  Philadelphia Eagles but added, "I would have liked a little contact before the  first game."  </P> <P> The Giants have asked the league for a two-week roster exemption for Taylor so  he will not count on the 47-man roster. The exemption would run out early if  Taylor plays.  </P></p>

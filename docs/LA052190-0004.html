			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE PLAN ON ANTITRUST LAWS  </P> <P> I read in The Times that "The Bush Administration on Monday unveiled its  long-awaited proposal to loosen antitrust laws so that companies can more  easily form joint manufacturing ventures" (Part A, May 8).  </P> <P> When the government loosened the restrictions on the savings and loans, it cost  the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars that it will take generations to  pay off.  </P> <P> The hoped-for result will be economic growth and a more advantageous  competitive position in the world. But do they actually know what the results  will be? Some experts have a different negative opinion. We can't stand another  goof like the savings and loans.  </P> <P> The economic interests have persuaded the government to ignore other antitrust  laws which have allowed gigantic monopolistic enterprises to take over  everything in sight. The result is huge profits by the financiers at the  expense of the workers who actually produce the wealth, many of whom are thrown  out of their hard-earned jobs.  </P> <P> The duty of the government is to the welfare of the people. The economic  trickle-down theory is too roundabout, too uncertain, and too devious.  </P> <P> BERNARD C. WATERHOUSE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROYALS SIGN MARK DAVIS TO $13-MILLION CONTRACT  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, a package of Kansas City Chamber of Commerce pamphlets,  real-estate brochures and media guides arrived at Mark Davis' home in  Scottsdale, Ariz.  </P> <P> Davis opened the package, knowing that the Kansas City Royals were one of the  teams bidding for free-agent players, but instead of studying -- or even  reading the material -- he tossed it aside.  </P> <P> "I figured I was going to stay in San Diego anyway," Davis said, "so why did I  need that stuff for?"  </P> <P> Guess who has been studying demographic statistics in the greater Kansas City  area these past 24 hours?  </P> <P> On Monday at Royals Stadium, Davis signed a contract for the largest annual  salary in baseball history, $13 million for four years with Kansas City.  </P> <P> Maybe he's still disillusioned because he isn't staying in San Diego, but the  Royals are considered one of the powers of the American League.  </P> <P> "I remember picking up the Phoenix paper one morning and seeing the Padres  weren't interested, and then a couple of paragraphs later saying the Kansas  City Royals weren't interested," said Candy Davis, Davis' wife.  </P> <P> "I told Mark, 'Well, this is great. It looks like we're going to end up playing  in Japan.'  </P> <P> "I tend to overreact at things like that."  </P> <P> The Padres might have overreacted when Davis' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks,  rejected their four-year, $12 million contract last Tuesday. They found a  replacement, free agent Craig Lefferts of the San Francisco Giants, who saved  20 games last season.  </P> <P> The Royals, who had listed Davis as their No. 1 off-season priority, also  announced that they had dropped out of the Davis sweepstakes.  </P> <P> "When I found out that they rejected the Padres' offer and weren't going to  sign with anyone unless they got a five-year guaranteed offer," Royal General  Manager John Schuerholz said, "I said, 'Well, we're out of it, too.' "  </P> <P> So the Royals spent $6 million on starter Storm Davis, another $2 million  re-signing free-agent second baseman Frank White and center fielder Willie  Wilson, and started making their spring-training plans when the phone rang  Friday morning in Schuerholz's office.  </P> <P> Randy Hendricks asked if the Royals were still interested in Davis.  </P> <P> "Not at that price," Schuerholz said.  </P> <P> Hendricks: "How about for less years and less money."  </P> <P> Schuerholz: "I'm listening."  </P> <P> The Hendricks brothers, who are from Kansas City, and Schuerholz opened serious  negotiations and at 6 p.m. Sunday, Davis was told to pack his bags. He was  going to Kansas City.  </P> <P> By afternoon, he was wearing a Royals cap.  </P> <P> He also had his signature on the richest contract per season in baseball  history.  </P> <P> Davis will receive a $1.5 million signing bonus, $1.75 million salary in 1990  and $3.25 million in 1991, 1992 and 1993. He also has award incentives in his  contract that could pay him another $550,000 a season: $100,000 for the Cy  Young award, $100,000 for the Rolaids Award, $100,000 for the American League  Most Valuable Player award, $100,000 for World Series MVP award, $50,000 for  MVP of the playoffs, $50,000 for the All-Star team, $25,000 for the Gold Glove  award and $25,000 for making the postseason All-Star team.  </P> <P> "It really is amazing the kind of money that's coming out now, isn't it?" said  Candy Davis, laughing. "You think he discovered the cure for cancer, or  something."  </P> <P> It is a lot of money, but Davis accepted only the fifth-best offer. He was  offered five-year guaranteed contracts for more money per season by the New  York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. And there were four-year offers from  the Angels, Detroit Tigers, Atlanta Braves, and, of course, the Padres, for  whom he saved 44 games last season while winning the Cy Young award.  </P> <P> "These were spirited negotiations," Randy Hendricks said, "but let the record  show that San Diego was the one that didn't want to sign Mark, not the other  way around."  </P> <P> The Padres made their fourth and final offer to Davis on Friday night for $12  million over four years. They waited for a response, and when Randy Hendricks  said last Tuesday that they were rejecting the offer, Padre owner Joan Kroc  became incensed, and told Manager Jack McKeon to find another reliever.  </P> <P> "The night the Padres offered four years for $12 million," Hendricks said, "we  asked for four years at $14 million. So it's inaccurate to say we never made a  four-year offer to the Padres.  </P> <P> "Really, we weren't surprised when they went out and signed Lefferts, but we  were surprised they never came to us and said, 'This is our final offer. This  is it. If you don't take it, we're going to make other arrangements.'  </P> <P> "We never were told that, or else Mark might be wearing a Padre uniform today.  </P> <P> "I wish the Padres the very best, and I hope Craig Lefferts does the job for  them (next) year, but I think everyone knows that San Diego is where Mark  wanted to play."  </P> <P> Said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn: "There's a lot of us that don't feel real  good right now. Deep in my mind, I was hoping everything would turn out all  right, and he's sign with us.  </P> <P> "We're going to miss him very much because there's nobody like him. You just  don't find that kind of reliever with that kind of stuff, and you certainly  don't see those overpowering relievers in the American League.  </P> <P> "He'll be just as successful over there as he was here. You'll see. He'll be in  the All-Star game for the next four years."  </P> <P> Davis becomes the first big free-agent signing in the Royals' 20-year history.  They've gone after Catfish Hunter, Pete Rose, Tommy John and Rick Sutcliffe,  but always wound up just hiking the bidding for someone else.  </P> <P> This time, after four years of not attempting to lure high-priced free agents,  they got the man that they believe will bring another World Series title to  America's heartland.  </P> <P> "We won a lot of division titles and a few championships with Dan Quisenberry  as our stopper," Schuerholz said, "and we came to the realization that we had  to have someone in that role to return to championship caliber. We had to make  some moves. With the A's and Angels in our division, we couldn't afford to mark  time."  </P></p>

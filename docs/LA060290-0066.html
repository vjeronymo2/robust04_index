			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REACTION TO ANTIVIVISECTION 'ADVER-TORIAL'  </P> <P> The media have been notoriously pro-vivisection, because the powers that be  want it that way.  </P> <P> Big business rides on funds for animal research. The chemical companies and  their sister pharmaceutical companies, together with manufacturers that test  products on animals, sponsor many of our television shows and place costly ads  in newspapers.  </P> <P> I was amazed at The Times' unbiased portrayal of this long-overdue commercial  and the SUPRESS organization in general.  </P> <P> GINGER GULLIE  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

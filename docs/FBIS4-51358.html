			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shu Rong (5289 1369)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Pudong  New District will adopt BOT [build, operate and transfer] and  other forms to more effectively invite foreign investment and to  speed up the construction of urban infrastructural facilities in  the new district.    This was learned from the urban construction work conference  yesterday.    BOT is an investment form which is different from the  previous practice of state appropriation. Chinese and foreign  enterprises are not only investors in various projects, but are  also managers and operators. Thus, investors may earn certain  returns. At present, the cross-river tunnel that links Yanan  East Road on both sides of the Huangbu Jiang was a project which  adopted the BOT form, and the investor in the project is Hong  Kong's CITIC Group.    Earlier this year, the institutions concerned in Pudong put  forth a number of BOT projects for inviting overseas investment,  and these projects aroused strong interest among would-be  investors. These projects included Route Number 1 of the Light  Railway, a garbage incinerator, a central heating system, a  waterworks, an airport express highway, and trunk roads in the  new district.    In addition, Pudong will allow collectives and individuals  to  make investments in or run some projects which are urgently  needed. The government will adopt certain favorable policies to  support such investment. At the same time, the market system  for urban construction will be established and fostered, and the  policymaking consulting mechanisms and technological reserve for  urban construction and management will be strengthened.    This year is a crucial year in the construction of the new  district. A number of major projects, including five major  roads and one major bridge, power supply facilities,  communications facilities, and environmental improvement  projects, will be completed within this year.    People in the institutions concerned said that the measures  adopted by Pudong for strengthening urban construction will be  favorable to overcoming the shortage of funds, to introducing  advanced management methods from foreign countries, and to  bringing a benign cycle to the construction of the new district.</p>

The first case under investigation is the alleged summary  execution of seven guerrilla members in the Ocosingo  marketplace. Their guerrilla's bodies were found tied up with a  single shot to the back of the head.    The commission is also working on the case of 14 people  traveling in a minibus who were reportedly killed in a 2 January  clash near the Rancho Nuevo barracks, approximately 12 km from  San Cristobal. Some of the bodies showed a shot to the head.  The commission is also investigating the deaths of four  civilians reportedly shot by the Army two days later at the same  place.    Regarding missing person cases, information indicates that  out of 349 reported cases, 142 people remain unaccounted for.    The committee said it interviewed 127 prisoners and  ascertained the injuries sustained at the time of their arrest.    Meanwhile, the Coordinating Board of Nongovernmental Human  Rights Organizations, which is headquartered in San Cristobal de  las Casas, said it had received 45 testimonies from people who  are not involved in the conflict -- mostly Indians -- who were  "mistreated" by the military and accused of being members of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN).    The Defense Ministry announced that 20 armed, masked men  yesterday held up two UNHCR representatives -- Isabelle Mariel  Raeber, a Swiss citizen, and William Calderon, a Mexican --  taking their money and credit cards, on the highway to the  conflict area.</p>

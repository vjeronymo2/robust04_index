			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wen Wuhan (2429 2976 3352): "Shenzhen Economic </F> Zone's Way of Regulating and Controlling Market Prices"]    [Text] The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone [SEZ] was like a  trailblazing vanguard in China's reform and opening to the  outside world, in developing the socialist market economy, and  in stepping up modernizations. It was not only first in  achieving successes in a market-oriented price reform, but also  gained abundant experiences in its exploration of price  management through regulation and control under the conditions  of market economy.    1. Direct Regulation and Control of Government-Fixed Prices    The method employed by the Shenzhen SEZ was: Prices and  charges in areas of a monopolistic, scarcity, protective, and  mandatory character shall still be fixed, regulated, and  controlled by the government. These include charges for electric  power, communications and transportation, water supply, urban  public utilities, primary means of agricultural production, real  estate, education, health services, and administrative  enterprises. This is a pattern in which the government by itself  applies the law of value in regulating and controlling prices.  In the actual practice of regulating and controlling these  prices, the Shenzhen SEZ strictly observes the limits of  authority in matters of price administration as between the  central, provincial, and city governments. It will rationally  determine and adjust the said prices and charges according to  the product costs and expenses in the various lines involved,  according to the supply and demand situation, also considering  the average profit margin of social funds, and also considering  the need for optimizing the production structure. The aim is to  allow these lines and products to earn, under the conditions of  normal production and rational operations and services, more or  less the same profit as the average profit margin of social  funds, and furthermore to promote the sustained and  well-coordinated development of all the various industries and  trades of the national economy.    2. Price Management by Regulation and Control of Prices  Determined by Market Forces    In its price reform, one step ahead of others, the Shenzhen  SEZ has already decontrolled all prices and charges for products  and labor services of a competitive nature and allowed them to  be regulated by the market, with the result that prices for 97  percent of all retailed commodities had become market-regulated.  In this vast array of market-regulated prices, the SEZ  government chose food prices, which were of primary importance  for the people's livelihood and which accounted for over 60  percent of all retail sales, as its breakthrough point in  carrying out the said regulation and control measures. It  effected regulation and control by economic measures, through  new rules and regulations, and by necessary administration  means, and thereby, ahead of others, accumulated experiences in  the regulation and control of market-regulated prices under the  conditions of the socialist market economy.    A. Establishing markets for the trading of agricultural  products, promoting normal circulation of commodities. To  establish wholesale and retail markets for the agricultural  products of the SEZ, the SEZ government instituted unified  planning, and through the methods of investments by public  finance, raising funds among the public, loans, and the  shareholding system, it set up successively large and  medium-sized wholesale markets for agricultural products of  altogether over 100,000 square meters in Yuanling, Futian, Buji,  and other places. It restored or newly built over 100 retail  markets for agricultural products over an area of over 300,000  square meters, accommodating over 60,000 vendors' stalls. The  purpose of establishing these markets for agricultural products  was not only to enliven circulation, promote production, and  greater convenience for the people, but also to provide the  preconditions for fair competition and trading at reasonable  terms. This is an important link in the establishment of a new  market order for the whole series of processes, from production,  to circulation, and to consumption of agricultural products, in  accomplishing normalization of market prices, and in effective  price management through regulation and control.    B. Using economic measures in the regulation and control of  market prices. These are the essential measures by which  government effects macroeconomic regulation and control of  market prices under the conditions of the socialist market  economy. They are also objectively demanded by the operational  mechanism of an economy that works on the principle of "let the  state regulate and control the market, and let the market guide  the enterprises." It is for this reason that the industrial and  commercial departments of the SEZ exert efforts in the following  ways:    First, closely monitoring of market movements, being  accurately in control of supply and demand changes in the  market, signalling to the government danger signs in the market,  and suggesting countermeasures that will effectively control  prices. For instance, in 1989 the entire city's total demand  in 1990 for major foodstuffs was forecast as: grain 180,000  tons, edible oil 20,000 tons, sugar 12,000 tons, aquatic  products 30,000 tons, poultry 18 million heads, egg products  12,000 tons, and vegetables 280,000 tons. The forecasts were  also for the particular seasons, months, and days of the demand,  and in this way provided clear and definite targets for the  scientific regulation and control of supply and demand of  agricultural products in the market, for the development of  production, for the organization of out-of-town sources of  supplies, and for ensuring a well-balanced availability in the  market.    Second, energetically developing production, increasing  effective supplies. Guided by the policy of "developing  production, increasing supplies, expanding exports," the SEZ  government formulated a set of "food basked projects" which  combine concern for the economic development of the SEZ as also  for the livelihood requirements of the people. It has so far  established 646 specialized and intensively operating fresh  foodstuff production entities. By 1990 the entire city had  become self-sufficient in aquatic products to 64 percent, in  vegetables to 50 percent, in egg products to 60 percent, in pork  to 41 percent, and in poultry to 31 percent.    Third, opening all gates to the SEZ, enlivening the  circulation system, and on a broad scale opening up supply  sources in outlying areas. Production and construction in the  SEZ is rapidly developing, employees, workers, and floating  population are all rapidly increasing, and the excess of demand  over supplies in the market is becoming an ever more significant  factor. Under these circumstance, the SEZ government is exerting  great efforts in the development of production and in increasing  the local sources of commodities, while at the same time ridding  itself of the ossified traditional distribution system and  smashing the exclusivity of business operations by state-owned  commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives.  The SEZ is establishing a diversified circulation system with  many divers channels which flexibly react to changes, with a  minimum of intermediary links, and with an integration of  production, supply, and marketing. Under the new system of  having the commercial and trading enterprises "operate in a  diversified way but adopting one line as main line of business,"  and of "integrating domestic and external trade, while making  production, supply, and marketing one well-coordinated process,"  the gates of the SEZ will be opened wide, "commodities are  welcome from any direction, and people are welcome whether in  state-run, collective-run, or individually operated  enterprises," all may participate in the market, to engage in  fair competition and free trading. On a broad scale, main  agricultural production districts in outlying areas are being  interested in setting up commercial enterprises in the SEZ, so  that commodities from all directions may flow into the SEZ's  markets and continuously increase effective supplies to the SEZ.    Fourth, exploiting to the fullest the advantageous location  of the Shenzhen SEZ for export trade, developing import and  export trade, aiming at a balance of supplies and demand in the  market. Shenzhen is separate from the hub of international  trade, Hong Kong, by only a bridge, and the SEZ has a unique  advantage for earning foreign exchange by exporting fresh  foodstuff to Hong Kong. At the same time, it is also in a  position to obtain through Hong Kong most rapidly supplies of  important commodities from the international market and  information on price fluctuations. The SEZ can be flexible and  selective in its import and export trade, so as to achieve a  balance of supplies and demand in its market. For instance,  early in 1989, the grain market became disturbed, and No 3 rice,  even at as high as 160 yuan per 50 kilo, was hard to come by. At  that time the SEZ immediately imported rice from Thailand and  stabilized the grain market.    3. Using rules and regulations as means of effectively  regulating and controlling market prices. From the viewpoint of  administrative control, market economy is an economy operating  within a legal system. The Shenzhen SEZ has therefore formulated  a complete set of rules and regulations operationally effective  in its system of wholesale and retail markets.    First, the SEZ's rules and regulations for the  administrative  control of wholesale markets. 1) Operators must register and  display their license when operating wholesale markets. 2)  Wholesale business in agricultural products must be transacted  inside the market. 3) Market control organs must daily publish  the commodity supply situation, the prices of the various  commodities in transactions the day before, so as to provide  price information for buyers and sellers. 4) Set prices must be  clearly marked out in the market. None other than legally  prescribed standard scales and weights must be used.  Fraudulently cornering the market, hoarding and speculating,  adulterating and falsifying, and the deliberate forcing up of  prices are strictly prohibited. Prices must accord with the  quality offered, competition must be fair, and trading must be  free. 5) Operators must pay taxes and administrative charges  according to regulations. Invoices are prescribed, and invoices  must accompany all commodities transacted, to provide, for later  linkage with the retail sales, a basis for the determination of  retail prices, according to the system of having a rate for the  differential between wholesale and retail prices.    Second, the SEZ's method of administrative control of retail  markets and its system of law-consistent trading operations. The  SEZ's policy is to treat state-run, collective-run, and  individually operated businesses equal and without  discrimination. 1) The trading system is to be one of openness.  The SEZ prescribes that every retail trader shall install  himself/herself and conduct trade within his own vendor's stall.  He/she shall openly display the quantity and quality of goods  and clearly mark their prices. Transactions shall be fair and in  observance of the law, and all trading shall be courteous and  open to supervision. 2) The trade control system shall be well  documented and conducted with proper bookkeeping. When retail  traders bring good bought at the wholesale market to the retail  market, they must have documentation of legal transactions, and  they shall fix the retail sales prices according to the  prescribed rate for the differential between wholesale and  retail prices. They must also strictly keep accounts of all  transactions according to proper accounting procedure. The  accounting system shall enable checks as to whether the traders  have observed all legal provisions. 3) Instituting a system of  "cards of reputable conduct." To ensure fairness of  transactions, and to guard against adulterations and  falsifications, short weighing and arbitrary forcing up of  prices, every retail sales stall has to prepare at the time of  any transaction a "card of reputable conduct," showing the type  of commodity sold, its quantity, quality, unit price, and total  amount involved, to present to the buyer and the city official  in charge for examination and verification, as proof that vendor  has conformed to law. (4) Instituting an administrative control  system by means of recording negative marks for violating rules  or regulations. Rules and regulations, as well as penalties for  violations, shall be publicly displayed inside the market.  Violators shall be penalized by recording negative marks. The  SEZ is carrying out its comparative appraisals in an enlightened  way: those who had no negative marks during one month are  vendors of excellence, those who had only one to two negative  marks are good vendors, those with three to five negative marks  are vendors due to receive a warning, those with five to 10  negative marks shall be temporarily closed down and undergo  rectification, those who have accumulated 25 or more negative  marks during the year shall have their license revoked and be  expelled from the market. 5) The SEZ instituted a "target  achievement" administrative control system. This is a mechanism  of self-control of administrative control personnel. The system  of job responsibility applies to personnel of every rank  enforcing basic administrative control of industrial and  commercial commodity prices in the SEZ. A comparative appraisal  of "target achievements" shall furthermore be conducted every  month, quarter, and year, and administrative market control and  service achievements shall be linked to rewards, penalties, and  promotions.    4. Using administrative measures to control the rate for the  differential, according to the principle of giving due  consideration to production prices. This is a kind of new type  of administrative control method which effectively regulates and  controls market prices by applying the principle of adding the  average rate of profit to the cost price. By a rational  determination of the rate for the differential allowed between  the prices at which the goods are brought in and the prices they  are sold for, the Shenzhen SEZ is regulating and controlling for  a certain time and for certain special commodities the rate for  the differential between wholesale and retail prices.    This kind of control of the rate for the price differential  reflects the government's conscious application of the  production price (plus average profit) principle, arrived at by  making full use of the function of market regulation. It  enables, on the one hand, effecting changes according to the  changes in costs and charges, and, on the other hand, enables  formation of rational purchase, wholesale, and retail prices  under the restraints of market supply and demand. It establishes  a harmonious coordination of profit distribution as between the  various links of production, wholesale, and retail. It has also,  as a consequence, resolved the irrational situation of "having  people at both ends crying, while the middleman laughs" and of  having exorbitant prices being demanded, a situation that had  arisen after the traditional prices had become irrational, had  been decontrolled, and allowed to freely adjust. It has also  enabled control of prices at an appropriate level.    In short, after several years of hard work in the economic  field, and exploratory efforts in the field of socialist market  economy, the Shenzhen SEZ has achieved excellent results in its  government's regulation and control of prices.</p>

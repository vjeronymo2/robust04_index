For almost eight years, the person in charge of  counterintelligence against the Soviet KGB was passing his  country's topmost secrets to his Moscow masters -- for which he  received from them more than $1.5 million.    Although on the previous evening, this prime news item did  not leave the television screens, and the life of the married  couple, in which not only the husband but also the wife were CIA  staffers, had been subjected to thorough and almost  month-by-month analysis, something substantial was added  Wednesday. Citing official sources, radio stations reported  that Aldrich Ames' activity had led, in particular, to the  tragic deaths not so long ago of two Russian citizens who were  CIA agents working for the United States. They were executed  for treason -- without trial or investigation.    The U.S. President repeated once again that he regards this  as a very serious case and that the scale of the damage to the  government is not yet clear, although it is already known to be  great. Clinton said that he has not spoken about this with  Russian President B. Yeltsin, so as to give the Russian  authorities time to consider an official response.    According to B. Clinton's statements, the special feature of  the case consists in the fact that it is a question not of an  "ordinary spy" but of a CIA veteran with 31 years' service. It  was possible to understand from the President's retort that  recruitment of a high official is a violation of certain accords.    The fact that there have been accords of this kind between  the two governments is indirectly borne out by the fact that  over the past two years quite a few U.S. counterintelligence  staffers have been moved to the sphere of combating drugs,  including A. Ames himself. It was possible to conclude from the  comments of one former State Department staffer that the  Russians had promised at a high level -- if not the presidential  level, then very close to it -- to change the rules of the game  and to get away from the usual espionage of the "Cold War"  style. And now this turn of events....    President Clinton said at the news conference that there are  at least two reasons to demand appropriate actions from Russia.  The first is already known -- the recruitment of a high  official. The President said of the second reason only that he  cannot speak of it yet, but he will when the time comes.    U.S. Secretary of State W. Christopher, who usually treads  delicately and avoids harsh statements, endeavored to appear as  fierce as possible when he maintained that the United States  will never be able to reconcile itself to "this way of acting by  Russia." In the absence of the ambassador (V. Lukin quit this  post after being elected to that of chairman of a Duma  committee, and Yu. Vorontsov has not yet completed the thorny  path of being confirmed), the young diplomat V.I.  Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad interim, is being  summoned to the State Department several times a day.    Jim Collins, an expert on Russia and the former No. 2 man  at the U.S. Embassy on Ulitsa Chaykovskogo, has insistently  recommended, so certain sources maintain, that Moscow refrain  from the traditional countermeasure -- the expulsion of their  present CIA resident agent. Moreover, it is proposed that  Russian intelligence voluntarily recall or "call to order" those  of its staffers who had contacts with Aldrich Ames "under  diploamtic cover."    One high-ranking State Department staffer said: Immediate  and voluntary "special steps by Russia" will make it possible to  avoid the serious threat hanging over bilateral relations.    Commentators point out, however, that "the sunny  relationship  between Bill and Boris has receded into the Bosnian shade."  Clinton himself, however carefully he chose his terms, made a  very transparent allusion to the likelihood of a revision of  "the whole policy (with regard to Yeltsin) which we have long  followed."    The U.S. mass media regard the Duma's proclaimed pardon for  the participants in two procommunist actions as a threat to  Yeltsin and the reform process. This eases the bitterness  somewhat and elicits some sympathy with the Russian president.    The opposition in Congress, however, is stepping up pressure  on the administration. Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader,  has accused Clinton of placating the Kremlin for too long.  Senator DeConcini, who once advocated giving Russia broad  assistance, has now abruptly changed his stance.    Why is it that we Americans are indignant at Russia and are  threatening to stop aid if we ourselves are doing the same thing  against them? This question was asked over the telephone by a  viewer of an evening television program entirely devoted to  examining Mr. and Mrs. Ames. The commentator's reply, which  followed at once, reflects the views of very many people in the  United States. The gist of it was that the Russians are making  fools of the Americans and abusing their kindness. By  allocating billions in aid for Russia the United States is, as  it were, paying for Russian espionage against itself and  maintaining traitors with taxpayers' money.    Aldrich Ames and his wife, who appeared before a judge  Tuesday, have not repented or asked for leniency. Maria, the  41-year-old wife of the former leader of counterintelligence  directed against the USSR, comes from a well-off family. The  Ames' attorneys will most likely ascribe the large purchases,  which are far in excess of what a cadre CIA staffer can afford  on his wages, to her family means.    Neither A. Ames' place of birth nor the educational  institution from which he graduated have yet been divulged by  the CIA leadership. But Aldrich's father is known also to have  worked for this department and also been an intelligence officer  but, unlike his son, to have been a "good guy."    U.S. officials and mass media are accusing Russian  television  and newspapers of concealing from the Russian public the  seriousness of this case and the arguments of the U.S.  Administration.    If the charge against the Ames is corroborated in court,  they  are both threatened with life imprisonment and a fine of  $250,000.</p>

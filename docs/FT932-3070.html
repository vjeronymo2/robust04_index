			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warm summit may disguise cool relations round table - Ralph Atkins considers prospects for Ulster as the British and Irish leaders meet today TEMPERAMENTALLY similar and driven by the same politics of reasonableness, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, meet in London today to search once more for progress on Northern Ireland. Paradoxically, the closer the relationship between the two governments, the further apart seem the province's nationalist and unionist political parties. In spite of the governments' efforts, attempts to restart round-table political talks have stalled. Originally expected this month or next, a resumption is now unlikely before the autumn. Nobody in London or Dublin predicts a breakthrough today. In large part, the deadlock is due to Unionists' fears. Since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement allowed Dublin to have a small, but symbolically important say in the affairs of the north, Northern Ireland's majority population has seen the Conservative party drift away from the Unionist cause. British policy - that Northern Ireland is part of the UK as long a majority of its population wishes to stay - has not encouraged Unionists to believe its constitutional position is safe. The warmth between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, with none of the testy inter-governmental exchanges that often characterised the 1980s, does not help calm suspicions. The hope that originally teased Unionists into the first set of round-table talks in 1990 - that the 1985 agreement would be torn up under a new London/Dublin/Belfast deal - has evaporated. Now the Rev Ian Paisley, populist Democratic Unionist party leader, is refusing to enter talks until the republic renounces its constitutional claim on the north. Mr Paisley is also irked by talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Sinn Fein. With local elections last month proving disappointing for the more moderate Ulster Unionist party, its leader Mr James Molyneaux has also hardened his position, complaining that uncertainty created by talks involving Dublin is costing lives. His argument has a robust logic; Loyalist terrorists are proving as deadly as the IRA, while last week's Opsahl report on the province, by an independent commission, said Britain's reluctance to set out a blueprint was adding to instability and distrust. British ministers respond that a history of failed political initiatives shows there is no alternative to the search for widely acceptable agreement from within the province. However Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is drawing up 'sketch plans' for new arrangements in the province, to replace the present 'direct rule' from Westminster. The initiative, agreed against the advice of some in the Northern Ireland Office, followed the last intervention in Northern Ireland by Mr Major in April. Sir Patrick's colleagues believe he is philosophical about the intransigence of nationalists and Unionists, judging that solutions may only evolve over years, rather than months. In that long run, prime ministerial summits will not make much difference either. An extra Pounds 24m is to be spent on the economic regeneration programme in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday. The cash will allow 30 new schemes, including a crime-prevention project for north and west Belfast. It brings to Pounds 124m the amount set aside for the Making Belfast Work initiative aimed at boosting economic development and education in some of the city's most troubled and deprived areas.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Marginal borrowers could be crowded out, says OECD MARGINAL borrowers could be crowded out of the international capital markets by borrowing needs of sovereign and corporate issuers in OECD countries. The considerable sums expected to be raised over the next few months could result in a flight to quality rather than a generalised tightening of borrowing terms, suggests the OECD in its latest Financial Market Trends publication. Capital raising is still growing strongly: at Dollars 439bn, facilities arranged over the period January-September 1992 were 16 per cent higher than over the same period in 1991. Until early summer, the main source of borrowing was the large-scale refinancing needs of sovereign and corporate borrowers. Since then, however, the need to replenish foreign currency reserves has given renewed urgency to the raising of foreign capital. The demand for capital from borrowers in OECD countries was some Dollars 50bn higher than in 1991, accounting for 88 per cent of the total. Demand for longer-term financing from Latin American issuers which have regained access to the private international markets is described as robust, totalling some Dollars 15bn, but there has been a slowdown in fund-raising by Asian and Middle Eastern borrowers. While the equity-related bond market continued to suffer from the lack of investor interest in the wake of losses experienced since the middle of last year, placements of international equities grew rapidly to around Dollars 20bn to end-September, despite the turbulence in the major stock markets. The international and foreign bonds markets have reverted to a period of more sustainable expansion. New bonds issued in the first nine months of 1992 totalled Dollars 249bn, up 9 per cent from what was already a record level. New issuing activity grew by nearly 30 per cent in 1991. Straight bond issues are up 12 per cent year on year, notwithstanding the recent sharp fall of new issues in several European currency sectors. The US dollar benefited most from the trend to reallocate funds in favour of safe haven currencies.</p>

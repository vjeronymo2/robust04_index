			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Wilton plans Chinese-speaking channel The Wilton Group, a UK-quoted company, is planning to launch a satellite channel for the Chinese-speaking communities of western Europe, writes Raymond Snoddy. The channel will be broadcast on the Astra satellite and will be a subscription service. Wilton will take about 80 per cent of the Chinese Channel. The remainder will be owned by the Shaw Media Corporation of Hong Kong. A majority of the Chinese language programming will be supplied by Television Broadcasts, the Hong Kong broadcaster. The aim is to begin a limited service next month and build up to 12 hours a day by the autumn. The company, to be based in London, will broadcast predominantly in Cantonese, although there will also be programmes in Mandarin and Vietnamese. The service will be aimed at the estimated 850,000 Chinese living in Europe, where the main population centres are the UK, France and the Netherlands. Wilton is planning to change its name to Cinecom and concentrate on the media, following a substantial investment by Mr Clive Ng, a businessman of Malaysian background.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "President Promotes Idea of </F> Signing Document on Civil Peace"]    [Text] On the morning of 10 March, people representing the  most diverse institutions of society -- from political parties  to power structures -- gathered in B. Yeltsin's office in the  Kremlin. Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin was there, as were  Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksiy II; M. Miytukov and  V. Viktorov, deputy chairmen of the two chambers of parliament;  Ye. Gaydar, leader of "Russia's Choice"; V. Zorkaltsev,  representative of "Communists of Russia"; N. Vitruk, chief of  the Constitutional Court; and representatives of trade unions  and public organizations. The president assembled this audience  in order to seek the entire spectrum of views on a very  important idea he has been plugging of late -- the idea of civil  peace and accord.    "We are getting information from all over Russia," the  president said, "that people support the proposal I put in my  message to parliament on the signing of a document on civil  peace and accord. Everyone must see that the time for  confrontation is past. I am proposing an organized discussion  today of the question of preparing such a document, on the basis  of which it would be possible to unite all political forces in  society for the sake of the main goal -- peace and tranquillity  in Russia. In fact, irrespective of our different views, we are  all patriots. This should not be a battlefield. If there are  differences on other questions they must be resolved through  negotiations. A short document of five pages or so could be  prepared within two weeks, and then we could meet again to find  the mechanism whereby as many participants as possible would  sign it."    If the main political forces were to sign the document  (memorandum or charter?) on civil peace and accord, all  potential instigators of social tensions would find their hands  tied, since people would be unlikely to oppose the idea of  social accord publicly. Whether it is possible or not is  another matter. It is hard to imagine a binding rather than  merely cosmetic document suiting parties of different  ideological hues. While making pledges, they would inevitably  start making demands as a condition of signing the document --  from the creation of a coalition government to the  reestablishment of the USSR. Such is the spread of views at the  moment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  stated that President Husni Mubarak and Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat discussed the situation in the occupied Arab  territories and the impact of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque's incident  on the peace process.    In a statement following the conclusion of the  Mubarak-'Arafat talks this evening, Musa said the two presidents  also discussed the issues of settlements and Palestinian  security in the occupied territories.    Musa said the security issue concerns not only the Israelis  but both the Arabs and Israelis. Therefore, from now on we  cannot speak about Israeli security without talking about  Palestinian security on an equal footing.    Musa explained that the demonstrations that were staged in  Jerusalem today to protest the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident  supported peace. They definitely encourage and give the  impression that forces desiring peace from the Palestinian and  Israeli sides can play a role in encouraging an agreement.    Musa said: We have never said that all Israelis are  settlers. But we have spoken about these extremist and  aggressive gunmen who commit crimes against the Palestinians in  the occupied territories. This is why we have spoken about  disarming the outlaw elements in some organizations.    Asked if the Palestinians insist that the UN Security  Council  issue a resolution providing protection for the Palestinian  people, Musa said the Security Council resolution should refer  to the security and protection of the Palestinians. Moreover,  the Israeli Government is dutybound to take measures to protect  the Palestinians from the settlers' attacks and the terrorist  organizations inside the settlements.    On whether Israel is prepared to accept the presence of  international observers in the occupied territories, Musa said  there is a basis for this in the Declaration of Principles, in  which Israel accepted a foreign presence between them and the  Palestinians. This indicates that this idea is not ruled out.  However, what is being discussed now at the Security Council is  the protection of the Palestinians in the rest of the occupied  territories, that is in the West Bank as well.    Musa added that we are speaking about a framework during the  next two weeks envisaging the disarming of the settlements,  protecting the Palestinians, and disbanding the terrorist  organizations. There must be decisive Israeli measures because,  under international law, Israel is responsible for the  territories under its military occupation.    Asked about the statements by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher following his meeting with Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and  whether these statements indicate a U.S. conviction for the need  to provide protection for the Palestinians, Musa expressed his  appreciation of the stands of the United States and Europe and  of their awareness of these considerations. He stressed that  there is a worldwide understanding of this issue.    On the date of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian  talks, Musa said setting a date is not being discussed now  although the negotiating track still exists.    Asked if the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident will make it  difficult to convince the Arab people to continue the peace  process, Musa said that the crime that was committed in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque provoked Arab people everywhere, including  the Egyptian people and Government. We are all together in this  and are angry over what happened.</p>

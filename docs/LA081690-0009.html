			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> The Plot Thickens: As far as John Frew, 25, is concerned, science-fiction  writer Ray Bradbury has had his day in the sun. Frew has started a petition  drive in Waukegan, Ill., to restore his great-great-grandfather's name to a  park renamed for native son Bradbury. The site for years was called Powell's  Park, in honor of 19th-Century Mayor John F. Powell. Frew said he doesn't  object to honoring Bradbury, but thinks a library or other landmark would be  more appropriate.  </P> <P> Weighing In: The National Assn. for the Defense of Fat Acceptance is coming to  the aid of Regina Elizabeth Guy, 25, in her battle to stop Maryland from  suspending her driver's license. The state claims Guy's 367 pounds force her to  drive from the center of the front seat, operating the accelerator and brake  with her left foot. Guy says it's discrimination. NADFA plans to demonstrate at  a Friday hearing in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Who's Laughing Now?: Vice President Dan Quayle may still be No. 1 on the  Democratic Party joke list, but it's the Republicans who are laughing all the  way to the bank. So far, Quayle has raised more than $12 million for the party  since he became vice president. One GOP insider said Quayle's fund-raising  skills stem partly from the attacks on him. "Some come just to see if he's as  bad as the press says."  </P> <P> Squashed: If the Guinness Book of World Records had a category for "Offending  People With a Zucchini," Jodi Wubben, 19, would win. Her sculpture, "The  Incident," was ordered off the Larimer County Fairgrounds in Loveland, Colo.,  on the grounds it was "tasteless." Wubben entered the piece in a "Zany Zucchini  Day" contest to draw attention to her claim that her father, Don, was hit by a  sheriff's deputy July 22. Her display depicted a zucchini with a club standing  over a fallen vegetable.  </P></p>

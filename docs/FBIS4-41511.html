			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F> by Nikolay Nazarovich on 25 June; place not given: "I Am  Grateful to the Voters"]    [Text] [Nazarovich] Alyaksandr Hryhoravich, how would you  explain such a tremendous, sensational lead over your rivals?    [Lukashenka] What took place was a sensation only for those  who did not want to see the truth. For our team, however, this  was a disappointment, because we had counted on more votes and a  victory already in the first round. I believe that this is not  a sensation for the people either. The impoverished, destitute  people for the first time had an opportunity to elect a man from  their circles. So the people expressed their views. I would  like to show my gratitude to everyone who voted in my support.  This is first. Second, I believe that all the best, the most  suitable Supreme Soviet deputies found themselves in my ranks.    [Nazarovich] How are you going to work on the second round  of the presidential election -- to unmask corrupted officials or  to present a creative program?    [Lukashenka] I was simply responding to all those assaults  and mud that was thrown at me. Regarding the unmasking, I will  again repeat: Those who are involved in corruption must not  remain in power. After all, all who were debunked by our  commission have not repented. They are ready to give up  everything, in order to complete construction of their houses.  Yet, can one do that at the current wages? This means that the  people are again being plundered.    Regarding the second part of your question, during these two  weeks we will pay special attention to explaining the creative  potential of our program. We have set up three primary  directions -- curbing inflation and price hikes, fighting  corruption, and establishing close ties between Belarus and  Russia. We have currently prepared a package of issues  concerning resolutions to economic problems, in order to stop  decline in production as early as in six months, to put  enterprises into operation, to return fired people to their old  work places, and to create new work places. We want to do that  with the help of Russia, which, I hope, will meet us half-way.    I will not retreat from the electoral battle, and I will not  withdraw my candidacy, even under the most extreme threats  against me.</p>

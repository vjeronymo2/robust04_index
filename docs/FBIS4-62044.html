			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- Today's State Duma debate on the  defense budget has been marked by sharp exchanges, and the final  figure for Russia's military expenditure has not yet been  defined, ITAR-TASS was told by Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobev,  head of the Defense Ministry's Military Budget and Finance Main  Directorate. He said the difference between the sum being  requested and the sum on offer is so great that the armed  forces' continued existence is at stake. For example, the  Russian Defense Ministry is asking for 87 trillion rubles, while  the Ministry of Finance is insisting on allocating just 37  trillion rubles.    According to the Defense Ministry, the Finance Ministry has  pared spending on the military to the bone. Arrears have been  run up on all major expenditure items. The military is now in  the position of having insufficient funds, not only to pay  salaries, but also to buy food and equipment and to pay its  bills. Lengthy delays in issuing servicemen's pay packets are  now routine.</p>

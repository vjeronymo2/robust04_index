			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. STARK'S COMMENTS ABOUT LOUIS SULLIVAN  </P> <P> In regards to the remarks of Rep. Stark calling Sullivan "a disgrace to his  position and to his race":  </P> <P> As a physician, I am familiar with previous derogatory statements by Rep.  Stark.  </P> <P> One of his favorite ways of referring to doctors is "those bastards."  </P> <P> I submit that Rep. Stark is a real "hater" and that he truly despises anyone  who fails to support his positions.  </P> <P> I suspect that he is furious that any black would not only disagree with him,  but would dare to be a physician also.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. CLAY, MD  </P> <P> Santa Maria  </P></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / French Treasury chief to head Bank of France MR Jean-Claude Trichet, a supporter of a strong franc and tough anti-inflationary policies, was yesterday appointed governor of the Bank of France. He succeeds Mr Jacques de Larosiere, who was elected last month as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Trichet, currently head of the French Treasury, the most powerful financial position in the civil service, will be the first governor of an independent French central bank. Under legislation expected to be implemented later this year after the final ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union, the Bank of France is granted autonomy in the formulation of monetary policy. The new governor, who will take up his post on Thursday, will also face the challenge of determining French monetary policy in the wake of the recent crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. The crisis broke the close link between the French franc and the D-Mark, a central element of French monetary policy in recent years. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said that Mr Trichet was 'the right man for the job' because of his experience of public and monetary affairs. Mr Trichet has had a long career in the French finance ministry and is head of the EC's monetary committee. Since 1985 he has been chairman of the Paris Club of western creditor nations. Bankers and economists in Paris said that Mr Trichet's appointment had been expected. They expected that the stability of the French franc, the maintenance of low inflation and the gradual reduction of interest rates would remain the objective of the central bank and the government. Mr Trichet's departure from the head of the Treasury, has prompted a reshuffle at the top of France's financial administration. His post is to be taken by Mr Christian Noyer, the director of Mr Alphandery's private office. Mr Noyer, 42, has a similar background to Mr Trichet, who is 50. Both are graduates of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for many top government officials and both have spent most of their careers in the financial administration. Mr Trichet also served as the head of the private office of Mr Balladur, the current prime minister, when he was economy minister in 1986. Mr Noyer will be replaced in the private office of Mr Alphandery by Mr Patrice Vial. Mr Vial, previously chief forecaster in the economics ministry, is director general of Banque Pallas-Stern, the French merchant bank. Troubleshooter, Page 3</p>

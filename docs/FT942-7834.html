			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Apology sought from MP over bill Lady Olga Maitland, the Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, came under further pressure yesterday to apologise for her role in wrecking the backbench bill which sought to establish new rights for the disabled. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told the Commons she had made representations to Lady Olga. The MP has recently returned to Westminster after a visit with a parliamentary delegation to Malawi. Ms Liz Lynne, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on health, asked whether Lady Olga was prepared to apologise for 'misleading the House about the drafting of amendments tabled in her name' to the disability (civil rights) bill. Lady Olga, who was not in her place in the Commons chamber when the issue was raised yesterday, had insisted in earlier exchanges that she was responsible for the amendments. She said: 'I sought consultation, but it would be totally unfair to suggest that they came from any other source.' Opposition MPs claim that her amendments were among those drafted by parliamentary counsel referred to by Mr Nicholas Scott, minister responsible for the disabled, when he apologised for misleading the House during the controversy over the bill. Referring to a demonstration staged earlier in the day, Miss Boothroyd said some disabled people were 'unfortunately encouraged by some members of the House to crawl up the steps at St Stephen's entrance for the benefit of the media'. She reaffirmed that the disabled were able to gain access to the House through New Palace Yard.</p>

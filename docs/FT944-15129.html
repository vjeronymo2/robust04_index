			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: French industrial output rises French industrial production rose 2.3 per cent in July and August compared with June, according to figures released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office. The increase was stronger than expected by private economists and eased fears of a slowdown in France's recovery from recession. Insee traditionally puts data from July and August together because many companies close for summer holidays. Figures from the period are treated with caution because of a high level of seasonal adjustment. None the less, the figures, showing a year-on-year increase of 5.2 per cent in industrial output and a 6.9 per cent rise in manufacturing output, appeared to confirm official predictions of continued healthy growth. John Ridding, Paris German producer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month, after remaining unchanged in August. Producer prices rose 0.6 per cent year-on-year. Dutch non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to an average of 484,000 in July-September (7.6 per cent of the labour force) from 421,000 (6.6 per cent) a year ago. Swedish retail sales rose 0.3 per cent in August compared to August 1993 after a 4.7 per cent decline the month before.</p>

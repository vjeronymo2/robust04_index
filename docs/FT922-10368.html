			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hungarian Credit Bank slides 50% HUNGARIAN Credit Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, announced that pre-tax profits had fallen 50 per cent last year as bankruptcy among its corporate borrowers spread. Pre-tax profits slipped to Ft4.6bn (Dollars 58m) in 1991 as Hungarian Credit Bank set aside a record Ft4.7bn in provisions against bad debts. The bank, together with the other three large state-owned commercial institutions, increased provisions in response to a new banking act allowing such charges to be written off against tax. They are also trying to clear their balance sheets in advance of the privatisation of the sector, which was recently approved by the government. However, bankers pointed out that Hungarian Credit Bank had not provisioned as aggressively as the rest of the banking sector had.</p>

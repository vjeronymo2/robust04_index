			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Marquess nets Pounds 20m from art clear-out The Marquess of Cholmondeley, the owner of two of the nation's finest houses, Houghton Hall in Norfolk and Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire, this week gained more than Pounds 20m after selling 146 lots of furniture, pictures and works of art. The money, from an auction through Christie's, will pay tax bills and be used for the maintenance of Houghton Hall, from where the items came. The saleroom had cautiously expected to raise Pounds 15m but few were surprised that this, the most important clear-out from a British stately home since Mentmore in 1977, did much better. There was something for everyone, provided they were extremely rich. The best endowed international museums, such as the Getty at Malibu, would be entranced by Jean-Francois de Troy's conversation piece of the 1730s, La Lecture de Moliere. It sold for a record Pounds 3.9m to Mr Simon Dickinson, the dealer, who obviously has a client in mind. Lovers of the ornate would have gone for the ormolu mounted porcelain vases  -one pair with gilt lions as handles sold for a record Pounds 1.92m, far above Christie's top estimate of Pounds 600,000. Two pairs of chairs commissioned in the 1720s by Sir Robert Walpole, the first prime minister and creator of Houghton, from William Kent, the leading designer of the day, sold for Pounds 219,500 and Pounds 397,500. This seemed small beer compared with the Pounds 881,500 paid for a grander pair of George I armchairs, or the Pounds 1.54m for a pair of Louis XIV marriage chests made by Boulle. A Rubens oil sketch was bought by Agnew for Pounds 1.76m and a pair of gold mounted ewers sold for Pounds 1.26m. With the rooms packed with bidders rather than spectators, with dealers recovering their confidence and voices, and with more than20 telephone lines pumping in demand from overseas, the art market seemed to have left recession behind. The marquess secured a record Pounds 21.268m from a dispersal from a British stately home, although Christie's will keep just over 10 per cent. The result was predictable. Works of art of this quality and provenance rarely come on the market. What was more unexpected was Lord Cholmondeley's decision to sell. Less than three years ago he relinquished the jewel of Houghton, Holbein's portrait of a lady with a squirrel, and a Gainsborough self portrait to the National Gallery for about Pounds 12m. This should have enabled him to pay off death duties, provide for his sisters, and secure the future of the hall. But Houghton costs a reputed Pounds 500,000 a year to keep going. Lord Cholmondeley looked at various solutions to this persistent financial haemorrhage. Discussions with an American university to convert it to a study centre came to nothing. The bright idea of selling the furnishings to the nation for Pounds 10m, with the proviso that they remained in situ in the Hall, was scuppered by the Treasury, although Lord Cholmondeley hopes to avoid liability on Thursday's windfall by offering other immovable items to the nation in lieu of tax. A grand auction seemed the easiest answer. Most of the items offered came from the attic - it was reckoned that Sir Philip Sassoon's French furniture did not gel with the William Kent decor. Lord Cholmondeley's pruning could be justified as returning the house to the time of Walpole. When it reopens next year the gaps will be scarcely noticed.</p>

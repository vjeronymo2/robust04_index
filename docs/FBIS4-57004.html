			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Court Justice Carlos Gaviria </F> Diaz by program director Dario Arizmendi; place not given; from  the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] Dr. Carlos Gaviria Diaz is the  judge who proposed the Constitutional Court's ruling lifting  penalties on the consumption of personal doses of certain drugs.  [passage omitted] Good morning, Dr. Gaviria Diaz.    [Gaviria Diaz] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] What do you think of the controversy unleashed  in the country and the witch hunt that has apparently begun  against certain members of the Constitutional Court? This witch  hunt is apparently against the judges who studied two articles  of the law having to do with lifting penalties on the  consumption of personal doses of certain types of drugs?    [Gaviria Diaz] Dario, you have clearly said that it is a  true witch hunt. Actually, the most unfortunate thing about  this is the fact that the mass of opinion is entirely emotional;  that is, it does not really understand the scope of the ruling  or is not even familiar with the ruling. Actually, this mass of  opinion is jeopardizing the Constitutional Court, specifically  the judges who approved lifting penalties. It makes us targets  of very emotional reaction from the most fanatical groups.    It is surprising that this type of reaction was begun by the  president of the Republic and that the candidates --  particularly those who have the best options for winning the  Presidency of the Republic -- are emulating this radical  prohibition in order to curry public favor. Thus, I am very  surprised about this reaction, but not because I did not think  such an important ruling would entail challengers in the  country. I am surprised by the sources of these challenges and  what they are doing. They are encouraging the most destructive,  emotional, fanatical, and dangerous reactions.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, in addition to the issues  broached by the president of the Republic and by some  candidates, the most outstanding aspect just a few hours  following the announcement of the Constitutional Court's ruling  was the statements made by some judges who voted against the  ruling. They openly criticized the ruling, and they even  encouraged the public to do so.    [Gaviria Diaz] I do not want to adopt the same attitude they  did. I deeply respect their points of view, which are different  from ours, because everyone is entitled to his own opinion.  However, I do regret they do not have that feeling of cohesion  with the court. The rules of the game were observed, and once  the ruling is approved the ruling belongs to the entire court  and not just to some justices.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, when will the entire ruling be  announced?    [Gaviria Diaz] The entire ruling will be announced next  week, when Court President Jorge Arango returns from President  Mandela's inauguration.    [Arizmendi] As far as you know -- because you are the author  of the proposal -- will this ruling take into consideration  certain restrictions as the president of the Republic  respectfully suggested when he delivered a radio message before  knowing the full text of the ruling?    [Gaviria Diaz] There is a total lack of knowledge of what  the mission of the court is, and I want to be very clear about  this: People are acting as if the court had arbitrarily decided  to lift penalties on drug consumption, as if we were acting as  legislators, or deciding on something that simply pleased us.  That is not the mission of the court. The mission of the court  is to compare and decide if the contents of a law clash or not  with the Constitution. In the event the court determines these  contents clash with the Constitution, then the court is obliged  to withdraw it, regardless of national or international reaction.    In the second place, it is being said that now children and  pregnant women are going to be using drugs, that drugs will be  used in schools, and so forth. Dario, it is legal to drink  liquor in Colombia, but I ask you: Is liquor being consumed in  the schools? It is legal to smoke tobacco in Colombia, but are  people smoking in church? With this, I am clearly saying that  the court does not have to go into these details. The ruling  simply makes general statements to this effect, but police  regulations and other institutional regulations will restrict  and control the consumption of drugs, just as it is does with  the consumption of alcohol and tobacco.

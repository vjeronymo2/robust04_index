			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Pakistan 'has atomic bomb' Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's opposition leader, yesterday unleashed what could be the beginning of another round of controversy over the country's secret nuclear programme. Addressing a public rally in the Pakistan-controlled state of Kashmir, Mr Sharif announced the country possessed an atomic bomb, according to the Pakistan Press International news agency. The claim was immediately denied by a foreign ministry spokesman in Islamabad. He restated the government position that it had acquired the capability to make nuclear weapons but had taken a policy decision not to do so and restricted the use of nuclear technology to peaceful purposes like energy. 'We have the technological capability but we have taken a conscious decision not to acquire nuclear weapons,' he said. Some officials said Mr Sharif's statement could be meant to embarrass the government both home and abroad. In recent years, relations with a number of western countries, especially the US, have been strained over the nuclear issue. Washington cut off its large economic aid and weapon supply programme to Pakistan in 1990, following charges that Islamabad had acquired the capability to produce nuclear weapons. A Dollars 1.4bn deal involving the sale of up to 71 F-16 fighter aircraft is still on hold, after the Bush administration stopped delivery under pressure from the non-proliferation lobby. Pakistan has refused to open its nuclear facilities for international inspection on the grounds that any such move must also involve India, its neighbour and arch rival. Other officials said Mr Sharif's statement could be linked to an intensifying government-opposition rift. He plans to begin a nationwide campaign by train next month in an effort to mobilise support for the government's removal. George Graham adds from Washington: The US remains concerned about nuclear proliferation in the south Asian region, and is continuing its efforts to bring about a cap on nuclear programmes there. 'We believe that both India and Pakistan could assemble a limited number of nuclear weapons in a limited time,' a State Department official said.</p>

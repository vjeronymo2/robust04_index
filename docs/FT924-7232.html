			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / French face transport strikes A wave of strikes will disrupt France's public transport this week, halting the Paris Metro at rush hours and disrupting trains and airlines, according to the unions, Reuter reports. Metro drivers are protesting at changes which they say will mean longer working hours. The Communist-led CGT union has called a 24-hour rail strike for Thursday and another a week later to demand wage rises and protest against planned job cuts. Public transport unions have called a 24-hour strike on November 27 in all provincial towns to back wage claims. Pilots and ground staff at Air France are also to stop work on November 27 in protest at plans to cut 5,000 jobs over three years.</p>

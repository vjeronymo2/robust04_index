			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters asked what constitutes ``satisfactory progress'' in order for a participant to continue to receive NRP's, and how often this determination must be made. The Department expects a grant application to define a system to address this issue, based upon the training to be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter believed that the wording in the proposed rule, that grantees must provide needs-related payments, seemed less definitive and suggested stating whether the projects will be funded without providing for payments to any participant. Another commenter suggested having States check the needs-related payment policies of SDA's before initiating the needs-related payments requirement. Two commenters suggested using the same eligibility criteria for needs-related payments for CAETA as are used in other title III programs. Two commenters suggested allowing State or local flexibility in determining who receives payments and payments policy. Another commenter suggested that it would be confusing to make the needs-related payment rate applicable to the weekly unemployment compensation payment level or to the poverty level, which the commenter believed would limit the number of eligible individuals in classroom training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is unable to accede to the requests of these commenters. Needs-related payments are discretionary under title III of JTPA, and grantees have some flexibility in providing such payments. However, under section 326(c)(2) of the Act, CAETA funds must be used to provide needs-related payments in accordance with the requirements set forth at section 326(f) of the Act. Similarly, section 325A(i) of the Act provides that in DDP programs, needs-related payments must be made in accordance with section 326(f). The Act requires that the Secretary prescribe regulations with respect to needs-related payments for CAETA and DDP. The needs-related payments regulations at &sect;631.65(c) follow the statutory requirements at section 326(f) of the Act. Because of these statutory requirements of CAETA and DDP, grantees have little discretion and must provide needs-related payments in the manner set forth in &sect;631.65(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested developing regulations that require grantees to document reasons for denial of payments and give opportunities for participants who had payments suspended to seek redress up to and including the federal level. The Department agrees that grantees should include descriptions of systems in grant applications which document payments, reasons for denial of payments and suspensions. In addition, the regulations at &sect;631.64 require each grantee to establish and to maintain a grievance procedure which, among other things, would handle grievances related to needs-related payments. The regulations at subpart F of 20 CFR part 627 provide procedures for the federal handling of allegations of violations of the Act or regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Participant Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nine commenters raised questions regarding participant eligibility provisions for dislocated workers under CAETA. One commenter suggested expanding the eligible population to workers needing skills upgrading or retraining on new or modified equipment. Sections 301 and 326(a) of the Act establish eligibility criteria for CAETA. Dislocated workers may receive skills training in the same occupation in which they were previously employed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> if <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  their current skills are obsolete, and such training is required for them to meet the local labor market hiring requirements for that occupation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested including a statement regarding the eligibility of workers who had been laid off from mines that supply coal to plants. The Department agrees that workers dislocated from mines as a result of compliance with the Clean Air Act would be eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter raised the question of how one determines that an individual's dislocation is the consequence of compliance with the Act if the layoff notice does not specifically mention the impact of the Clean Air Act, and whether the grantee has to assure verification is done for each applicant. The CAETA grantee must determine and document that a layoff is Clean Air Act-related and must verify that each applicant was a part of such layoff. The application guidelines will provide for reasonable documentation which could establish that the layoff was related to the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested allowing temporary employment with the employer from which the worker was dislocated. Participant eligibility for enrollment in CAETA is specified at section 326(a) of the Act. The Department believes that temporary employment with the same employer is inconsistent with the definition of dislocation and is restricted at &sect;631.3(i)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Grantees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received seven comments regarding entities eligible to apply for grants under CAETA. Three commenters indicated that submitting applications directly to the Department of Labor, rather than through the State, could lead to such problems as a lack of coordination, and duplication. Another commenter suggested that recipients should provide assurances that they are administratively capable of operating the program. Two commenters suggested that limiting eligible grantees to States and territories of the United States would ensure coordination with State entities and SSGs. Section 326(b) of the Act permits the Secretary to recognize five types of eligible grantees, and it does not require applicants to apply through the State. The Department recognizes that there would be benefits to submitting all applications through the States, and encourages such action. It should be noted, however, that an ``eligible grantee'' may not be an appropriate applicant for a particular project. The nature and extent of the proposed project, and the capacity of an applicant, will be factors in evaluating an application and an applicant's ability to perform the work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

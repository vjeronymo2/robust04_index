			<p>BFN     [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 23 Apr (EFE) -- Captain  Humberto Coral Caballero, one of the Colombian Armed Forces  officers who was part of the Search Bloc that killed drug  trafficker Pablo Escobar in December, was murdered on Friday in  Medellin, police sources reported today.    Coral Caballero was shot by two persons in a vehicle while  he  was on leave in La America neighborhood, the same area in  western Medellin where the Medellin Cartel chief was killed on 2  December 1993. Escobar was gunned down in one of his hideouts  following a search that lasted for more than a year and involved  more than 1,500 policemen. The murder of Capt. Coral Caballero,  who was from Barranquilla, is among the first crimes in Medellin  involving officers following Escobar's death.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OROVILLE;  </P> <P> BUTTE COUNTY ASKS FOR MORE MONEY  </P> <P> Butte County supervisors asked Gov. George Deukmejian for an additional $8  million in state aid, declaring again that their only alternative would be to  file for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's press secretary, Bob Gore, said the Republican governor would have  no comment on the county's request until his fiscal advisers review it. Butte's  letter is a counter to Deukmejian's proposal last week to give the county $7.45  million in state aid if it cut an additional $6.65 million to close an  estimated $14.1-million gap in its proposed $155-million budget. That offer  from Deukmejian came just a few hours before the county was scheduled to become  the first in the nation to file for bankruptcy.  </P></p>

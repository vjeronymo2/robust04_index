			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Ashdown berated for relief of besieged PM LABOUR leaders accused Mr Paddy Ashdown and his Liberal Democrat followers of providing a lifeboat for Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons last night, when the government survived two crucial votes on the Maastricht treaty by majorities of three and six. In tumultuous scenes in the crowded chamber, Mr John Smith and his colleagues on the Labour front bench knew they were on the wrong end of a see-sawing debate seconds before the result was officially announced. Mr Ashdown took the brunt of the verbal assaults unleashed by Labour MPs as soon as the emergence of Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, from behind the speaker's chair signalled that the government had successfully survived the first vote with a majority of six. The insults directed at the Liberal Democrats who voted with Mr Major and his supporters in both divisions became even more abusive when it was announced that the main government motion had been carried by a majority of only three. In a bitter comment after the hubbub subsided, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, charged Mr Ashdown and his party with betraying the millions of people who voted for them in April's general election. 'The only thing the Liberals have been true to is their colours - yellow,' he said. An unrepentant Mr Ashdown renewed his charge that it was Mr John Smith who had abandoned his principles by refusing to support the government and sullying his record as a consistent supporter of Britain's membership of the European Community. Earlier the Labour leader had insisted that the ambiguous and anodyne government motion had more to do with the internal crisis in the Conservative party than with the EC and the Maastricht treaty. In a vigorous defence of Mr Smith at the close of the debate Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the prime objective of the main motion was to re-establish the authority 'of an increasingly accident-prone and embattled prime minister trying to establish his authority over his increasingly querulous party'. Labour would not assist in that objective, he said, and in a pointed thrust at the Liberals warned 'those who do will be required to account for their actions to an angry and incredulous British public'. Mr Smith highlighted the sharply contrasting indications from government quarters in recent weeks about the importance that ministers attached to the debate. He emphasised that a briefing by Downing Street officials had led to newspaper reports that a government defeat would result in Mr Major calling a general election. Scoffing at the navety of Liberal Democrat MPs, he said they had been 'conned by the Conservatives'. Mr Smith said that for Labour MPs to adopt the same course would amount to an endorsement of the government's decision to opt out from the social chapter - 'that might suit the Liberal Democrats but it would be a betrayal for us'. Mr Smith argued that further proceedings on the bill should be delayed until after the Edinburgh summit in December, when the terms secured by the Danish government for staging a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty would be clarified. He contended that a statement made by the the prime minister in September amounted to an acceptance that the 'framework' for the second Danish referendum would have to be agreed at the Edinburgh summit before MPs were asked to deal with the next stage of the bill.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Visa expects fraud losses to nearly double VISA International, one of the two leading US credit card companies, yesterday said it was seeking new ways to detect card fraud as the level of worldwide losses from counterfeiting appears likely to nearly double in the current fiscal year. Visa said yesterday it expected worldwide counter-feit losses to increase to more than Dollars 100m in the financial year that ends this March 31; the level in the 1990-91 year was Dollars 55m. If the fraud losses continue to increase at the present rate, losses could exceed Dollars 175m next year, the company said. To combat fraud, Visa said it was developing an early-warning system that would analyse card-usage patterns on all daily transactions over a certain amount. This system, which Visa christened the 'transaction analysis system', is intended to identify quickly probable counterfeit transactions.</p>

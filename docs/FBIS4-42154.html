			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sto"-signed report: "Latvia Wants Guarantees"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 26 May -- Despite the agreement under  international law with Russia on the withdrawal of Russian  troops, Latvia is still concerned about its security. Speaking  to this newspaper in Bonn, [Anatolijs] Gorbunovs, the speaker of  the Latvian parliament, said that regarding this issue, the Riga  government is counting on "support from West Europe and the  CSCE." He said that Latvia had made "substantial concessions"  to Moscow to stabilize the European security system. That  involves, above all, the promise that Russia would be able to  use the early-warning system radar station in Skrunda for  another four years. However, the Latvians fear that in the  future the Russian Government will be able to ignore the pledge  to withdraw from Skrunda. That is why the Latvians would like a  "guarantee" from the CSCE regarding the Russian promise of a  withdrawal. Appropriate signals from the West regarding the  upcoming ratification of the these treaties by the Latvian  parliament, the Saeima, would be important.    The Latvian parliamentary speaker, who is on an official  visit to Germany along with a parliamentary group at the  invitation of the speaker of the German Bundestag, said that,  despite Moscow's promise to withdraw 18,000 active soldiers by  31 August, there was concern about retired Russian officers who  wanted to continue living in Latvia as Russian citizens. The  government in Riga, which is being advised on citizenship issues  by the experts from the Council of Europe, is seeking to  encourage Russian citizens to agree to repatriation on a  voluntary basis. A foundation has been set up to assist those  who wish to be resettled. So far, Sweden and the United States  have contributed $2 million to the foundation. "It would be  wonderful if all the countries who congratulated us on this  gesture would...also participate in the foundation," observed  Gorbunovs.    Schaefer, the Foreign Ministry secretary, congratulated  Gorbunovs on the Russia-Latvia agreements on the withdrawal of  Russian troops. They were the "expression of a policy based on  readiness to reach a compromise and not on issuing maximum  demands." The Latvian parliament should now seek to ratify the  agreements as quickly as possible. Schaefer gave an assurance  that Germany would campaign for the "rapid admission of Latvia,  Lithuania, and Estonia to the European Union." The Federal  Government hopes that with the beginning of the German EU  presidency on 1 July, the free trade agreements between the  European Union and the Baltic states will be concluded. During  the German presidency, the "Europe treaty" should be implemented.</p>

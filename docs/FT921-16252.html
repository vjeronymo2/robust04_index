			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / West shelves threat of sanctions against Libya THE US, Britain and France have shelved plans to seek immediate United Nations sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing, western diplomats said yesterday. The tactical retreat, led by the US, follows soundings within the 15-member UN Security Council which revealed that several countries had reservations about supporting sanctions. A diplomat involved in the discussions said that no final decisions on future action had been made, but it was clear that 'sanctions are not going to move very quickly' within the Security Council. The US, Britain and France are instead preparing to draw up a resolution demanding that Libya hand over agents accused of planting bombs on both the Pan Am flight which exploded over Lockerbie in 1988 and a French UTA airliner which blew up over Niger the following year. Drafts circulating at the UN headquarters in New York yesterday reiterated previous demands for Libya to hand over the suspects, while condemning the mid-air bombings. Libya denies any part in the bombings, but has detained the two agents accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing and says it is holding its own inquiry into the case. It has also invited western judges to Libya for any trial of the two men. However, Britain and the US insist that the men be handed over to a 'competent court', either in Scotland or the US. If Libya fails to comply, the three allies are likely to seek further steps through the UN, including possible sanctions such as a halt to all international flights to and from Libya and banning the sale of commercial aircraft, spare parts and airline-related equipment. Tougher measures such as a boycott of Libyan oil are possibilities. Although Britain and the US have refused to rule out possible military action against Libya over the bombings, a British official yesterday conceded that the Security Council was unlikely to pass any resolution advocating force. British officials were yesterday at pains to play down the thrust of reports in the Washington Post and reported comments from diplomats in Cairo suggesting that sanctions against Libya had been ruled out absolutely. 'There is no weakening of resolve on this issue whatsoever,' said one. 'Britain, France and the USA are determined to bring this affair to a satisfactory conclusion.'</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SUMMER FRUITS ADD COLOR, TASTE AND VITAMINS TO VARIETY  OF RECIPES  </P> <P> Many of the summer's most prolific fruits, typically eaten out of hand or used  to flavor and color recipes, also are superb sources of vitamins. This  nutritional benefit makes them a wise choice to boost vitamin and mineral  intake without having to resort to commercial vitamin supplements.  </P> <P> Apricots, peaches, cantaloupes and nectarines are packed with Vitamin A,  Vitamin C, potassium, iron and fiber, while strawberries and oranges supply  substantial amounts of Vitamin C. Honeydew and watermelon are noted primarily  for their potassium content, which is modest: about 559 milligrams per 4x8-inch  wedge of watermelon and 825 milligrams for a 1/10 slice of a five-pound  honeydew.  </P> <P> On their own, cherries and plums have a marginal value too -- 10 cherries or  one plum provides only a fraction of the RDA for any vitamin or mineral. But  combine them with other summer fruits or wholesome ingredients, such as Vitamin  C-rich red peppers or high-iron spinach, and they make delicious summer salads.  </P> <P> Here are some nutritional values from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Home  and Garden Bulletin No. 72, "Nutritive Value of Foods," which may be helpful  for those seeking to improve their vitamin intake without supplementation.  </P> <P>  -- One half cantaloupe provides about 1,000 international units (IU) more than  the Recommended Dietary Allowance for Vitamin A and satisfies the RDA for  ascorbic acid at the same time.  </P> <P>  -- One whole medium nectarine supplies about one-quarter of the day's  requirement for Vitamin A.  </P> <P>  -- The entire day's need for Vitamin C can be met with just one cup of whole  strawberries or one whole orange.  </P> <P>  -- Three raw apricots provide more than half the RDA for Vitamin A.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLUM PASTA SALAD  </P> <P> 8 ounces bow tie, wagon wheel or small shell pasta  </P> <P> Boiling water  </P> <P> 6 medium plums, sliced  </P> <P> 1 small red pepper, cut into slivers  </P> <P> 1/2 cup walnut or pecan halves  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plain yogurt  </P> <P> Basil Dressing  </P> <P> Drop pasta into large pot of water and cook over medium heat 8 minutes or until  cooked as desired.

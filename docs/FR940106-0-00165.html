An individual's approved training program may be amended by the State agency to add a course designed to satisfy unforeseen needs of the individual, such as remedial education or specific occupational skills, as long as the length of the amended training program does not exceed the 104-week training limitation in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Full-time training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Individuals in TAA approved training shall attend training full time, and when other training is combined with OJT attendance at both shall be not less than full-time. The hours in a day and days in a week of attendance in training shall be full-time in accordance with established hours and days of training of the training provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Section 617.24 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;617.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preferred training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Training programs that may be approved under &sect;617.22(a) include, but are not limited to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) On-the-job training,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (b) Any training program provided by a State pursuant to Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c) Any training program approved by a private industry council established under the Job Training Partnership Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (d) Any program of remedial education,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Any training program (other than a training program described in paragraph (c) of &sect;617.25) for which all, or any portion, of the costs of training the worker are paid_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Under any other Federal or State program other than this Subpart C, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) From any other source other than this section, but not including sources personal to the individual, such as self, relatives, or friends, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (f) Any other training program approved by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  18.

The limitations in section 236 which are implemented in this section concern the restrictions on approval of training which are related directly or indirectly to the conditions on training which are approvable or on the funding of training costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> On-the-job training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The costs of on-the-job training approved Subpart C of this part for a worker, which are paid from TAA funds, shall be paid in equal monthly installments.

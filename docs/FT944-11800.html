			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Hualon plan faces Europe challenge Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board has declined to confirm that the controversial plan by Hualon of Taiwan to build a Pounds 157m Belfast textiles plant will go ahead if the European Commission's approval of Pounds 61m of aid for the project is challenged in court. The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which says the plant will create unfair competition, said yesterday that it planned to appeal to the European Court. Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington and a member of the Commons public accounts committee, is to urge the committee to ask the Northern Ireland Audit Office to investigate the project.</p>

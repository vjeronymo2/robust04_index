			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kragujevac, 8 May (TANJUG) -- The Serbian people  will on no account allow any threats to the territorial link  between the Serb lands, despite our lasting commitment to peace  and a political solution, Milan Martic, president of the  republic of Serb Krajina, told "The Hallmark of the Times"  program of Kragujevac radio. [passage omitted]    Asked why the talks between the republic of Serb Krajina and  Croatia had been delayed and when they will resume, Martic said:  "This is not up to us. We insist that the talks take place at a  neutral venue and on equal footing for both sides. The  condition for continuing the talks is the removal of Paragraph  12 of the UN Security Council Resolution 820, relating to  exports and imports. Making any concessions to Croatia, even  when it comes to transport links, is out of the question unless  we are treated equally. Gaining transport links would mean  nothing to us if we cannot export or import goods, and for that  it is necessary to remove Resolution 820."    Asked to comment on the increasingly frequent statements by  western and Croatian politicians about the reintegration of the  republic of Serb Krajina into Croatia, with a high degree of  autonomy, Martic said: "These are merely their wishes." He  added: "We are convinced we are fighting for the survival of the  Serb people and we will persist in it to the very end."    "We will not give in on our basic demand -- the right to  self- determination of our people, as guaranteed to all other  peoples in the world."</p>

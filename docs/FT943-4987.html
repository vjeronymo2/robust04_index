			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US purchases behind Heywood advance US acquisitions boosted the first-half results of Heywood Williams, the building materials and automotive components group, which more than doubled the pre-tax profits of its continuing businesses to Pounds 16.1m, writes Andrew Taylor. Last year's interim profit of Pounds 22.74m was not comparable as it included a Pounds 15m gain on the Pounds 95m sale of the UK glass division to Pilkington. Proceeds from the sale were used to buy two US companies: LaSalle-Deitch, which supplies components and furnishings for factory built homes, and Bristol Corporation, the plumbing products concern. The latter also sells heavily to suppliers and occupiers of factory built homes. The acquisitions, which joined the group after the first half of last year, added Pounds 7.8m to operating profits which rose from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 16.1m. Profits from existing US operations increased by Pounds 300,000 and the US total reached Pounds 9.6m, compared with Pounds 1.4m. UK building materials businesses, however, continued to suffer from the failure of the repair, maintenance and do-it-yourself markets to recover. Profit margins on plastic windows and doors have been squeezed by big rises in polyvinyl chloride raw material prices. Overall UK profit, including AutoWindscreens, fell by 6.8 per cent from Pounds 6.21m to Pounds 5.81m. Continental European glass profits rose sharply from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 265,000 reflecting an improvement in construction markets. It is thought the group intends to sell this business. In the UK it has accepted an offer for Finalex, 'reflecting the asset value' of the aluminium extrusion business which has been losing market share to plastics in the replacement window and door market. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said the price was low and not material by comparison with Heywood's remaining businesses. Earnings per share of continuing businesses increased from 5.5p to 9.7p, including the effects of last December's Pounds 52.4m rights issue. The company, therefore, is proposing to increase the interim dividend by 11 per cent to 5p. COMMENT Heywood is the latest building materials producer to complain of slow progress in UK repair and maintenance markets. These fare better when the housing market is performing well. General house sales, however, remain sluggish compared with new house sales. Meanwhile, PVC prices seem set to rise further. Heywood shareholders should be grateful, therefore, for some shrewd earnings-enhancing US acquisitions. These should help increase group profits to Pounds 36m this year and Pounds 42m next. This places the shares on forward multiples of 16 this year and more than 13 for 1995. It is difficult, however, to see how the group will improve this rating until there is a more positive outlook for UK repair markets.</p>

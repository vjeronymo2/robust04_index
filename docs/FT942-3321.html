			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Enterprise Oil raises bid but shuns cash: Shareholders remain wary of unusual structure - Target's price declines Enterprise Oil yesterday raised the stakes in its hostile bid for rival explorer Lasmo with a final all-share offer valuing the target at Pounds 1.59bn. It was clear from the revised terms and lack of a cash element that Enterprise had been under pressure from its shareholders not to push its terms too far. Enterprise is seeking to win over Lasmo's hesitant shareholders by doubling the promised dividend, allowing them a greater share of the enlarged company and offering earlier conversion dates for the A shares and warrants which make up the unusually structured equity offer. Based on an Enterprise share price of 399p, Lasmo shares were valued at 165p, against last night's close of 143 1/2 p - the day's 4p fall indicated scepticism about prospects of the bid's success. After a 9p drop in Enterprise's shares, the offer was worth about 161p. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chief executive, said the revised offer represented fair value for shareholders in both companies. 'We haven't used buckets of cash, we haven't underwritten the shares, we are confident this will win it.' Lasmo's shareholders were less enthusiastic, given the absence of cash and Enterprise's decision to retain the unusual structure. 'It smacks of short-term financial engineering,' said one institutional investor. 'They are finding it difficult to convince people of the strategic merits.' Enterprise's institutional investors are also believed to be unenthusiastic. They fear significant earnings dilution and short-term effects on the share price. Analysts said the market was expecting Enterprise's revised offer to fail. 'People do not like the complexity of the bid and would have been much happier with a cash alternative,' one analyst said. Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, said the revised bid remained unwelcome. 'The share of the combined company is totally inadequate and it continues to be in junk paper,' he said. Enterprise is offering 36 A shares and 13 warrants for every 88 of Lasmo's, valuing the target's shares at 165p on an Enterprise price of 399p. This compares with 27 A shares and 12 warrants for every 80 Lasmo in the original offer. Lasmo investors would hold 44.5 per cent of the enlarged company, against 40 per cent. The A shares would carry dividends of 6p in 1994 and 1995, against 3p in the three years to 1996. This equals 2p per Lasmo share, against the target's promised minimum of 1p. The warrants' strike price has been improved to 430p against 470p. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Skiing: Danger under the sun - The risks of the slopes and how to ski safely IN THE heart of the Swiss Alps this week, something stirred. Flurries of snow followed by more substantial falls on higher slopes in the Valais arrived to break the relentless meteorological deadlock of sun and blue skies but not necessarily to improve treacherous pistes. The danger to life and limb is still there, although further snowfalls may finally minimise the dangers. Day after day, the slopes had slowly deteriorated from superb to good to patchy to downright dangerous as recent deaths testify. After a superlative start to the season, skiers encountered endless sunny days or perfect piste skiing. But without further falls and with temperatures not always cold enough to enable resorts to top up with artificial snow, even the best pistes on the lower slopes gradually deteriorated. The problem now is that small amounts of fresh snow tend to cover icy moguls, making them even more treacherous because skiers often cannot tell what lies under the fresh covering. Much higher up, however, the new snow is sufficiently deep on most runs to ski without breaking through to the old snow, which was in better condition anyway because of the altitude. Another problem is that the very qualities that make a ski resort so challenging - steep, long, rocky descents with chutes and couloirs - tend to make it more dangerous with inferior snow cover. Verbier is a good example. So are other barnstorming resorts such as St Anton, Val d'Isere, Argentiere, Zermatt and Jackson Hole. Each has steep, rugged, rocky mountains where the terrain includes some of the world's most exhilarating runs. Take away too much snow cover and you get areas of treacherous, rock-strewn slopes where out-of-control intermediates, travelling too fast for their imagined skills, can easily damage other skiers and themselves. The problem with strong, fit, young intermediates is that many ski as fast as experts without the same control. In Verbier this week, the La Chaux area above Les Ruinettes has been hell's corner as skiers came hurtling into one of the resort's busiest bottlenecks. In normal conditions, their inadequate technique would see them through, but on hard, icy slopes they are unusually vulnerable - and so is anyone who happens to be in the way. In these conditions, a red run can easily be labelled black and even the mildest blue can be transformed into a stiff red. Ironically, the unpleasant and sometimes dangerous state of the slopes has highlighted the attraction of off-piste descents, so often thought of as the pre-occupation of the hare-brained, dangerous fringe of ski-ing. In resorts where the groomed runs are at their most dangerous, skiing off-piste with a qualified guide can be a safer option. Guides are trained to seek out good and safe snow conditions. The only snag is that to get to the classic off-piste areas a skier can rarely get by with lower-intermediate skills. Off-piste skiers must be able to negotiate breakable crust and heavy, loose snow, and to walk up and then ski down some steepish gradients. But just as there are easy and difficult pistes, there are usually 'beginner' areas for off-piste debutants. In Verbier, intermediate piste skiers can manage the gentleish ungroomed slopes around Attelas without a guide and even the gentle descent all the way down from the Rosa Blanche glacier, although a guide is required to help skiers steer clear of crevasses. More expert skiers can cope with the joys and perhaps occasional fears of skiing a myriad off-piste itineraires. Stairway to heaven, reached by a long traverse from the top of the Jumbo Mont-Fort cable car, is a wonderful example of rich rewards for little effort. It involves a steep but not difficult walk to reach some wide open and exhilarating but not terribly steep snow fields. In good conditions, even Mont-Gele and the legendary 'back' of Mont Fort can be skied by strong, experienced intermediates. On the rare occasion when a group of helicopter skiers are injured or killed, it inevitably makes headlines. Yet you have more chance of being injured or killed in one of the scores of individual collisions or falls on piste than in an avalanche while heli-skiing. Year after year, single skier's deaths have gone almost unnoticed. What is different this year is that some of the casualties have been British. Guides cost money. Our guide this week in Verbier, Yves Rausis - with almost 20 years experience in Canada, Alaska and California and who survived a massive 2,300 foot fall during an avalanche while guiding in Verbier eight years ago - cost SFr400 (Pounds 183.40) a day between four of us. You might well ask why you should pay such a sum to ski off-piste when you are already having to pay to ski on-piste. However, your Pounds 50 will bring you not only good snow while others are struggling in difficult conditions, but also wonderful adventures in remote and beautiful wildernesses that you would not find if you spent the whole week looking, not to mention the risk of falling down a crevasse in the process. Guides such as Rausis can make all the difference between an average day on skis and a truly outstanding one. They instil a confidence that is rarely misplaced. I would ski over a cliff for Yves in the almost certain knowledge that I would not only live to tell the tale but do it all over again. Such confidence can enable you to ski with verve in places where - if you were alone - you might die of fright. The elation you experience makes the guide worth every centime. My visit to Verbier was organised by Ski Thomson, Greater London House, Hampstead Road, London, NW1 7SD. Telephone 081-200-8733. I stayed in the Chalet Mont Clair (prices from Pounds 297 including cooked breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner with wine. Our chalet person, Sarah Armstrong, made delicious cakes, excellent porridge and was patient with two exuberant under-fives in our party.</p>

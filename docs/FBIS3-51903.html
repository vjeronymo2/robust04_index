			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Roque Bacarreza] </F>   [Text] Washington, 26 Jan (EFE) -- The Latin American and  Caribbean diplomatic communities in Washington today were  somewhat disappointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton's speech  because he dedicated only three lines to them.    "We have summoned a summit of continental leaders from  Canada  to South America. And we will continue to exert pressure to  restore democracy in Haiti," Clinton plainly said in his State  of the Union address on the evening of 25 January before  Congress.    Nevertheless, as certain Chilean and Mexican diplomats  noted,  Clinton's constant references to efforts already made to  liberalize international trade also pertain to Latin American  nations. An Andean diplomat said, "If we fail to do our homework  -- adjust and modernize structures -- it will be very difficult  to heighten the interest of the United States and its  corporations." His opinion was shared by a Brazilian diplomat  and a third person from Central America, who discussed Clinton's  message in private.    Meanwhile, Isaac Cohen, director of the Economic Commission  for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA), told EFE: "It is up  to us, the Latin Americans, to turn those three lines into a  large door."    Cohen described the meeting confirmed by Clinton as a "very  important" opportunity for the heads of state of the entire  continent and the Caribbean.    The effort, to which Cohen and the diplomats who were  consulted referred, pertains to negotiations between Latin  American and Caribbean nations and the United States on the  basis of the results and progress made in structural adjustment  and modernization plans to achieve an adequate level of  competitiveness abroad.    Several of the presidents who visited President Clinton in  the past year, such as Argentina's Carlos Menem, and the heads  of state of Central America and the Caribbean pointed out the  need to change the terms of relations with the United States. In  this regard, they agreed on the need to expand trade  opportunities in the U.S. market, to offer facilities for the  investment of capital, and to support technological cooperation.    According to certain State Department diplomats, the  hemispheric summit, whose date and site have not yet been  determined, could take place during the second half of 1994.  Diplomatic sources predict the meeting will take place in Miami  (Florida) prior to the election of certain governors and the  partial renewal of the U.S. Congress in November. The heads of  state of the nations of the inter-American system have not met  since 1967. The last "summit" was held at the Punta del Este  (Uruguay) beach resort.    Diplomats consulted by EFE, who were somewhat disappointed,  said they were not surprised by the content of Clinton's speech,  which focused on domestic matters and left foreign policy on a  secondary level. The hemispheric "summit" could focus on trade,  democracy, poverty, and social politics, according to sources  close to the initial preparations. In a message read on 25  January before a solemn session of Congress, Clinton made  constant references to U.S. interest in expanding free trade  borders to improve the people's living standards. The drug  trafficking issue was not singled out, but Clinton included it  in a new battle front opened by his government to combat a wave  of violence, which is among the major concerns of this country.</p>

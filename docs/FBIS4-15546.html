			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry did  not consider the question of suspending the airlift to the  former Yugoslavia of an additional contingent of Russian  peace-keepers due to the NATO air strike against Serb positions  in the area of Gorazde, INTERFAX was told by the spokesman for  the Defense Ministry Vladimir Kosarev.    He said that a Ukrainian infantry company of the  peace-keeping contingent is stationed in the vicinity of Gorazde  where earlier NATO forces bombed the Bosnian Serb positions.  The spokesman said that there are no casualties among the  Ukrainian servicemen.    Earlier the Federation Council decided to send to the former  Yugoslavia an additional 300 Russian servicemen to raise the  number of the Russian contingent to 1500 people.</p>

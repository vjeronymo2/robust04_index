			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Railtrack says over half the network open Railtrack claimed last night that 53.4 per cent of its network was open yesterday in defiance of the signal workers' strike which will end at noon today, Robert Taylor writes. The RMT transport union intends to hold the next strike a week today for 24 hours. Only 17 per cent of signal workers worked normally yesterday with little sign of any erosion of support for the dispute among union members. The union said some who returned to work during last week's strike stayed away yesterday because of their outrage at the 4.7 per cent pay rise awarded to MPs.</p>

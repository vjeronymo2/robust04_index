			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fascist Skinheads Hold First </F> National Demo"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vicenza, May 15 -- Extreme right-wing  skinheads with arms raised in the Fascist salute and wearing  black leather jackets marched through the streets of this  northern town Sunday [15 May] in their first national  demonstration. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at  "several hundred."    Led by Piero Puschiavo, who is under investigation here for  attempting to re-organize the banned Fascist Party of Benito  Mussolini, the skinheads shouted slogans and displayed signs  against the republic and the mass media.    Puschiavo, who heads an organization calling itself the  Veneto Skinheads Front, founded in Rome in 1991, at a rally  following the march praised Fascist ideals and compared Fascists  killed during World War II to those who died fighting against  Mussolini and Hitler.    An 80-strong police force watched over the event and  prevented clashes between the skinheads and anti-Fascist  counterdemonstrators.    In local reactions, Vicenza deputy mayor Sergio Carta said  "the event was at the very least inopportune in a city where an  inquiry into this phenomenon is still open."    "It is singular that as soon as a centre-right government is  installed, extremist positions automatically come to light," he  went on, adding that "I have the impression that there is an  attempt to soften or anaesthetise certain memories of this  country and Europe as a whole, and I am worried by the absence  of a civic reaction, because indifference brings the risk of  violence prevailing."    The Veneto leader of the opposition Democratic Party of the  Left sent Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro a telegramme  expressing "the keenest concern over the signal given by the  Vicenza neo-Nazi march, and the way it was underestimated by the  authorities."    "I remind those who say that these are isolated phenomena  that in Germany these groups are the subject of abundant  legislation aimed at suppressing them," he added.    The chairman of Venice's Jewish Community, Sandro Romanelli,  sent a message to President Scalfaro, Premier Berlusconi, and  the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, expressing his  concern over the Vicenza rally.    A communique said the Jewish Community of Venice "calls on  the Public Powers to exercise their due role and apply the law,  and invites public opinion and all conscientious citizens to  stand a democratic, antifascist guard, that our country may be  spared useless violence at such a delicate moment in political  life."    National police chief Vincenzo Parisi issued a communique  this evening saying that he had issued instructions that no such  marches or rallies will henceforth be allowed, in the interests  of public order.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: KOP board fined over bourse breaches THE BOARD of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), one of Finland's leading commercial banks, was fined yesterday in the Helsinki city court for financial misconduct in breach of bourse regulations, writes Robert Taylor. Each director, plus the former president of KOP, Mr Jaakko Lassila - who resigned just before Christmas - were fined between FM2,800 (Dollars 695) and FM7,000 each. The court found them guilty of failing to notify the Helsinki bourse last spring of losses stemming from a series of exchange transactions they had made. It was not until the middle of May, two months after KOP directors knew of the loss, that the bourse was informed. Under bourse regulations, all listed companies are required to immediately provide information that might influence their share price. Finland's bank inspection board was so concerned at the behaviour of the directors that it called in the police.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL AIDS HOTEL PLAN  </P> <P> The Pomona City Council has agreed to waive $243,235 in fees and spend $186,360  on a water line to help the Shilo Inns chain build an all-suites hotel and  restaurant at Temple Avenue and the Orange (57) Freeway.  </P> <P> The new Shilo Suites Hotel, with 131 rooms, would be constructed within a block  of the existing 161-room Shilo Inn.  </P> <P> Shilo Inns owner Mark Hemstreet of Portland, Ore., told the council that  construction could be completed within a year.  </P> <P> Hemstreet said the existing inn has "lost a tremendous amount of business"  because it cannot accommodate banquets for more than 75 to 90 people. The new  hotel would have restaurant and banquet facilities seating 500.  </P> <P> The agreement given preliminary approval by the council calls for the waiver of  fees for a building permit, sewer connection and other charges. Hemstreet said  the city's expenses would be offset within three years by revenue from the 8%  tax on room occupancy.  </P></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Court clarifies rules on company transfer taxes THE European Court of Justice last week clarified the circumstances in which related company profit transfers are liable to tax. The first case involved a contract between two German companies with the same majority shareholder to transfer profits from one to the other. The local German tax office attempted to tax a transfer on the basis that it was not a simple inter-company transaction but a payment by the majority shareholder to the recipient company. Such payments are taxable under German law. The question of whether profit transfers between two companies controlled by the same shareholder were taxable was referred to the European Court of Justice. The Court ruled that under Community law transfers which increased company assets were liable to capital taxes even if the company's authorised capital was not increased. The transfer was therefore taxable. However the court said that if the recipient had held shares in the donor company then the transfer would have been deemed a dividend payment and not subject to capital taxes. The second case involved the transfer of certain branch offices to a new company. The transfers were made by a shareholder in the new company. Community provisions stated that a tax of only 0.50 per cent could be levied on branch transfers. The local German tax office thought this rate was too low for branches which were not independent and distinct from their main companies. The Court ruled that in order to benefit from the 0.50 per cent tax rate, a branch had to have sufficient assets and personnel to carry out its particular activity on its own.

Fishing quota applications fail THE European Court of Justice has rejected claims for annulment of Community measures setting fishing quotas around Greenland, Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Islands in four actions brought by Spain and Portugal. Under Community law the individual fishing quotas of EC countries are intended to ensure relative stability for their fishing industries. The quotas are meant to take into account traditional fishing activities in the member countries, regional needs associated with fishing and the loss of fishing opportunities in third country waters. The relevant quotas for the member states were initially set in 1983 and have not been changed since. Spain and Portugal were not included in the determination of quotas on their accession to the Community in 1986. Their claims were based on two general points: the principle of relative stability had been incorrectly applied; and the measures were discriminatory. The Court dealt with both points on the basis of the principle of 'acquis communautaire'. In effect, the court said that as there were no amending provisions in their acts of accession, Community law as it then stood applied to Spain and Portugal. The 1983 determination of quotas was therefore valid. The Court pointed out that Spain and Portugal found themselves in the same position as other members states who had not yet joined the Community when the quotas were set.

Italian aid scheme not subject to Community rules AN Italian law allowing reductions in registration fees on purchases of agricultural land by farmers does not fall within the scope of Community measures relating to increased efficiency in the agricultural sector. Case C-162/91, Societa Tenuta il Bosco v Ministero delle Finanze dello Stato, ECJ 2CH, 15 October, 1992. Dutch hormone measures valid NATIONAL rules forbidding the purchase, possession, holding or sale in Holland of animals containing traces of various hormonal substances have been upheld by the European Court of Justice. In spite of the fact that Community provisions only prohibit the administration of hormones to cattle or the slaughtering and selling of such animals for human consumption, the court said the wider effect of national laws did not make them incompatible with EC law. The Dutch measures were effective in attaining the objective set down by the Community rules. However, the court emphasised that national measures should not go beyond the relevant community measures. Case C-143/91, Leendert Van der Tas, ECJ 2CH, 8 October, 1992. Greek import licence decision invalid THE European Commission brought proceedings against Greece for breach of its obligations under EC import rules. Greece had refused to grant licences for the import of matches from Sweden and Bulgaria. The Commission had granted Greece permission to apply national surveillance measures to imports of Swedish matches. But the Court said that was no justification for the imposition of quantitative restrictions on Swedish matches. The Court also ruled that by failing to respond in detail to questions put by the Commission, Greece was in breach of its Rome Treaty obligations. Case C-65/91, Commission v Greece, ECJ FC, 14 October, 1992. Italy's failure to follow ECJ rulings THE Commission brought a successful action against Italy for failing to take measures within the relevant time limits to implement rulings of the European Court relating to the implementation of EC tax measures. The Court reiterated that its rulings should be complied with in as short a time as possible. Case C-262/91, Commission v Italy, ECJ FC, 14 October 1992.</p>

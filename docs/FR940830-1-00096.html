Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. The operation and maintenance manual for vessels consists of three parts:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Waste transfer procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Waste clean up procedures; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Waste deposit reporting procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The first part of the operation and maintenance manual shall identify the measures that you will take to minimize the deposit of waste into coastal waters during transport and transfer activities. In the operation and maintenance manual you should (&sect;237.5(d)(ii)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during waste transfer and transport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to the vessel crew on the implementation of the technologies and techniques that will be employed during waste transfer and transport. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary structures, or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies and techniques described shall be appropriate to the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to minimize the spillage of waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Instruct the crew to secure the waste in such a way as to prevent the deposit of waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Direct the crew not to load the vessel in excess of its capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Direct the crew that all ports and valves that may be used for flushing or discharging waste or waste residue from the hull or tanks must be clearly labelled and that all ports and valves must be sealed except for the purpose of transferring wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e. record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The second part of the operation and maintenance manual describes for the vessel crew the procedures that will be used to clean up, promptly and thoroughly, any waste deposited into coastal waters (&sect;237.5(a)(1)(iv)). This section must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Describe the role and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during cleanup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Describe in detail for the crew the techniques and technologies that will be employed during waste cleanup. The technologies or techniques must be appropriate to the waste type and the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to clean up all waste promptly and thoroughly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. In the third part of the operation and maintenance manual describe the procedures to be followed if the vessel's crew is unable to clean up all of the waste deposited. In this section you must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provide a contact name and telephone number of the designated responsible person (see section 237.5) involved in the ownership or operation of the vessel. Indicate that this contact person should be notified immediately by telephone, marine radio if the crew is unable to completely clean up the waste deposited. This contact name and phone number and the number of the USCG NRC must be posted on the vessel in a location visible to the vessel's crew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide the telephone number of the USCG NRC to be called by the responsible person if the crew is unable to completely clean up the waste deposited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide an example of a followup letter to be used by the responsible person to report the waste deposit to the USCG NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provide copies of the form that assists record-keeping and reporting in the event of a waste deposit. The operation and maintenance manual must instruct the appropriate crew member to complete one of these forms for each deposit of waste. The record must include the time and date of the deposit, estimates of the amount of wastes deposited and amount retrieved, actions taken to clean up the waste deposit, and any other pertinent information. If an action was not accomplished or successful, it is important to document why those actions were taken. Any actions to prevent further incidents of this type should also be recorded. All waste deposits must be recorded, whether cleaned up or not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Waste Sources and Receiving Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. The operation and maintenance manual for waste sources and receiving facilities consists of three parts: waste transfer procedures, waste cleanup procedures, and waste deposit reporting procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.

Direct all employees that all waste that clearly resulted from, or may have resulted from, waste loading or unloading operations shall be removed prior to the first high tide following the completion of any waste transfer operation or before the waste has had a chance to disperse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The third part of the operation and maintenance manual describes the procedures to be followed if the facility's staff is unable to clean up all of the waste deposited.

Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F> Federation Government apparatus, by Iosif Galperin; place and  date of interview not given: "Civil Servant Should Have a Proud  Ring, Believes V.P. Kvasov, Leader of the Russian Federation  Government apparatus"]    [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has published a document  defining the concepts of the federal state service and the  federal state employee and precisely and clearly prescribes the  bans and benefits connected with this service and outlines the  civil servant's path from consultant to state adviser. We asked  Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, under whose leadership the document  is being elaborated, what gave rise to its appearance.    [Kvasov] Today we are in practice creating a new state. All  its ideas are included in the draft Constitution adopted by the  nationwide referendum. The controllability of the economy  requires the building of an absolutely new state service system  and its standardized regulation. At federal, regional, and  local level. There is a decision of the president's on the  restructuring of the management apparatus and even earlier  decisions on the restructuring of local organs came into force.  It was for this that a statute was adopted to ensure that from  the outset state service is joined by qualified people.    The edict states that this statute does not regulate  questions of the posts of government members, the leader of the  president's administration, and other so-called political posts.  What is new for Russia is that we are distinguishing between  administrative and political posts. We are approaching an  establishment of power whereby political leaders come and go but  the apparatus operates. That is necessary for the stability and  continuity of power and in addition the civil servant will be  protected from political tyranny.    This statute is the first attempt in Russian history to put  state administrative workers in their places. The actual  mechanism for making and executing decisions and monitoring the  job and the person doing it has been recorded. There are also  prohibitions. For instance, they cannot take part in strikes.  The civil servant does not have the right to hold another post  at the same time. Teaching is an exception. The state employee  does not have the right to engage in business personally or even  through agents, to be a representative of third parties in a  state organ and use for nonofficial purposes information which  has been supplied to him, or to receive a fee for publishing  items as part of his official activity.    [Galperin] In Germany, for instance, state service is  considered one of the most privileged of jobs. If a person  joins the state service his whole life ahead is assured. And  that plus point is evened out by very powerful protection  against minus points, there is a law on the ban on professions,  they do not accept political extremists for state service. For  instance a Communist Party or Fascist Party member cannot be a  state employee...    [Kvasov] The state service should be outside party  allegiance. That does not mean that the employee does not have  the right to belong to a particular party or public  organization. That is a violation of human rights. But he must  not be tied by party decisions, which is enshrined in the  statute. That is the first, quite mild, stage.    [Galperin] When political life in the country once becomes  settled, when the parties' real political faces become clear,  then this requirement for a state employee will probably be made  specific by some separate statute and separate law and so forth?    [Kvasov] Initially we were more specific. But we decided to  leave it like that for the time being. That is also a step  forward, although it must be said that a number of norms  envisaged by the draft statute are not norms for direct action  (the institution of state posts and the determination of  qualifications requirements for them, and others) and should be  made more specific by other Russian Federation legislative acts.  At the same time their inclusion in the draft lends the statute  integrity, provides an opportunity for the consistent building  of a state service system in accordance with necessity and as  these acts become ready and also facilitates the transition in  the future to legal norms.    [Galperin] Take the following example. In Bashkortostan it  was the Supreme Soviet chairman who signed a secret edict about  how all civil servants in any state organs have the right to a  10-year loan at an interest rate of 8 percent for an amount  equal to 120 monthly salaries. This was adopted before the  elections and started to operate during the elections. From the  viewpoint of morality, for instance, that is understandable, but  how to assess this from the viewpoint of the statute on the  state employee in general?    [Kvasov] The state employee, because the state places him in  an organizational framework, should have a certain compensation.  But the compensation should be the same for all. In Bashkiria  and Ryazan Oblast. That is the principle. But I consider such  regional decisions to be purely populist.    [Galperin] Perhaps the most interesting thing for readers  will be the new table of ranks. Will the "titular counsellor"  and "collegiate assessor" really become modern again?    [Kvasov] We spent a long time discussing the introduction of  a table of ranks. Before the revolution it simply defined a  civil servant's place in the official hierarchy but did not  touch on the range of his duties. We decided to reintroduce it  but within a system with other solutions. Materially a "rank"  adds little, merely a small percentage increase. The main thing  here is the moral incentive. For instance, a third class  consultant (the lowest rank) knows he can serve to a higher  rank. The top civil servant is a full state councillor of the  Russian Federation. Any rank is retained upon retirement but is  referred to as "retired," which should attract people to state  service. And, second, people will start to treat their work  more responsibly.    In our state service now we have cases of corruption and  abuse of official position. And how should we fight this? By  increasing responsibility and involvement. For instance, having  worked 12 and one half years in state service a man can later,  when he reaches pension age, receive a pension which is 80  percent of his salary. And the pension is then indexed.    [Galperin] It is still hard for the state to vie with  private firms and particularly with joint ventures....    [Kvasov] Indeed, responsibility there is less and wages are  bigger. But state service is stabler. An employee can be  thrown out of a firm at any time, but just try doing that here!  Look at what a complex dismissal process has been included in  the statute.    You must understand that when a person does not value his  job, when a civil servant thinks, never mind, if they dismiss me  I shall join a private firm and earn several times more, it is  then that temptation arises. In the West an attempt to bribe a  civil servant ends with the civil servant dragging the briber to  the police. A man there feels he is a representative of the  state, second, the state protects him, so he cannot be gotten  to. In our country, unfortunately, there has been none of all  this. In the past a party card was some kind of restraining  factor. But when the oppression of party commitments  disappeared the double-headed flower of corruption immediately  bloomed in the organs of state management at all levels.    The new statute is one attempt, by increasing the value of  state service, to struggle against corruption. We are seeking  to change the attitude which has formed over the past 75 years  which views the civil servant as a bureaucrat. What is  bureaucracy? If you look it up in Dal, it is what the state  needs. You remember how KROKODIL used to portray bureaucrats in  our country? The bureaucrat sits there and looks up some  paragraph or point or other. And he says that according to some  rule you cannot do something. But who wrote that rule? The  state. That means we blamed the bureaucrat for observing the  state's interest. Do you understand? That is, in first  publishing a law we implied it was for paper only, for form's  sake. And those who tried to observe the letter of the law were  called bureaucrats. But today that is precisely the kind of  person we need. We are issuing thousands of laws, decrees, and  directives. And to ensure that they all operate we need people  who can fulfill them. At present we have a situation in which  if we like a decision we fulfill it and if we don't we pretend  it does not exist. But if some control organ or some inspector  "catches you out" then you say: "Oh, sorry, we overlooked it!  We forgot to pay 500 million rubles tax...."    [Galperin] At the time of early perestroyka the main  slogan was that there were too many bureaucrats. The 18 million  people employed in the management apparatus had to be reduced,  etc., and now there are also sometimes accusations that since  the reforms the number of apparatus workers has not declined.    [Kvasov] Naturally, today even in the field of economic  management we cannot retain all structures in the form in which  they existed a year ago. They are beginning to harm matters.  We must constantly adapt the management structure's  substructure to the new economic realities. So there is nothing  surprising about the fact that we periodically abolish some  ministries and create some organs. That is an ordinary  redistribution of functions between state organs -- a  redistribution dictated by life.    [Galperin] And between Moscow and the regions.    [Kvasov] First, an increasing number of functions are being  taken from the center and transferred to the regions. Look at  the Constitution. It does not state that the government  manages. Although it is not ruled out that an integral system of  state enterprises will remain in our country. But that is not  the main thing. The government elaborates and submits a state  federal budget and ensures its fulfillment. That is its task is  to pursue a unified financial and monetary and credit policy.  The government only manages federal property. And the amount  of federal property is constantly dwindling. We are also  issuing it to the regions so naturally with the reduction of the  volume of federal property there will be a reduction in the  sphere of federal management. Although some new structures may  perhaps be created in the regions. But at a completely  different level, not vertically but horizontally.</p>

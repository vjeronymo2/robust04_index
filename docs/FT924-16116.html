			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Dawkins confident of recovery: Australian treasurer expects upturn before next year's election AUSTRALIA will not see dramatic declines in unemployment as its economy recovers from recession, but growth in employment, when it occurs, will be sustainable, Mr John Dawkins, Australia's treasurer, said in London yesterday. He said the Labor government of Mr Paul Keating, was not making 'heroic' forecasts of sharp falls in unemployment, now at 10.9 per cent. The rate is sensitive for the government, which must call an election by mid-1993 and is struggling to pull the economy out of a long and deep recession. Mr Dawkins said unemployment would drop below 10 per cent during 1993, but he could not say that this would occur before the election. However, he was confident that the signs of an improvement would be there by the time the election was called. The monetary and fiscal stimulus which the government has given to the economy would not re-ignite inflation, Mr Dawkins said. Inflation dropped to an annual rate of 1.2 per cent in the quarter to end-June. The government has sought to boost the economy through repeated cuts in interest rates and job-creation programmes. Low inflation was not simply the result of the two-year recession but was also attributable to low growth in wages and would therefore be sustainable, Mr Dawkins said. The budget boost followed a long period of fiscal rectitude and was being funded by savings. It was sensible, he said, for the government to provide such a stimulus when it could afford to do so. Countries such as Britain and the US, because of their budget problems, could not afford to do it. On interest rates, Mr Dawkins said that given the recent instability of international financial markets, further changes in rates could not be contemplated for the time being but that they would remain under review. Sustainable, non-inflationary growth would be the answer to Australia's balance of payments problems - the deficit is currently projected at ADollars 15bn or 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product. Australia needed to make inroads into the size of its external debt but this would take time. Mr Dawkins said a key element of sustainable growth was continued progress in liberalisation of trade. The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) grouping would be important in this process because it would help to develop the widest possible constituency for liberalisation, he said. Australia was instrumental in establishing Apec, which has so far consisted of a series of meetings but agreed recently to establish a permanent secretariat. Mr Dawkins suggested that eventually it could have functions similar to that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the industrialised world, monitoring regional economies. A key objective, he said, was to maintain US economic involvement in Asia while it reduces its military presence. See Observer</p>

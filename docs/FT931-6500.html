			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Eyes on Germany THE MAIN focus in foreign exchange markets this week is on whether the Bundesbank will ease monetary policy again at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, hinted at the weekend that the easing in minimum reserve requirements for German banks, due to take effect today, could lead to a decline in lending rates in the German cash market. However, there has been considerable speculation that the lombard and discount rates might also be changed on Thursday, not least because of the fledgling tensions in the European Community's exchange rate mechanism. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes there are several reasons why a cut could come now. He points out that monetary growth is slowing, the recession in the manufacturing sector is deepening and business confidence fell further in January. Recent inflation data from the German states may have dented any willingness to cut rates. But, Mr Lyons says: 'Although the February inflation data was stubbornly high, the other recent domestic indicators point to the need for lower rates.' Miss Alison Cottrell, an international economist at Midland Global Markets in London, thinks that the Bundesbank will not ease its official rates at all. It will not want to be seen to make any policy change immediately after this weekend's G7 meeting, giving the impression that it can be swayed by international pressures. Today's change in minimum reserve requirements also ties the Bundesbank's hand, because there will be more liquidity in German money markets, and the central bank would not want to confuse markets by easing policy. If there is tension in the ERM, Miss Cottrell believes the Bundesbank could buy time by cutting the repo rate, which it has not done since rates were cut earlier this month.</p>

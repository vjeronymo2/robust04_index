			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE OKS ROSE FLOAT DESIGN  </P> <P> Three giant raccoons frolicking on a log will be the featured characters on  Torrance's 1991 Tournament of Roses Parade float entry, City Council members  agreed Tuesday.  </P> <P> Designed by C. E. Bent and Sons Inc., "Nature's Playground" had been  recommended by the city's volunteer Rose Float Assn. as best representing next  year's Pasadena parade theme of "Fun and Games."  </P> <P> Bill Lofthouse, a representative of the float designing company, said the  decoration of the mother raccoon and her two babies with pampas grass, wheat  stalks and a variety of bark, leaves and petals will challenge the skills of  Torrance volunteers. But Lofthouse said their experience from previous years  should aid them in their task.  </P></p>

Poindexter's Iran-Contra case on Thursday ordered a  hearing on whether the former national security adviser may introduce evidence  that covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels was legal.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold Greene scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday to  discuss whether there was valid evidence that Poindexter could use to defend  the charge that he obstructed congressional inquiries into whether National  Security Council aide Oliver L. North was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan  Contras.  </P></p>

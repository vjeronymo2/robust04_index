			<p>SUMMARY                                     Voters in the 27 March Ukrainian Supreme Soviet election voted  heavily for the recently reconstituted Communist Party of Ukraine  (CPU), especially in the east and south, preferring it to other  leftist parties--the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) and Labor  Party--which were almost shut out.  Rukh ran very well in Kiev  city, and democrats dominated in the west, accentuating the  regional divergences in the country.  Despite the apparent lack  of enthusiasm for parties and the huge number of nonparty  candidates running, candidates with party affiliation did very  well in the first round and also got about half the places in the  runoffs, suggesting that parties may play a bigger role in the  new parliament than had been expected.                                END SUMMARY     Very few seats were settled on this first round of the election  The Central Election Commission announced on 29 March that 49 of  the 450 seats had been decided in the 27 March first round and  that the victors included 12 from the CPU; 4 from Rukh; 2 each  from the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party), SelPU (Peasant Party  of Ukraine), KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), and SPU;  and 1 from the UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party-  -Stepan Khmara's party), while 24 have no party affiliations  (UNIAN, 29 March).  UNIAR, however, on 30 March said 48 seats had  been decided and presented a different list of victors, including  11 independents, 10 CPU, 6 Rukh, 3 "Ukraine Democratic  Association," 3 KUN, 3 New Wave, 2 DemPU (Democratic Party of  Ukraine), 2 SPU, 2 SOU (Union of Officers of Ukraine), 2 URP, and  1 each for SelPU, UKRP, UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly), and  MBR (InterregionaL Bloc of Reforms--the bloc of former Premier  Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr  Hrynyov).     Leftists Run Well     In addition to its Lead in the small number of settled contests,  the CPU and other leftist parties are poised for significant  gains in the runoffs, having placed far more candidates in the  runoff contests than the democratic parties.  Interfax reported  on 30 March that 159 CPU members and 29 SPU would be in the  runoffs--25 percent of the total number of second-round  candidates--while 70 Rukh, 24 URP, and 6 KUN candidates would  compete and that combined democratic candidates would total about  125 (a figure including 6 from the ultranationalist UNA), versus  about 400 independent candidates.  Demokratychna Ukraina reported  on 31 March that 185 CPU members would go into the runoffs along  with 26 SPU and 83 for the communist-inclined SelPU, versus only  55 Rukh (71, if one counts candidates backed by Rukh) and 27 URP.  Other Leftist parties, such as the SPU and Labor, were almost  shut out by the CPU--even though the CPU was banned until  recently and presumably was not as well organized as the SPU or  other Longer-established parties.  Leftist voters apparently were  attracted by the communist Label, not by a more moderate form of  socialism, or wished to register protest by voting communist.  The CPU even beat out non-nationalist democrats based in the  east:  The Kuchma-Hrynyov MBR only won 40 places in the runoffs,  according to the 1 April Nezavisimaya Gazeta.     The efforts by democratic parties to avoid destructive  competition and present a united front against leftists and  rightists achieved some success, although probably not as much as  some democrats are claiming.  The democratic bloc--now titled  "Ukraine Democratic Association"--set up by Rukh, URP, DemPU, and  other democratic parties, did well in Lviv and appears to have  helped the democrats at Least get into the runoffs in some  eastern and southern districts.  Democratic bloc leader Levko  Lukyanenko optimistically claimed after the election that 182  democratic candidates had gotten into the runoffs versus 170 CPU  and Less than 30 SPU (Kiev radio, 30 March).  He broke these down  as 88 from the democratic bloc plus 94 independents he considered  "of democratic orientation."  He also claimed 24 of the first  round victors as representatives of his bloc (Kyivska Pravda, 1  April), apparently adding together all democratically-inclined  victors.     Voters Support Parties     In another notable trend, voters gave more support than expected  to party-affiliated candidates, leading them to dominate the  first-round winners and claim a Large share of places in the  runoffs.  UNIAR's List of the 48 first-round winners included 37  with party affiliation and only 11 without, suggesting that ties  to a party gave a real advantage.  This idea is reinforced by the  large number of party candidates who made it into the runoffs-  -402 party candidates versus 400 independents, according to the  30 March Interfax.  In contrast, only 11 percent of first-round  candidates had been nominated by parties, according to the 2  March Holos Ukrainy, although many others had party affiliations.  The apparent discouraging of parties in the election law, the  many nonparty candidates, the often-voiced anti-party sentiment,  and the preference of many prominent, establishment candidates  for running as independents had encouraged expectation that the  overwhelming majority of those elected would be people without  party ties, leaving only tiny party factions in the new  parliament.  The first round suggests that parties may play a  bigger role than expected and that, with voters concentrating  their votes on the CPU and Rukh, there will be fewer parties and  bigger party factions in the new parliament--although the  majority may still be independents.     Regional Variations     The election appeared to not only reflect polarization between  the CPU and Rukh but also to accentuate regional divergences in  Ukraine, with the CPU far ahead in the east and south and Rukh  candidates and other democrats sweeping Kiev city and the west.     South     The CPU was clearly dominant in the southern oblasts of Odesa,  Mykolaiv, and Kherson, which altogether contain 45 districts.  (No substantial results from Krym, where many potential voters  refused to participate, have been reported yet.)  With all but  one district reported in these three oblasts, the CPU won the  only seat settled and won places in 16 runoffs, while fellow  leftists in the SPU and SeLPU won only 2 runoff places apiece.  The Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc MBR won 3 runoff places and the Liberal  Party 1.  Democratic nationalists won hardly any places in the  runoffs:  Rukh 4, URP 1, Union of Officers of Ukraine (SOU) 1,  and Greens 1 (SEE BOX ONE).     -- In Odesa Oblast's 23 districts, CPU First Secretary Mykhaylo  Myaskovskyy won the only seat settled (Post-Postup News Agency,  29 March), while the CPU placed candidates in 5 runoffs, and  other runoffs will include a "Union of Communists of Odesa"  candidate, a pro-communist candidate, and a SeLPU candidate  (Post-Postup, 29 March).  Rukh ran only 12 candidates (its list  of candidates was printed in the 17 March Rada) and got none into  the runoffs, while the democratic bloc put up 19 candidates (its  list of candidates appeared in Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12) and got  one (a DemPU) candidate in the runoffs.     -- In Kherson, no seats were filled on the first round.  The CPU  placed candidates in runoffs in 8 of the 11 districts, while the  SPU placed 2 candidates and the SeLPU 1.  Non-nationalist  democrats--reformers got 1 Liberal candidate and 1 MBR candidate  in runoffs (Post-Postup, 30 March).  Rukh and the democratic bloc  had run 10 candidates (Rada, 17 March; Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12)  and placed 2 candidates in the runoffs, both running under the  label "Ukraine Democratic Association" (Post-Postup, 30 March).     -- In Mykolaiv, no seats were filled, but democrats did somewhat  better than in Odesa and Kherson.  The CPU placed candidates in  runoffs in 4 of the 11 districts, the MBR in 2, Rukh in 2, URP in  1, SOU in 1, and Greens in 1 (Post-Postup, 29 March).  The  democratic bloc as a whole outscored the CPU, getting 5 in the  runoffs (the Rukh, URP, SOU, and Greens candidates) out of the 11  it nominated (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12).  Rukh had nominated  candidates in all districts (Rada, 17 March) and 3 candidates it  endorsed (including 1 SOU candidate) got into the runoffs.     East  Democrats expected an uphill struggle in the east and so had  largely united their efforts, with the democratic bloc usually  able to field far more candidates than Rukh alone (see the Rukh  list in the 17 March Rada and the democratic bloc list in Narodna  Hazeta, No. 11-12).  Rukh appeared especially weak in Kharkiv and  Dnipropetrovsk, where the democratic bloc endorsed more URP or  DemPU candidates than Rukh candidates (SEE BOX TWO).     Election returns from the east are still incomplete but show a  big CPU lead, with 11 CPU members already elected and at least 55  in runoffs, plus 9 SPU and 4 SeLPU candidates.  Meanwhile, the  democratic parties so far appear to have only about 20 in  runoffs.  Even the eastern-oriented Hrynyov-Kuchma MBR and the  Liberal Party appear to be getting only a handful of candidates  into the runoffs.     ---- In Zaporizhzhya, with all 18 districts reporting, the CPU  won  the only seat settled and got candidates into 8 runoffs, SeLPU  got 3 into the runoffs, but SPU got none.  Independents got 18 in  the runoffs, while democrats got some into runoffs running as the  "Ukraine" bloc (2) or the "We" bloc (4).  The Liberals and MBR  got none.  Rukh put up candidates in 13 districts (Rada, 17  March) and got 3 into runoffs, but as "Ukraine" bloc or non-party  candidates (Post-Postup, 30 March), while the democratic bloc put  up 15 candidates (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12) and got 4 into  runoffs, as "Ukraine" bloc, "We" bloc, or nonparty.  Three of  these were also Rukh candidates, and the fourth was from the PDVU  (the centrist Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine).     -- In Luhansk, the CPU's strength was demonstrated dramatically  when CPU candidates won 6 of the 25 districts in the first round.  One independent also won (UNIAR, 28 March).  Almost all districts  have only communists in the runoffs, according to local democrats  (Post-Postup, 1 April).     -- In Dnipropetrovsk, the one seat settled in the first round  went to a SeLPU member, while democrats have a slight lead in  runoff spots for the other 33 seats, with 11 for the "Ukraine"  democratic bloc (including 3 backed by Rukh).  Eight CPU, 3 MBR,  2 Labor Party, 2 Rukh (plus 2 in the Ukraine bloc), and 1 SelPU  candidates also placed in the runoffs  (Post-Postup, 30, 31  March).     -- In Kharkiv, returns from 14 of the 28 districts filled no  seats but put 8 CPU candidates into runoffs, as against 3 SPU, 2  Rukh, 1 MBR, and 1 DemPU (Post-Postup, 30 March).    -- In Donetsk, the Donetsk paper Aktsent on 1 April characterized  the election as a "colossal success" for leftists and a "full  defeat" for nationalists, citing several districts where  democrats got only a tiny percentage of votes.  The paper  reported that 4 of the 7 seats filled went to the CPU, while 32  of the 81 runoff candidates are CPU, 6 SPU, 4 Labor Party, 2  Civil Congress of Ukraine, and 1 each for SeLPU and the Liberal  Party.  There is no evidence so far that Rukh, the democratic  bloc, or even the Hrynyov-Kuchma MBR got into the runoffs.  Although Aktsent reported that only one Liberal Party candidate  got into the runoffs, the party itself claimed 4 of its  candidates would be in the runoffs (Rada, 31 March).     Rukh Territory     In sharp contrast to the east and south, Kiev city and the west  seem likely to be swept by the democratic bloc and Rukh, with the  CPU making little showing.     Kiev city.  Rukh did very well in the capitol, winning two seats  outright and getting into the runoffs in almost all of the 21  remaining districts, giving it a good chance of winning the  overwhelming majority of Kiev seats.  The two seats won by Rukh-  backed candidates--Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy and independent  radical economist Volodymyr Lanovyy--were the only Kiev city  seats won on the first round.  Judging by the list published by  the Post-Postup News Agency on 30 March and in the 29 March  Vecherniy Kiev, Rukh candidates or candidates affiliated with  Rukh got into runoffs in 20 of the other 21 districts, while Rukh  lost out in only one district.  Rukh's success is all the more  surprising because some of its prominent figures, such as Les  Tanyuk, chose to run outside Kiev city, leaving Rukh leaders  Holovatyy, Ivan Zayets, and Yuriy Kostenko, and independents  Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, former Defense Minister  Kostyantyn Morozov, and economist Lanovyy the only big names on  Rukh's endorsed list (published in the 17 March Rada).  Several  of the successful candidates on Rukh's endorsed list were  independents (Morozov, Karpenko, Lanovyy) or URP or KUN  candidates, rather than actual Rukh members.     No other party came anywhere near Rukh's success in Kiev city.  The UNA got 4 candidates into runoffs, the URP 3, CPU 3, SPU 1,  KUN 1, and the KNDS (Congress of National Democratic Forces) 1.  Ten independents got into runoffs.  Leftists were splintered, as  the CPU and SPU competed against each other in almost every  district (Post-Postup newspaper, 17-24 March).     Rukh even outstripped the democratic bloc of which it is a  member.  The democratic bloc endorsed candidates in only 14 of  the 23 districts, including 7 Rukh candidates, 4 URP, 1 KUN, and  2 independents (Narodna Hazeta, No. 11-12), and 13 of the 14 were  the same candidates as Rukh endorsed.  But the democratic bloc  did not endorse Lanovyy or Holovatyy and so backed neither of the  two elected in the first round, leaving it with no winners even  though Rukh won two.  Bloc-endorsed candidates placed in 12  district runoffs.     Lviv.  As expected, national democrats did very well in Lviv.  Rukh candidates won 3 of the nine seats settled on the first  round (out of 23 districts), the moderate national democratic New  Wave bloc also won 3, while the ultranationalist parties UKRP and  KUN each won 1, and an independent probably close to Rukh (Yevhen  Zherebetskyy, who actually had helped found the local Rukh in  1989, according to the 29 March Post-Postup) won the remaining  seat.     The democratic bloc, locally called the Political Consultative  Council of Lviv, did better than Rukh and may wind up with the  overwhelming majority of Lviv's seats.  It endorsed candidates  for all 23 districts, but since its member---parties often could  not agree on one single candidate, it usually endorsed two or  three candidates per district.  Its list of endorsees was  published in the 5 March Vysokyy Zamok.  Six of the endorsees won  on the first round (3 Rukh, 3 New Wave), and in one district both  runoff candidates are endorsees, guaranteeing a seventh seat for  the bloc.  In 10 other districts the bloc got at least one  candidate in the runoff, while its candidates lost in 6  districts.  Thus, the bloc has a chance of getting as many as 17  of the 23 seats.  Its loss in at least one district--number 268-  -appeared to be caused by the bloc backing two or three  candidates who probably split the democratic vote, allowing  candidates from the right extreme (KUN) and left extreme (CPU-  SPU) to win the two runoff positions.     Rukh did not do as well in Lviv as it did in the last election,  when, as the main democratic umbrella organization, it won most  seats, and it will have fewer members on Lviv's delegation to the  Supreme Soviet than the present 10 or so who still identify  themselves with Rukh, rather than with some other party.  This  year it ran candidates in 15 districts (Rada, 17 March) and saw 3  win, another 6 get into runoffs, and 6, including Lviv Rukh  Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy (who lost to a KUN candidate), lose.  In addition, Rukh backed 3 candidates from New Wave who were  elected.  In total, Rukh might get as much as 9 seats.     Among the other main parties in the democratic bloc, New Wave, a  coalition of democrats, did well, probably because it had  prominent candidates such as Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor  Pynzenyk.  It fielded only nine candidates (listed in the 12  January Za Vilnu Ukrainu), three got elected (Yukhnovskyy,  Pynzenyk, Ihor Koliushko), two got into runoffs (Taras Stetskiv  and Zoreslava Romovska), and four lost.     The URP, although based in Lviv and one of the oldest democratic  parties, did very poorly.  It ran candidates in 17 districts  (listed in the 24 March Za Vilnu Ukrainu), but none were elected  on the first ballot and only 4 got into runoffs, while 13 were  defeated.  Especially humiliating, its national chairman Mykhaylo  Horyn was defeated by ultranationalist Stepan Khmara in district  261.     Ultranationalist parties--KUN, UNA, UKRP, OUN (Organization of  Ukrainian Nationalists), and SNPU (Social---National Party of  Ukraine)--did poorly, probably because they ran so many  candidates against each other.  Ultranationalist candidates won 2  of the 9 seats settled and got candidates in the runoffs in 8  districts, but lost in 12 districts.  Their biggest success was  Khmara's defeat of Horyn, a sweet revenge for Khmara, since he  had been ousted as deputy leader of the URP in mid-1992 by  incoming Chairman Horyn as part of a move to shift the URP toward  a more centrist stance.  The other success was KUN nominee Ivan  Bilas's defeat of Lviv Rukh Chairman Klyuchkovskyy in district  278.  Most of the far right's successes, however, were by the  relatively moderate KUN, which won one seat and got candidates  into 6 runoffs.  The more radical UNA got candidates into 2  runoffs, including commander of its paramilitary arm (UNSO) Oleh  Vitovych in district 275 and UNA-UNSO chief of staff Yaroslav  Ilyasevich in district 282.  The semi-fascist SNPU, which had put  up candidates in 21 districts (Post-Postup newspaper, 17-24  March), got no one into runoffs (Post-Postup News Agency, 29  March).     Among leftists, few SPU and even fewer CPU candidates even  registered in Lviv, and it is not clear if the few that did had  any serious organizational support.  The lef t's only successes  were getting one SPU-CPU candidate (Ivan Kelman) into the runoff  in district 268 and one CPU candidate (Oleksandr Holub) into the  runoff in district 266.  In the latter case, the victory was a  fluke, since URP candidate Oleksandr Shandryuk won just under 50  percent, and in a badly splintered field Holub came in second  with only 7.7 percent (Post-Postup, 29 March).     Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil     Few results from the other two Galician oblasts are in yet, but  they, like Lviv, settled a high proportion of seats in the first  round and appeared to vote for national democrats or  ultranationalists.  Ivano-Frankivsk filled 6 of its 12 seats,  with 2 democratic bloc candidates, 2 DemPU, 1 URP, and 1 KUN  candidate winning, while Ternopil filled 4 of its 10 seats,  electing 1 each from Rukh, URP, UNA, and KUN (Post-Postup, 29  March).     Implications     Concentration of votes for the CPU and Rukh and the democratic  bloc may help reduce the large number of parties and create  larger factions in the new parliament, bringing improvement over  the present confused situation where few deputies adhere to any  faction and a majority is hard to rally.  The difficulties Rukh  and the democratic bloc have suffered in trying to agree on  common candidates suggests that they probably will not succeed in  creating a well-unified bloc in parliament.  The pre-election  expectation of a majority of unaffiliated deputies appeared to  favor President Leonid Kravchuk, Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan  Plyushch, and the present establishment--all of whom appeared to  want to keep parties weak.  A large CPU faction may pose a threat  to Kravchuk and to any future president, such as Kuchma, as well  as to reformers, since they will not be as subject to  manipulation as non-party deputies often dependent on the  establishment.  The apparent weakness of other leftist parties  and of the Liberal Party and MBR appears to throw the heavily  populated and politically dominant east and south into the hands  of the CPU.  Such a strong regional base for the CPU may  accentuate the tension with west Ukraine and more reformist  areas.  Thus, the election already may be signaling a significant  political realignment of political parties and regional forces.

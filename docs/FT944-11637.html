			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise sale The long-awaited sale by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company, of its near 10 per cent shareholding in Enterprise Oil, largest of the UK oil exploration companies, did little harm to Enterprise shares, which finished only a penny cheaper at 385p. Turnover, swollen by double-counting of the placing, reached 128m shares. Elf sold 50.8m Enterprise shares, its entire stake plus some stock jointly owned with Enterprise, comprising overall 10.3 per cent of Enterprise's equity. The stock was placed with international investors by a syndicate led by BZW and including Cazenove and Dresdner Bank. The deal involved a bought deal, with the syndicate believed to have paid 365p apiece for the shares and placed them at 369p, realising a profit of around Pounds 2m. Mr Steve Turner of Nomura said: 'In the short term there may be a bit of indigestion, but longer term it removes a major overhang from the shares.' The placing triggered heavy switching across the sector, with institutions selling blocks of Clyde Petroleum and Lasmo in order to buy into Enterprise on the view that the Enterprise stock was being sold at the year's low point. Lasmo was 1 1/2 firmer at 147 1/2 p after turnover of 5.4m, while Clyde, where a block of 4.7m shares, or just over 1 per cent, was sold at 37p, held at 39p.</p>

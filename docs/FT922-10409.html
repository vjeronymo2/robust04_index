			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Writing is on the wall for shoplifters - Worth Watching Retailers can cut shoplifting losses by using a new device developed by Knogo, the Marlow-based subsidiary of the the world's biggest electronic article surveillance producer, writes Richard Lapper. The device, dubbed KnoGlo, is a tag filled with indelible crimson or yellow stain which ruins articles if unauthorised removal is attempted. One version, the mini KnoGlo, is designed for use with a Knogo's electronic anti-theft system, while the Universal KnoGlo can be attached to most brands of tags. On a three-month test marketing trial the mini-tag was fixed to designer jeans in stores where losses of 5 per cent had been recorded. No thefts took place during the period. Knogo: UK, 0628 483040.</p>

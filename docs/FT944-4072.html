			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (5): Litigation is still clogging up courts - The Valuation Controversy / It is no surprise that the profession has spent the past two years engaged in critical self-examination The reputation of valuers suffered more in the recession than any other profession. Litigation surrounding negligent valuations is still clogging up the courts. The widely differing valuations of Queens Moat Houses hotel portfolio undermined the credibility of traditional open market valuations. It is, therefore, no surprise that the profession has spent the last two years engaged in critical self-examination. Since most of the outstanding litigation is between valuers and banks, valuations made for secured lending purposes were the first to be overhauled. In conjunction with the British Bankers Association, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors issued a guidance note giving detailed advice on how valuations conducted for banks should be carried out. This introduced the concept of 'estimated realisation price' (ERP) - the price that would be achieved if the property was put on the market immediately, rather than the price that would be achieved if a sale was agreed today. The wider response to the painful experience of recession came with the Mallinson Report, which was published in April and contains 43 detailed recommendations. The main message was that the existing rules and techniques for valuation are broadly satisfactory, but need to be refined. The institution acted rapidly on one of the report's main recommendations: that guidance for valuers contained in the Red and White Books should be consolidated in a single volume and supplemented with additional rules. The old Red Book was actually very limited in scope, laying down rules for valuations which would be relied upon by third parties other than the client. In practice, this covers valuations likely to appear in public documents such as company accounts and prospectuses. The new Red Book will be much wider in scope, covering virtually all valuations apart from advice given to potential sellers in the course of agency work. It also introduces the concept of estimated realisation price as an established basis of valuation. The institution hopes that the contrast between estimated realisation price and open market valuation will increase understanding among clients. Not everyone agrees. Some in the profession think that enshrining an alternative valuation basis will cause confusion. How clients react to ERP remains to be seen. But the new Red Book goes to great lengths to improve mutual understanding between the valuer and the client. This was another of the messages from the Mallinson Report. It said, for example, that valuers should decline instructions where the client was not prepared to disclose the purpose of the valuation. The new Red Book also demands that valuers obtain written instructions before undertaking work. Insurance companies have estimated that 45 per cent of professional indemnity claims could be avoided avoided if the instructions to the valuer from the client had been written down. But the new Red Book is not a definitive response to the Mallinson report. The report recommended that the 'all-risk yield' method used by valuers should be refined, and that alternative techniques should be explored to provide a cross-check for results. The institution has set up working parties to look at these issues. Some would like to go further, faster. The British Association of Hotel Accountants has suggested a method of valuing hotels based on discounted cash flow analysis rather than market evidence and yields. This has been rejected by the institution on the grounds that the worth of a property to its owner - as defined by discounted cash flow techniques - may have little connection to its value in the open market. Besides, present accounting rules demand that published accounts should show open market valuations based on best practice as defined by the Red Book. However, the lesson of recession is that valuers can not afford simply to state open market value without explanation if their valuation diverges from underlying considerations of worth. Over time, valuers will have to accept the Mallinson Report's insistence that valuers should be familiar with a range of approaches to valuation and be prepared to explain their findings to clients.</p>

A source at the talks said that the meeting is being held as  a response to a request by the observers who hope that one  week-old differences will be overcome and hope that the two  sides will approve specific principles for national  reconciliation tomorrow. One of the points of disagreement that  is being discussed at the meeting relates to UNITA's radio  station the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel, also  known as VORGAN. According to Angolan legislation, political  parties can own publications but cannot own radio stations.  Meanwhile, UNITA considers VORGAN an exception because it  already existed before the legislation was approved.    Another point of disagreement relates to the country's  administrative decentralization, which the government says is  already being implemented. Meanwhile, UNITA wants provincial  government to have its own power, at several levels, as well as  its own budgetary capacities. Moreover, UNITA wants the  principle relating to holding provincial and locals elections to  be defined in Lusaka, following a transitional period.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Heidrun Graupner: "With an Internal Compass for </F> Democracy"]    [Text] Munich, Apr--She pinned the letter to her bulletin  board in the entrance hall. Every 11 May, she receives a letter  from Johannes Rau and last year, it was her 72d birthday, he  included with almost prophetic prescience a quotation from  Martin Buber: "Old age is wonderful, if one has not forgotten  what it means to begin." However, the new beginning in October  of last year was intense even for a Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. She  talked even then about alternating hot and cold baths and now,  in the April before the presidential election, Free Democratic  Party [FDP] Chair Klaus Kinkel provided an additional cold  shower with his coalition declaration in favor of the union  parties [Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union  (CDU/CSU)].    October was a particularly turbulent month. Hans-Dietrich  Genscher had handed the FDP his final rejection and the  political barometer of ZDF [Second German TV] jumped to 15  percent at the mention of Hamm-Bruecher's name. Hamm-Bruecher  was unanimously chosen on 15 October at the small party  convention in Magdeburg, although some FDP leaders would have  preferred to sacrifice the queen in this game of chess almost  immediately. They were talking about the nominee when Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher stated emphatically that she did not see herself  as a chip in a poker game--a sentiment she had to express  several times. Then the Union parties revealed a quotation from  her about the GDR "embassy refugees," with the transparent  accusation that she had been opposed to unification. She,  herself, finally suggested in June to nominate civil rights  advocate Jens Reich from eastern Berlin. Since then, her  candidacy has irritated some people more than Jens Reich,  himself, who dismisses such matters with a smile. She said that  the FDP wanted somebody who represented the party and that Reich  would not have been accepted even if she had renounced her  candidacy.  <H5>  "To Begin Is Important" </H5>   The past few weeks in the Swiss Alps, she had time to ponder  Kinkel's coalition declaration and her own motivation for  persevering as a candidate. The party leadership had reassured  her that its assent just suggested an attitude and that her  candidacy would now be supported more strongly. Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher allowed herself to be appeased although she had  never liked coalition declarations. She has often expressed such  sentiments because assent can lead to restricted maneuverability  and that could be dangerous for the FDP. Opposition would be a  better choice.    Some FDP members would indeed have been pleased, if the  bothersome challenger had voluntarily withdrawn after Heitmann's  retreat, but this never occurred to her. The decisive reason for  her candidacy was not just Heitmann, the union parties'  candidate, nor winning the election. When starting something,  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher often said to herself "even if it fails,  it was still the right course of action. That is my idea of  democracy." Her reason for running has been part of her campaign  from the beginning: To strengthen the image of the FDP since  even the union parties do not take the FDP seriously. "We are  not an appendix, nor are we a bloc party."    She does not, however, have to tell us that she is sometimes  simply possessed by thoughts about the unexpected possibility  that her long political life will not just cease, that she may  again have a chance to express her ideas--and be listened to as  well. Wherever she appears, she enjoys the crowds with her head  held high and always with a friendly smile. The people flock to  her. "Hildegard for president" has triggered ovations. The  controversial politician stands for populism and does not  represent party cliques. This is important, even for the FDP, at  this time of disaffection with politics in a gloomy election  year. She is invited to everything and speaks at the opening of  the Leipzig Book Fair, at election rallies, and at local clubs  to "groups of frustrated people who have an urgent need to  listen." Even the party leadership may summon her and make her  the centerpiece, as--for instance--at the Stuttgart epiphany  meeting.    She has always called herself "a freelance liberal," and  boasted about her independence. To take an unequivocal position  was probably unavoidable for a woman who wanted to advance in  the male-dominated political environment of the past 46 years.  She says that she is sometimes ruthless and inconsiderate when  anger gets the better of her. But she had the mark of a  politician as early as 1946 when in the small state of  Wuerttemberg-Baden she met the minister of culture with the name  of Theodor Heuss. The Bruecher siblings lost their parents at an  early age. The youngest three were raised in Dresden by their  Jewish grandmother who killed herself when she was to be  deported to Theresienstadt. Later, when Hildegard Bruecher  studied chemistry in Munich, she became involved with the White  Rose circle. Nobel-prize winner Heinrich Otto Wieland, her  doctoral mentor, and chance saved her.    Theodor Heuss remained the dominant figure in her life, and  there is hardly an occasion when she does not quote him. "He was  actually the first German who talked positively to me about  democracy." Since then, she fights relentlessly to keep  democracy from failing. She can almost understand why she is  sometimes referred to in FDP circles by the title "her  sacerdotal eminence, spokeswoman for a political conscience,"  because in the eighties she annoyed her colleagues "to the very  end" with parliamentary reform. However, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher  also practiced what she preached, namely that a representative  is not bound by the dictates of his party but only by his  conscience. She voted against tax-free aviation gas, against the  Fighter-90, and against party-donation amnesty. Gerhard Baum, at  least, said that she was responsible for raising his  "self-esteem as a parliamentarian."    On 1 October 1982, the day of the no-confidence vote in  Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher said before  the German Bundestag: "I cannot cast a vote of no confidence  against the chancellor of the coalition government, for just a  few months ago, I expressed my confidence in him." She also said  that Schmidt did not deserve to be toppled without voter  approval and that Helmuth Kohl did not deserve to become  chancellor without voter approval. Both events carried the  "stigma of violating democratic protocol." At that point the  parliamentary Foreign Ministry undersecretary resigned from the  government but remained a Bundestag representative. Her career  was ruined, however. The word in Bonn is that from then on  Chancellor Kohl never again acknowledged the existence of  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, on the other  hand, is again writing favorable articles about her and he voted  for the candidate.    Yet scars remain on both sides. Maybe for that reason  achievements that are her own are very important to her; for  instance, the '93 charter for the Munich Citizens Association  that she initiated and the Theodor Heuss Foundation. Sometimes  she says that nothing has remained of her work and ideas, and  that only a "few survivors" are still interested. In the  mid-sixties, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher felt really at home in the  FDP. With Hermann Flach amd Ralf Dahrendorf, she called this the  time of political awakening. She can only visualize a switch to  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in theory. "The  external surroundings would have been quite intolerable and  would not have agreed with me."    She is a grande dame who says that she is barely on familiar  terms even with herself. Her arguments with the Greens are less  about substance than about their appearance. Even at age 72, her  patrician heritage prevents her from lifting the curtain on her  private life. The liberal Protestant has been married for more  than 40 years to Erwin Hamm, a Catholic and member of the CDU,  who worked for many years as a social and health administrator  in Munich. When he derides her Protestant work ethics, she  replies that it is the only way she can fritter her time away.  The pile of books and articles that she has written on the side  proves her point. Erwin Hamm once called her the "family Jeanne  d'Arc" of Bonn, which clearly characterizes her better than to  call her a feminist, although she spent her entire life  practicing politics as a woman.    When she started in 1948, she was the youngest city  councillor in Munich and she was always the first: she was the  first female Bundestag group chair, the first female  parliamentary undersecretary, the first female national deputy  party chief, and the first woman in the Foreign Ministry, which  caused men some consternation. "But they were polite," she says,  "initially they sent me to a playground and that was proper  because it enabled me to gain a global perspective."    She had to suffer many indignities, and in the Bavarian  Landtag, she sometimes felt as if she were futilely baying at  the moon. In the early sixties, the Bavarian FDP was drifting to  the right and wanted to get rid of her because she could not be  "integrated." The citizens saw it differently and gave twice as  many votes to her 17th place on the list than to those who  occupied the first places. In 1984 she toppled the Bavarian  minister of justice, Theodor Maunz, because of his Nazi  background. She constantly fought for better cultural and  changed educational policies and succeeded to bring about a  referendum against parochial schools. She is still advocating a  plebiscite clause in the constitution. The opening of the school  system to children of all social classes--and thus, above all,  to girls--was, she thinks, her most important achievement. She  cannot understand the FDP's neglect of educational policies,  policies that are "liberal beacons, and subjects for mind and  spirit."  <H5>  Toying With Intriguing Ideas </H5>   Now she is again the first and convinced that, "in  principle," it will be easier in the future for a woman to be a  presidential candidate. She finds the thought of "a male  president--a female president" intriguing--and, she says, she is  up to it. Her hesitation over these words, relates to her 72  years, an age "in which one cannot simply continue one's life as  it happens to be at the moment." Yet, she knows exactly what she  would do as president--it is something that the protagonist of a  rejuvenated democracy has always championed. She is surprised  that so far nothing has been said about the foreign-policy  aspect of the presidency, since Weizsaecker had made a pivotal  impact on the image of the Federal Republic abroad. In this  area, too, she feels confident because of her six-year  experience in the Foreign Ministry.    On 2 May the FDP Executive Committee will vote on the  coalition declaration. Also at issue will be the presidential  election and votes for Roman Herzog, for Johannes Rau, and for  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. So far only Secretary General Werner  Hoyer has said that a third ballot with the party's own  candidate would be the least-flawed solution. It will be  interesting, especially for the candidate who has never taken so  much care in drafting her speeches as in her present position in  which she has promised to polish the party's image. What action  FDP members will take on 23 May remains to be seen. "Some people  will settle old scores with me in the election booth." This will  certainly be her last major role on the political stage--a  thought that also concerns her. As a young girl, Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher was a good gymnast. She has not forgotten that one  is judged not only for the execution of the exercises but also  for one's dismount.</p>

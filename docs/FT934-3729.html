			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Paper calls for big new investments in 'info-highways' and infrastructure One of the main causes of Europe's decline in competitiveness is the slowdown in infrastructure investment of the past 10 years, according to the Delors White Paper, writes David Gardner. The challenges involved in moving into the 21st century therefore involve big new investment in the 'information highways' of the new industrial revolution, and in pan-European transport, energy and environmental infrastructure, it says. Developing an advanced information society and economy, the paper says, in a characteristically Delors turn of phrase, 'is a crucial aspect in the survival or decline of Europe'. The development of new information technology, the White Paper envisages, would be financed almost entirely by private capital, while the transport and energy networks would be financed by a mix of public and private funding. In both cases, the EU and member states would play an enabling and catalytic role, and the White Paper emphasises that deregulation of the telecommunications sector is vital. The Commission also wants the EU to encourage inter-company co-operation on research and development, in 'a limited number of major joint projects', not only in information networks, but in bio-technology and eco-technologies. The Commission proposes EU financing of about Ecu20bn (Pounds 15bn) a year between 1994 and 1999. About Ecu5.3bn would come from the EU budget and Ecu6.7bn would be in loans from the European Investment Bank. But a further Ecu7bn could be raised, the paper says, by issuing 'Union Bonds' on the capital markets, taking advantage of the EU's high credit rating. The balance would come from a further new instrument, a 'convertible' bond issued by a company funding a project, backed by the European Investment Fund, set up a year ago. The information technology drive, the White Paper estimates, would cost some Ecu150bn over the next 10 years, and Ecu67bn in 1994-99 for eight 'priority' projects. The White Paper specifies areas where the effort should be concentrated, such as developing a high-speed communications network. But Mr Delors wants a 'Task Force on European Information Infrastructures' to be set up, with a mandate from the Twelve to kick-start the projects by mid-1994. The Commission, as envisaged under the Maastricht treaty, would play a more leading role on transport and energy infrastructure. The White Paper reckons Ecu250bn investment is needed by the end of the century, mainly in rail, road, airport and gas pipeline infrastructure, building links within Europe and to its eastern and southern neighbours. Eight projects requiring Ecu95bn in 1994-99 are identified as priorities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Savvateyeva: "Counterintelligence Intends </F> To Probe Officials. Why?"]    [Text] As the paper TRUD reported the other day, during a  routine meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the staff of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), the president issued  instructions for a probe of all officials of the president's  apparatus, government apparatus, and all top power structures  for corruption.    When approached by IZVESTIYA, the FCS refused point-blank to  comment on the subject -- even to provide information on whether  the "instructions" were verbal or in the form of a document.  The FCS Public Relations Center announced that no one would  talk with us about the president's directive. The actual FCS  chief, Sergey Stepashin, perhaps... Stepashin's day was  described as "very busy," of course -- today and in the  immediate future.    But this report, made in passing, appears highly important  and worthy of attention. And since there is no official  informatiom to be had on the subject we will have to use  guesswork.    Hypothesis number one. The president really is intent on a  "shake-up" at the top in order to fight corruption. The fact  that there are indeed things to combat militates in favor of  this scenario. Moreover, this kind of activity brings political  dividends: Fighters against corruption invariably enjoy public  esteem.    But this tidy scenario is spoiled by the simple  consideration  that mass measures of a similar nature, embarked on on more than  one occasion before, have generally got nowhere. They have been  ineffective at any rate. And the people who thought up the  latest "purge" are certainly aware of this. It occurs to one  that these people had some special intention, somehwat different  from the stated intention. What is it?    Hypothesis number two.    If one assumes that the president and his analysts are aware  of the ineffectiveness of mass "purges," then one deduces that  they are taking an interest not in all the "top structures of  state power" but only a certain segment of them.    Analysts tend to believe that it is likely to be the  government apparatus. To be precise, Chernomyrdin's immediate  entourage.    The beginning of the year has clearly been marked by a  strengthening of the premier's position. The January government  reshuffle and the recent appointment of two new vice premiers  graphically demonstrated the extent of the Cabinet of Ministers  chief's independence. But the premier is finding a common  language with parliament. At any rate, he is treated very  fairly both in the Duma and in the Senate. His rating is  steadily rising.    Observers point out that the "Gazprom" concern could be  significantly strengthened in the very near future -- if it  succeeds in taking over part of the infrastructure and some of  the oil refineries in Ukraine which are seriously in debt to the  Russian oil industry. Clearly, this will also strengthen the  premier's positions.    If this scenario is correct, then, experts believe, the  people bound up with the oil structures will have a claim to be  "leading figures" in anticorruption cases. The reasoning behind  this is that there have been more and more reports in the press  of late about offenses being committed by those specializing in  oil exports. According to this scenario, there will very  probably be major oil scandals in the very near future.    It is also thought that currently influential vice premier  Oleg Soskovets could also feature in Chernomyrdin's "oil"  entourage. He had had a lot of oilmen "attacking" him of late.  Suddenly all the "attacks" stopped, Soskovets turned out to be  their friend, and even arranged for some benefits for the oilmen.    But there is also the suggestion that the cases of  corruption  will not result in serious scandals. The president's current  instructions, made public quite deliberately in the media, will  simply "frighten" certain people and do the job that way.  Although it is not inconceivable that the fight against  corruption could result in some government changes.</p>

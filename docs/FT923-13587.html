			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Finita la commedia 'CRISIS' HAS so long been the normal state of Italian politics and state finances that foreigners are in danger of underestimating the crisis Italy is now experiencing. A rampant public sector deficit, an inconclusive election result followed by a 16-ballot presidential election, the country's top anti-Mafia magistrate murdered, leading politicians indicted for corruption, a fragile government formed after prolonged horse-trading, the public contemptuous of politics: so what else is new? Italians will go on working and making money, even if much of it is concealed from the authorities. Italy will remain a delightful country to visit and an enjoyable if sometimes exasperating one to do business with. Its politics, happily, will remain the least interesting thing about it. Perhaps that instinctive response of the outsider will prove right, yet again. But this time Italy may have to confront some painful choices. The corruption and irresponsibility of the postwar state has in some respects been cumulative rather than static. The scale of corruption revealed by the current scandal in Milan - particularly in the higher reaches of the Socialist party - goes beyond what even the most shameless politician would have attempted in the 1950s or 60s: one reason why it has come to light is that contractors can no longer afford kickbacks of the size demanded. Similarly the proportion of revenue absorbed in servicing the public debt has grown to almost unmanageable size. The recession does not help, even if it has affected Italy later and less drastically than other European countries. In addition, the convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht present a serious challenge to a country which needs both economically and psychologically to be in the European Community's first tier. Above all, the Italian state is a child, and therefore now an orphan, of the cold war - its domestic politics dictated by the choice in favour of the west made in 1948. It has put up with an ever more corrupt and inefficient political system mainly because the only alternative appeared to be a communist-dominated government. But today, communism is no longer an alibi for the ruling class. That is why last April voters plumped in unusual numbers for maverick, anti-system parties, including some which call into question the unity of the country. The result of that election is paradoxical: a government composed of the same parties as before, with a narrow majority, but conscious of the need for drastic fiscal and institutional reform. It has begun boldly, by taking the axe to Italy's legendary cornucopia of a state pension system. If it carries on like this it should, according to the traditional rules, collapse. But this time traditional rules may not apply. Maybe the government will be able to appeal over the head of parliament to a wider public, which knows that the price of the usual governmental failure would this time be too high.</p>

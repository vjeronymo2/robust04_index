			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph is LA NACION introduction] </F>   [Text] Discussing foot-and-mouth disease, the administrator  of Senasa [National Service for Animal Health] said that this  disease, which first appeared in Bariloche and then spread to  other areas, will soon be fully under control.    Senasa's general administrator, Dr. Bernardo Cane, yesterday  told LA NACION that within 60 days the situation in Rio Negro  will be fully normalized. There, because of the outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease in the region, approximately 9,000 sheep  were sacrificed to prevent the spread of disease.    Shortly after his return to Buenos Aires from that region,  Cane, in a telephone interview, said that the strategy  implemented by his organization, including the slaughter of  animals, vaccination, revaccination, restrictions on livestock  movements, the establishment of new fixed checkpoints, and the  inspection of meatpacking plants and pig-breeding facilities,  would be operational within 90 days.    Thirty days have now elapsed, so he felt that within 60 more  days the situation will be absolutely under control. Efforts are  continuing to achieve that goal.    He said that in Bariloche 125,000 animals were revaccinated  and there are no signs of danger. In Viedma a similar number of  animals have been vaccinated and revaccinated.    Concerning the last eight outbreaks in Adolfo Alsina, San  Antonio Oeste, and General Conesa, he said that immediate action  was taken, as on the other occasions, and that the situation was  under control.  <H5>  No Danger </H5>   The official also said there was no danger for either Buenos  Aires or Chubut and, when asked if what had happened could pose  some risk to the progress of the National Plan to Eradicate  Foot-and-Mouth Disease, he emphatically said no. "On a national  level," he said, "everything is going very well. In the last  three months there were only seven instances reported all over  the country (not including the ones in Rio Negro); this will  absolutely not impede the progress of the plan."    Foot-and-mouth disease causes Argentina losses of $300  million a year because of international restrictions on our  meats.  <H5>  Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan </H5>   In his conversation with LA NACION, Cane said that the area  covered by Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego, that is,  the area south of the 42d parallel, is considered by  international organizations as a disease-free zone not requiring  vaccination.    He also said that starting tomorrow, staffers from the Pan  American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, from INTA [National  Institute of Agricultural-Livestock Technology], and Senasa will  begin work on a Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan to standardize a  package of epidemiological measures that, when implemented in  the mid-term--it cannot yet be determined exactly when--will  enable Neuquen and Rio Negro Provinces to regain the status of  vaccination-free zones.    Neuquen does not vaccinate and to protect itself from this  disease it has banned the entry in its territory of meat  containing bones--the virus multiplies in the bone marrow.  Furthermore, Senasa has declared Neuquen free from  foot-and-mouth disease, and for the past 10 years no outbreaks  of this disease have been reported.    The Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan will now attempt to have  this  province and Rio Negro internationally recognized as regions  free from foot-and-mouth disease.  <H5>  Sacrifice </H5>   When asked whether it was absolutely necessary to sacrifice  animals, Cane answered that firmness in making such decisions  counts for a great deal with international organizations.    "By sacrificing these animals it is possible to recover  disease-free status within one year; if that is not done, it  takes at least two years, and by 1995 we want to have this  disease under control," said Cane.    He added that both the European Union and Chile supported  the  measures taken by Senasa and have not imposed restrictions on  our products.    Chile--the only country in South America recognized as free  from foot-and-mouth disease--is at this time the third-ranking  buyer of our meats, following Germany and Italy. Every year it  buys 25,000 tons of refrigerated choice meat cuts.    Concerning his position as Senasa's director, Cane said his  resignation is still under consideration by Secretary of  Agriculture Felipe Sola. However, he reiterated his desire to  continue working with all the sectors involved, "for we all  share this responsibility."    A few days ago Cane said in a statement to Telam that  "mistakes were made on a national and provincial level and by  producers and the meat-packing industry," which contributed to  the spread of this disease south of the Colorado River.</p>

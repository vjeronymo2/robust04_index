			<p>BFN     [Text] PLO leader 'Arafat appealed for a holy war to free  Jerusalem and this was broadcast on the Israeli Radio and, of  course, created a great stir. At his press conference in Oslo  today, 'Arafat said that the holy war, jihad, is a religious  term and that with this word he meant a peaceful campaign.    [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] What I had mentioned  exactly, a religious terminology. Jihad, for your information,  I will continue my jihad to achieve peace. [end recording]    [Correspondent Johan Fredriksson] Well, PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat is of the opinion that he has been misinterpreted. The  Israeli Radio had obtained a tape from a meeting in South Africa  two weeks ago. Israeli Radio broadcast this tape and it created  concern in peace efforts. Yasir 'Arafat used the Arabic word  jihad, a holy war, but the statement was just part of religious  terminology and what 'Arafat meant was a sort of peaceful  crusade for the Palestinian cause, he said. And thus he and the  Norwegian mediators were of the opinion that the new threat  against the ongoing peace process was alleviated.    As a confirmation of this, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres appeared quite unexpectedly at the news conference in Oslo  and then even 'Arafat was surprised. Shim'on Peres said he was  satisfied that Yasir 'Arafat has confirmed his and his  organization's commitment to the peace process in the Middle  East. This is Johan Fredriksson, Oslo.</p>

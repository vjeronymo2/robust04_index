			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> It has come to our attention that the provisions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing &sect;403.504, particularly paragraph (d) of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, have caused confusion because they do not clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the above process. (Some interpreted paragraph (d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as indicating that there was a two-step process involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for the grants. That is, that a State applied for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and was awarded a basic grant and that, if there were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional funds available, the State submitted another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and a subsequent award was made.) This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revises &sect;403.504 to more clearly reflect the award process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> D. Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with section 4360(c) of OBRA '90, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule retains existing &sect;&sect;403.508 (a) and (b), with editorial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide that a State that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives a grant under this program may, with one exception,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the grant for any expenses incurred in planning,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing, implementing, and/or operating the program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the grant is made. The exception applies to a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that receives a grant to supplement an existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantially similar'' program. In this case, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award of the grant and funded through other sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including in-kind contributions), but must maintain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities of the program at least at the level that those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities were conducted immediately preceding that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (States will be required to provide information to document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their maintenance of effort and funding levels.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> E. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with section 4360(e) of OBRA '90, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the State to submit to us an annual report on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICA program, this rule provides that a State that receives a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant under this program must submit at least one annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to us and any additional reports we prescribe in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of grant award. It further specifies that HCFA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advise the State of the requirements concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency, timing, and contents of the report(s) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of grant award that it sends to the State. This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removes existing paragraph (d) (``Annual report'') from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;403.508 and establishes a new &sect;403.510 (``Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements'') to set forth the reporting requirements as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> F. Administration of Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule adds &sect;403.512(a) to identify those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions that control the administration of the ICA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants. Section 403.512 specifies that health insurance ICA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants are administered in accordance with the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 CFR part 403, subpart E; certain provisions of 45 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 74 (``Administration of Grants''), 45 CFR part 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments''), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of the solicitation, and terms of the notice of grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> award. Section 403.512(a) also specifies that, except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum funding levels established by &sect;403.504(b)(1),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of conflict between a provision of the notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of grant award and any provision of the solicitation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E of 42 CFR part 403, or of 45 CFR part 74 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 92, the terms of the notice of grant award prevail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule adds &sect;403.512(b) to state that HCFA provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to each applicant regarding HCFA's decision on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for grant funding under &sect;403.504.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule adds &sect;403.512(c) to enable States to appeal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 45 CFR part 16, HCFA's determination regarding its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant application. 45 CFR part 16 contains procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appealing a final decision to our Departmental Grant Appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> G. Technical Change_Definition of ``State''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule revises the definition of ``State'' at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;403.500(c) to correct the inadvertent omission of ``the 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States'' from the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

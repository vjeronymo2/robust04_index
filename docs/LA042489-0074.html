			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SCORPION' ANYTHING BUT STINGING  </P> <P> "Red Scorpion" (citywide) is a numskull live-action comic book designed to show  off a stolid Dolph Lundgren as a super-hero.  </P> <P> Writer Arne Olsen and director Joseph Zito would have us believe that Lundgren  is a Soviet assassin dispatched to an Angolalike African nation to kill the  leader of a rebellion against oppressive Soviet-led Cuban forces. (The leader,  played by South African actor Ruben Nthodi, is reportedly based on Jonas  Savimbi, a pro-Western leader of an Angolan guerrilla movement and ally of  South Africa.) It scarcely requires a crystal ball to predict that Lundgren's  Nikolai, "the perfect killing machine," will undergo a change of heart and  realize who the true oppressors are.  </P> <P> The film makers aren't actually all that interested in the plight of the  citizens of the fictional Mombaka. (They, in fact, weathered much adverse  publicity from anti-apartheid groups for filming in Namibia and for obtaining  from South Africa the military equipment seen in the picture.) The idea is to  put Nikolai through the same kind of severe muscle-flexing test of his strength  and courage that Steve Reeves used to endure in his spear-and-sandal epics.  </P> <P> Lundgren is not without humor, and he reveals a surprisingly engaging smile.  However, films like "Red Scorpion" (rated R for language and heavy violence)  are in the long run likely to hinder rather than further his career. KEVIN  THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / US calls for more cuts in interest rates THE US yesterday said that further interest rates cuts were needed in Europe to boost growth. Mr Roger Altman, the US deputy Treasury secretary, said the US welcomed last week's reduction in the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard rates. He said that the recent pace of reductions in European interest rates was 'good'. But it hoped that the process of lowering European interest rates would continue. Mr Altman made his comments to journalists at the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after addressing the bank's annual meeting. His remarks suggested that that Germany could come under pressure from its Group of Seven partners later this week to accelerate the easing of its monetary policy. The G7 is due to meet on Thursday in Washington to discuss the state of the world economy amid concern at the spread of recession to Japan, Germany and other continental European countries. Senior British Treasury officials said yesterday that the emergence of recession to these parts of the world more than offset encouraging signs of recovery in the US and the UK. The officials also said the UK would press at this week's spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for wage restraint in the international financial institutions. The UK had been disappointed not to win a majority on the IMF and World Bank boards to reduce this year's 6 per cent pay increases at the two bodies.</p>

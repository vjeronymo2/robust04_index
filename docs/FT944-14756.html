			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Figure was accurate Sir, Your report, 'Merseyside union official steps down' (October 20), on the resignation of Mr Alan Quinn from the T&amp;G's executive quotes Mr Quinn as claiming that the union accepts that the published figure for his expenses is inaccurate. This is not, in fact, the case. Attention was drawn to Mr Quinn's expenses following the publication in the union journal, as now required by law, of the amounts claimed over the past year by himself and all other members of our lay executive. Mr Quinn asserted that the published figure was untrue, as a result of which an inquiry was established to ascertain the position. This investigation has established that the figure published for payments made to Mr Quinn is, in fact, accurate. There is no question of the T&amp;G's financial officer having accepted that the published expenses figure for Mr Quinn of Pounds 15,181 is 'inaccurate and not true'. Bill Morris, general secretary, Transport and General Workers Union, Transport House, Smith Square, Westminster, London SW1P 3JB</p>

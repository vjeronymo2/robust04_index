			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Institute of Economic Affairs Conference on Regulation: Monopolies probe for Manchester airport THE Civil Aviation Authority will soon refer Manchester airport to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in the first stage in a five-yearly review of pricing at the airport. Sir Christopher Tugendhat, the CAA's chairman, said the referral, within the next six months, would be part of a general inquiry into Manchester airport. It had built up a substantial monopoly in the north with a throughput of passengers three times as high as at Glasgow airport. Sir Christopher said the growing use of Manchester meant the government would need to consider whether another runway should be built shortly after the turn of the century. He told the conference airport regulation would become much tougher with the CAA's consideration over the next few months of what price cap to impose on airline charges at airports in the London area. He said: 'The work we have had to do on airport regulation so far has been relatively straightforward, but I fear this honeymoon is coming to an end.' Sir Christopher hinted that whatever price cap was decided on, Heathrow airport would not be allowed to alter its charges to favour long-haul services at the expense of domestic services. He said that would threaten services between Heathrow and regional airports. It would also put at risk the future of UK airlines which depended heavily on domestic routes while leaving British Airways unaffected, and could inhibit regional development.</p>

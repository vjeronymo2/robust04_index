			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Inspectors want urgent action on GNVQs Urgent action is needed to improve the new General National Vocational Qualifications, which ministers hope will be taken by a quarter of all 16-year-olds, government inspectors said yesterday. The Office for Standards in Education, the schools watchdog, said the qualifications - dubbed 'vocational A-levels' by the government - needed a more manageable assessment of standards, better course design and tougher external checks. It said that the rate of improvement since Ofsted last reported on the qualifications during their pilot 12 months ago was 'far too slow'. Advanced GNVQs completed their pilot earlier this year, and were attempted by only 3,800 students. Mr Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, said: 'We are concerned that if urgent action is not taken then the credibility of the qualifications will be undermined. That would be a tragedy, given the possibilities which now lie before us.' He pointed to problems in the way the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the quango which administers the new qualifications, assessed standards. He said that external assessors did not check that different institutions used the same gradings when setting assessment, and the curriculum had not been defined with sufficient clarity. The national council stresses that it measures competencies, using the driving test as an analogy. Mr Woodhead rejected the comparison, pointing out that employers wanted some idea of how well students had performed, rather than whether they had managed to pass. The inspectors said the coursework produced for advanced GNVQs - taken in the sixth form - was equivalent in its standard to two academic A-levels, in line with government intentions. However, 25 per cent of work for intermediate GNVQs did not come up to the intended standard of four GCSEs. The Further Education Funding Council for England published a report on GNVQs in colleges, which have a stronger tradition of training and vocational education than schools. It found that the strengths of GNVQs outweighed their weaknesses but identified 'teething problems'. These included variable assessment practices and too little attention to the 'core skills' of literacy and numeracy. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said the reports 'powerfully reinforced' the list of demands for improvement which he gave the national council earlier this year. He said that reforms were now needed 'with still greater urgency'. Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, acknowledged 'inevitable teething problems' with the qualification. He said the council was 'working very hard to accelerate the development of our quality system'. GNVQs in Schools 1993-94. Ofsted. HMSO. Pounds 3.95.

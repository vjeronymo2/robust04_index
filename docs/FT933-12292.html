			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Why it can pay to go foreign  -Financing SECOND cars normally are bought out of taxed income, which makes first cost a matter of great importance. So, how can you limit the amount of capital that has to be invested - or borrowed - to buy what is bound to be a depreciating asset? If saving pennies is important, it can pay to think foreign - to faraway places where cars with strange-sounding names are made. Have you, for example, ever heard of a Kia, Hyundai, Proton or Sao Penza? Possibly not. But should you be in the market for a brand-new second car, make a note of the names. Kia and Hyundai are Korean; Proton is Malaysian; and Sao Penza, despite sounding like a minor Portugese saint, is South African. Just to complicate matters further, deep down they have a lot of Japanese in them. A Kia Pride is really the former Mazda 121 hatchback (which, incidentally, was sold for some years in the US as a Ford Festiva. The explanation is that Ford owns a large chunk of Toyo Kogyo, which makes Mazdas). Both Hyundais and Protons make use of a lot of Mitsubshi technology, although Hyundai is pioneering new models entirely of its own design. And the Sao Penza is a born-again, old-model Mazda 323. Oriental provenance apart, they also have very competitive on-road pricing in common. A Kia Pride is a tall, thin car of super-mini size with generous head room, three or five doors, and a choice of 1.1 or 1.3-litre engines. The controls, including steering, are light, it rides pretty well and it is cheap - about Pounds 500 cheaper than a comparable Rover Metro, for example. Prices start at Pounds 5,499 for the four-speed, 1.1-litre three-door, and Pounds 6,899 buys the longer-wheelbase five-door with a 1.3-litre engine and five-speed gearbox. Hyundai's entry model is the X2 1.3-litre three-door with a four-speed gearbox. It costs Pounds 6,498, which makes it more than Pounds 400 cheaper than the most basic Renault Clio. But if you fancy driving a sporty-looking two-door, a 1.5-litre, five-speed Hyundai S-Coupe is quite a bargain at Pounds 9,938. And an up-market Hyundai Lantra 1.6 GLSi saloon, complete with power steering and four electric windows, costs only Pounds 10,298, undercutting the cheapest 1.4-litre Rover 400 (without power steering) by nearly Pounds 500. Proton 1.3 and 1.5-litre four-door saloons and five-door Aerobacks resemble closely the Lancers that Mitsubishi stopped making in Japan several years ago. All have five-speed gearboxes and power steering, standard on the 1.5-litre models, is a Pounds 350 option on all but the basic 1.3 litre. Prices start at Pounds 6,990 for a four-door, and even a top-model automatic Proton Aeroback 1.5 is less than Pounds 10,000. The Sao Penza is a South African-built version of the old Mazda 323 - the car that was so similar to the last model Ford Escort that it was even sold as one in some south-east Asian markets. It has a 1.3-litre engine, five gears, and is equipped simply. Build quality is up to Japanese standards but the cost is low - Pounds 6,623 for the three-door, Pounds 6,479 for a five-door. There are even cheaper new cars. The rear-wheel driven Russian Lada is based on the Fiat 124 that died in the 1970s. It is unrefined, but owners say it is reliable, long suffering and easy to service. (You have only to look at Russian roads to see why these qualities are much admired back home). A Lada Riva 1.5 four-door at Pounds 3,905 is a lot of car for the money. If you do not expect too much - and do not plan to change it too soon - it is likely to prove good value. The much more up-to-date, front-wheel driven Lada Samara has its rough edges, too, although the engine (1.3 or 1.5) is quite sweet and seems tireless. Prices start at Pounds 4,580 for a five-speed 1.3-litre three-door. At that kind of figure you cannot really complain about heavy brakes and rather sloppy handling. I have saved the best until last: the Skoda Favorit. Forget the jokes about the old rear-engined Lada (sample: what do they call a Skoda Convertible? A skip). The 1.3-litre Favorit is a smartly-styled, front-wheel driven five-door hatchback or estate car. Volkswagen owns Skoda, and it shows in the build quality. But Skoda prices remain highly competitive, ranging from Pounds 4,849 to Pounds 6,372.</p>

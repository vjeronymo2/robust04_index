			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Sterling falls to lowest ERM levelagainst D-Mark: Decline partly driven by drop in dollar STERLING fell yesterday to its lowest level against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. The pound's  1/2 pfennig fall in London, to close at DM2.8070, left it within three pfennigs of its permitted floor against the D-Mark in the ERM. In New York it dipped further to DM2.8057. If it reaches the lower limit of DM2.7780, the government will be forced to support the currency either by intervention on the foreign exchanges, or by raising interest rates. The pound's fall yesterday was partly driven by the decline of the dollar, as dealers sold the US currency in exchange for D-Marks on speculation that the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy will remain for some time. The dollar fell to a low of DM1.4455, narrowly above its all-time low of DM1.4430 reached in February 1991. It closed in London at DM1.4485, down nearly  1/2 pfennig on the day, and slipped to DM1.4475 in New York. Expectations that the German central bank will keep its short-term interest rates high were triggered by its latest figure for money supply growth, indicating that inflationary pressures in Germany remained strong. The broad money M3 measure grew at an annualised rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and last month, compared with 8.7 per cent in June. Although the trend in money supply growth is downwards, the Bundesbank's target growth rate of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent for the year appears likely to be missed. That makes improbable an imminent relaxation in the German central bank's tight monetary policy. Investors also switched funds out of sterling on concern about the UK's recovery prospects. Yesterday Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, said Britain faced four more quarters of contraction with a recovery delayed until 1994. He predicted a 1 per cent fall in output this year, followed by zero growth next year. Many foreign exchange dealers believe that the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are likely to buy their currencies on the foreign exchanges if the decline in the dollar and the pound continues. However, the two rounds of central bank intervention in support of the dollar over the past month have failed to stop the US currency's slide. Although the Bundesbank Council meeting concluded yesterday without a change in interest rate policy, the market is still fearful of a rise in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate following the increase in the discount rate. Money market interest rates in Germany are at around the same level as the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. In the past, the Bundesbank has used this as an excuse for raising the Lombard rate.

M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased by 2.4 per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year rise of 1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May.

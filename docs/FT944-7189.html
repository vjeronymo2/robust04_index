			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bologna banks plan a 'merger of equals' Credito Romagnolo and Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna yesterday claimed their planned merger would eventually realise commercial and efficiency savings of more than L700bn (Dollars 435.6m) before tax over 10 years, and improve customer service. The two banks, both based in Bologna, announced a merger at the beginning of this month, shortly after Credito Italiano (Credit) of Milan revealed it was planning a L2,000bn bid for control of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo). Yesterday the groups' chairmen refused to take questions about the promised hostile bid from Credit. But they continued the policy of stirring up local pressure against the Milanese bid by underlining the strong regional identity of their own banks. The merger, which will be submitted to Rolo's shareholders for approval on December 19, has a head-start over Credit's plan because it has already been approved by the Bank of Italy, which supervises the Italian banking sector. Credit has remained silent about its bid plans, while the central bank continues to examine the proposals. Rolo, whose shares are quoted in Milan, will merge with CAER, the unquoted parent of Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo). The banks yesterday described their plan as 'a merger of equals'. The foundation which controls CAER will have a 30.7 per cent stake in the enlarged group, and former Rolo shareholders will control 64.5 per cent. The two companies plan to protect minority shareholders' interests with a list-voting system allowing them to nominate board members. Rolo's limit of 10 per cent on voting rights will also be maintained at all ordinary shareholder meetings. Together the two banks will have assets of L61,056bn, and more than 500 branches, making them the 10th largest bank in Italy's fragmented financial sector. They also claim they would be the fourth most efficient bank.</p>

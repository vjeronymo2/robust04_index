			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Leyland Trucks plans first big investment Dutch and UK truck companies created out of the collapse of the Daf group last year are increasing their profits and making a first significant investment in a new range. Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the UK truck maker rescued by a management buy-out last year, says it will spend Pounds 25m (Dollars 38.25m) to design and develop a medium-sized truck range to be built at its Leyland, Lancashire, headquarters. Most of the new vehicles will be for delivery to Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck maker also revived - with Dutch and Belgian government finance - from the Daf collapse. The UK company has a long-term contract with the revived Dutch manufacturer under which Daf Trucks sells and services all Leyland-produced trucks in Europe. The announcement came as Daf Trucks reported a net profit for the first half of Fl 39.2m (Dollars 22m) on turnover of Fl 924.2m. Daf in March reported a net profit of only Fl 10.8m in a truncated first financial year.</p>

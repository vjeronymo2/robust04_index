			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: RMC in Belgian joint venture RMC, the world's biggest concrete producer, is to merge part of its German operations in a joint venture with Lhoist of Belgium, one of the world's biggest lime producers. The UK concrete company said that the 63 per cent owned Rheinisch-WestfalischeKalkwerke (RWK), which produces lime and limestone for the iron, steel, chemicals and building industries, accounted for less than 10 per cent of its German operations. The business is being merged with French and Czech operations of Lhoist in a new Belgian-based joint venture called Chaufourneries de Hergenrath, which will be jointly owned by RMC and Lhoist. Mr Derek Jenkins, RMC's finance director, said that the proportion of RWK's lime sales to iron and steel producers had fallen from about 50 per cent to 40 per cent as the industry had retrenched. He said that 'given the decline in the steel industry it was felt this business would do better in joint venture with Lhoist'. RWK, which is being transferred at its book value of Pounds 90m, generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m for 1992. Lhoist is transferring assets and earnings of a similar value, said Mr Jenkins. There would be a small cash payment to Lhoist to cover the difference between the two group's contributions. Mr Jenkins said it was expected that the merger would have little impact on RMC's profit this year. The joint venture will have the capacity to produce 3.3m tonnes of lime a year.</p>

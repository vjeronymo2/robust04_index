			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Hamas deaths spark protests by Palestinians Clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday, as Palestinians took to the streets to protest against Wednesday's killing of four leading members of the Hamas Islamic movement's military wing. Palestinian sources said dozens of Palestinians were injured; the Israeli army said three soldiers and three Israeli civilians were hurt. In the Hebron area, Palestinian sources said Jewish settlers fired guns and threw stones at several homes. Palestinians responded by stoning the settlers. And when the army arrived, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse the Palestinians. About 120,000 Palestinians in the Hebron area have been under strict curfew for a month, since Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 30 Arab worshippers inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. Only the 400 or so Jewish settlers in the town are allowed to move around freely. The Israeli army commander responsible for the Hebron area, General Danny Yatom, claimed yesterday that the Hamas militants killed in Hebron were believed to include extremists responsible for the murders of several Israelis. However, since the building where they had been hiding out was devastated it was proving difficult to identify the bodies. The PLO yesterday urged rich nations to give more money to support setting up a Palestinian police force in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho, Reuter adds. 'What has been pledged so far is not enough. We need more,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, after Israeli and PLO delegations met representatives of 20 donor countries in Cairo. He quoted World Bank figures estimating start up costs of Dollars 47m and annual costs of Dollars 90m for a Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho, designated as self-rule areas under an accord signed last year by Israel and the PLO.</p>

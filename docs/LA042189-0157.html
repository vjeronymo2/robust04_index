			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO PLAYER WON'T BE CHARGED  </P> <P> The District Attorney's Office has declined to charge a Fresno State football  player with rape on grounds of insufficient evidence that force was used.  </P> <P> Defensive lineman Terry Cook was arrested after a 22-year-old woman said he and  two other men gang raped her on April 7. But an investigation has turned up  "insufficient evidence of force and fear to warrant filing the case," Deputy  Dist. Atty. Gary Hoff said Thursday.  </P> <P> After Cook's arrest, he and a player who was named by the woman but not  arrested were suspended from the football team. Coach Jim Sweeney said he has  not decided whether to reinstate them. "I'm sickened by the event," Sweeney  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Clinton takes popular road on health PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday invited 21 of the 700,000 people who have written to the White House about US health care to come to Washington for a citizens' forum. Thus Mr Clinton has set about putting his campaigning skills at the service of governing, ahead of what is likely to be the most complex challenge of his presidency, reform of the US health care system, Returning to a skill he perfected during his election campaign last year, the president yesterday used personal stories to humanise some of the main themes of the reform plan he will present in detail next Wednesday. The tales - of struggling to pay for a relative's care, of being unable to change job for fear of losing health insurance, of being charged Dollars 2,407 for a pair of crutches - were all fuel to his fire. Opinion polls suggest the Clinton administration has been successful in convincing people that the system needs reform. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, out yesterday, 78 per cent said that US health care was a big problem. Less successful, however, has been the effort to persuade people that they would benefit by Mr Clinton's proposed reforms. Most people are still fairly happy with their own health care and insurance coverage, and only 20 per cent in the poll thought they would be helped by Mr Clinton's plan. Even so, 55 per cent thought the country as a whole would be helped. The White House's central message yesterday was the need to tackle insurance companies' reluctance to cover people who have suffered an illness or who have sick children or parents. Coverage is refused on the grounds of a pre-existing condition. Mr Clinton said the pre-existing condition was now 'part of the everyday vocabulary of most working men and women in this country. . . if you have it, you either can't get health insurance or you can never leave the job you're in.' But Mr Clinton also tackled head-on the issue likely to become one of the most controversial in his plan: the requirement that all businesses provide health insurance to their employees, paying at least 80 per cent of the costs. This mandate is the principal difference between the Clinton reform plan and proposals outlined by the Republicans this week. Mr Clinton said that employers who did not provide health insurance to their workers were getting a 'free ride' by using a health care system paid for by those who did. The president added: 'I don't want to pretend that this is all going to be easy, but it seems to me that it is a fair thing to say everyone in America should make some contribution to his or her own health insurance, and all employers should make some contribution.'</p>

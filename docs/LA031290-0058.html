			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA ON CBS, BUT IT MAY NOT BE LIVE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount's first-round NCAA tournament game against New Mexico State at  8:30 Friday night at Long Beach will be nationally televised by CBS.  </P> <P> The East Coast will get it live at 11:30 p.m., the West Coast delayed at the  same time.  </P> <P> Channel 2, however, could decide to show it live, and a decision is expected to  be made today.  </P> <P> Showing the game live would mean preempting a Bugs Bunny special, "Dallas," and  possibly "Falcon Crest." Or the station might push back "Falcon Crest" from 10  to around 10:30 p.m., and along with it the 11 o'clock news to 11:30 or so.  </P> <P> The CBS game Thursday night will be Ohio State vs. Providence. Channel 2 will  show it delayed at 11:30 p.m. LARRY STEWART  </P></p>

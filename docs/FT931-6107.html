			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shift in super soaraway agenda - Why the tabloid papers have reassessed Labour IT'S THE Sun wot won it, screamed the banner headline in Britain's bestselling tabloid after Mr John Major's election victory last year. The message was typically immodest but not unconvincing. The Tories had run a hopeless campaign. The Sun had rescued them with its daily vilification of Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party. How times change. Earlier this week Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, the Sun's irrepressibly flamboyant editor, hosted an intimate dinner for a select group of senior politicians. But the guests ushered into a private room at London's Savoy hotel were not from the Tory cabinet he had helped re-elect. With the government's popularity crumbling, Mr MacKenzie preferred the company of Mr Tony Blair, Mr Gordon Brown and Ms Majorie Mowlam, the youthful rising stars of Labour's shadow cabinet. Yesterday he was unusually reticent about the dinner. But The Sun is far from alone among the Tory tabloids in deciding to replace scorn for the opposition with a new willingness to give it a fair run. To the delight of Mr John Smith's team - and the fury of Downing Street - a potent mix of genuine disenchantment with the Tories and crude commercial judgment has warmed relations between Labour and its erstwhile enemies. The recession, the bitter Tory infighting over Maastricht and Mr Kinnock's departure have all contributed to the shift. The country is disgruntled and no tabloid can afford to be too far out of step with its readers. The trend has been reinforced by the fierce competition resulting from a shrinking market - and by the opportunity to pick up Labour-supporting readers offered by the Daily Mirror's public rift with the opposition leadership. A glance at the reception given earlier this week to Mr Smith's call for constitutional reforms tells the story. The Daily Mail declared that he planned sweeping reforms of Britain's 'crumbling' constitution. The Sun said he had dumped his party's 'Big Brother image'. Today, another member of Mr Rupert Murdoch's Wapping stable dubbed him 'Citizen Smith' for promising to put the individual before the state. Those stories followed a week in which they had offered generous praise for Mr Blair's response to the escalating juvenile crime rate. The change reflects an informal edict to their political journalists at Westminster: as long as the government is making a hash of things, Labour must be given a fair run. Only the Daily Express has remained unquestionably loyal to the Tories. The change has been most striking at Today. Its editor, Mr Richard Stott, this week underlined its shift to the left by appointing Mr Alastair Campbell to oversee its political coverage. Mr Campbell, a close personal friend of Mr Kinnock, left the Daily Mirror only 10 days ago after a row with its chief executive. Mr Stott, once a Mirror editor, hopes Today will be the principal beneficiary of the disarray in the editorial offices of his former employer. Exasperation with the government is reflected almost daily in The Sun's editorial columns. After a recent opinion poll found that 80 per cent of the population was unhappy with the government, the tabloid declared that the only surprise was that as many as 20 per cent were content. There is an important caveat to all this. It is not uncommon for the tabloids to dilute their support for Tory governments between elections. A lot can happen in the next four years. Few at Westminster believe that Mr Murdoch's papers would actively support Labour when it really counts. But in the meantime Mr Smith and his colleagues can enjoy Mr MacKenzie's claret instead of his more familiar vitriol.</p>

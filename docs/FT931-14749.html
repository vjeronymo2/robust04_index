			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Glad to leave darkest Britain Sir, I read with interest the article 'Africa: Frustrating but worthwhile' by 'practical traveller' Nicholas Woodsworth (January 9). As he found so many 'frustrations' travelling on the so-called 'dark continent', I would be very interested in knowing if it is indeed worthwhile for British tourists to travel in Africa. Bearing in mind the many frustrations I have faced since I came to Britain, I will fortunately be leaving soon. I think the first thing I will do when I do return home to the 'dark continent' is write an article entitled: 'Britain - Frustrating and not worth it]' Alfred P Masondo, 97 Tenison Road, Cambridge CB3 1RQ</p>

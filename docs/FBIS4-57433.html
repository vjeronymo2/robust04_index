			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergio Ramirez, Sandinist faction leader in </F> the Nicaraguan National Assembly, by an unidentified reporter on  the "Impact 620" program; monitored in progress -- live]    [Text] [Reporter] ...that blame the Sandinists for the  property situation in Nicaragua. A short while ago Daniel  Ortega said he would return his house, but only to an  organization dealing with the handicapped or to some sort of  workers' movement, not to its original owner. Will the congress  discuss the property issue? As a faction leader in the national  parliament, you have studied the property problem.    [Ramirez] This is not on the congress' agenda. We will only  discuss our political program, changes to our statutes, and the  election of our authorities.    The property issue is of course on the National Assembly's  agenda. As soon as we are through with the congress, I plan to  look into this pending matter and what we call the Last Word on  Property Law [Ley de Punto Final de la Propiedad], which are a  group of laws, not just one law. We are going to propose in the  National Assembly a law that deals with agricultural  cooperatives, their land deeds or titles; a law that serves to  regulate and protect workers' propriety rights, both in the city  as well as in the fields; a law that will be called the property  stabilization or property stability law; plus a revaluation law  covering bonds that belong to those whose property was  confiscated. I believe that this package of laws will help us  resolve this very complicated property issue, which has no  single solution, but instead several solutions.    My thoughts on this matter are that although some people  were  treated unfairly, there are others -- which the government  itself admits -- whose property was confiscated fairly, for  example the property belonging to the Somozas and those close to  them. The finance minister has said that those whose properties  were affected becasue of their ties to the Somoza regime will  not be entitled to any sort of return. There were other types  of property reviews where obviously some people were treated  unfairly. Nevetherless, that same property may have been  occupied for 15 years by a cooperative, and no one would even  consider evicting them, removing them to put someone else in  their place. What the state has to do in such cases is to  compensate these people. This has been done with bonds. The  problem is that these bonds are not worth enough to satisfy the  people who receive them, so now we will propose in the National  Assembly a law to revalue these bonds and make them good for  paying taxes and bank debts, for purchasing privatized  corporations, and/or conducting various financial market  operations. This will ensure that people who receive these bonds  will feel more satisfied.    There are also property disputes that need to be discussed  in  the courts and not simply resolved by administrative rulings.  The idea is to find stability, not at the expense of someone  else or by a sector of the people -- the poorest, the less  fortunate -- instead, that this be accomplished through fairness  and justice.    [Reporter] Going back to the topic of Sandinist trends and  with this special congress in mind, there are so many things,  opinions, points of view on the FSLN. However, speaking of the  trend that wants Sandinism to return to become a majority party,  what would be the FSLN platform, guideline, or alternative for  ensuring the return of Sandinism?    [Ramirez] First, we need a true political party. When I say  a true political party I mean a party that does not fear voters.  It was precisely in the 1987 Constitution, which was voted on  when there was a Sandinist majority, where the succession of  power was established through elections. In order for a party  to return to power in Nicaragua or gain power, it has to win the  elections through votes. This party has to therefore practice  electoral proselytism. Some comrades in the party are a bit  embarrassed -- I say because of ideological prejudice -- at this  electoral nature that Sandinism must have. I am not saying that  Sandinism should only be active during national election  periods. I do not believe in parties that remain dormant for  six years and when election time comes they awaken -- these are  electioneering parties. A party that stops defending those in  our society who have the least -- the most humble, the less  fortunate, the jobless, peasants without land or those under  threat of eviction -- is a party that wants to regain political  power through the control of land, Nicaragua's traditional means  of political control. This also holds true for those who use  small and medium-sized businesses to promote themselves.  Sandinism must conduct constant political work to make people  aware of their rights, their interests. This is what I mean  when I speak of revolutionary parties that always work for the  benefit of the great majorities -- those who have the least,  without discriminating against other sectors of society.    But, at the same time, thinking that a political party that  believes its duty is to defend the interests of the vast  majority and that it has to struggle every day for the interests  of all sectors, the best way to watch over those interests is to  put this in practice from a position of power, not from the  opposition. Therefore, one must be part of the government and  to become part of the government one must win the votes. It  must be realized that a political party does not win the  majority of votes until such time as a person enters the voting  booth behind a curtain to cast his vote for a specific party.  If the voter is not convinced at that time that he is voting  for something, if previously he has not received the true  message of expectation for the return of lost hopes, we will  never obtain the majority of votes we need to return to power.  We will not achieve this if we do not have a true, credible,  and loyal message. I believe we have to go out and send the  message again.    [Reporter] You have been described as a moderate. It is said  that if one is moderate, one is not belligerent. To say, for  example, that the FSLN's action in support of the workers'  gains, or support for the true problems within society, or for  economic problems, or to go out into the streets to stage a  strike -- that to a certain extent this harms the nation's  development -- well, if this is not being belligerent then it  would be best to sit behind a desk and give orders instead of  going out to the streets. What is your point of view on this?  Do you think that to be belligerent, everyday actions must be  taken into account?    [Ramirez] I know every inch of this country; I have been in  many places throughout these 15 years. I have talked with all  sectors; I have visited the most remote municipalities in the  nation. I believe I understand the people's way of thinking.  If someone asks me to interpret the feelings of the Nicaraguan  people about the Legislative Assembly, or whether the people  want war or violence -- in my opinion, this is not the type of  belligerence that the people want. Given the enormous economic  crisis, with such a high rate of unemployment -- in the  countryside, in the poor Managua neighborhoods -- what the  people want is an opportunity to work. They want peace. They do  not want to use weapons anymore. They do not want any more  deaths. They do not want any more kidnappings. In Matagalpa, in  Jinotega, what the people want is security. Their security is  threatened every day by armed criminal gangs who kidnap, rob,  kill, block traffic on the road, force people out of buses to  rob and assault them -- these people are armed for acts of  revenge. What the people want is peace, security. They do not  want any more war. This is what I interpret as my belligerence.  My duty as a belligerent politician is to proclaim peace, but  not peace with injustice.    Obviously I will never, never support someone who wants to  recover his property by burning down the house, damaging the  roof, poisoning the water supply so that cattle die, closing up  the water wells -- as happened in a violent eviction on the  outskirts of Leon. I can never agree with these acts of violence  that the law must punish. What is sought is precisely that  violence end, no matter its origin. We want to live in peace  with security. The FSLN can't keep hailing violence just  because certain sectors use violence; this would be a  never-ending story. To the extent that we continue threatening  the fragile peace the nation and the citizens are enjoying, with  incorrect speeches, with violent speeches, calling for acts of  revenge, we will not gain any votes; rather we will alienate  them. These are my conclusions after my contacts with the  Nicaraguan people, through my permanent dialogues with diverse  sectors of society. This is why I reaffirm my conviction in my  call for peace, call for reconciliation with justice, for a new  society, for a democratic society in Nicaragua. This is what  the people of Nicargua want.    [Reporter] How much truth is there in that within the FSLN,  the rank and file will be taken into account [words indistinct]  the communal movement, if only one sector of the society attends  the assemblies -- if of course he is member of the FSLN. For  example, in Masaya an assembly has just been held, where I  understand Henry Ruiz participated. Some leaders did not attend  that assembly because they belong to the faction, the other  faction, that is. How can one side know the other's position  [words indistinct] if they do not sit down [words indistinct]  make a decision through a democratic process [words indistinct]  reach a conclusion? Maybe a consensus can be reached for  presentation at the congress on the 20th. You, as  representatives of the Sandinist faction that represent the  majority, do you invite all to the demonstrations, to meet and  talk about the FSLN's internal crisis?    [Ramirez] Well, about this so-called faction, we know that  this is a majority that is not an organized faction, it does not  have authority, it does not have a leader, it does not have a  structure within the nation. It does not seek to be a party  parallel to the FSLN. The [passage indistinct] was elected,  where 150 Sandinist signed an agreement whereby [words  indistinct] were established. I do not see this as [passage  indistinct] the radio, the author of the anthem. [passage  indistinct] The document was signed by the majority. I do not  see [words indistinct] with people such as Ernesto Cardenal, our  national poet who signed this document. Also Mario Flores Ortiz  could be summoned, the founder of psychiatry in the nation, of  great prestige in the medical sector, and one of the senior  socialists of Nicaragua. [Words indistinct] the names of the  150 who signed the document, subsequently 500 more signed.  There is a true tendency toward [words indistinct] that no one  can disqualify. At this stage of the game to be calling as  right wing the [words indistinct] Ernesto Cardenal or Mario  Flores Ortiz, or [words indistinct], union leaders and all those  socialists, is nothing more than nonsense. No one in this  country believes in this type of language and in name calling.    [Words indistinct] we are not organized as a faction with a  structure within the party. Therefore, everyone attends the  meetings we call, debates have taken place as they should with  the [words indistinct] if the current tendencies are correct  this is discussed, if this is correct or not. I believe this is  the proper way to wage a political debate. What has assembled  us here in this process before the Congress, is the lack of the  use of a democratic mechanism within the party. This results in  serious mistakes being made. For example, there are two  candidates for secretary general. The department heads, the  political secretaries of the parties should be [word  indistinct], both candidates should be given equal opportunities  to appear before the national congress delegates, before the  departmental congress delegates. They should be given the  opportunity to talk to them. Otherwise, when a candidate goes  to talk to an assembly, the others are not present because they  might have been prohibited from attending. This is possible.  Unclear mechanisms could be used to limit who attends. I  believe this is a result of not practicing democracy.    From now on we should ensure there is more than one  candidate  for a public post from the FSLN ranks. There could be two, or  three, or four candidates running for the same post. Now there  are two, [words indistinct] could be more than two. They should  be given the same opportunity to appear before FSLN audiences to  present their own points of view. That is democracy.    [Reporter] Allow me, I do not know if in this case I am  being  naive [words indistinct], but talking a little about the reality  that exists within the FSLN, [words indistinct] Carlos Mejia  Godoy. When Carlos Mejia Godoy presented a composition written  by Pablo Antonio Cuadra, it received harsh criticism. At the  signing of [words indistinct] other document [words indistinct]  the majority, were harshly criticized by the media. What is  more, the same media that belong to the FSLN do not give space  to persons who agreed with that position. So, do you believe  that in the Congress this would be solved, or [words  indistinct]? The truth is that they are not allowed to make use  of the media. If they belong to the FSLN, undoubtedly the FSLN  members should be allowed to use this media. What is your  opinion on this?    [Ramirez] It would be difficult to respond in that same  language [words indistinct], I will never fall into that trap.  I believe that my duty is to speak in a lofty manner, to seek  the consensus of all in the party, I will not respond to  insults. I will not ask: Why are you insulting me, calling me  right wing [passage indistinct], cannot sit with me at the same  table, cannot be in the same party? I would be paving the way  for my expulsion from the party. My duty is to be a Sandinist,  my duty is to struggle within the ranks of my party, this is  what I believe. I want my party to become a truly democratic  force capable of winning the elections in 1996 and other  elections in the future. I am going to struggle for a Sandinism  that will [word indistinct] with Nicaraguan society, not a  Sandinism that instills fear. I am going to struggle for a  Sandinism in which true democratic forces can join to offer  Nicaraguan society a true alternative of power in the nation. I  want to struggle for a Sandinism that will not identify with  irrational violent actions that are not the legitimate defense  of the people, of the dispossessed, of this nation's majority.  This is the Sandinism I want, this is why I am inside the  Sandinist party.    I am not going to be scared off because they say Sergio  Ramirez has identified himself with the rich sector. This is a  gross lie and outright slander. I do not possess any fortune,  nor do I have anything against those who possess fortunes. I  believe it is legitimate within this society, to work in the  field one wants, accumulate capital, if one is honest.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what will happen after the  Congress?    [Ramirez] I do not want to speak now about what will happen  after the Congress. I think Sandinist unity should be sought.    I am in Sandinism because I believe in the majority. If I  did not believe in the majority, I would be doing other things.  I would have some business, a candy store, a shoe store, I would  have apartments to rent, or a farm of 500 manzanas. I do not  know what I would be doing if I did not feel that what I am  doing in my party is politically right, because I want to turn  my party into a winning force. We must defend the interests of  the majority, which is what I believe in, and make that majority  return to Sandinism. The truth is that the majority is not in  Sandinism right now. The Sandinist Front is a minority party.  That is what I believe.    [Reporter] This is "Impact 620." We are having problems with  this line. Dr. Sergio Ramirez is here. I have three final  questions. I had wanted to give listeners the opportunity to  participate but due to the line problems, here are my questions  which deal directly with the reality facing the Sandinist Front  leaders in the National Directorate.    There are some who follow a slightly more modern line while  others maintain a special position -- a position is respected.  For example, in the case of Commander Daniel Ortega, he is not  the only option for secretary general of the Sandinst Front.  Before you arrived, other people called to ask you whether you  think he is the only option in the effort to maintain the  Sandinist Front Secretariat and coordinate the party's decisions  within the conglomerate of the party congress. It is said that  the decisions are made by the conglomerate, not by a single  person. But this is not shown in practice. He wants to  continue being the Sandinist Front secretary. He no longer  wants to be candidate because it is too early to talk about  presidential candidates. He wants to continue as secretary, but  he does not give the other viewpoints and positions in the  Sandinist Front a chance, and for some time those positions have  not been accepted. There are also the media and properties  owned by the Sandinist Front to keep the party functioning. But  most of those properties are managed by the circle that supports  Commander Daniel Ortega's line. What do you think about this?  If this continues in the next few months, there might really be  a division within the Front.    [Ramirez] I think that Commander Daniel Ortega has every  right to be a candidate for secretary general of the Sandinist  Front. The Front's statutes do not prohibit reelection to the  secretary generalship. Therefore, as a Sandinist Front  militant, he has every right to be a candidate, just as  Commander Henry Ruiz has every right. He has the same right to  be a candidate for the secretary generalship and to be elected.  They each have the right to address the Sandinist audience to  attempt to show that each one is the best candidate and has the  best proposal. The Sandinists have the right to hear them, to  believe them or not. When the vote is held, congress delegates  have the right to vote for one candidate or another. That is  part of the democratic game in the Sandinist Front. Different  candidates present themselves in pursuit of a position. Each  promotes his candidacy, and congress delegates will vote  secretly to elect the candidate of their choice.    Now then, if either of the two sides involved with these  candidacies -- Commander Ruiz has his followers and Commander  Daniel Ortega has his -- tries to disqualify the other, I think  Commander Ruiz and Commander Ortega will be critical of those  exclusions, discriminations, or disqualifications. I think that  disqualifications would not help pave the way for unity in the  Sandinist Front.    [Reporter] Now then, the Sandinist Front party is part of  the  Nicaraguan people, and the Nicaraguan people are experiencing a  difficult economic situation. There is also the problem of the  return of armed groups to civilian life. There is the issue of  the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], the economic  situation, and the search for aid. The Paris Club meeting is  approaching. Yesterday there was a meeting with representatives  of donor countries. What viewpoints does the Sandinist Front on  the economic problem and the involvement of all sectors, whether  they be Sandinists or not? The Sandinist Front must also  contribute. It is said that the Front has not contributed to  improving the Nicaraguan people's economic situation. There are  strikes and disturbances. There is a vertical command structure  which does not permit a consensus in resolving economic  problems. Criticisms are sometimes voiced in the parliament.  What are the Sandinist Front's viewpoints on the country's  economic situation? What about the ESAF? What can you tell us?    [Ramirez] I think the Sandinist Front was very critical of  the ESAF. The Sandinist Front has said the ESAF does not  fulfill the Nicaraguan people's expectations for profound change  in the economic model. I agree with those criticisms. I  obviously agree with the position that the ESAF does not satisfy  the needs of the most abandoned sectors as participants in the  economy. I would like an economic program that first helps the  new owners of land, the cooperatives, the individual owners who  were members of the resistance, Sandinists, demobilized Army  soldiers, and demobilized members of the Government Ministry.  Hundreds of thousands of manzanas have been distributed by the  Sandinist revolution and the government of Mrs. Chamorro. They  need credit, they need technical assistance, they need roads,  they need markets, they need to begin to produce for the  nation's benefit and that of thousands of peasant families that  hold these lands and resources. Therefore, the economic program  should be directed at favoring these emerging economic sectors.  If we add up these thousands of producers and the thousands of  manzanas they hold, we have there the actual production of food  and agricultural products for the country. Therefore, there  should be special plans for meeting the needs of these producers.    In terms of the economy, the country is not going to  progress if only a minority benefits from the ESAF. I am not  saying that this minority, which consists of large property  owners and manufacturers, should be forgotten, but those  thousands of small, medium-sized, and impoverished growers  should also be taken into account. They are in dire need of low  interest credit, technical assistance, seeds, and new markets  for their products. Herein lies Nicaragua's future, among the  small and medium-sized growers. I believe that the ESAF should  be aimed at addressing the problems of this sector, and here I  also include urban artisans, small and medium-sized businesses,  and small industrial manufacturers. This sector includes the  majority of the Nicaraguan people. Again, when I speak of a  majority, I am referring to the term in the economic sense of  benefits, not gratuities or giving away credit. I am not  referring to that but saying that the time is ripe for the  country's production to start to grow and for resources to be  truly distributed.    [Words indistinct] Nicaragua to those who have less. We need  an economic program that can result in a rapid drop in  unemployment in Nicaragua. If every year we could produce  10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 jobs, we would actually see the  benefits and the population's living standards would improve.  But all these problems like criminal activity, child abuse, and  efforts by the police to control the exponential increase in  criminal activity are caused by unemployment. In addition,  instability in rural areas is caused by a lack of economic  stability, lack of credit, unemployment. This is all related to  the economic crisis in Nicaragua.    At any rate, what do we have? In order for a program like  this to be implemented, as the Sandinists are proposing, first  we need to get into the government. We need votes in order to  get into the government. If those votes cannot be secured, we  will be speaking in merely theoretical terms because there is  not much that can be done from the opposition camp to change an  economic program. In this case, the only thing left would be to  support the just union demands that are determined to change the  economic program.    [Reporter] What's your opinion on forming coalitions or  alliances with other political parties for the 1996 elections?  On several occasions, I have even heard Arnoldo Aleman mention  that there could be a conservative alliance in order to face the  FSLN.    [Ramirez] I believe that during the 1996 elections there  will  be different types of alliances on both sides. In no way am I  going to rule out that the FSLN will or will not form an  alliance for the elections. But before we can talk about  alliances, we must first clearly define what is going to take  place within the FSLN as a political entity, and if we can  arrive at a satisfactory agreement that will fulfill the  expectations of any other party that wants to associate with us.    This is why the results of this upcoming weekend congress  are  very important. Whatever comes out of this congress will  determine our image before Nicaraguan society. Whatever takes  place during the congress will once and for all determine the  FSLN's position for the 1996 elections. Once the congress  adopts a political position, this cannot be changed until some  time before the elections, during another congress and where we  adopt another position. But the assurances and confidence we  project during this congress will be decisive in the 1996  elections, with regard to potential allies as well as to  society, which will have to choose between the FSLN and those  political forces to select a government that will run Nicaragua  as of 1996.    [Florentina Navarro, caller] Hello. Good morning. Is Dr.  Sergio Ramirez speaking?    [Reporter] You are on the air. Come in, come in.    [Navarro] Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado? How are you? This is  Florentina Navarro. I would like to ask you something. But  first I wish to greet the congress and the lasting memory of our  companeros Fabio Vega, German Pomares, Silvio Mayorga, Hernan  Pomares, Silvio Buitrago, and all of the heros and martyrs,  those who fell in Bocay and Pancasan, such as Faustino Ruiz and  Zoilo Escobar. I hope their memory will last in unity in this  congress, which is a congress of the people.    I want to ask Dr. Ramirez a question. In addition to the  agenda, what other measures could be taken? As far as I  remember, the first peace agreements were signed -- one of them  was Esquipulas -- by the government, represented at the time by  Commander Daniel, Dr. Sergio Ramirez, and other officials. They  signed the agreements for peace we have been trying to attain.  Other agreements and other documents were signed later.    Reading the Constitution, I find that the workers' only  strategy of struggle is based on Article 103 of the  Constitution, which recognizes the right to strike. This is a  method for the workers' struggle, according to the Constitution.  Other means of struggle, such as the right to create unions and  respect for freedom of organization, are included in the  Constitution. I think it is necessary to define in the Congress  the nature of these legalized methods of struggle. We would  also have to determine how true peace will be attained  considering that there is no economic, social, or political  stability.    One other thing, Dr. Ramirez. I have read nearly all of your  writings and papers. I would like to know whether you have a  socioeconomic plan for improving the country's situation. At a  conference the other day, Dr. Francisco Solaina said that in  Nicaragua there are no projects or economic policies that allow  investments to crystallize in the country because of the absence  of political or economic stability or security in society. It  is necessary to devise a strategy to solve this situation [words  indistinct] stability in the country.    My question deals with the economic situation in Nicaragua  and whether what Dr. Lainez says is true, that in Nicaragua  there is not even a set of projects or anything that could serve  as the basis for an economic or social policy to solve the  problems of unemployment and capital depletion. There has been  much capital depletion for a long time. This is another factor,  which not always is taken into consideration in opinion polls.  At the congress, we have submitted a demand for an answer to  the people's economic needs. It is necessary to change what  some people describe as leadership and others describe in  another way. What the people require are solutions to our  problems, such as housing, education, health, and all of the  services stipulated in the Constitution as the right of the  Nicaraguan people.    [Ramirez] I appreciate Mrs. Navarro's call. Rather than a  question, it has been a series of excellent remarks on the  country's situation. The country requires an economic project  like the one I have been trying to outline. It is necessary to  think first of the large number of unemployed, those who must  have the security afforded by land possession, who want to till  the land. We must think of cooperative members, small- and  medium-sized producers, small- and medium-sized industrialists  and craftsmen, all of which comprise the majority of the  population who want to participate in economic activities but  are restricted by the crisis, who are not given bank loans,  technical assistance, aid for production, new or repaired roads,  etc. These needs would be met by a true socioeconomic plan for  getting Nicaragua out of its economic crisis. National  unemployment stands at 50 percent.    In addition, thousands of young people enter the labor  market  every year. These young people cannot find jobs [words  indistinct]. Any economic project must first take into  consideration these great dispossessed majorities of jobless and  just walk the streets.    [Words indistinct] I also think that a socioeconomic plan  which truly solves Nicaragua's social and economic problems  cannot be sponsored by a single party. It is necessary to have  a national agreement with the participation of unions and  political parties. We must agree on medium- and long-term plans,  which would change the course of the country development, ensure  the country's economic stability while respecting other parties'  ideas. If a government undoes what others did, if one  privatizes while the other nationalizes, and then still others  privatize again, we would go on and on trying unsuccessfully and  the country would continue in crisis, chaos, and desperation.    [Reporter] Does that mean you agree with the Cosep [Higher  Council of Private Enterprise] when it asked that a deal be  struck so that those accords be kept in the years to come  regardless of whichever government may be in office?    [Ramirez] I have been saying for a long time that we need a  long-term accord that will take us beyond 2000 and give economic  stability to the country, that we should all get in the same  boat, and that regardless of the government that comes to power  it should respect the guidelines or fundamental definitions  contained in that plan. In that respect, (?Fidelina) is right  in criticizing the lack of that economic program [words  indistinct] that program must be the fruit of an accord among  all the forces participating in the economy and in defining the  country's political course. (?Fidelina) also asked about the  methods of struggle, [words indistinct] are those allowed by the  laws and the Constitution. The right to strike is a legitimate  right. It is contained in the Constitution. Under the  Constitution and the laws, workers have been guaranteed the use  of their right to strike.    [Reporter] How about the method used?    [Ramirez] The method used is another matter. If a strike is  implemented with armaments, rifles, and pistols, that does not  fall within the parameters of the law. This is a topic of very  intense discussion within the FSLN rank and file. Some say, if  my house is being set on fire, why should I not defend myself?  Why doesn't the judge see that? If the method used to evict  someone from his house is to spill a gallon of gasoline in his  home while his family is inside, that person, regardless of his  political affiliation and regardless of who it is that is trying  to evict him, whether thugs have been paid [word indistinct]  violence to where he is resting at home with his children, the  Criminal Code, the Constitution, recognizes the defense of  legitimate self-defense. That is in the law. It is not illegal  to defend oneself, if one watches others coming to disturb the  peace of his house.    It is one thing to recognize what the laws state, and  another  thing to preach violence [words indistinct] this incites people,  worsens [words indistinct], and will not bring peace,  tranquility, stability to the country [words indistinct]  violence, no matter where it comes from. Violence is not the  domain of one side. Violence exists in different segments of  society, and we must calm violence and abide by the laws and the  Constitution, so we can create the necessary stability, we can  have the investments that (?Fidelina) mentioned. So long as  there is no peace and stability in the country, the economy will  [words indistinct] there are no capital resources [words  indistinct].    [Reporter] On this matter, could we reach a defined position  on methods of struggle in the debates?    [Ramirez] That is in the agenda of the FSLN congress, a  definition of the methods of struggle. That is one of the most  important points we are going to discuss in the congress.    [Reporter] We have a caller here. Hello? Go ahead, please.    [Unidentified caller] Dr. Ramirez, some say that [words  indistinct] between Commander Daniel Ortega and Dr. Sergio  Ramirez Mercado is for show, and deep down you are united.  Also, Commander Ortega said that no Sandinist will be a  candidate for president in 1996. They will support someone else  who [words indistinct] the revolution. If you run for president,  what will your platform be? Another question is: The charges  against Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman were temporarily dropped.  Will it remain that way [words indistinct] so he may not be  eligible to run in 1996?    [Reporter] Dr. Ramirez will answer.    [Ramirez] I have already heard some say that the political  debate within the FSLN is for show. Skeptics believe the  political division is for show. I would like to tell the person  who called, he did not give his full name, and I did not ask him  to identify himself, that I am participating seriously in this  debate. This does not mean [words indistinct] trying to  preserve any kind of personal enmity. I do not believe personal  enmities are the way to resolve a political debate. There is  no reason why I should be an enemy of Commander Daniel Ortega.  We worked together for many years [words indistinct] turn into  his enemy because we are speaking a different political language  and because our political stances are different.    I do not regard the political debate in terms of an enmity.  If I am not antagonistic toward people who have no political or  ideological identification....    [Reporter interrupting] Even if they insult you?    [Ramirez] I have not been directly insulted. I must be  honest in this respect. Even those who [words indistinct] I  seek to convince them that if someone [words indistinct] and I  have nothing to do with you, why should I participate in a  political debate? I think that slurs disqualify the person who  utters them, not the one who receives them. I think the  Nicaraguan people and Nicaraguan society have enough political  maturity to understand that slurs disqualify the persons who  utter them.    If a convinced Sandinist, such as the woman who called me,  expressed her thoughts, and accurately named all the heroes and  martyrs -- I remember her with a great deal of admiration and  affection -- if a woman like Mrs. Navarro who called earlier  were to believe all those slurs against me, and all the insults  and offenses uttered against me on the radio, which I repeat I  [words indistinct], she would not be calling me here. She would  not believe in me.    She gets into a dialogue with me and talks to me over the  telephone because she respects me. For that reason, all those  slurs have not made an impression on her heart, her mind, or her  ears. That is why I am very pleased. I repeat, slurs  disqualify those who utter them.    Now, I really do not agree with the view no Sandinist should  begin to seek a presidential candidacy for the 1996 elections,  and that we should seek a candidate outside the Sandinist ranks.    I believe that any party that says it does not have a  suitable candidate to represent Nicaraguan society during a  presidential election is a party that is defeated even before  the election starts. If it says that it has to look for  candidates outside [words indistinct] even Sandinists who are  quite capable of participating in an election campaign and even  winning. I am not going to [words indistinct], I have at least  10 Sandinists in mind who have the prestige and sufficient  backing to be presidential candidates. Now, if after  scrutinizing the FSLN ranks we can ascertain that there is no  suitable candidate, then we have no other choice but to look  outside the party. However, a party cannot start looking for  its candidate from outside its rank and file because it is  disqualifying itself from the beginning. This does not imply  that I am saying that Sergio Ramirez should be considered simply  because he is a Sandinist. If necessary, I am quite willing to  stand in line with any list of candidates. My sole objective in  life is not to be a presidential candidate, just as my sole  objective is not to accumulate great wealth and assets. I am  not going to feel distressed or spiteful, nor will I abandon the  FSLN or go to the dogs, or lock myself in a dark room and brood  just because I was not selected presidential candidate. No sir,  that is not my sole objective in life. My objective in life is  to change this society, for it to become more equitable, for it  to have a better social security, and for resources to be  distributed more evenly. I intend to continue struggling for  this. In concluding, the issue about Mayor Aleman is currently  in the courts. So far an appeal has been filed with the Supreme  Court of Justice on the sentence issued by the Managua Appeals  Court. This has to be solved in accordance with court  decisions. I insist that the state of law must be strengthened,  and will be strengthened insofar as it is possible for us to  acknowledge the weight of the court's decision. I don't know  what is going to happen, if the appeal will be received, or what  repercussions will result from the Supreme Court of Justice  accepting the appeal.    [Reporter] Please allow me to insist again. I believe that  we have covered many issues during these 90 minutes. In  reference to the exclusion matter, you mentioned that it would  not seem appropriate for a situation of exclusion to take place  within the FSLN or during the congress. Yet, there is a  situation of exclusion taking place at this time. You yourself  mentioned the radio stations that do not allow you time to  express the views of a segment that specifically has some clout  and strength within the party. [Words indistinct] if this  continues to take place. Will the issue of the radio stations  owned by FSLN members be included in the Sandinist debates, or  have you finally digested the fact that the radio stations are  owned by private individuals?    [Ramirez] The problem is that I do believe that radio  stations owned by the FSLN should allow equal time to those  within the party who view things differently to express  themselves. However, if someone tells me that a radio station  such as Radio Ya, for example, is not [words indistinct] private  property. In cases such as these, what can I do to get time on  the radio if the owners are unwilling? Then, the only thing  left for me to do is to approach the other stations that do  allow me time. I believe that this is also part of the game of  democracy. I am not going to file a lawsuit against a Radio Ya  simply because they do not want to give me time. It's all a  matter of taste, then....    [Reporter, interrupting] And also because the station is  owned by private individuals.    [Ramirez] I would like a debate to take place in order to  really determine how is it that these stations are owned by  private individuals. I believe that is something that concerns  mechanisms within the party itself which we must clarify as  thoroughly and openly as possible.    [Reporter] I would like to [word indistinct] Henry Ruiz,  who is running for the position of FSLN secretary general, and  as a person who as treasurer has handled issues related to  assets owned by the Sandinist Party. As such he is aware of  what assets the FSLN has and what it does not. Then we now have  Henry Ruiz as candidate and the other side says that he is the  candidate of division.    [Ramirez] Henry Ruiz is FSLN treasurer. I have been present  when he has delivered his financial reports and [words  indistinct]. Radio Ya is not registered as one of the party's  assets. BARRICADA and Radio Sandino are registered, but not  this radio station. I believe that it is the party treasurer's  responsibility if the party's list of assets suddenly does not  appear. I want to be perfectly clear in that I am not going to  make a big fuss simply because I am not allowed media time. Nor  am I going to resign the party because I am not given sufficient  media time. I intend to continue to struggle so that genuine  democracy exists within the party.    [Reporter] We have now reached the end of this program and  want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado for appearing on our  "Impact 620" program. What is your message to FSLN followers  and members and the Nicaraguan people about this congress?    [Ramirez] My message is to the congressmen. There are 500  congressmen from all over the country and the congress begins on  Friday and ends on Sunday. I want to tell them that the FSLN's  future is in their hands. They need to be aware that they will  be responsible for deciding the FSLN's course. They are elected  by the rank and file and their will should not be affected by  any possible meddling. There is no party organization at the  departmental or municipal level, no type of assembly, no small  or large congress that can hold to ransom the will of the  national congressmen. Their will is sovereign. They are not  obligated to any sort of decision or previously agreed  resolution by the party to vote a certain way for or against a  certain resolution. Their wills, sovereignly expressed in  Congress by raising their hand or by secret vote, is what will  determine the fundamental decision that will guide the party  over the next few years. This is why the conscience and vote of  these congressmen is fundamental to defining the course the  party will take. These congressmen must responsibly remember  and keep fresh in their minds that they are the people who truly  represent the FSLN's true will.    [Reporter] We want to thank Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We have  requested TELCOR [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal  Services Institute] to improve some of our telephone lines  because some are noisy and it is difficult to put the calls on  the air. We hope that this is not the only time we have you  here on this program. We are at your service with this station  that has great coverage. With the massive participation of the  people both Sandinists and non-Sandinists can express their  views here.</p>

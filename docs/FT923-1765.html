			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Sweden unveils rescue package: All parties back plans to save Skr28bn through benefit cuts and tax rises SWEDEN'S minority coalition government last night agreed an emergency economic package with the Social Democratic opposition to try to convince international financial markets that its currency will not be devalued. The wide-ranging package involves sweeping cuts in state benefits and tax increases. The measures will lead to a total reduction in the budget deficit of SKr28bn (Pounds 2.9bn) next year - around 2 per cent of the country's gross national product. The all-party agreement involves further budget cuts and tax increases over the next five years to 1997 when government savings are expected to total Skr40.6bn. The party leaders hope this will be enough to calm the markets and enable Sweden's central bank to cut the current overnight 500 per cent interest rate on lending to the banks. There is no question of the Social Democrats joining the centre-right government in any grand coalition, but the party will use its votes in parliament to back the details of the agreement as they come into force. In a joint statement the two sides said they supported fully Sweden's fixed exchange rate policy and the tough financial measures needed to maintain it. Under the benefit cuts, old age pensions will be reduced, child benefit increases will be postponed and the introduction of family allowance will be abandoned. Sickness benefits and foreign aid will also be cut. Many of the government's cherished economic plans are to be dropped or postponed. The privatisation of state industries will be delayed and the promised abolition of the wealth tax has been deferred by a year. The scrapping of the tax on capital, previously planned for this autumn, will be postponed for two years. Taxes will rise on petrol and tobacco. Both government and opposition have accepted unpopular measures in an effort to keep unemployment down. In the longer term the two sides have agreed on a radical transformation of the way the Swedish welfare state is financed. The biggest change will involve shifting the funding of the health insurance system by the middle of the 1990s from the state to both sides of industry. Last night Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, and the other party leaders in the coalition, as well as Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrat leader, held a joint press conference to present the unprecedented peacetime agreement. All party leaders stressed the extraordinary circumstances that had forced them to bury their differences in the wider national interest. They hoped the agreement would the markets after three weeks of unprecedented turbulence and bring stability back to the economy. Politically the agreement has enormous significance. It is precisely one year ago that the Social Democrats lost the general election. Now the party can claim to have played a vital part in saving the economy from collapse although at the price of sacrificing many of its welfare spending plans. For Mr Bildt's four-party coalition the events of recent days have shaken its confidence. There appears to be no question of its resignation but the abandonment or delay of large parts of its free market programme is bound to arouse discontent among its supporters.</p>

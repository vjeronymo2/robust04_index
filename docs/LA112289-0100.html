			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AEROJET SETTLEMENT OF ARMY OVERCHARGE TO TOTAL $590,000  </P> <P> Aerojet-General Corp. agreed Monday to pay the government $590,000 to settle  claims that it overcharged the Army on contracts for film display panels, the  Justice Department said.  </P> <P> Aerojet reported the violation to the government under the Defense Department's  Voluntary Disclosure Program, which encourages contractors to report misconduct  to avoid prosecution.  </P> <P> The Justice Department agreed to take no further action against the company on  the overcharges. However, the firm still could be temporarily or permanently  barred from future Pentagon business as a result of its admissions.  </P> <P> The contracts were with an Aerojet subsidiary, Aerojet ElectroSystems Co. of  Azusa, which improperly charged labor costs to overhead accounts when direct  payments under the contract were exhausted, according to federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> Aerojet ElectroSystems built thin film display panels, an advanced means of  displaying data using electroluminescence.  </P> <P> Under terms of the agreement, signed Monday, Aerojet will pay the government  $278,000 in addition to an earlier payment of $312,000. In addition, the  company will pay all the costs of investigating and settling the case, the  Justice Department said.  </P> <P> "This is not a new thing . . . this is just the end (payment) of the total  $590,000," an Aerojet spokeswoman said. "As far as we are concerned, the system  worked. We found this on a self audit."  </P></p>

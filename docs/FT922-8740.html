			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Technology: Moving the goal posts - How advances in sporting equipment have changed the nature of the game Modern sports professionals rely more than ever before on sheer, unadulterated power as a winning strategy. The American golf player John Daly can hit a ball 340 yards off the tee; the German tennis star Michael Stich can hit a serve at 120 mph, past all but the best opponents. For these two, and hundreds of other professionals in their chosen sports, the key to success is a mixture of athleticism and new equipment technologies - specifically, graphite-fibre golf shafts and large-headed tennis rackets made of composites of graphite and fibreglass. These have unlocked power that was unattainable just a decade ago. But simultaneously they represent changes in the games. Daly and Stich came from nowhere last year to win one of their game's biggest events - Daly at the US PGA championship at Crooked Stick, Indiana last August, and Stich at Wimbledon last July. But how much was skill, and how much the equipment? If the equipment alters the nature of the game, should rule-makers ban it? Or should they welcome the boost such advances offer amateurs, on whom the wider health of the game depends? The administrators do not know the answers. So the rules of modern sports have become more like a weapon in a continual conflict with equipment manufacturers, rather than a regulator of contests between players. After all, is any tennis player likely to measure the width and length of an opponent's racket-head? Or a golfer expected to grab an opponent's irons and minutely examine the shape and spacing of the clubface grooves? Hardly. But the rules specify them, sometimes to the millimetre. Nor are tennis and golf alone in facing dilemmas caused by runaway technologies. Hardly any sport is untouched, from athletics, where new materials in some running tracks favour sprinters but penalise long-distance runners, to yachting, where competitors in the bi-annual Americas Cup competition now spend as much time puzzling over its rules, and wondering whether new boat designs (produced in wind tunnels and supercomputer modelling) break or bend them, as they do tacking and gybing. 'Equipment has had an effect on the game, but that's inevitable,' says Andrew Coe, assistant product development manager at the tennis division of BTR subsidiary Dunlop-Slazenger. 'It's just evolution.' Bob Haines, the company's research and development manager, adds: 'Manufacturers, like players, are competing with each other. And competition generally leads to better equipment, too.' That competition has created something close to an acute problem for men's professional tennis. Until the late 1970s, every professional used wooden rackets. Nowadays they all use graphite-fibre models which are lighter, larger and stronger. These are made by heating acrylic fibres to around 270 deg C, when they form graphite and carbon fibres - far stiffer and lighter than wood. These are then injection-moulded along with fibreglass in varying ratios to produce composite rackets. Being stiffer than wood, these transfer more of their energy into the ball, which can be hit up to 30 per cent harder. Serves of over 100 mph are common. Though the rackets are two-thirds bigger than wooden ones, the extra size does not compensate for reduced reaction time. Thus the typical point in a men's match next month at Wimbledon will last less than three seconds, and consist of three strokes: serve, return and volley. For spectators, such matches lack attraction. Thus the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which runs the majority of the men's professional tournaments, and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), which lays down the rules for use worldwide, are worried. If the professional game becomes so boring that no one watches it, the ATP's members will have no income, instead of the Pounds 35m in prize money offered on the tournament circuit this year. In March the ATP got together with the ITF and a number of player and manufacturer representatives to discuss what it calls the 'power problem'. Among the suggestions were changes to the size of the court, the rules, and enforced reductions on racket sizes. Manufacturers oppose limits for two reasons. First, as Haines says: 'Everything tends to get faster in sports; if you put an artificial control on anything, that makes the sport artificial.' In other words, the sport does not explore the players' limits of ability. Second, amateurs adore more powerful rackets; they, not professionals, led the move away from wood, which racket-makers followed happily because the new rackets yielded higher profits. Yet manufacturers have lost out through that. Wooden rackets wore out and broke (within a few weeks when used professionally), but graphite often lasts for years. Total sales worldwide have dipped from a peak of Pounds 15m in 1981 to Pounds 11m in 1991. Racket-makers now have to rely on intensive marketing, finding ever more exotic substances to incorporate in their products: last year one offered materials also found in the Stealth bomber. The problem for the ATP is that any changes it proposes should not affect the women's professional game - which is separately run and publicly delighted with the increased power the new rackets lend - and be relatively cheap to implement. Limits on the rackets are most unlikely. 'It would be a curtailment of freedom,' says Haines. It would also be likely to attract Restraint of Trade lawsuits from US manufacturers - if pros could not use them it would be hard to advertise them to the public. An easier option would be to change the characteristics of the balls themselves: making them bigger or more 'fluffy' would increase their air resistance, slowing them down. This could also provide a marketing boost for ball-makers. Golf's rule-makers - the combined brains of the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews, Scotland and the US Golf Association (USGA) in Far Hills, New Jersey - have more room for manoeuvre than those in tennis. But they are fighting on a variety of fronts: not just clubshafts, but also clubfaces and balls. And their undoubted power to set the rules has not kept them clear of the US legal system. In the mid-1980s an American start-up company developed a ball called the Polara. The pattern of the ball's dimples (which help it fly further) effectively made a seam. Positioned correctly on the tee, it could be made to swerve, like a cricket ball, as required. The USGA promptly banned it by changing its rules; the Polara's makers sued. The USGA settled out of court for a seven-figure sum. A potentially bigger case, due to come to court later this year, involves Karsten Manufacturing of Phoenix, Arizona, makers of the Ping range of clubs. The grooves on its Ping Eye2 range of iron clubfaces had a U-shaped profile (instead of the usual V) and were also closer together than the norm. Professionals using these could put more backspin on the ball and stop it abruptly on landing. The US Professional Golfers Association (PGA) decided this made them 'too accurate'. In 1989 it banned the clubs from use in PGA tournaments and proposed a rule banning U-shaped grooves - thus earning an injunction and a lawsuit from Karsten Manufacturing. The case finally comes to court sometime in the next six months. Still the changes keep coming. Other manufacturers, including Yonex of Taiwan and Spalding of the US, have produced 'wide-body' woods with heads 15 per cent larger and shafts 1.5 inches longer than normal. Novice golfers like them, feeling they are more forgiving of imperfect shots. For once, the rule-makers have not made any move. The Royal &amp; Ancient and the USGA know that in rule-making they tread a fine line between preserving the game and strangling the innovation that manufacturers rely on to keep marketing their wares. They also know that most of it is illusory. 'The improvements from technology are exaggerated,' believes Alastair Cochran, technical adviser to the Royal &amp; Ancient. 'In the US, the average handicap is the same as 15 years ago. I think peoples' views are coloured by what a couple of professionals do with their special shots. The biggest improvement in the past 20 years among the pros is the players, not the equipment.'</p>

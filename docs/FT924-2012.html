			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Horsham takes 100% control of US oil group MR PETER Munk, the Toronto entrepreneur, has settled his dispute over the future of Clark Oil &amp; Refining, the US oil refiner and distributor, with his long-standing associate, Mr Anthony Novello. Horsham, controlled by Mr Munk, owns 60 per cent of Clark and has now reached agreement to buy out the 40 per cent minority holding from Mr Novello for USDollars 100m in cash. Horsham said that it had wanted to buy the Clark minority shares since it first bought control in 1988. 'Horsham will now own 100 per cent of Clark and have unrestricted ability to manage it to maximise shareholder value,' said Mr Paul Melnuk, president of Horsham. Horsham owns 21 per cent of American Barrick Resources, the gold producer which is also controlled by Mr Munk. This summer Mr Novello, a St Louis oil dealer, succeeded in blocking Horsham's plan to take Clark public. Clark, which owns two US refineries and nearly 900 retail outlets in the mid-western US, had 1991 revenues of USDollars 2.4bn and profit of USDollars 38m.</p>

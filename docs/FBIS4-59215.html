			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior political source has told our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz that Israel sees no point in discussing  the issues that remain under contention with the PLO because it  has no intention of acceding to the PLO's demands.    The disagreements revolve around the stationing of a  Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge, a Palestinian  director at the Rafah border checkpoint, and the size of the  Jericho enclave. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has  been informed of Israel's position.    On 10 May, the working groups on refugee affairs will resume  discussions in Cairo. The parties will stress the improvement  of the refugees's living conditions and refrain from dealing  with other aspects of the problem.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Factory prices at virtual standstill A VIRTUAL standstill in the prices of manufactured goods last month confirmed the weakness of inflationary pressures in the economy. In spite of growing domestic demand, the prices of finished manufactured goods were only marginally higher in August, according to official figures. The output price index rose 4.3 per cent in the year to August, compared with a revised 4.2 per cent in the year to July. Although that was the highest rate for two years and 1 percentage point higher than the rate of increase at the beginning of the year, the slow growth of producer prices suggests that manufacturers have chosen to absorb the higher cost of imports that followed the devaluation of sterling a year ago. Excluding food, drink, tobacco and petroleum - volatile elements that are believed to distort the underlying picture of inflation - the index rose by 0.3 per cent month on month to give a 2.6 per cent increase in the year to August. That compared with 2.5 per cent in the year to July. The prices of inputs - raw materials and fuel used by manufacturers - fell by a non seasonally adjusted 1 per cent in August compared with July. Compared with the same month a year ago, producer input prices were up 6.2 per cent, compared with 6.3 per cent in July. The Central Statistical Office said the month-on-month fall largely reflected seasonal falls in the prices of home-produced food manufacturing inputs. On a seasonally adjusted basis, input prices rose by 0.1 per cent, month on month. The level of input prices has remained roughly stable since March after rapid gains immediately after devaluation. Most of the annual increase in input prices reflects sterling's depreciation.</p>

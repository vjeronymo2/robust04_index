			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Teachers divided on NUT boycott THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers, the biggest teaching union, is launching a boycott of appraisal arrangements which could be linked to performance-related pay. The move opens another front in its dispute with the government, which has already led to the boycott by the three largest teaching unions of this year's national curriculum tests. But the move splits the unions, which have been united so far in their opposition to the tests. Neither the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, nor the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the other two large unions, will follow the NUT's lead. Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT general secretary, said that teacher-appraisal interviews were being used to introduce performance-related pay. The union will ask local education authorities and the governors of grant-maintained schools to advise their schools not to link appraisal to pay, or to award points for 'excellence'. If local NUT representatives do not receive these assurances, they will decide on further action - probably a boycott of appraisal interviews. Mr McAvoy said: 'Performance-related pay will generate competition and rivalry, destroying teamwork in schools. It is a device to divide and destabilise the teaching profession dressed up in the guise of promoting educational excellence.' However, he said the NUT had no objection to appraisal interviews if they were not related to pay. The Department for Education said: 'We are disappointed that the NUT is taking this stand. We are sure that all teachers will be in favour of appraisal as a valuable way of developing professional expertise. All other professionals are appraised in some way.' The department added that appraisal has been in force since September 1990 and was carried out on a two-yearly cycle, which would make it an inappropriate scheme to be linked with pay. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the NUT was in danger of 'throwing out the baby with the bath water'. He said: 'The vast majority of schools would not want to use appraisal for those purposes, and if they want to go down the performance-related pay route in future, they will not do so unless there is a national scheme in place. We are a long way from that.' Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'There's no point in firing off at too many targets. We certainly would not support the campaign NUT are starting, mostly because of the multitude of other issues facing teachers.'</p>

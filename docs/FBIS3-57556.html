The 900-day blockade was broken near the  village on January 18, 1943.    Yeltsin said that would be an equestrian statue and added  that everybody remembers how the marshal inspected the victory  parade in Red Square in 1945.    "This is the right decision (to erect the monument),"  Yeltsin  said and added the symbols of Russian patriotism and valour  should replace the cemetery of top Soviet leaders in Red Square.    The main Russian square houses the mausoleum where the  mummified body of Vladimir Lenin lies. Behind the mausoleum are  graves of top Soviet communist leaders and outstanding  personalities.    Zhukov won the battle of Stalingrad, lifted the siege of  Leningrad and seized Berlin, and most Soviet victories in world  war two were connected with his name. After the war he became  the Soviet defence minister and member of the ruling Politburo  of the Communist Party.    It was he who actually led the arrest of Lavrenty Beria,  head  of the secret police and a close associate of Joseph Stalin,  after the dictator died.    He supported Nikita Khrushchev when the communist leadership  tried to oust him in June 1957, however Khrushchev, who feared  the popularity of Zhukov, dismissed him from the post of the  defence minister and Politburo member in the same year when the  latter was on a visit in Yugoslavia.    Zhukov died in 1974.</p>

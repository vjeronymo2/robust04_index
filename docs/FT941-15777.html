			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Right rate for the jobs December's sharp fall in unemployment will doubtless encourage the UK chancellor to err on the side of caution on interest rates, a point rammed home by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury. Since the sharp rise in UK equities since the budget has been fuelled by hopes of an early cut in rates, yesterday's 42-point fall in the FT-SE 100 index is understandable - although it seems perverse that shares should take fright at recovery. The foreign exchange market got the message well before Mr Nelson's comments, with sterling rising to its highest level against the D-Mark since the ERM crisis of September 1992. Sterling's strength may eventually pose a policy dilemma. The unemployment figures show that manufacturers are still shedding labour. That may be a secular trend beyond the control of government, but manufacturing output has also lagged recovery. If industry looks in danger of being priced out of export markets too, the pressure for corrective action would be great. But that point is some way off. Sterling is still well below the D-Mark exchange rate that prevailed before the ERM crisis, while its appreciation on a trade-weighted basis is much less pronounced. An early interest rate cut designed to hold sterling down could also backfire. If international fund managers are buying sterling for the UK's growth prospects, the pound might actually rise. That amounts to another argument for caution on monetary policy, at least until tax increases start to bite in April. How the economy will react at that point remains difficult to predict. With employment growth concentrated in poorly-paid service sector jobs, though, lower unemployment promises only a limited offsetting benefit to personal disposable income.</p>

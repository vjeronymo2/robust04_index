			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: More jobs go at Central as Carlton restructures Carlton Communications moved to integrate its Central Television acquisition more closely - a restructuring that will cost a further 180 jobs and lead to savings of more than Pounds 15m a year. Carlton UK Television, the UK's largest commercial television company, broadcasting to 20m people in London and the Midlands, was formed following the Pounds 758m acquisition of Central last November. The programming commissioning and production arms of Carlton and Central will be integrated into Carlton UK Productions, under Mr Paul Jackson as managing director. Broadcasting services will combine under Mr Clive Jones. The ITV company also confirmed its intention to move its Birmingham broadcasting centre to a new purpose-designed building in the city and to transfer some operations to its Nottingham studios. The restructuring will lead to 40 job losses by the end of this year. When the new Birmingham centre is in operation about 90 jobs will be transferred to Nottingham, and the overall workforce will be reduced by a further 140. Union representatives said yesterday they were 'devasted' by the further job losses - 50 jobs had already gone since the merger. Ten years ago Central alone had 2,400 staff. When the present restructuring is complete, the combined Carlton UK Television will have a total of about 1,000 although a large number of independent producers are employed indirectly. Mr Andy Allan, chief executive of Carlton UK Television, said the integration and job losses were necessary to create the sort of company that could compete not just in Europe but in the rest of the world. From January 1, Birmingham-based Central Television and London-based Carlton Television will be known as Central Broadcasting and Carlton Broadcasting. 'Strong regional boards and management will ensure that regional services, including news and regional programmes, will maintain their distinctive character and be of the highest quality,' Mr Allan said. The aim was to increase the amount of production at the Nottingham studios, not just making programmes for ITV but eventually for other countries. He added: 'If the BBC is interested we would be delighted to talk to them.' At the time of the takeover it was suggested that Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year could be saved by rationalisation. Mr Allan expects savings of Pounds 15m a year. Mr Mark Beilby, media analyst at SG Warburg, said that with little real growth in advertising revenues expected over the longer term, ITV companies had to cut costs. Carlton's share price gained 12p to close at 857p.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Europe may echo US banks' troubles A spate of poor first-quarter trading profits by US banks, due to turmoil in the financial markets, has sparked concern that similar declines may hit European bank earnings. 'A few banks made huge amounts out of the markets last year, and that can't be repeated,' warned Mr John Aitken, banks analyst at UBS. 'It is overwhelmingly likely you will get a sharp reduction in trading profits.' He added that the UK stock market did not appear to have taken account of potentially weak trading earnings. Most European banks do not report first-quarter earnings, so the first complete information on this year's performance will not be available until July or August. However, two Swiss banks indicated yesterday that their first-quarter earnings were hurt by the sharp falls in world bond and stock markets. Swiss Bank Corporation said in a quarterly statement that operating profits in February and March were 'below expectations' and cited a drop in trading revenues 'due to the sudden deterioration in international financial markets'. According to Ms Jennifer Oliver Martin, European banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, the Swiss banks are 'very reliant on trading profits', with an average of 35 per cent of income coming from trading, compared with 6 per cent for German banks. Mr Michael Lever, director of equity research at Nomura, said dealing profits across the UK banking sector rose to 10 per cent of total income last year, from 7 per cent in 1992. 'We have factored in a 25 per cent reduction in dealing profits across the board.' However, European banks are likely to be less vulnerable to declines in trading income than their US counterparts. US banks tend to be more reliant on proprietary trading - taking positions on market movements using their own capital - which means earnings are likely to be more cyclical. Also, a substantial portion of US bank losses came from emerging market debt trading, where few European banks are leading participants. Safra Republic, the Geneva- based private banking group, reported its trading account swung from a Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.16m) profit in the first quarter of 1993 to a Dollars 2.66m quarterly loss.</p>

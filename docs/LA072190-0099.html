			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BRITISH OPEN;  </P> <P> NORMAN, FALDO: MAJOR MATCHUP AT ST. ANDREWS  </P> <P> Two of the best golfers in the world playing on the oldest and most famous golf  course in the world for the oldest and most prestigious prize in the golf  world.  </P> <P> That is the prospect for the final two days of the British Open as Greg Norman  of Australia and Nick Faldo of England go head-to-head over the hallowed  fairways of the Old Course of the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.  </P> <P> Norman and Faldo are deadlocked after 36 holes with record 12-under-par 132  totals after Norman shot his second successive 66 Friday and Faldo followed a  few moments later with a 65 to go with his opening 67. They will be paired in  today's third round.  </P> <P> Both are former British Open champions, Norman having won in 1986 and Faldo in  1987, and they are 1-2 in the Sony World Rankings.  </P> <P> Faldo has won three of the last 12 major championships, lost another in a  playoff and missed a U.S. Open playoff last month by one stroke. Norman has  been the runner-up who has seen Bob Tway steal a PGA and Larry Mize grab a  Masters from him with last-hole heroics.  </P> <P> Their birdie blitz the past two days has put them four shots ahead of the  field. Craig Parry, another Australian, and Payne Stewart, the PGA champion and  leading American, are tied for third place with 68-68 -- 136 scores.  </P> <P> At 137 are an international foursome of Ian Woosnam of Wales, 68-69; James  Spence of England, 72-65; Nick Price of Zimbabwe, 70-67, and Mike Reid of  Provo, Utah, 70-67.  </P> <P> Steve Pate of Simi Valley, Jodie Mudd of Louisville and Peter Jacobsen of  Portland, Ore., are at 138 with Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain, Sam Torrance of  Scotland and Anders Sorensen of Denmark.  </P> <P> The Norman-Faldo confrontation calls to mind the marquee matchup of Tom Watson  and Jack Nicklaus at Turnberry, Scotland, in the 1977 British Open. Watson won  with a final-round 65 to Nicklaus' 66 after each had shot a 65 in the third  round.  </P> <P> Watson was not so fortunate this year. His one-over-par 145 left him among  those who missed the lowest cut in British Open annals. It took a one-under-par  143 to stay in the tournament. Among those sidelined was Arnold Palmer, who  first played here 30 years ago and had hoped to make the final round after  shooting a 71 Friday, but his par total barely missed.  </P> <P> Also heading home early are Seve Ballesteros, Curtis Strange and defending  champion Mark Calcavecchia.  </P> <P> The most sudden departure was that of Scott Hoch, who was two under par going  to the dreaded Road Hole, No. 17, where he took a nine after hitting one ball  out of bounds and putting another in the infamous Road bunker. Suddenly, he was  three over par.  </P> <P> The previous record low cut was two over par, last year at Royal Troon.  </P> <P> "We are sailing along, Greg and I; we're playing well, holing putts and seizing  opportunities," Faldo said. "It was exciting out there today. We seemed to be  chasing one another. As soon as one birdie went up on the board, another one  went up. It was a nice mode to be in."  </P> <P> Norman had a remarkable string in what is known as the Loop, from the seventh  through the 11th holes at the far end of the course, where he shot 3-2-3-3-3,  four strokes under par. Only amateur Gene Andrews of Los Angeles has done  better here, 3-2-3-3-2 in the 1958 British Amateur.  </P> <P> Norman still trailed Faldo by a stroke before making the day's most spectacular  shot, a 75-yard wedge that hit the green on No. 14, then spun about two feet  back into the cup for an eagle-three on the 567-yard hole.  </P> <P> "I knew I hit it good and I saw it hit the green and spin, but I couldn't see  it go in the hole," Norman said. "I had an idea, though, from the cheer that  went up."  </P> <P> Faldo was not as spectacular, clipping off seven birdies without a bogey in his  usual display of consistency. Faldo shot 18 consecutive pars in the final round  to win his British Open.  </P> <P> "The best shot I hit was on the 17th when I was in deep grass, 156 yards from  the hole, and hit a seven-iron just short of the green," Faldo said. "It was  close enough to putt, about 90 feet, and I was pleased to get down in two  putts."  </P> <P> Norman said he looked forward to what has all the earmarks of a match-play  shootout.  </P> <P> "I definitely feel I can win this week," he said. "That will be my approach the  next two days. I feel relaxed and happy with my game and am in a good position  to win at St. Andrews, which is every golfer's dream.  </P> <P> "Faldo and I grew up together in Europe, basically, and have been matching  shots since 1977. We know each other very well. It should be interesting, to  say the least."  </P> <P> Off this year's records, it would appear to be even up.  </P> <P> Norman has won the Doral Ryder and Memorial tournaments on the American PGA  Tour, plus the Australia Masters in his home country. Faldo has won the Masters  and lost by a stroke in the U.S. Open and the Volvo PGA championship in Europe.  </P> <P> Faldo warned, however: "Greg and I can't spend all our time watching each  other, because the guys in back know what they have to do, and they'll be loose  and can come out shooting at the moon. There is a long way to go, and if the  weather changes, anything could happen.  </P> <P> "You know, when it blows around here, the sea gulls walk."  </P> <P> Stewart, who wore the green-and-yellow colors of the Green Bay Packers, said he  felt good about his position with 36 holes remaining.  </P> <P> "I came over here two weeks ago and played in the Scottish Open to get rid of  jet lag and get a feeling for the bump-and-run game you need on a links course  like St. Andrews," he said. "I have been patient and have been in only one  bunker in two days. That's the secret around here. I feel good about my  chances."  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> SCOREBOARD  </P> <P> THE LEADERS  </P> <P> Player &amp; Score  </P> <P> Nick Faldo: 67-65 -- 132  </P> <P> Greg Norman: 66-66 -- 132  </P> <P> Craig Parry: 68-68 -- 136  </P> <P> Payne Stewart: 68-68 -- 136  </P> <P> Mike Reid: 70-67 -- 137  </P> <P> Nick Price: 70-67 -- 137  </P> <P> James Spence: 72-65 -- 137  </P> <P> Ian Woosnam: 68-69 -- 137  </P> <P> *Six are tied at 138  </P> <P> THEY MISSED THE CUT  </P> <P> Player &amp; Score  </P> <P> Arnold Palmer: 73-71 -- 144  </P> <P> Tom Kite: 71-73 -- 144  </P> <P> Seve Ballesteros: 71-74 -- 145  </P> <P> Tom Watson: 72-73 -- 145  </P> <P> Curtis Strange: 74-71 -- 145  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia: 71-75 -- 146  </P> <P> Craig Stadler: 82-71 -- 153  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign exchange tax more equitable COMPANIES will be subject to more equitable taxation on foreign exchange gains and losses under long awaited and radical draft legislation circulated yesterday by the Inland Revenue. The changes will principally affect any UK companies that take out finance in foreign currencies and those with assets held in foreign currencies subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations. The rules will permit them to offset losses on exchange fluctuations against tax for the first time. Previously they have been taxed on any exchange gains without being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses. The Revenue said the legislation would not be retrospective, so it will not help companies which suffered heavy exchange losses after the depreciation of sterling when Britain withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn. Tax practitioners generally welcomed the proposals as a change that would bring the UK into line with tax regimes in other countries. Mr Derek Jenkins, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This gives British companies more of a level playing field with the rest of the world. They will be taxed on their trading transactions in foreign currencies in the same way as they are accounted for in economic terms.' Ms Emma Lubbock of Price Waterhouse said: 'Companies will welcome the certainty of tax treatment and the removal of anomalies.' She said they would find the 40 pages of regulations and notes daunting. The Revenue said the effect of the changes would be broadly tax neutral, with any losses from the introduction of allowances being offset by new taxes on gains which were outside the remit of previous legislation.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS GO FOR POST-CENSUS POWER  </P> <P> House Democrats announced a fund-raising drive in anticipation of perhaps 18  congressional districts shifting toward the Republicans after the 1990 Census.  </P> <P> The campaign, IMPAC 2000, will try to raise $1 million to help Democrats keep  or win state offices before congressional districts are redrawn. With six or  seven new seats in California at stake, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), chairman  of the drive, noted that the party in power will decide which party the  boundaries will favor when the legislatures adjust them to reflect population  shifts since 1980. California's delegation is expected to grow from 45  representatives to 51 or 52, or almost 12% of the House.  </P></p>

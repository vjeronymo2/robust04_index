			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, head of </F> the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday prayers  leader, in Tehran on 8 April--recorded]    [Excerpts] May God's peace and mercy be upon you all  [passage omitted] I wish to pass a message on behalf of Imam  Sadeq to the Islamic world, to all Muslims -- wherever they live  and whatever sect they follow -- and to everyone who is under  the enemies' oppression in the East and the West, that you  should strive to become familiar with the Imams; and if you  desire salvation you should apply this culture and these  training methods. You should not be afraid of the enemy,  shortages, and hardship. You should stand against the enemy.  Ultimately you shall survive and the enemies will depart.  [shouts of approval from the congregation]    The enemy only thinks of himself. He thinks of lust, wealth,  status, and mundane matters of this valueless, untrustworthy,  and disloyal world. Divine tradition will not allow them to  survive. World creation is not based on this. The creation is  righteous. We did not create the earth, the heavens and what is  in between them in vain [Koranic verse]. They are wrong because  they are moving contrary to the objectives of creation. They  will, thus, be crushed. You, the Palestinian youth, who went  and carried out that suicidal action in revenge: First, may God  join your soul with those of all the immaculate martyrs of  Islam. [shouts of approval]    Second, we are satisfied with what you have done, and may  God  give some of the rewards of your deed to us.    Third, the enemy should understand what the problem is: When  a desperate person reaches the end of his rope, this is to what  he will resort. How can mankind tolerate injustice forever?  They might tolerate it for a year or two, or 10 or 20 years.  You have been bullying these people for the past 45 years. You  have suppressed them for 45 years. They are human beings and  not sheep to put up with everything until they are slaughtered.    God did not create mankind to put up with tyranny. God did  not create human beings to be feeble. God created mankind to be  an honor-seeking, a justice-seeking creature in search of the  truth. These virtues of mankind will work for him eventually.  But there is a limit to each individual's endurance. There is  a limit to one's patience. When one runs out of patience, the  oppressor must expect to see the consequences of his torturous  deeds.    The United States is making a mistake. The United States'  allies are wrong. Israel is wrong. They are wrong to imagine  that a handful of weak and vile individuals can solve humanity's  plight by sitting around a table to sign an accord. The United  States is committing crimes in the world today. On the one  hand, when people are killed while saying prayers, they play  dead in terms of adopting a stance. Their only response was a  feeble and tasteless move, just to silence their own public. On  the other hand, when this man took action to avenge the blood of  those martyrs by punishing them, they could not wait to hold a  session to condemn this action. Shame on you. They killed  worshipers inside a mosque during Ramadan, and you did not give  a damn. Whereas, when this young person sacrificed his own life  just to demonstrate that we are alive, just to tell you not to  go on with what you are doing and just to stop tyranny and  murder, then you sit and condemn him. [shouts of approval from  congregation] [passage omitted]    Our Bosnian brothers and sisters, and our brothers and  sisters who are the target of repression in Gorazde today -- and  with the United Nations failing to do its routine work -- they  should know that they will survive because they are righteous.  They must learn from history and be a model for the future.  They should continue to resist as they have done so well until  now. May God bless them with his victory.</p>

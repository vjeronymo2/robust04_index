			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: P&amp;P lifts Bridge Oil bid as another suitor enters The bidding war for Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group, sprang into life yesterday, when Texas-based Parker &amp; Parsley increased its offer from 70 cents to 80 cents a share - and was promptly trumped by a new suitor. The new bidder, whose 85 cents a share offer values Bridge at ADollars 356.7m (USDollars 262m) and was recommended by the Bridge Oil board, is a US partnership called Joint Energy Development Investments. Jedi, in turn, is owned by US-based Enron, the rapidly growing natural gas company, and the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the biggest public pension funds in the US. Jedi, using a newly-formed company called Gantry as its bid vehicle, entered the fray within minutes of the announcement of the increased offer from Parker &amp; Parsley yesterday morning. P&amp;P, whose opening bid for Bridge was announced last month and which holds a 4.2 per cent interest in its target, had been widely expected to raise its terms. Announcing its new offer, P&amp;P said it was waiving all conditions to its bid. However, within minutes of the news, the rival Jedi offer was unveiled, and Bridge shares quickly rose to the new bid price of 85 cents. Jedi did not own any shares in its target ahead of the announcement, but Macquarie Equities, the equities division of Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based institution, is understood to have picked up about 10m Bridge shares in the market - about 2.5 per cent of the oil and gas company's equity. Macquarie Bank is advising Jedi. P&amp;P said all options remained open. 'We were serious in our intent and we remain serious,' Mr Herb Williamson, executive vice-president, commented. 'Any and all options remain open . . . price being one of them.' The Bridge board is recommending the Jedi bid in the absence of any higher offer, in spite of the fact that a valuation of the company by Grant Samuel put Bridge Oil shares at between 95 cents and ADollars 1.13. Jedi was set up in 1993 with capital of USDollars 500m. Ownership is split equally between Calpers and Enron, although the latter, via a subsidiary company, is the general partner.</p>

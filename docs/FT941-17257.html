			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pentland pays Pounds 20m for Italian sports company Pentland Group, the cash-rich consumer brands company, yesterday paid L50.6bn (Pounds 19.7m) for 90 per cent of Ellesse, the Italian sports goods company. Ellesse makes sportswear, concentrating on skiing and tennis. Pentland has distributed Ellesse clothing in the UK for 12 years, and has acted as UK licensee for its footwear for the past five years. Mr Richard Stevens, company secretary, said yesterday that Pentland felt the Ellesse brand might have 'lost focus a little in the last few years', but it had a first class pedigree. 'We think it will prove to be a good investment at this price.' Pentland would sharpen up its image and improve worldwide distribution, he said. Ellesse products would complement rather than compete with Pentland's existing brands. For example, Ellesse swimwear was more style oriented than Pentland's Speedo, which was aimed at competitive swimmers. Mr Leonardo Servadio, founder of Ellesse, will retain the remaining 10 per cent of the company. He has the right to require Pentland to buy his stake in certain circumstances, and Pentland has a similar right to acquire his stake. Maximum consideration would be L12.5bn. Pentland will pay a deferred consideration of 10 per cent of profits before interest and tax if they total more than L48bn for the five years to 1998. Maximum payment would be L7.2bn. In the year to end-December 1992, Ellesse announced profits of L4.1bn. Mr Stevens said Pentland would continue to look for larger acquisitions in the branded consumer durables sector. At the end of the six months to June 30 last year Pentland had cash of Pounds 252.9m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.7m on turnover of Pounds 198.4m after losses and closure costs at its US trade finance business. Last April it paid a 12p special dividend from the profit on the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Adidas, the sports goods company.</p>

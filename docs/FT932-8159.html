			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / CBI urges fresh growth strategy THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry is to urge the government to construct an industrial strategy based on strengthening the supply side of the economy to achieve sustainable economic growth. The CBI has been encouraged by recent ministerial language which is more supportive of manufacturing industry, but it believes the government has still failed to articulate a clear industrial strategy. The employers' organisation has started work on a policy document intended to define its view of the government's proper role in improving Britain's competitiveness. It will also set out what the CBI believes to be the acceptable limits of state involvement in supporting industry. The CBI is anxious to discourage any suggestion of old-style state intervention, but believes the government must make its central objective the adoption of policies intended to help UK companies compete more successfully. Business leaders complain that competitors in other European countries receive far more assistance from government in winning vital orders. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, yesterday made a preliminary report on the issue to his ruling council, which will discuss it again later this year after more detailed work has been done. Mr Davies told a London press conference: 'We are trying to work towards a definition of what government's responsibilities are towards industry.' He said the government's prime responsibility was to provide a stable economic framework for business. But beyond that it had to implement policies which would raise the trend growth rate. The CBI is to examine a series of policy areas in which it believes government action should be taken to help improve national competitiveness. They include public expenditure and taxation, education and training, transport infrastructure and planning and business support services. The European Community has lost one fifth of its share of world trade since 1980 and will lose more unless productivity improves and social costs on employers are contained, the CBI council warned yesterday. Members called on the EC to 'rethink its commitment to the social chapter and to avoid directives which will further reduce competitiveness'.</p>

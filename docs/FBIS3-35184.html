The attack took place near the  border between Rafah and Egypt, when machine-gun fire was  directed at an Army jeep patrolling in the area. Army troops  returned the fire, and two residents of Rafah were injured.    Meanwhile, in the center of Hebron, a bomb was set off last  night on one of the main streets. It exploded but caused no  injuries or damage.    Settlers in the territories are now blocking roads in  protest  over the murder of Tzipora Sason, the 30-year old woman from  Ari'el who was shot by terrorists last Friday night. At the  site of one of the roadblocks is reporter Mark Weiss:    [Begin recording] Groups of settlers at five locations  throughout the West Bank set up roadblocks at 5 o'clock this  morning. Coordinated by the YESHA' [Judaea, Samaria, and the  Gaza Strip] settlers council, the protesters burned tires and  threatened to turn back Arab vehicles; however, nearly all Arab  cars turned back before reaching the settlers' roadblocks or, as  in the past, planned to wait till 7 o'clock before traveling on  the roads, knowing that the demonstrations end at 7 o'clock.  [passage omitted]    Large numbers of soldiers and police are on hand, but so far  there have been no confrontations, and the security forces have  decided not to disperse the settlers and to allow the protests  to continue.

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Reacting to the recent controversy over female sportswriters in locker rooms, a  New Jersey legislator proposed to prohibit all media interviews for 30 minutes  after the conclusion of sporting events.  </P> <P> Sen. John F. Russo said the bill would include sports from high school and  college level to the four professional franchises that play in New Jersey.  Russo said it would be in the best interest of sports and journalism for  players to be allowed "to cool off and take a shower" before giving postgame  interviews.  </P> <P> The NFL and the New Jersey Press Assn. opposed the proposal.  </P></p>

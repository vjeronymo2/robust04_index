			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Exchange reviews role in paperless settlement The London Stock Exchange is considering the creation of a so-called nominee company for retail investors who will find it difficult to undertake transactions once a new paperless share settlement system becomes operational. The proposals follow a setback to the exchange's plans to retain a significant role for itself in settlement following the introduction of the Crest paperless settlement system. The Bank of England has been overseeing Crest since plans for Taurus, the exchange's own paperless system, collapsed last year. The plan is one of several under consideration by the exchange, which may turn out to have little or no role in settlement. Under the latest plan the exchange would create a nominee company which could hold records of private investors' shareholdings in electronic form, enabling them to buy and sell shares more quickly. Because it is expected that share purchases will have to be paid for - or share certificates delivered - five days after each bargain is struck, investors who prefer to hold their share certificates in paper at home risk failing to complete their trades on time. Many private clients have expressed concern about nominee companies, however, partly because of security concerns. The exchange's nominee company would operate with Lloyds Bank Registrars, the UK's biggest registrar, in helping companies to identify the beneficial owners of their shares in the nominee.</p>

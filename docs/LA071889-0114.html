			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEN FAILED TO HELP DROWNING TODDLERS, FIRE CAPTAIN SAYS  </P> <P> Bystanders did nothing to help two toddlers who had fallen into a swimming  pool, said an emergency official who was able to save one of the children.  </P> <P> Fire Capt. C. A. Beasley pulled the two girls from the pool Sunday, but one of  them, 15-month-old Tiffidie Anne McGough, was dead. Her 2-year-old half-sister,  Taffidie, was in critical condition Monday in Texas Children's Hospital. Their  mother was asleep in a nearby apartment when the girls fell into the water.  </P> <P> Beasley told the Houston Chronicle that two men were standing by the apartment  house pool when he arrived, and they told him there were "dolls or dogs" in the  water.  </P> <P> "Regardless of what they thought they were, I can't imagine anybody standing  there looking at two kids in the pool," Beasley said.  </P></p>

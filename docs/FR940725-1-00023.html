			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. The Commission previously examined whether to limit various joint ventures in the context of our broadcast ownership rules. In that context, the Commission examined joint advertising sales, shared technical facilities, and joint programming arrangements (or ``time brokerage''). We noted that such joint ventures are not precluded by any Commission rule or policy so long as the Commission's ownership rules are not violated and the participating licensees maintain ultimate control over their facilities. The Commission did not impose any additional restrictions on operational joint venture arrangements, but noted that all broadcast licensees are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and maintenance of editorial control. The Commission, however, did limit time brokerage arrangements in the same local market so that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Where an individual or entity owns or has an attributable interest in one or more stations in a market, time brokerage of any other station in that market form more than 15 percent of the brokered station's broadcast hours per week will result in counting the brokered station toward the brokering licensee's permissible ownership totals under the revised local ownership rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. As explained in Radio Ownership Rules, our rules or policies do not prohibit joint marketing ventures so long as a licensee maintains  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control over the licensed facilities and complies with the antitrust laws. In the context of CMRS or PCS joint ventures, we need not concern ourselves with programming diversity because CMRS providers are, by definition, common carriers and have no control over content. We believe that there may be benefits to consumers from these joint marketing ventures. We are concerned, however, that such arrangements may provide competitors access to information, or have other anticompetitive effects, that could impede vigorous competition. Therefore, commenters should address whether a licensee who enters into a joint marketing venture with one or more licensee whose geographic market area have an overlap of 10 percent of the population should have the interest of the other joint venture licensees attributed to it for purposes of the PCS aggregations limits, the cellular-PCS cost-ownership rules, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. In addition, if the Commission finds such arrangements to be attributable interests, commenters should address whether we should adopt different rules relating to designated entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

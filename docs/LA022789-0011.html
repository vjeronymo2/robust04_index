			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY  </P> <P> I appreciated your special section Toward Equality. You are doing a public  service and serving a great need in educating the public about prejudice. I  hope that you will continue this service and cover other areas of concern and  public values. There is so much on TV and in the papers which destroys  traditional values that inserts like this are a refreshing sight.  </P> <P> GERARD P. WEBER  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / New management finds extra Ferruzzi losses FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second biggest private sector company, has revised its losses for the first five months of this year to more than double the previous L491.6bn (Pounds 205m). The new deficit of L1,165bn follows the investigation of alleged cover-ups of losses by the group's former management, and of bribes to political parties. The new management, imposed by the group's main bank creditors, said about L645bn of losses had been ascertained only recently. It called in Deloitte and Touche, the international auditors, in June to re-examine the books. Ferfin is staggering under about L31,000bn debt. The management plans to slash the group's nominal share value to only L5 from L1,000. The plan, which is likely to be approved by shareholders, involves reducing Ferfin's share capital to L205bn, from L1,370bn. It is then proposed that the shares be consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to restore the nominal value. Trading in the shares of both Ferfin and its Montedison industrial subsidiary was suspended yesterday pending the announcement. Ferfin's revised losses are believed to take account of two separate events, both previously hidden from shareholders, involving the longstanding existence of what amounts to a parallel set of books. The bulk of the additional losses stems from Ferfin's complex commodity trading operations. Leaked testimony from former executives - now co-operating with Milan magistrates investigating political corruption - has suggested that Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of Ferfin who shot himself last month, covered up between Dollars 350m and Dollars 450m of losses in US commodity futures trading in 1989. The new audits have resulted in a L245bn write-down in the capital of the group's main trading subsidiary; the discovery of a L84bn 'irrecoverable' loan by one of its offshoots; and a L165bn foreign exchange loss by another trading operation. Together, the new losses are in line with the 'shortfall' of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 270m in Ferfin's accounts to July 1991 alleged by Mr Gardini in a file in his personal computer. The file, which was compiled just before his death, was believed to be for Milan magistrates. Ferfin's new management has also adjusted the group's results to reflect irregularities arising after Mr Gardini stepped down. For instance, it is not recognising L79.3bn in assumed 1993 royalties from the Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary, sold to Sweden's Procordia group in March.</p>

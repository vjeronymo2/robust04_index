			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Middle East and Gulf growth rates halve The overall growth rate for the economies of the Gulf and other leading Middle Eastern states more than halved in 1993 from its level the preceding year, slumping to an aggregate 3.5 per cent from 6.8 per cent, according to a newly-published report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Amman-based United Nations agency. The ESCWA study, which covers the seven Arabian Peninsula states and Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, lists low oil prices, poor export performances, continued sanctions on Iraq's economy, political uncertainties in Egypt and Yemen and 'the generally depressed state of regional co-operation' as the chief factors in the decline. Only two states, Yemen and Qatar, recorded negative growth rates in 1993, the report says, but weak oil prices helped cut aggregate GDP growth for the Gulf Co-operation Countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) to a rate of 3.3 per cent from 7.5 per cent in 1992. More positively, the report notes that economic reforms 'gained momentum', particularly in Jordan, which recorded 6 per cent growth in 1993 and where both inflation and unemployment were substantially reduced, and Egypt, which the report says showed growth the same year of 1.8 per cent. But it says delays in Egypt's implementation of reforms and disagreements with the IMF and World Bank have had a 'negative impact on economic growth and the state of investors' confidence'. The report also notes the positive effects of Lebanon's stabilisation policy  -which it calls 'implicitly in line' with IMF recommendations - and Syrian policies which, it says, are 'aimed at gradually opening up and deregulating the economy'. Both Lebanon and Syria showed improved growth in 1993 over 1992, the study says, with rates rising to 7 from 5 per cent and to 6 from 5 per cent respectively. However, it says that generally positive growth rates have failed to arrest increasing discrepancies within the countries it covers: 'The majority of the poor and rural population continues to be deprived and marginalised in most countries of the ESCWA region.' The report estimates total external debt of the region to have grown to Dollars 186bn (Pounds 124bn) from Dollars 180bn over the period, representing 62 per cent of aggregate GDP in 1993. While it says Egypt and Jordan, in particular, have recently improved the terms of their debt repayment, the report notes the region's external debt constituted 11.5 per cent of total developing country debt.</p>

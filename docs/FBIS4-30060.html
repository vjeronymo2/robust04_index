			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Thursday indicated the possibility of stepping down with his  entire cabinet to fashion a fresh coalition government and  tackle a host of formidable domestic and foreign policy  challenges. Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband his cabinet  if it is necessary to bring the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a  former member of the ruling coalition, back to the fold. The  coalition and the SDP are currently holding rounds of realliance  talks.    "I would like to leave (everything), including the issue of  my resignation, to the decision of the talks," he said at a news  conference. Today, we are in an extremely difficult situation,"  Hata said. "It is tremendously important to form a powerful  government in order to get through this difficulty."    Hata met the press shortly after the long-overdue fiscal  1994  budget cleared the Diet and the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence motion against the  Hata government.    The premier said he will relay his intention to SDP  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama when they meet later Thursday to  weigh the option of forming a new coalition government with the  SDP's participation.    The SDP, the largest contingent in the last government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the ruling  coalition in late April, forcing Hosokawa's successor, Hata, to  form Japan's first minority administration since 1955.    The coalition is prepared to accept in principle the terms  for the SDP's return. One last hurdle is the SDP's demand that  the Hata cabinet resign en masse before the formation of a new  administration.    On the LDP's submission of a no-confidence motion, Hata  countered he has exerted strong leadership to deal with numerous  tasks for the sake of Japanese livelihoods since assuming office  two month ago.    Hata renewed his opposition to the idea of holding the next  general election under the current multiseat electoral system,  which is soon to be replaced by a new system combining  single-seat constituencies with proportional representation.    ``Now is not the time to contest an election under the  present multiseat system,'' because a government panel will  shortly finish its task of redrawing a new electoral map for the  House of Representatives, he said.    Although the Diet legislated in January a package of  electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional  passage of a yet-unformed redistricting bill is required to  allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the new  system.    But he also said he has no intention of waiving his right to  dissolve the lower house as head of government.    ``The last resort for the premier when facing off with  parliament is to exercise the right to dissolve (the lower  house),'' Hata said. ''And I cannot deny this.''</p>

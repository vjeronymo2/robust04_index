			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["tl" report: "SPD Wants To Reduce German Contribution to </F> European Union"]    [Text] Bonn, 16 May -- The Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] wants to reduce Germany's net contribution to the  European Union [EU]. This plan is part of a 10-point  declaration, which was presented by SPD federal and land experts  for financial matters yesterday.    A fairer distribution of the contributions must be ensured  in  the European Union, the SPD's financial program says. Since  Germany has fallen from second to seventh place on the European  scale of prosperity after unification, in particular the returns  from Brussels to the new laender are to be increased. To  "prevent" Germany's payments to Brussels "from continuing to  skyrocket," strict budget discipline must be ensured in the EU,  in the SPD's view. Within the framework of a reform of the EU  budget, the SPD also wants to check which fields need to be  regulated at the EU level in the first place.    With these proposals the SPD financial experts go even  beyond  the plans by FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social  Union [CSU]), who has also come out in favor of reducing the  German net contribution to the EU. Furthermore, the 10-point  declaration of the SPD budget experts, which was presented by  SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and North Rhine-Westphalian  Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser yesterday, contains harsh  criticism of the Federal Government's budget policy. Over the  past years the government has decided tax increases of about 115  billion German marks per year. With the SPD there will not be  any further increase in the tax quota, the statement says.  Lafontaine accused the CSU/CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and  the FDP [Free Democratic Party] of planning four tax increases:  raising value-added tax, property tax, and petroleum tax, as  well as introducing highway tolls. Lafontaine underpinned this  by citing statements by top politicians of the coalition, which  were however partly denied or retracted.</p>

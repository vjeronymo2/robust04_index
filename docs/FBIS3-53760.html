			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Husam Sannun, a resident of Hebron who was  critically injured yesterday evening during the dispersal of a  riot near the local Islamic College, died today at Hadassah-'En  Kerem Hospital. The physicians ruled that he was hit in the head  by an ax, and not by a bullet, as had been initially claimed.  Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the riot in Hebron  was dispersed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers' gunfire.    A soldier was lightly injured in Rafah when a fragmentation  grenade was thrown at an IDF patrol. The soldiers opened fire  at the estimated site from which the grenade was thrown. IDF  troops launched searches in the area.</p>

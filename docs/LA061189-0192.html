			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: MEN AND WOMEN DRESSING THE PART EDITED BY CLAUDIA BRUSH  KIDWELL AND VALERIE STEELE (SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PRESS: $40, CLOTH, $24.95,  PAPER; 188 PP.)  </P> <P> "Men and Women: Dressing the Part" is too stiff and dressy a title for a book  that might better have sported a more casual label. The argument the book hopes  to make is that clothing expresses the subordination of women; because male  symbols are more highly valued, any moves toward sexual equality in this area  have entailed women's adoption of men's clothing. "If and when equality comes,"  the text states, "both men and women will be free to express their unique  individuality drawing from the broad vocabulary of masculinity and femininity."  This conclusion has no firmer support than avant-garde designer Rudi  Gernreich's 1970 vision of men and women wearing miniskirts and trousers  interchangeably -- although the authors take a dim view of his sexually  differentiated sketches. A serious discussion of gender identity and sexual  inequality demands sterner stuff.  </P> <P> There is no need to impose on this wealth of subject matter any single,  restrictive theory of the functions of clothing. The articles -- written by  several contributors -- suggest a wide variety of links between gender  identity, cultural values, social interactions and dress. The discussions  provide much of substance, from the impact of mass production on clothing  design and policemen's early resistance to wearing uniforms to the evolution of  sportswear from the mid-19th Century to the present. One chapter asks why  today's infant clothing is more sex-typed than in the past. Prior to World War  II, boys' first haircuts and first trousers were described as traumatic for the  mother. Tracing the changes in toddler dress, the article concludes that  parents since World War I have become increasingly preoccupied with teaching  their young children "sex roles," ostensibly for their psychological health.  </P></p>

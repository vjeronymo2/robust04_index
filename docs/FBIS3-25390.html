Following the recent government crisis in Mali, Muriel  Pomponne took stock with the Malian president of the  difficulties facing the country. For 10 days or so, Mali has  had a new government set up around the majority party, Adema  [Alliance for Democracy in Mali]. The other political parties,  including the CNID [National Committee of Democratic  Initiative], which joined the government nine months ago, have  left. Muriel Pomponne asked President Konare whether this was  not the failure of his policy aimed at opening up the political  spectrum:    [Konare] During the electoral campaigns we advocated  political openness. This was not a mere slogan. Of course, a  certain number of parties have left, to our regret, because it  is not what we wanted, and I have to say that, following the  prime minister's resignation, it was not very welcome, given the  scale of the difficulties. Those who remain must face up to the  situation and believe me, they will, in keeping with this spirit  of openness.    [Pomponne] There is another education crisis right now in  Mali. Students have taken to the streets again. It would seem  that ever since the beginning of the third republic,  institutions and Malian students have not been able to agree.    [Konare] The education crisis dates back a long time before  the third republic was born. We are dealing with pupils and  students whose desire to see the country go forward, we do not  doubt, because they understand that without a democratic Mali  none of their problems can be solved. We are also applying  ourselves to making sure that all political parties understand  that the educational arena must cease being a target for  political parties.    [Pomponne] You are also facing an economic and social  situation which has been somewhat difficult since the  devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. You  recently had the opportunity, in Yamoussoukro for instance, to  meet the French authorities at the highest level. Did you  receive assurances from your partners in development?    [Konare] We did receive assurances from them. We spoke about  several specific actions. A social fund for development was  announced. We would like this special fund for development to  be managed with full Malian participation, and a maximum of  projects to be funded. We raised debt issues which tie us to  France, monetary debts for instance. We also raised the issue  of certain subsidies France is willing to put at our disposal.  The issue of African companies, of Malian companies, which deal  with France was also raised, and I believe that all these issues  concern our French partners.    [Pomponne] Did you get any positive answers?    [Konare] I would like to say that we got the feeling that we  were being not only listened to, but also understood.    [Pomponne] Mr President, when you came to power two years  ago, Tuareg rebels had just reached a peace agreement with the  Malian government. Two years on, what do you make of what was  then called the national pact?    [Konare] I think we still have peace, despite a few  incidents  here and there. The pact is undoubtedly our main asset. Of  course, I would have liked things to go much better, I would  have liked to get much more. This is not the case in some  respects. But there are difficulties on the ground,  psychological difficulties, political difficulties. We have  identified a certain number of difficulties which I hope to iron  out very quickly.    First of all, the absence of an administration on the  ground,  which means that specific needs of the people such as schools,  health, and veterinary centers for instance are not being met  very quickly. It is important for local administration to be  got on the ground very soon.    There is the issue of integration into the armed forces and  the security forces. Efforts have been made, efforts are being  made. You know, 660 have already been integrated, including  officers. We are going to integrate more. We are in the  process of assessing [the number of men to be integrated]. As I  said, some figures have been given. Some say 2,000, others  3,000. I think that those people know that this figure is  unrealistic given the size of our army and, as I said, we will  never introduce ethnic or racial criteria for armed forces and  security forces.    Civil servants will be recruited in order to facilitate the  good management of the north of our country. But great efforts  will have to be made in order to start numerous development  programs on the ground, and it is within these development  programs that real integration will take place.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Swiss seek closer EC security ties SWITZERLAND is seeking closer security ties with other European countries, in spite of its traditional strict neutrality policy and the rejection by Swiss voters last December of closer economic ties with the European Community. The Swiss foreign ministry yesterday confirmed a Zurich newspaper report that closer ties were being sought with European security organisations. But it said membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or the Western European Union was not being considered. The Swiss government, which is not even a member of the United Nations, has been reviewing its foreign and security policies since the end of the cold war and in the light of advances in military technology. A report by a group of experts in March 1992 recommended that only the strictest definition of neutrality - not participating militarily in wars between other countries - should be retained. This would leave the way open for joining the EC and the WEU and for participating in multilaterally agreed economic sanctions against delinquent countries. In 1990, the country participated in the UN-sponsored economic blockade of Iraq. In the current debate over the government's plan to purchase F/A-18 fighter aircraft for the Swiss air force, some experts argue that air defence strategies for a small, landlocked country like Switzerland are now credible only in the context of co-ordinated European strategies. The cabinet is expected to announce the conclusions of its security and foreign policy review during the summer.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Filofax at Pounds 1.27m as margins rise Filofax Group, the personal organiser company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 950,000 to Pounds 1.27m in the six months to the end of September. 'Operating profit has increased by 38 per cent and that 38 per cent derives very simply from an increase in sales and an increase in margins,' said Mr Robin Field, chief executive. 'It's about providing a useful product to real people,' he added. Earnings per share dropped to 4p (4.3p) as the company almost exhausted available tax losses and took a charge this time of Pounds 375,000 on a 'conservative' rate of 30 per cent. The board declared an increased interim dividend of 0.75p (0.5p). Mr Field said he had every confidence in a strong performance during Christmas and beyond. The company aims to broaden its product range over the next three to five years. 'Over time as the thing grows, we would expect it to become more broadly based and to cease to rely on just the one product,' said Mr Field. Sales rose 34 per cent to Pounds 8.31m (Pounds 6.18m), but the results did not portend the return of the yuppie. 'We have never sold much to yuppies. Our ideal customers are busy housewives - female, social, domestic customers,' Mr Field added. Gross margins increased reflecting improved purchasing efficiency and the continued move towards selling directly to retailers. Filofax spent about Pounds 3m in cash on three acquisitions in the last four months, including its Swedish and German distributors just before the September half-year end which together contributed Pounds 375,000 to sales. The company received Pounds 35,000 (Pounds 56,000) in interest and expects to have a positive cash balance at the year end. Filofax also announced a change of brokers from UBS to Hoare Govett. UBS said it was very disappointed by the move.</p>

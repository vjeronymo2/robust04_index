			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Leading Article: A fruitless day's work THIS WEEK'S EC agreement on a 48-hour maximum working week and other limits on working time reflects poorly on everyone involved. Britain, the odd-country-out on community social policy, remains truculent and isolated to the last. Having campaigned with bogus figures and matchless bluster, before abstaining in the crucial vote, the UK will now take the matter to the European Court. The European Commission stands accused, backed by key member states, of disguising the changes as a health and safety measure, in order to make them subject to majority rather than unanimous voting in the council. Some member states have meanwhile let it be known privately that while they agree with Britain, they cannot afford to be seen to do so. When these new measures reach national statute books in three or four years, they will in reality make little impact, since most of the 12 have legal restrictions which already match or are tighter than required under the EC agreement. Britain, the only country with no legal limits on the working week or minimum holiday entitlements, faces the biggest shift. Yet even in Britain, the effect promises to be modest; mutually voluntary arrangements are exempt from the rules, as are certain occupations, and there is to be a delay of at least 10 years before the start of the 48-hour week as such. Most ironic of all, the fact that the measure has been classified as 'health and safety' means that it will be overseen by a hard-pressed health and safety executive, which is unlikely to make policing of working-hours registers its highest priority. The most striking fact of all, however, is that in the three years it has taken the 12 to agree a form of words on working hours, unemployment in the Community has risen by 3.2m, from 8.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent. It is still rising. These years have also brought the prospect of a greatly enlarged Community, and the cracking of the EC's exchange rate regime under the strain of economic diversity among its existing 12 members. If ever it were possible to imagine a lockstep march towards identical working conditions from Copenhagen to Athens, that moment has surely passed. What workers want from Community social policy today is most of all an economy sufficiently competitive and prosperous to provide them with jobs. There have been welcome signs lately that the Commission may be beginning to recognise the case for making job creation a higher priority than labour rule harmonisation, or at least to calculate the cost of any proposed social measures. If that means anything, it implies further flexibility on labour market regulation. None of this is to imply that any well-run company would want systematically to deny its workforce a daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours, at least one day a week off, a break after six hours and at least three to four weeks' annual holiday. But these are goals not best achieved by Community-wide laws irregularly enforced by inspectors with more important tasks to perform.</p>

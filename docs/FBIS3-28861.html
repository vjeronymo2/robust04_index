			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the morning of 10 February, a plenary session of  the Council of Ministers was held under the chairmanship of  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and  Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, of the Royal Government  of Cambodia to examine a number of bills and major issues.    1. The meeting discussed and adopted the bill on the  establishment and the functioning of the Supreme Council of  Judges. This bill, consisting of 22 articles, is very important.  It not only ensures the independence of the judiciary but is  also the basis of a law to move toward the establishment and the  functioning of the Constitutional Council of the Kingdom of  Cambodia [KOC]. The state secretariat for relations with  Parliament will submit this bill to the National Assembly for  examination and decision.    2. In accordance with Article 41 of the KOC Constitution,  the cabinet decided to examine the press law at its next meeting  to determine the freedom of the press, freedom of publication,  and the responsibility of organizations or networks  disseminating information to Cambodian listeners. This is to  conform with the country's political situation.    3. The cabinet also discussed the legal procedures relating  to the cabinet and assigned the cabinet office to supervise and  implement this task.    4. The meeting also listened to the report by the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on goals  relating to the consolidation and expansion of international  relations, particularly bilateral relations with countries that  have diplomatic relations with the KOC.    5. The plenary session also listened to the report by the  Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Mines on the progress of oil  exploration and on the restoration and repair of hydropower.  The cabinet examined a number of concrete measures to ensure  proper and firm implementation of the decisions of the cabinet  at its plenary session on 26 January, which set the electricity  rate at 350 riel per kilowatt/hour for general users. Relevant  ministries were requested to consider reducing the rate for  light industry.    6. The cabinet also listened to the report by the Tourism  Ministry relating to a number of principles for developing  tourism.    The cabinet closed its plenary session at 1145 with a lofty  spirit of unanimity and responsibility.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 10 February 1994</p>

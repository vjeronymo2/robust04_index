			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Letting lift for BAA offshoot BAA, the airport operator, said Lynton, its property development and investment arm, had more than doubled the amount of office, retail, and industrial space it let last year to 815,000 sq ft - more than 18 acres. In addition, 27 acres of development land were sold, and planning consent was achieved for a new 325,000 sq ft business park at Gatwick Airport. Mr John O'Halloran, a director of Lynton, said he was delighted that the business had performed so well in what was still a very difficult letting market.</p>

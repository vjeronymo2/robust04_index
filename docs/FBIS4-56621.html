			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Miranda, national secretary of </F> energy; place and date not given; first three paragraphs are  PRESENCIA introduction]    [Excerpts] Confident that Bolivia's geography offers great  advantages for natural gas, National Secretary of Energy Carlos  Miranda is enthusiastic about converting Bolivia into a center  to supply gas to Latin America's southern cone for the next 50  years.    Not only is he responsible for hydrocarbons, but also  electricity and other energy sources, like wind and solar power,  which he believes should be the ones Bolivia uses most in the  future.    At the same time, he is preparing to begin the process of  privatizing the companies in this sector: YPFB [Bolivian  Government Oil Deposits] and ENDE [National Electricity  Enterprise]; to continue negotiations to build the gas pipeline  to Brazil; to oversee compliance of the accords with Argentina;  and to analyze the possibilities of selling gas to Paraguay and  Chile. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Gas Routes </H5>   [PRESENCIA] You have been one of the promoters of the  project  to convert Bolivia into a center for supplying gas to the  Southern Cone. What is that project based on?    [Miranda] The vision that we have (I can no longer say that  I  have, for it seems that everybody has adopted this view) is that  for natural gas, our geographic position in the center of the  continent is an advantage. We are a sort of Latin American  Tibet. To the west lie the Andes, a formidable barrier; to the  north and east, the great green barrier of the Amazon forests;  and to the south, thousands of kilometers of pampas. And we are  right in the middle.    While we have blamed a large part of our troubles on this  landlocked position, I believe we have a special edge for  natural gas because on both coasts--that is, toward the Atlantic  and the Pacific--we have two neighbors with structural energy  shortages, which means that they are not expected to be able to  provide all the energy they need for their own consumption. To  the south is Argentina, the third or fourth leading consumer of  gas in the world, proportionally: 40 percent of the energy  Argentina and Brazil consume is gas. So we have two large  potential markets and one large real market to the south.    That is the origin of the concept that Bolivia may become a  gas supply and distribution center, for we also have Peru with  large gas deposits in Camisea. Let me repeat this: our  geographic position and those markets, plus the availability of  resources, make those prospects possible.    How is all this taking shape? We are starting with Brazil.  PETROBRAS [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has submitted its  engineering costs study to us.    [PRESENCIA] Is the engineering costs study for the gas  pipeline from its border to Sao Paulo or does it include the  entire pipeline?    [Miranda] It includes the entire pipeline. Actually, the  study covers the gas pipeline for the Rio Grande (Santa  Cruz)-Campinas-Sao Paulo-Curitiba-Porto Alegre line; this gas  pipeline is not going to supply only Sao Paulo, but the entire  Brazilian southeast. It opens up to us both the Sao Paulo market  and the market in southern Brazil, its most productive area.    To the south, we have been supplying gas to Argentina for  over 20 years. The result of our latest trip is that we now have  a supplemental accord for hydrocarbons. We have worked out a  great concept here: hydrocarbons and their by-products from  Bolivia can flow to Argentina free of taxes and without any  tariff or paratariff barriers, and vice versa. Our view is that  while we are suppliers to Argentina, at some given moment we may  also be purchasers from Argentina or transporters of Argentine  gas to Brazil or other points.    [PRESENCIA] But by eliminating tariffs, are we not hurting  ourselves, especially when acting as a distribution center?    [Miranda] No; we would be doing ourselves no favor if we put  tariffs on gas that comes into Bolivia to be sent on to other  markets. We want gas to flow through Bolivia "as fluidly as  possible."    The gas pipeline system that we have now, as well as the  projected system, are designed to create a large closed circuit  on the Atlantic coast, where gas can flow in any direction.    [PRESENCIA] Give us an example of the advantages for Bolivia  of transporting Argentine gas to Brazil.    [Miranda] Making maximum use of our infrastructure that has  been built so that it can be expanded.    [PRESENCIA] Will a toll fee be charged?    [Miranda] Of course!    [PRESENCIA] Who will set the rates?    [Miranda] That will be determined at the precise time the  operation is conducted. But such fees are a fully accepted  practice all over the world. We also plan to go to Chile, and  this gas from northern Argentina has to flow through Bolivia to  enter Chile too. The Argentines are going to build a gas  pipeline to Santiago. We plan to go to Antofagasta; it is my  goal to have this circuit also completed by 2015 or 2020.    These are large markets; the gas will come from Bolivia's  reserves, from northern Argentina, and from Comisea (Peru), and  Bolivia will serve as the gas supply and distribution center.    [PRESENCIA] What does that mean in terms of volumes,  dimensions, and money?    [Miranda] With what we have now, by using 3.4 trillion we  can  supply Brazil with 560 million cubic feet of gas per day. That  means that if we have 10 times more, we can supply the entire  system, in the long term, with 5.6 billion cubic feet a day.    [PRESENCIA] With our own reserves?    [Miranda] With our own reserves.    [PRESENCIA] What does that represent in time?    [Miranda] It will mean 20 uninterrupted years, and with the  Bolivian reserves that may come to 33. If we add the reserves  from northern Argentina in this integrated system, plus the  Camisea reserves, we are talking about a gas pipeline system  that could handle about 50 trillion cubic feet a day for 20 to  50 years.    [PRESENCIA] What does this mean in terms of money?    [Miranda] We are getting into some very special calculations  and speculations. We will say the following: the 215 million  cubic feet that we now send to Argentina represents $100 million  in revenues a year. So right away the Brazilian business will be  more than $250 million a year. The problem is determining how  much gas will cost in the long term. But at constant prices, we  are talking about eight times what we can send to Brazil, that  is $1.6 billion a year in 20 years, in a gradual process that  will continue to grow.    Let us not forget that gas is the fossil fuel of the 21st  century. The data show that everybody is trying to move as much  toward gas as possible, because it is the least polluting fuel.  Moreover, it has a stable and permanent supply.    To recap these ideas: our geographic position with markets  around us, and natural resources in and near Bolivia (northern  Argentina and Peru) make it possible to plan this large network,  and in very conservative figures, we are speaking of this order  of magnitude.    [PRESENCIA] Geologically, what will happen when this energy  supply comes to an end? Will it be necessary to change the  energy matrix?    [Miranda] Yes, but that is at least 50 years in the future.  What happens to the other energy sources? That is why I speak of  gas fundamentally as energy for export, for our most abundant  resource is hydroelectric power. We should export gas and  generate our own energy hydroelectrically to the greatest extent  possible.    Let me point out that along with this gas production, we  estimate that while we have 22 trillion cubic feet of gas still  remaining to be discovered in the country, we estimate that we  also have about 4 billion barrels of petroleum, so I am talking  about another 40 to 50 years of petroleum as well.    We should not address the problem by asking what will happen  when our petroleum or gas are depleted, for we are talking about  a time frame of at least 50 years. That same situation is true  all over the world. Everything now known about hydrocarbon  reserves and consumption on a global level shows that up to 2040  the figure is certain. From that point forward it is very  difficult to foresee.    The image of a nonrenewable resource that is going to come  to  an end is relative, for at the same time a number of substitutes  have to come in. Work is being done on other fuels like  hydrogen, and others are being sought. But right now, in global  terms, the world remains dependent on hydrocarbons as its great  energy source, and in national terms, we are in the same  position and have a horizon similar to the world position,  perhaps a tiny bit beyond that.  <H5>  Gas Pipeline Being Built </H5>   [PRESENCIA] How are negotiations going for gas sales to  Brazil?    [Miranda] This is the situation now. First, PETROBRAS has  defined how it wants to bring the entire project to Porto  Alegre. A very detailed engineering cost study has been received  and the general feeling that we have, that they gave us, is that  despite the World Bank's objections, the gas pipeline, first of  all, is Latin America's biggest energy project, and that is  extremely important. Second, it has such appeal to any investor  that they are sure that despite the World Bank's objections,  financing will be arranged at terms that are acceptable for the  investor and for us (the producers and consumers).    Obviously, it would be easier with the World Bank, but the  president of PETROBRAS told me that when they were going to  build the Itaipu dam, the bank raised similar and many more  objections, but they went ahead and built Itaipu, which is  larger than the gas pipeline project, so he was quite sure that  this project will go ahead.    [PRESENCIA] What might the problems be in PETROBRAS? There  was said to be internal opposition to the project.    [Miranda] The problem is that PETROBRAS, constitutionally,  holds a monopoly on the import and supply of hydrocarbons in  Brazil. That led the World Bank to raise that objection.    The problem is in the hands of the Brazilian Congress. Until  15 May, they are going to be reforming their Constitution and  they are studying that and many other reforms. There is a strong  inclination to take the monopoly on the import, transport, and  marketing of hydrocarbons in Brazil away from PETROBRAS.    Where is it going to end up? We do not know, as this is an  internal Brazilian problem. Some indications seem to suggest  that PETROBRAS might retain a large part of its monopoly, but  for gas it might no longer hold that monopoly.    If that happens, the financing problem would be much easier,  because in the end, that will result in repayment guarantees for  the loans they get to build the pipeline. With the monopoly, the  view from outside is that PETROBRAS is not a sufficient  guarantor, but if it loses the monopoly, those guarantees would  exist.    So far, we know of three large consortia that would  definitely like to compete to build the project. These include  Enron, the BHP, Tenneco, and British Gas group, which has  visited the country, and according to PETROBRAS, the French  group TOTAL.    [PRESENCIA] Would this be with or without PETROBRAS as the  majority enterprise?    [Miranda] Yes, it would be with or without PETROBRAS holding  the majority.    [PRESENCIA] Is YPFB able to handle that job for the  Brazilian  part?    [Miranda] Yes, there would be no problem on the Bolivian  side.    [PRESENCIA] Then why are you saying that the project will be  built with private capital?    [Miranda] Because we decided that this project will be  carried out fundamentally--not exclusively--with private  investment.    [PRESENCIA] Why?    [Miranda] Because there is now no intention for YPFB to get  involved in this type of investment. YPFB has no access to  financing sources. One reason for its privatization is the  closeoff of concessionaire multinational capital continuing with  the state as a contractor.    [PRESENCIA] How much do you calculate will be invested on  the  Bolivian side?    [Miranda] About $450 million. Of that amount, half will  easily be spent on materials and at least about $100 million on  labor.    [PRESENCIA] And the Brazilian investment?    [Miranda] To Porto Alegre, about $1.6 billion. The total  project is on the order of $2 billion.    [PRESENCIA] Does the Bolivian investment include the supply  of gas to be exported?    [Miranda] No, that is another item. For the supply to the  pipe, it is estimated--with a fairly good degree of  precision--that we will invest about $700 million over the next  10 years to develop fields, build feeder lines, and put a large  plant in Rio Grande.    [PRESENCIA] To whom will the gas pipeline belong?    [Miranda] To the transporting enterprise, but our  legislation  will state that any gas producer, not just YPFB, may enter this  pipeline. We have to see two things: that YPFB has the sales  contract, it must provide; and the transporter will be the one  that has the line and carries the gas. This line will be a  "common carrier," so any enterprise will have the right to enter  the line by paying its toll fee. All this, controlled by the  regulatory agency, will be set up as part of the privatization  process.  <H5>  Argentine Compensation </H5>   [PRESENCIA] Could you explain the contents of the agreement  that has been signed in Argentina?    [Miranda] We have signed a three-year sales contract. We are  going to increase the volume of gas a little. Before, we were  selling 200 million cubic feet and we are going to raise that to  215, and we are also increasing the "take or pay."    [PRESENCIA] What is "take or pay"?    [Miranda] These things are not absolutely precise; there are  seasonal fluctuations in demand and other factors, so "take or  pay" means that the purchaser is obliged to pay the seller for a  minimum volume of what has been contracted, even if he does not  take the entire amount. This is called "take or pay," meaning  that even if you do not receive, you still have to pay. In the  petroleum world, gas contracts are written with "take or pay"  clauses of 80 or 75 percent. We got 92.5 percent.    [PRESENCIA] So if you do not use the gas, you pay us 92.5  percent of what was agreed?    [Miranda] Of the volume of which we spoke. The previous  contract had an 85 percent "take or pay" clause.    [PRESENCIA] What does Argentina do with that unused gas?    [Miranda] It puts it into its system, which it has to sell,  and if not it will still have to pay for it. Fortunately, we  have not had to use a "take or pay" with Argentina. They took  everything we sent. We are now beginning a seasonal pricing  mode: in winter it costs a little more and in summer a little  less. The first year the price is going to be 1.05 [denomination  not given] in summer and 1.10 in winter; the second year, 1.10  and 1.15; the third year, 1.15 and 1.20. And the door has been  left open so that in the future, prices can be set based on  variations in fuel oil prices. But that is still a potential  arrangement.    [PRESENCIA] The contract also includes the possibility of  importing and exporting other by-products....    [Miranda] Yes. As a consequence of the termination of the  old  arrangement and starting new accounts, it was agreed that  Bolivian gas could enter the deregulated Argentine market  without any tariff and that it would be treated like Argentine  gas. In exchange, Bolivia also lowered tariff barriers on all of  Argentina's petroleum by-products until the year 2002.    The change that has been introduced means that there is now  no time limit, it is indefinite. So this creates a free energy  market between Bolivia and Argentina, bearing in mind that we  are becoming a gas distribution center.    [PRESENCIA] In those conditions, is it possible that  Argentina may send us gasoline that is cheaper than YPFB's  gasoline?    [Miranda] I do not think so, theoretically no. Do not forget  that when we deregulate the market, which we are going to have  to do in 120 days, we are going to enter a new system of setting  prices in Bolivia.    There will no longer be transfers from YPFB to the Treasury  (which come to 65 percent); instead, there will be the ICE  [Specific Consumption Tax]. So from now on, it will be the  company's efficiency that will enable it to obtain the lowest  possible cost. Right now, we are bringing diesel fuel from  Argentina which, since there is no ICE or transfer, is an  excellent deal. But when we start the ICE system, we are going  to have an intermediate import and export parity model that will  make it almost a matter of indifference whether it is a Bolivian  or imported product.    [PRESENCIA] Luckily, gasoline prices did not go up at the  start of the year....    [Miranda] That is part of the reason why.    [PRESENCIA] But will they go up automatically?    [Miranda] No, we do not expect prices to rise, because in  this system what interests us most is that the ICE replaces  YPFB's 65 percent transfer. It will be a tax in the full meaning  of the word. Then YPFB will be able to compete perfectly. It has  been hard to compete with YPFB, because all the pipelines are  set up for domestic consumption, and bringing products in from  other countries to Bolivia is difficult. We do not believe that  will cause major disruptions; perhaps in some products there may  be some things that do not work smoothly, but I do not think it  will cause any problems for the Treasury.    [PRESENCIA] And for the citizens?    [Miranda] Or for the citizens, for if the YPFB product plus  the ICE is too expensive, the imported product will take away  its market.    [PRESENCIA] What does it mean that YPFB and YPFSA  [Government  Oil Deposits, S.A.] (of Argentina) can join in an association?    [Miranda] The association contract that has been initialized  and that will take effect very soon is our first such contract  in Bolivia. It means that YPFB signs an association contract  with YPFSA of Argentina. YPFSA conducts the operation at its own  risk, using its own resources. When there is commercial  production, YPFB has the option of working in association or  continuing with an operating contract like the ones we already  have, and for everything that has been invested, YPFB only  acknowledges the costs of commercially exploitable wells.    [PRESENCIA] One last issue with Argentina. They have made a  payment to us of $84 million. Why?    [Miranda] Basically, they have given us $84 million, of  which  $50 million is fully and totally available, and $34 million is  to be used for border development projects.    [PRESENCIA] Why are they making this payment?    [Miranda] Our proposal goes like this: "Gentlemen, as you  are  our sole gas market, you set the price (this is the truth; as we  do not have anyone else to sell it to, they set the price), and  as you put us in the position of keeping all of your economic  activity balanced, you have to compensate us." That was the  rationale behind that proposal.  <H5>  We Are Changing the Nation </H5>   Carlos Miranda was inevitably asked about the privatization  of YPFB and ENDE, which are now under his stewardship.    In both cases, he expressed confidence that this process  will  move forward, although slowly.    He said YPFB's value is between $1.5 and $2 billion, but  there are some variables that could cause its value to rise.    [PRESENCIA] Who will be the owner of the pipelines?    [Miranda] The party who privatizes it: the state is  completely withdrawing.    [PRESENCIA] What does the clause in the Privatization Law  mean, which says that hydrocarbon resources remain the "property  of the state and are inalienable and nontransferable"?    [Miranda] That means that the state, when it privatizes or  awards areas through contracts or licensing arrangements, is not  giving away the reserves, which remain under its control.    [PRESENCIA] What does market deregulation mean for  hydrocarbons?    [Miranda] Deregulation will be a gradual process. In a  country full of ports it is very easy to do this; in Bolivia the  process is quite complicated. At first, it will mean that YPFB's  transfers will be compensated with both sales and production  taxes, and that prices will not be set by decree, as they are  now, but by the workings of supply and demand.    [PRESENCIA] YPFB now has contracts with a number of  companies. Will the privatization process include them?    [Miranda] One issue that is being discussed is whether we  will privatize YPFB by itself or with its contracts as well. If  we take the first route, the companies will be able to sell  their products. If we choose the second route, everything is  going to pass through the hands of the privatized YPFB.    Those two positions both have their pros and cons. If we  privatize YPFB with its contracts, we are replacing a public  monopoly with a private monopoly. Of course, here the regulatory  agencies will be greatly involved in order to avoid any unfair  consumer practices. That is what concerns us. The other model  will be simpler, as they will enter a full competition system.  <H5>  Electricity </H5>   Then Miranda explained the benefits of privatizing ENDE,  even  though the company now generates profits and performs a social  function by undertaking unprofitable projects, especially in  rural areas.    "First, ENDE is now a financially sound company as the  Treasury has covered over $100 million of its debts. To continue  expanding, ENDE is in the same position as YPFB. It would have  to turn to external financing that is closed for this type of  project, so the possibility of ENDE's expansion, not in the  short term, as it has financing for the next two or three years,  might be a problem."    He added that "the model is adjusted so that Bolivia can  substantially increase the rate of growth of its Gross Domestic  Product. That will present major energy requirements, as we will  need energy in order to grow. ENDE can handle a growth of 3  percent, but if we raise this rate to 6, 7, 8, or 9 percent,  there will be big financing problems, and that is one of the  fundamental reasons for privatizing ENDE."    "By privatizing ENDE--and we are quite sure about the  model--we want to create the conditions for healthy competition."  <H5>  Rural Electrification: the Third Arm </H5>   Miranda explained that rural electrification is complicated  "because the problem of rural areas is not simply electricity.  In essence, it is a problem of poverty: of being able to bring  energy in any form (electricity, LPG [Liquefied Petroleum Gas],  kerosene, unconventional forms of energy), and then having the  ability to pay for it."    To deal with that situation, his office is working on a plan  to establish the DIFER [Office of Rural Energy Promotion], which  will serve as a link between organizations like NGO's  [nongovernmental organizations], foundations, and multilateral  and private institutions, with municipalities, in order to  finance specific projects in specific areas.    Local participation will be involved in that process  because,  with that, communities will be able to determine precisely what  their needs are and develop appropriate projects, which will not  necessarily involve electricity.    He made it clear that that plan "is outside the  privatization  plan, but it is not intended that the state will do everything,  for that has been a failure."    Enthusiastically, he said this is "our third big plan and it  is the one which presents the greatest challenges, because to  set loose, absolutely in the hands of market forces, almost 50  percent of the rural population would not be very prudent. We  need to develop a system to give rural inhabitants access to  energy."    He insisted that "this still needs to be worked out, for we  have to coordinate this very well with all the social  development programs. We have to recognize the problem of  agriculture, the problem of energy for agriculture is the  problem of poverty. This is a slow and complex process, but we  are putting much faith in the process."</p>

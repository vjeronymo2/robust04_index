			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Abtrust launches high yield trust Abtrust, the Aberdeen-based fund management group, is launching a High Income Investment Trust. It will offer an initial yield of about 7 per cent by investing mainly in the income shares of split capital investment trusts, or the ordinary shares of other high-yielding investment trusts. About 80 per cent of the trust will be invested in this way, with the remainder used to buy shares in other investment trusts with the potential for capital growth. The trust aims to raise a total of Pounds 40m; a placing has already raised Pounds 25m. The public offer opened yesterday, and closes on March 25. Ordinary shares will be issued at 100p, with no warrants.

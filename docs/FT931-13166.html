			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: Tough choice Perhaps Sir John Harvey-Jones, ex-boss of ICI and troubleshooter extraordinaire, will allow the TV cameras to chronicle his next big decision  -helping choose the next editor of The Economist weekly newspaper, which he chairs. It would give an interesting insight into his ability to pick winners. Admittedly, Observer may be a little biased since The Economist is half-owned by the Financial Times. But it has been a fertile breeding ground for future highflyers. Not being tied by Fleet Street's restrictive practices, successive editors have had the pick of the bright young things coming out of university. Sunday Times editor, Andrew Neil, ex-Times editor Simon Jenkins and Sarah Hogg, head of the prime minister's policy unit, all made their mark at the magazine before moving on and up. Meanwhile, Rupert Pennant-Rea is not the first editor to be rewarded with a big job. His predecessor, Andrew Knight, went on to head the Daily Telegraph before being poached by Rupert Murdoch to be his right-hand man. Knight's predecessor, Sir Alastair Burnet, left to edit the Daily Express. Although The Economist has railed at the continuing influence of Britain's ruling class, the choice of the next editor will be made by the very same. The four trustees, including NatWest chairman Lord Alexander and former CBI president Sir Campbell Fraser, can veto the decision. However, it would be unusual if they did. It's up to Sir John and fellow directors such as Cadbury Schweppes' boss, Dominic Cadbury, and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild to find an editorial genius with untapped management skills. Past form suggests that a thirtysomething stands the best chance. Walter Bagehot was only 34 when he was made editor and Geoffrey Crowther had just turned 31. But given its current success - circulation has topped 500,000 - it would be surprising if the directors chose an editor not steeped in the magazine's culture.</p>

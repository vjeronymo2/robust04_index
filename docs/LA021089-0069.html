			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMAICA VOTE PUTS SOCIALIST BACK IN POWER  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Michael Manley, a one-time radical socialist who led  Jamaica to near-collapse in the 1970s, swept back into power Thursday with a  landslide victory in an election marred by sporadic violence and charges of  fraud and voter intimidation.  </P> <P> With almost two-thirds of the vote counted, Manley's People's National Party  led the Jamaica Labor Party of Prime Minister Edward Seaga in 43 of the  nation's 60 parliamentary voting districts.  </P> <P> Seaga, the Reagan Administration's closest ally in the Caribbean, had bitterly  complained even before the polls closed that the election was "the most  fraudulent" that he has seen in 30 years of public life. He charged widespread  vote stealing and intimidation directed against followers of his party.  </P> <P> Manley, a one-time ally of Cuba's Fidel Castro who now says he is a political  moderate, also complained of voting irregularities directed against his party.  Manley rejected Seaga's charges as "a pathetic excuse for the anticipated  defeat of the JLP."  </P> <P> But in a brief speech conceding defeat less than six hours after the polls  closed, Seaga indicated that he will not contest the results. "We shall take  our defeat with a smile," he said.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Manley asked an exultant crowd at his own headquarters "to  take this victory with dignity and with humility."  </P> <P> "I want you to remember the election is over. You must not provoke people. You  must not crow over people," he said, adding that "when an election is over, we  who win have a special responsibility to respect those who lose."  </P> <P> Manley said he will seek to meet Seaga soon and urged members of both parties  to work together.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Fatal Victim  </P> <P> A 25-year-old pregnant woman was shot to death in one of a number of election  shooting incidents in and near the capital city that left at least four other  people wounded. But the violence appeared to have been confined to relatively  few urban districts, with the voting proceeding peacefully through most of the  countryside and along the rich north coast where the luxury tourist resorts are  concentrated.  </P> <P> Foreign journalists and other observers who toured polling places in Kingston  and nearby St. Catherine parish, or county, reported isolated clashes between  supporters of the rival parties and some instances of ballot box theft and  other irregularities. But most of the voting took place in a peaceful  atmosphere, which made it appear unlikely that the overall results could be  challenged successfully.  </P> <P> Radio-dispatched security troops of Jamaica's 3,000-man army and 7,000-man  police force rushed to trouble spots throughout the day, occasionally firing in  the air to separate rock-throwing and jeering rivals who crowded near polls in  the poorer areas of Kingston. Eight military helicopters made frequent sweeps  over the most heavily populated areas.  </P> <P> "We thought it would be chaos at first, but we got everything under control  early. Voting at most of the polling places has gone smoothly," said a senior  officer at the St. Catherine parish police headquarters at Spanish Town, west  of Kingston.  </P> <P> Both Seaga and Manley circulated throughout the day among polling places in the  city, at risk of becoming the focus of turbulence as they sought to quell the  anxieties of voters and poll officials.  </P> <P> At one Kingston poll, Manley and a group of about 30 People's National Party  followers were virtually besieged in a voting office by twice that number of  Labor Party supporters, but security forces arrived before trouble erupted.  </P> <P> Seaga tensely thrust a Cable News Network cameraman aside at another polling  station, knocking him into an angry crowd of Labor Party voters who seized the  video-cassette from his camera. The prime minister later issued a public  apology and invited the CNN crew to rejoin his entourage.  </P> <P> Manley, the apparent winner, was prime minister from 1972 to 1980 when he lost  a landslide election to Seaga after a prolonged election campaign that left  more than 700 dead. Then a radical socialist, Manley forged close ties to  Castro, inviting hundreds of Cuban advisers to Jamaica. His economic  experiments, which included nationalization of some industries, state-run farms  and rejection of the International Monetary Fund, alienated local businessmen  and the international financial community.  </P> <P> His support of Third World causes and close ties to Castro led to increasingly  sour relations with the United States, which virtually cut off aid to Jamaica  when the socialist prime minister endorsed the dispatch of Cuban troops to  Angola.  </P> <P> In recent years, however, a self-described "more laid-back Manley" has claimed  that he has learned from his mistakes and no longer will pursue his radical  causes of the past. In a measured and deliberate campaign, he has mended fences  with Washington and the banking community and pledged no more nationalization  of industry as well as support for private enterprise in the future.  </P> <P> Although he said he will establish "moderate" diplomatic relations with  Communist Cuba, forging solid relations with the Bush Administration in  Washington will be his first priority.  </P> <P> Seaga has been Washington's closest friend in the Caribbean since he became the  first foreign leader to visit President Ronald Reagan after his inauguration in  1981. He boasted of playing a leading role in the formation of Reagan's  Caribbean Basin Initiative which has been responsible, in part, for Jamaica's  return to economic solvency following near-collapse under Manley.  </P> <P> In 1983, riding a wave of popularity for his support of the U.S. invasion of  leftist-ruled Grenada, Seaga called a snap election that Manley's party  boycotted, giving Seaga's Labor Party a clean sweep of the 60-seat Parliament.  </P> <P> Thursday's election was the first to be contested in Jamaica since the bloody  1980 Seaga landslide.  </P></p>

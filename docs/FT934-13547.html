			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Technology: Japan keeps its shirts in shape A shirt with a memory is the latest technological breakthrough to ease the lives of Japan's hard-pressed salarymen. Introduced earlier this year by two medium-sized textile groups, Tomiya Apparel and Choya Corporation, memory shirts are designed to hold their original pristine shape after washing, so doing away with the daily ironing. While the rest of the clothing industry is in a downturn, memory shirts are beating their sales targets in Tokyo department stores, the traditional testing ground for generations of new technology products. They are thought to be popular among salarymen who are forced to spend the night in a city-centre hotel after long evenings at the office or drinking beer with colleagues - both events which tend to create crumpled shirts. The trick is a chemical which memorises structures and pulls back to its original shape at room temperature. This means the memory shirts also shrink less than their ordinary counterparts. The chemical can either be baked onto the fabric - the Choya method uses a technique developed by Nisshinbo Industries, a Japanese textiles group - or sprayed on in gas suspension, the method used by Tomiya, based on a technology developed by American Textile Processing. So far the memory shirts have gone down well, despite the fact that they cost around 20 per cent more than normal, forgetful shirts. Tomiya reports that it had to boost its output by 30 per cent last month to cope with demand. Isetan, a leading Tokyo department store, has set aside a quarter of its shirt sales space for memory shirts, which it sells for Y6,900 (Pounds 43) in white - as favoured by most Tokyo office workers - or Y7,900 in patterned designs. They can be purchased more cheaply at supermarkets such as Ito-Yokado, which was so impressed with its initial trials - at between Y3,900 and Y4,900 - that it plans to stock them throughout its chain by mid-November.</p>

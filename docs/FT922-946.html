			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: ML Pounds 2.24m in the red EXCEPTIONAL losses of Pounds 3.26m at ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronics distribution company, pushed the company into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.24m for the year ending March 31 1992 compared with a profit of Pounds 6.29m the previous year. ML, which parted company with its chief executive on Tuesday, said it was planning to make disposals to reduce its 114 per cent year-end gearing. Mr Timothy Sallitt, the chairman and acting chief executive, said that the results were 'unsatisfactory'. Cutting debt remained a high priority. That would be achieved by cuts in working capital and 'disposals of under-utilised assets and businesses not central to the company.' The exceptional losses were the result of staff cuts of 20 per cent over 15 months. An extraordinary Pounds 762,000 loss was a consequence of disposals. The reduction in the company's size was reflected in the turnover for the year of Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 92.4m). The loss per share was 5.1p (8.3p earnings) and the final dividend is cut to 1p (2.6p) for a 1.85p (3.45p) total. Mr Sallitt said the disposals would not be in the company's defence businesses of weapon launching and decoy systems, which were performing strongly. The company said it would return to profit this year with analysts estimating more than Pounds 2.5m pre-tax.</p>

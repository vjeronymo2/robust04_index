			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni forces  killed 16 civilians, including four children, and wounded 45 in  heavy shelling of the southern port city of Aden Sunday [26  June], hospital workers said here.    The four children died when Katyusha rockets slammed into  the  al-Tawahi district near the port. Twenty civilians were wounded  in the same attack, workers at the Basuhayb military hospital  said.    One of the rockets damaged a house and another exploded near  a school sheltering displaced people.    Earlier workers at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said 12 dead  civilians and 25 wounded had been admitted during the  bombardment Sunday.    Fierce fighting resumed at dawn, shattering a ceasefire  announced by the Sanaa authorities, and northern troops advanced  into the western suburbs, seizing the Hiswah power station and  Radio Aden buildings on the coast road.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Sandino Fernandez, deputy </F> chief of the Playa Giron Fighter Brigade, by Eduardo Gonzalez at  Playa Giron on 14 June; interview opens with one Major Chamizo  answering a telephone call and the "Alert Position One" order,  followed by an air raid siren; from the "First Thing" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Gonzalez] We are with the Playa Giron Fighter  Brigade, celebrating the Western Army's 33d anniversary. The  pilot has two minutes to take off for this air patrol exercise.  We will talk with Lieutenant Colonel Sandino Fernandez, deputy  chief of the base, in the meantime.    This type of unit consumes a lot of fuel, lubricants, and  electricity. How do you manage to maintain a high degree of  combat training and readiness with only one-third of the energy  resources?    [Fernandez] First, many of the problems that we used to  solve  through consuming energy are now solved through our comrades'  ingenuity and intelligence. We have developed flight simulators  that cost pennies to operate to maintain training levels  comparable to years ago.    [Gonzalez] I want to tell our listeners that the MiG-29  motor  is already running and that Major Chamizo is aboard.    [Fernandez] The simulators save having to conduct flights,  which cost between $6,000 and $7,000. They make it possible to  train the pilots -- although without the psychological impact of  a real flight -- on the ground for pennies. It costs about one  or two cents in terms of electricity, even with the new electric  fees.    [Gonzalez] The air patrol is taking off. It has been one  minute and 50 seconds since the alert call came in. Of course,  our pilots conduct real flight exercises to maintain their  proficiency. Several related tasks are conducted in every  exercise to conserve resources.    [Fernandez] We have developed devices, modeled on the  bicycle  gear, that allow us to forego the use of trucks, trucks used to  charge batteries, and trucks used to cool the air on the  airplanes. We have mounted air tanks and air conditioning  equipment on bicycles and tricycles. This allows us to prepare  the equipment without using fuel. We have also managed to  reduce electric consumption to a minimum. We use electricity  only in those instances when it is necessary.</p>

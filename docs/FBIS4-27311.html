			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Wednesday [1 June] reopened the "framework" trade talks after  a three-and-a-half-month deadlock over a U.S. demand for  "objective criteria" to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets.    Last Tuesday, the two countries announced that they would  resume the talks in three priority areas -- Japanese Government  procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications, auto  and auto parts and insurance.    The talks bogged down at the February summit meeting between  then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Washington.    According to the announcement after exploratory talks in  Washington, Japan and the U.S. agreed not to use "objective  criteria" as "numerical targets" in accessing the openness of  the Japanese markets to foreign goods and services.    Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy chief of the Finance Ministry's  International Finance Bureau, heads the Japanese side, and  assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Japan and China Ira Wolf  leads the U.S. delegation at the two-day talks on insurance.    Among focal points at the talks is the pace of the  liberalization of Japan's insurance business in the "third  field," which deals with accident, nursing care and disease  insurance.    The U.S. has called on Japan to "slow down" the pace of  liberalization because of foreign insurers dominance in that  business area.    The two countries will also resume talks on auto and auto  parts on Thursday in Washington and government procurement on  Friday in Tokyo.</p>

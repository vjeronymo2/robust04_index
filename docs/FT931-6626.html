			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / France bucks trend as foreign investment rises FOREIGN DIRECT investment in France grew strongly in the first six months of last year, making France the exception among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which generally experienced a slowdown in direct investment inflows. According to an OECD survey of financial market trends, strong inflows meant that foreign direct investment exceeded French investment abroad for the first time. The OECD suggested the growth reflected a more favourable attitude to foreign investment in France because of the employment opportunities it generated, and the realisation by foreign investors that France was at the heart of the single market. Figures for the first six months of last year confirm the generally downward trend in FDI, with the OECD reporting that Japanese direct investment abroad fell by about 16 per cent from the same period in 1991. In the first six months of last year total direct investment inflows in OECD countries was Dollars 32.4bn (Pounds 22.8bn), compared with Dollars 36.6bn in the first six months of 1991. Outflows fell from Dollars 73.6bn in the first half of 1991 to Dollars 67.9bn in the same period last year. Among the biggest investors, only outflows from the US registered 'remarkable' growth in the first half of last year. Chemicals were the main target of European and US direct investment in the manufacturing sector abroad. The report found that in 1991, US investment in foreign chemical industries was Dollars 40bn, representing 10 per cent of total US companies' assets abroad. By contrast only a few Japanese chemical groups operate globally. In Europe, chemicals constituted the bulk of German, British, French and Dutch investment abroad. A new impetus came from privatisation in east European countries where European groups took over big producers in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The EC received more than half US outward investment in electronics in 1991, with new US affiliates set up mainly in Germany and the UK. The report says that over the past three years, Japanese investment in car manufacturing came to a standstill in the US as demand for cars weakened in North America and Europe. At the same time, Japanese investment in the European car industry - mainly Spain and the UK - doubled.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is deeply concerned over the withdrawal of  North Korea from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "Our principal position is well known and remains the same.  Russia stands for a stronger non-proliferation regime and for  transparent nuclear programs so that there be no fear of  possible attempts to create nuclear weapons," Russian Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing in Moscow  today.    He said it was especially important that a state  participating in the non-proliferation treaty and in an  agreement with the IAEA fulfill its obligations. "If this was  not done or is not done, the world community has the right to an  adequate response," Demurin said.</p>

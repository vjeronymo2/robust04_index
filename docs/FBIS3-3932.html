			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Excessively Rapid Growth by </F> Foreign-Funded Enterprises Will Adversely Affect Foreign  Exchange Market"]    [Text] An internal State Council analysis report has  pointed out that the excessively rapid growth of investment by  foreign businessmen in China will adversely affect China's  surging foreign debt and will weaken the foreign exchange market  and the balance between international income and expenditure.  Adequate attention must be paid to this issue.    Figures show that in 1993, the total value of imports and  exports by foreign-funded enterprises in China was $67.07  billion, a 53.3- percent increase over 1992. Of the total  import and export value, all of the economic sectors in China  (referring to state-owned, collective, joint-venture, solely  foreign-owned, and individual economies) they account for 34.3  percent, while exports by foreign- funded industries increased  by almost 8 percentage points over 1992. According to estimates,  in 1994, the volume of exports by foreign- funded enterprises  will account for 40 percent of the total volume of exports in  the country.    According to relevant experts, what is noteworthy is that,  China's estimated foreign debt in 1993 was $80 billion, $10.7  billion more than in 1992. The debt repayment rate is about 16  percent, and this means it has come closer to the foreign debt  warning line generally used by the international community.  After the unification of China's exchange rate, when  foreign-funded enterprises use foreign exchange to pay principle  and interest or remit profits, a new, strong external force will  emerge and affect the foreign exchange market.    Another thing which worries the relevant departments in  China  is that the net increase in value of exports by foreign-funded  enterprises has already surpassed the net increase in the value  of exports by other economic sectors in China (mainly  state-owned and collective enterprises). In 1993, the total  export value of foreign-funded enterprises was $25.24 billion, a  45.4 percent increase over 1992, and the net increase in value  was $7.87 billion, which is 27.5 percent of the country's total  export value and an increase of 7 percentage points over 1992.  The total value of exports by other economic sectors in China  decreased in 1993, whereas for imports, the total value of  imports by foreign-funded enterprises also climbed to an  important position: accounting for 32.8 percent of the  country's total import value in 1992 to 40.2 percent of the  country's total import value in 1993, and the net value of  imports increased 66.1 percent over 1992, whereas the net value  of imports by other economic sectors in China increased by only  1.7 percentage points. In order words, growth in imports and  exports in China in 1993 was basically determined and realized  by foreign-funded enterprises. In addition, data and figures  also show that in 1993, China's unfavorable foreign trade  balance also came mainly from unfavorable trade balances among  foreign-funded enterprises.    In 1993, the unfavorable balance between imports and exports  in China was $12.18 billion. This was due to the fact that  although other economic sectors in China had a favorable balance  between imports and exports of about $4 billion, the unfavorable  balance between imports and exports from foreign-funded  enterprises was $16.59 billion. The unfavorable balance in  foreign-funded enterprises was mainly manifested in the use of  equipment and materials for their investments in China, with the  amount reaching $16.63 billion.    According to a relevant informed source, the rapid increase  in the proportion of foreign trade carried out by foreign-funded  enterprises in China has caused a decrease in the share of  foreign trade held by China's state-owned and collective  enterprises, and relevant departments in Beijing worry that this  will constitute a threat to China's balance of international  income and expenditure to the extent of affecting the country's  long-term and stable economic development.</p>

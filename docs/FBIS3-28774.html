			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Deputy Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata arrived in Washington  on Wednesday [9 February] night to try to break a deadlock in  the stalled framework trade talks between Japan and the United  States.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor earlier in the day  announced the suspension of working-level negotiations until  Hata's arrival in the hope that a Japanese political decision  could lead to a breakthrough.    The talks, which had resumed in Washington early this week,  stalled due to a squabble over how to measure Japan's efforts to  open its auto and other markets.    Hata is to join Friday's summit meeting between Prime  minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.</p>

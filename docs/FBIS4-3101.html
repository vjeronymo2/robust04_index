			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Pei Jianeng: "Output of Steel Rises by </F> 7.6 Percent in 1st Quarter"]    [Text] Steel output reached 22.95 million tons in the  first quarter of this year, 7.66 percent more than the same  period last year, it was revealed yesterday.    China produced 20.29 million tons of rolled steel and 22.14  million tons of iron from January to March, increases of 9.47  percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, according to figures  from the Metallurgical Industry Ministry.    However, the output of iron ore, reported at 48.7 million  tons, fell below the ministry's production target, officials  said.    But the general increase in output was accompanied by a rise  in product quality, the officials added.    The ratio of advanced continuous casting--a symbol of  technical capacity in steel making--also rose, from last year's  32.82 percent of steel output to 38.62 percent, in the first  quarter of this year.    Manufacturers' profits and taxes also increased markedly  during the first quarter, going up 16.7 percent over last year.    China produced 88.3 million tons of steel last year making  it  the world's second biggest producer, behind only Japan.    This year the target is 93 million tons and officials are  optimistic about the chances of hitting the target.    In the first two months of the year, China imported 2.3  million tons of rolled steel, 8.1 percent more than the same  period last year.    Meanwhile, it exported 150,000 tons of rolled steel, an  increase of 57 percent.    Although the government lifted the price ceilings of steel  products at the beginning of this year, market prices have  remained stable as supply and demand are roughly balanced,  officials said.    It is expected that China's total demand for rolled steel  will hit 100 million tons this year.    About 90 million tons will be supplied by domestic  production  and stockpiles.    Officials said China still needs to import about 1O million  tons of rolled steel this year.    Last year it imported a record 30.26 million tons of rolled  steel because of overheated investment in fixed assets.    Officials said a shortage of capital is still the biggest  headache for domestic steel makers.    And the new tax burdens imposed on iron mines may cause most  of them to lose money this year, officials said, adding that the  transport bottleneck will also affect steel production,    One of China's major steel makers, the Beijing-based  Shougang  Group, produced 1.85 million tons of steel and 1.47 million tons  of iron in the first quarter, respective increases of 29 and  33.78 percent.</p>

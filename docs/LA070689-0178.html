			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOOK TELLS OF SCRAWLED CUE CARDS;  </P> <P> AIDE PROMPTED BUSH IN RATHER INTERVIEW  </P> <P> George Bush's quick comebacks during his explosive interview with Dan Rather  last year were not entirely off the cuff, a new book says.  </P> <P> Several of the presidential candidate's responses came from cue cards scrawled  by media consultant Roger Ailes, CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer and Gary Paul  Gates say.  </P> <P> Excerpts from their book, "The Acting President: Ronald Reagan and the  Supporting Players Who Helped Him Create the Illusion That Held America  Spellbound," appear in the July 8 issue of TV Guide.  </P> <P> During the live, January, 1988, interview, then-Vice President Bush told  Rather, who had been questioning him on his role in the Iran-Contra affair:  "It's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like  it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set  in New York?"  </P> <P> Bush referred to Rather's walk-off from the CBS set in 1987 when a tennis match  ran into news time. It caused the network to "go black" for six minutes.  </P> <P> "What people in the bureau and viewers at home could not see was that the  response had not been entirely spontaneous. As the interview progressed, the  crafty Ailes had stationed himself beside the camera," Schieffer and Gates  wrote.  </P> <P> "If Bush seemed to be struggling for a response, Ailes would write out a key  word in huge letters on his yellow legal pad and hold it just beneath the  camera in Bush's line of vision.  </P> <P> "Just before Bush had shouted that it was not fair to judge his career on Iran,  Ailes had written out on his legal pad the words not fair to judge career ...  Yours. Three times during the interview, Bush's answer had come after Ailes had  prompted him with key words or phrases scribbled on the legal pad."  </P> <P> Schieffer and Gates said that before the interview Bush had been stirred up by  aides who wanted to end the candidate's image as a "wimp."  </P></p>

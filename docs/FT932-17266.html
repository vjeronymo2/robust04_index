			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank beats forecasts A GOOD fourth quarter last year helped Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, improve its total operating profits for 1992 by 7 per cent to DM6.39bn (Dollars 3.94bn). The rate of increase in total operating profits - which include the profits made from own-account securities trading - was lower than at other German banks which have reported in the past two weeks, but better than analysts' expectations. Analysts had expected that profits would be flat or worse following a 5 per cent drop at the 10-month stage, revealed in December last year. But Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chief executive, said Deutsche had enjoyed a better fourth quarter following difficult conditions in the previous six months. He said that conditions continued to be good in the early part of 1993 and the parent company bank had experienced 'double-digit' growth in profits in the first two months of the current year. Although Deutsche said it increased its bad debt provisions by a significant, but undisclosed, amount last year, the figures show the German banking sector's continuing immunity to the increasingly severe economic downturn in Germany. Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest bank, increased operating profits by 20 per cent last year, and Dresdner Bank, the second-biggest bank which reports today, increased operating profits by 17 per cent in the first 10 months of last year. Shares in both these banks have outperformed both the German stock market and those of Deutsche since the beginning of the year. Deutsche's growth in net income was 29.7 per cent to DM1.83bn reflecting special factors such as the the release of provisions on sovereign debt affecting eight countries. The operating results reflected strong securities business - profits in this area were DM1.12bn, broadly the same as in 1991 - as well as lending and fee income. Total assets increased by 10.6 per cent to DM496.6bn while net interest income rose 5.1 per cent to DM11.16bn and net commission income increased by 11.2 per cent to DM4.2bn. Total operating expenses rose by 7.7 per cent to DM10.41bn, half the rate of increase in 1991. The net interest margin fell 11 basis points to 2.3 per cent. Mr Kopper said Deutsche was, in principle, keen to seek a listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, following Daimler-Benz's agreement with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission earlier this week which will lead to a listing later this year. Mr Kopper said the bank would study the details of the agreement between the SEC and Daimler, Germany's largest industrial company in which Deutsche has a 28 per cent stake. One possible objection to a listing would be a requirement to consolidate this stake, he said. The 1992 dividend is to be DM15 a share, the same as for 1991.</p>

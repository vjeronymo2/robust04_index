Stating the stand of the Cameroonian Government on the  Bakassi Peninsula for the first time in public, Mr. Kouomegni  asserted that "we are within our rights and our option is still  finding a peaceful solution to the problem."    "This solution can only be found through the strict respect  for each country's territorial integrity -- that of Cameroon and  of Nigeria. It is for this reason that Cameroon has informed  international institutions and does not rule out any initiative,  be it bilateral or multilateral," added Mr. Kouomegni who was  speaking at a news conference.    "However, if war is imposed on us, we must go to war and we  will count on the bravery of our soldiers who have so far given  an excellent demonstration of their bravery and we will count on  our allies, including France, whose readiness to help us has  remained intact," the minister continued, adding: "We recognize,  and this is very clear, that this option would be harmful for  our two states. We do not wish for it."</p>

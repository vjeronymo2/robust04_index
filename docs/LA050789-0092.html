			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: THE KENTUCKY DERBY;  </P> <P> CHALK UP A VICTORY FOR OUTCASTS  </P> <P> A horse they thought so little of they did everything but leave him on a park  bench with a note on him won the Kentucky Derby Saturday and may be the  greatest thing to come down a homestretch in this decade and maybe in several.  </P> <P> If he was a cat they might have drowned him at birth. He was knock-kneed, he  wobbled when he walked like a teen-ager in high-heels. He was so ugly he was  almost 2 years old before they were sure he wasn't going to be a camel.  </P> <P> Twice, they tried to auction him off. But the horse-buying public was too smart  for that.  </P> <P> Nobody wanted Sunday Silence till Charlie Whittingham got a look at him.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham has been around race horses since the days of Dan Patch. He  knows they don't have to look like something out of a Roy Rogers movie. You  judge a horse with a clock, not a mirror. Man o' War might have had a lousy  profile.  </P> <P> Charlie liked Sunday Silence so much, he bought half of him. The horse the  tuxedoed auctioneers could not get a nibble on looked to Charlie like a bigger  bargain than a hot diamond.  </P> <P> The horse who won $574,200 Saturday and $980,000 in his life wouldn't bring  $17,000 at a dispersal sale two years ago. When Arthur Hancock III declined  that sale price, his partners backed out. "You take him, then," was their  attitude.  </P> <P> Whittingham, on the other hand, reacted as if a rich uncle had just left him an  oil field. He couldn't believe a horse this good would be available at any  price. The horse was not only good, he was as well-behaved as a Boy Scout and  as trainable as a circus seal. Talent often comes coupled with moodiness,  truculence, temperament. Talent often hates to be told what to do and how to do  it. Good Soldier Schweiks, they're not. Sunday Silence was like a kid who eats  his vegetables and cleans the blackboards. If he could talk, he would say "Yes,  sir!"  </P> <P> That's all Charlie Whittingham needs -- a fast horse who will do what he tells  him.  </P> <P> So, the horse nobody wanted is the toast of Kentucky today. He won the coldest  -- and the slowest in 30 years -- Kentucky Derby on a gelid May Saturday when  sleet swept down the backstretch and a cold wind whipped in the horses' faces  on the turn for home.  </P> <P> Was the winner much the best? Well, look at it this way: How many Kentucky  Derbies do you see with the winner running sideways in the stretch?  </P> <P> The race was run in the slow-freight time of 2:05. Horses move faster than that  pulling surreys. That was the slowest Derby since 1958. There's no telling what  Sunday Silence might have run if he hadn't come down the stretch like a guy  carrying a football -- or being thrown out of a waterfront bar. Saddle broncs  in a rodeo do less jumping around. Patrick Valenzuela must have thought he was  trying to stay on a Brahma bull.  </P> <P> The least surprised guy in Kentucky was Charlie Whittingham. Whittingham has  been telling everybody who would listen for months that his horse was something  special. It was such a startling change of posture for Charlie that the public  chunked in $592,058 on his horse to win.  </P> <P> It has always considered an act of faith back here in the bluegrass country  that horses who come over the mountain from the Pacific are, by definition,  "nice little California sprinters." They're not supposed to like it when  anything draws alongside them.  </P> <P> The horse who was supposed to expose them at Churchill this year was a speed  demon infelicitously named Easy Goer. Tracksiders couldn't make up their minds  whether he was another Man o' War -- or merely another Secretariat. Wonder  Horse III. He didn't even need to be whipped. He had won the Wood Memorial  under a hand ride like a horse on a bridal path being ridden by a debutante. He  had come within a click of a world mile record with nothing chasing him. No one  had ever shopped him around or put an ad in the paper or offered to throw in  the saddle if someone would bid on him.  </P> <P> Charlie Whittingham was unimpressed. "Maybe he's a wonder horse," observed  Charlie. "He better be."  </P> <P> He wasn't. It was a case of easy come, Easy Goer. He did finish second. It was  the second time he had lost at Churchill in six months. Maybe he didn't care  for the track. It was hard to. It was greasier than a truck stop hamburger. The  field often looked like Charlie Chaplin trying to cross a waxed dance floor.  </P> <P> It was vindication of two sorts for his principal owner, Arthur Hancock III. He  not only refused to sell Sunday Silence short -- twice -- but he had the laugh  on those who said he was not serious enough to run the family heirloom,  Claiborne Farms. When Arthur Three got out of college, he passed up mucking the  family stalls in favor of playing a guitar in honky-tonks and writing songs  about guys whose wives left them for truck drivers and took the kids with them.  He even named Sunday Silence from a Kris Kristofferson lament titled, "Sunday  Morning, Coming Down."  </P> <P> The family wasn't sure they wanted a guy who would rather be Willie Nelson than  a stud farmer, rather have a hit record than a Derby horse. Arthur took his  guitar and left home.  </P> <P> Claiborne Farms had 34 horses in 28 Derbies, winning two of them. Arthur Three  has been in four Derbies and won two.  </P> <P> The horse nobody wanted and the owner the family didn't want either hauled down  the biggest prize in racing Saturday. If he -- they -- win the Triple Crown,  they may set a new trend in the sport of kings. Get owners out of rock concerts  and horses out of the Yellow Pages.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nomura Securities to close three offices in Europe NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest securities brokerage, yesterday announced the closure of three of its European offices to reduce costs, amid the slump in the domestic stock market and the fall in underwriting business in Europe. In the latest move to reorganise its operations overseas, Nomura will close its Munich and Basle branches at the end of this month, and its Stockholm representative office on December 11. The closures follow last month's cut of 50 staff in London. The operations of the Stockholm office will be taken on in London. The four local employees are to be made redundant. Staff at Nomura's Munich and Basle offices have been offered jobs at its Frankfurt and Zurich subsidiar-ies. Last month, Yamaichi Securities closed its branch in Melbourne. Japanese brokerages have been forced to concentrate on strengthening domestic operations at a time when the Tokyo stock market has failed to recover. While the Nikkei stock average rose from a six-year low of 14,309 in mid-August, after the Japanese government's announcement of an emergency economic package, the index has since lost half of these gains on worries over corporate earnings and the country's political turmoil. Japanese brokerages crowded into the European markets during the height of the Tokyo stock market in the 1980s, when Japanese companies rushed to raise equity-linked funds. However, the slump in the home market has depressed overseas equity-linked financing. Nomura said that since current overseas operations were built to satisfy clients' needs at the peak of the Tokyo stock market, the stream-lining of operations was inevitable.</p>

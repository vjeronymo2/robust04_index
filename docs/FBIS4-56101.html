			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of rightwing forces in Slovakia held  their third meeting last night, following the parliament  session. Their one-hour discussion focused on the possibility of  forming a strong rightwing election bloc. According to Jan  Carnogursky, the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is  skeptical in that respect. That is what he briefly told me about  the bloc, which is also represented by the National Democratic  Party, the Democratic Union, the Democratic Party, and the Party  of Businessmen and Tradesmen.    [Begin recording] [Carnogursky] If all of us wanted to form  one election bloc, then according to the Elections Law, it would  mean that we would have to win at least 10 percent of the vote  in order to actually make it into the parliament. For that  reason, we have simply continued pursuing our idea of getting  rightwing deputies to the Slovak parliament. That trend will  continue until 10 June. Thereafter, the party ticket will be  complete because extending the process of forming election blocs  and negotiating after 10 June would be wasteful.    [Reporter] Mr. Cernak [National Democratic Party chairman]  said he will not form any election coalition without you, the  KDH. What is the situation with regard to the Democratic Union,  the party headed by a chairman who enjoys the greatest  popularity of around 20 percent? What is the Democratic Union's  reaction?    [Carnogursky] The Democratic Union intends to go into the  elections alone and it is not contemplating a coalition with any  other party. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Election likely as Bhutto calls off protest PAKISTAN'S opposition parties last night called off a planned 'long march' today against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, giving rise to speculation that an early election will be called. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, had planned to lead tens of thousands of supporters on the march to Islamabad to try to force Mr Sharif to call the poll. The plan for the demonstration had set the two sides on a collision course and paramilitary police were on standby in the capital. The decision to call off the march was apparently made as part of an army-backed package, senior aides to Ms Bhutto said. It came after she flew to Islamabad from Lahore yesterday to meet General Abdul Waheed Kakar, Pakistan's chief of army staff. Ms Bhutto said she had 'postponed' the march at the army's request in the national interest. Pakistan's political crisis was triggered in April when Mr Sharif's government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. With the government then returned by order of a court, there has been intensifying political confrontation. The opposition parties were widely believed to have gathered around Mr Khan in his tussle with Mr Sharif. In the past few days, Gen Kakar is understood to have been involved in hectic efforts to negotiate a settlement. Although no details of the formula were available last night, a government minister conceded that an early election was part of the deal. However, Mr Khan's future was not clear. Mr Sharif has insisted repeatedly Mr Khan must quit before an election to ensure the poll is not rigged. Last night's developments appeared to have created a new opportunity for politicians to prevent a total collapse of negotiations, which could have given way to street violence involving opposite groups.</p>

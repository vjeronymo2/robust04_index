			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> IRVINE PLAN TO REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE LOW-INCOME UNITS STALLS  </P> <P> The Irvine City Council postponed action early today until Aug. 22 on a  controversial plan that would require developers to price 10% of future housing  for very low-income families.  </P> <P> The council asked for additional information from the city staff regarding the  establishment of a nonprofit corporation to develop low-cost housing as well as  studying a top figure on a fee that might be imposed on businesses to finance  housing for employees.  </P> <P> The plan before the council would require 10% of future housing to be priced  for families earning less than $24,000, or half of the county median income.  </P> <P> The largest opponent is the Irvine Co., which contended Tuesday night that such  quotas have not been successful in producing significant amounts of low-cost  housing in other cities.  </P> <P> Company officials asked the city to establish a blue-ribbon committee that  would find new ways to generate funds and entice nonprofit developers.  </P> <P> If the city does not provide any incentives to private developers in the form  of bond financing, the Irvine Co. suggested changing the plan to require 3% of  housing for very low-income families and 7% for the next higher category,  families earning up to 80% of the median.  </P> <P> Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson called those figures "a shame" and said the  city and company must work together to improve them.  </P> <P> Several City Council members said the 10% figure is not unreasonable, pointing  out that one recent development project priced 20% of its units for low-income  residents.  </P></p>

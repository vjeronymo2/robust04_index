			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (1): Time to set new goals - After the bubble years of the 1980s, manufacturers are facing a fourth year of falling profits, and financial institutions are sweeping up the debris from their excesses. Robert Thomson reports on the current debate about the future of corporate Japan THE LATEST course in Japanese corporate therapy is Goal Setting, represented in the phonetic script of katakana, which tells a Japanese reader that the term and, perhaps, the idea are foreign. The words also tell of a lack of direction among companies famed for an ability to set and beat ambitious long-term goals. Goals need resetting because Japanese manufacturing companies face a fourth year of falling profits, and realise that an eventual recovery will be less profitable than in the past, when the hard years of yen appreciation or recession were quickly replaced by another bout of rapid sales growth and apparently boundless expansion. Financial institutions are still sweeping away the debris from their excesses during the late 1980s, the so-called bubble years, which left banks with non-performing loans that will be a burden until the end of the decade. Larger brokers are also under pressure, but several mid-sized houses are in serious difficulty, as was shown when Cosmo Securities was bailed out last month by a leading bank, Daiwa Bank. The Cosmo case provides evidence that some old corporate walls are crumbling, though others remain sturdily in place, resisting recession, deregulation and financial market collapse. On the financial fringe, relationships are changing. Banks are varying interest rates for companies in the same corporate group, while larger companies are selling bank stocks, though not those of their closest institutions. Japan's cross-shareholding system is generally holding together. Companies needing to improve profitability, but weighed down by low-yielding stocks held for the sake of maintaining a traditional relationship, are nevertheless finding themselves obliged to sell stock. Institutional investors, too, are threatening to offload their holdings in companies which refuse to increase dividend payments. The threats come as debate gathers momentum over whether Japan is in the middle of a shift from employee sovereignty to shareholder sovereignty. Companies must be more aggressive in cutting costs, including personnel, to bolster profits, which will be distributed in ever larger amounts to investors more willing to take legal action to protect their rights, or so the theory goes. But the swaying of the economic and social structure has inspired fears among executives and bureaucrats that Japan's era has ended, that the country will be hollowed out by the flow of manufacturing investment to east Asia, and that a corporate culture supposedly an extension of the communal spirit of the rice fields is withering. Goal-setting does not seem a bad idea at a time of such grim visions. The term was coined by Mr Shigeru Watanabe, of the Nomura Research Institute, who wants companies to pay more attention to return on equity and less to the aggressive pursuit of market share: 'In the coming years, companies will have to look at return on equity if they are to be successful. They need to set new goals by looking at these numbers more closely.' The numbers are not looking good. Since 1984, return on equity of listed manufacturers has slipped from 9.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent in the year ending in March, and Mr Watanabe estimates that the rate will fall to about 2.5 per cent for the current financial year. The operating profit to sales ratio for manufacturers has fallen from 5.47 per cent at the end of 1984 to 2.88 per cent for last financial year. Mr John Baldwin, head of research at Jardine Fleming Securities, said executives are beginning to realise that they will have to make difficult decisions about job losses and corporate direction which they have not had to face in the post-second world war period. 'Executives in the 55 to 60 years old range really have had the best of Japan. Profits and salaries have always risen, but that has come to an end and it is quite a shock. They have to make some very difficult decisions,' Mr Baldwin said. 'Personnel expenses rose 5.8 per cent last year even though sales fell by 2.1 per cent. This does not represent a sustainable pattern'. The longer the downturn and the weaker the recovery, the more pressure Japanese companies will face to reform their character. The yen's appreciation this year has prompted manufacturers to look for cheaper sites in east Asia, where production quality has risen markedly over the past decade. If the yen remains strong, the Bank of Japan fears 'a massive substitution of overseas production for domestic production'. A sure sign that large companies are setting new goals will come if they begin to lay off workers, instead of just lowering the ceiling on the annual intake. Honda Motor is reducing its workforce by 3,000 over the next three years through natural attrition and a reduced intake of graduates. JVC, the consumer electronics company, is to reduce its workforce by 2,000 over the next year, and Matsushita Electric Industrial has transferred 2,000 employees to retail outlets. These cutbacks indicate that Japanese manufacturers are facing the most difficult decisions. Mr Baldwin said that at the end of July, there were 424,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing, compared with a year earlier, while during 1987, when the economy was suffering from an earlier bout of yen appreciation, 190,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. The unemployment rate is still a modest 2.5 per cent, because workers have been shifted sideways into sales subsidiaries or service company affiliates. The sideways shift is the traditional response to downturn. Staff stay on the payroll and the promise of lifetime employment is kept, but companies are unsure whether they can continue to keep their side of the bargain. Manufacturers say Japanese consumers have lost their appetite for durables, as sales of cars, colour televisions and videocassette recorders are all far below peaks reached during the giddy days of the late 1980s, when companies geared up for increased production by commissioning new plants. Manufacturers are still paying for that expansion in higher depreciation charges, but they and financial institutions based their investment calculations on capital costs reckoned to be close to zero. Money was easily raised on the stock market and return on investment was not the first priority of managers inspired by the bubble era antics of their contemporaries and competitors. Some Japanese companies thought they were addressing decline through diversification, the corporate therapy course of the mid and late 1980s. Nippon Steel ventured into computers and mushrooms, Komatsu the construction machinery producer, began distributing Norwegian pleasure cruisers, and Minebea, the bearings maker, drifted into cosmetics. A decade later, Nippon Steel is expecting a Y15bn pre-tax loss for the year to March, and admits that it will have to review loss-making diversifications. Komatsu last month announced a restructuring programme that will increase component imports. Minebea is out of cosmetics and early this year sold a semiconductor subsidiary, NMB Semiconductor, to Nippon Steel. If shareholder sovereignty is to be more than phrase favoured by commission-hungry brokers, executives will need to be more responsible for wayward investment decisions which have reduced profits and the returns to shareholders. Revisions to the Commercial Code in June eased filing requirements for shareholder litigants, though Japanese courts are generally wary of exercising their power to set clear precedents. Japanese executives are reluctant to alter a course that has brought them remarkable success. There is a lingering sense that profits and partnerships will return to normal, but there is also a recognition that stimulatory packages and a series of interest rate cuts have failed to budge the economy. When executives finally emerge from the still deepening trough, they are likely to find an unfamiliar landscape.  ----------------------------------- AVERAGE YIELD ON TOKYO STOCKS  ----------------------------------- Year                  %  ----------------------------------- 1984               1.11 1985               0.96 1086               0.75 1987               0.51 1988               0.47 1989               0.41 1990               0.54 1991               0.66 1992               0.89 1993*              0.73  ----------------------------------- * June  ----------------------------------- Source: Yamaichi Research Institute  -----------------------------------  ------------------------------------- RETURN ON EQUITY FOR LISTED JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS  ------------------------------------- Year                %  ------------------------------------- 1984              9.4 1985              8.5 1086              5.7 1987              6.5 1988              8.1 1989              8.3 1990              7.7 1991              5.6 1992              3.1 1993              2.5*  ------------------------------------- * Estimate  ------------------------------------- Source: Nomura Research Institute  -------------------------------------  ------------------------------------- AVERAGE PRICE TO EARNINGS RATIO OF TOKYO STOCKS  ------------------------------------- Year             Times  ------------------------------------- 1984             27.41 1985             31.92 1086             49.80 1987             70.04 1988             63.75 1989             65.98 1990             52.66 1991             45.28 1992             44.82 1993*            89.00  ------------------------------------- * September  ------------------------------------- Source: Yamaichi Research Institute  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECALL SOUGHT OF 2 ON SCHOOL BOARD  </P> <P> A small group of residents began a recall effort against two Inglewood school  board members Thursday, accusing them of not serving the community well at a  time of "major crisis" in the schools.  </P> <P> The recall targets are Larry Aubry, the school board president, and Thomasina  Reed, who was elected last June.  </P> <P> Both Aubry and Reed were accused of "faltering leadership, lack of direction,  poor comprehension of major issues (and) inadequate response to board members,  communiques and concerns."  </P> <P> The four residents who signed an intention-to-recall form were Emmanuel Gary  Jr., a parent who ran against Reed last year; Mildred McNair, a former school  board candidate whose son graduated from Inglewood schools; Charles Coronado,  an Inglewood businessman with a grandson attending Hudnall Elementary School,  and Tiburcio Maldonado, a parent who has criticized the district for its  handling of Latino children.  </P> <P> Charlotte Bell, a Los Angeles resident who has a son at Inglewood's Crozier  Junior High School, is another organizer of the recall effort. The form was  delivered Thursday to the county registrar-recorder's office.  </P> <P> Reed questioned whether the recall effort would succeed and said, "If they want  to come forward with some specific complaints, that's fine."  </P> <P> Aubry declined to comment because he had not been formally notified of the  recall.  </P> <P> The two board members have a week to file an answer to the accusations before  petitions can be circulated. To force an election, recall proponents would have  to gather signatures from about 30% of the registered voters in the school  district.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Omar Carreon Abud: "Will Democracy Come To Us </F> From the North?"]    [Text] Just like hundreds, perhaps thousands of times  before, last week, prominent members of the U.S. Congress  pressured our country to make Mexicans behave the way it suits  them. This time, it was Democratic Congressmen David Bonior's  and Robert Torricelli's turn. They submitted a draft resolution  to the Foreign Affairs Committee on our country's upcoming  elections. If approved, Bonior's and Torricelli's initiative  would be debated and voted upon by the full House.    In essence, the U.S. lawmakers are proposing an invitation  be  extended to have "total international observance" of the Mexican  elections and also "the establishment of autonomous electoral  authorities at the federal, state, and local level." Before  unveiling their proposal to journalists, Bonior and Torricelli  were not remiss in including their venerable opinions on Mexican  politics of the past years. All of this, according to the  concerned U.S. politicians, so there can be genuine democracy in  our country.    According to newspaper reports, a histrionic David Bonior  said: "It is our hope that in approximately 95 days, the world  will once again celebrate the triumph of democracy and raise its  glass to another democratically elected president in Mexico."    The Mexican Embassy in Washington was the first to reject  this clear meddling, which is unacceptable despite the fact that  is has been often repeated. Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo  McGregor was next to reject it. In that respect, many Mexicans  feel accurately represented.    Is it necessary to have others observe us on election day?  Who are these ethereal, almost immaterial individuals,  uncontaminated by base economic and political interests, who  could unquestionably decide if Mexicans elected their president,  senators, and deputies in a democratic manner or if they cheated  and have to play overtime, take penalties, or even repeat the  game. Such individuals do not exist, and the U.S. lawmakers  know this well.    If they insist, I am certain it is merely because they want  to continue meddling, deciding the future of Mexicans. If the  idea is not to impose a president because the old, deeply rooted  Mexican nationalism will not allow it, then it is at least to  obtain other concessions that may not be as decisive but which  are certainly vital to their interests. The message is clear:  If you do not agree, if you do not accept certain treaties and  agreements, if you do not accept certain conditions for  conducting business, I will accuse you and portray you as  undemocratic and dictatorial. It is an intimidation tactic.    It is a tactic they are already using against Cuba. Robert  Torricelli is sponsoring the latest tightening of the U.S.  blockade against that island. Under the pretext that there is  no democracy in that small country, Cubans are being starved to  death. One cannot buy anything from Cuba; one cannot sell  anything to it; and if a ship (no matter from what country) even  docks there, it is penalized by not being allowed to dock in  U.S. ports for six months. All of this because the interests  defended in the Capitol are not the same as those defended in  Cuba.    In fact -- and much has been said already -- democracy, the  election of authorities based on the sovereign will of the  people, is never and has never been anything but an excuse for  meddling. There are countries where there is no democracy,  where it is not even known, where the people live under  outrageous oppression, but those governments and systems are not  the object of the mildest censure on the part of the champions  of democracy to whom we refer today. On the contrary, these  lawmakers are their great allies and commercial partners. Close  to us, in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, the  military violently toppled the democratically elected president.  Now he must wander for years all over the United States begging  for support. He only receives evasive remarks and promises.    Father away we have an example that is similar or even more  eloquent. Saudi Arabia has been ruled for decades by a despotic  family that does not even know what "international observers"  are, much less "autonomous electoral observers." When the time  came, however, it proved itself to be one of Washington's most  unscrupulous and therefore staunchest and most reliable allies.  We will not even mention the terrible years of Pinochet,  Stroessner, and General Videla, among many others.    We Mexicans are read the riot act, but we flatly reject it.  Decisions concerning Mexico's economic and political life and  everything else fall solely within our purview, even more so now  that the solidarity of the poor with the poor is only an  illusion of the past. If our system of life has flaws, even if  it has aberrant features, it falls to Mexicans to correct it.  It is clear that models from abroad are not always viable and  that pressure from abroad is never acceptable. The best and  only way to have a fatherland that is more just, sovereign,  free, and democratic, which is what many of us want, is through  the unity and organization of the people who suffer abuses and  injustices and who are always living under oppression. Heeding  the north is not and will never be the way. They have their  interests, not friends. We have our children to leave them a  better, or a least a little better, world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the </F> Nahal 'Oz checkpoint in the Gaza Strip -- live; broadcast in  progress]    [Text] ...is linked to this place in the Gaza Strip.  Approximately 750,000 or almost 800,000 Palestinians live here  with 5,000 Israelis as opposed to the less than 20,000  Palestinians living in the Jericho area that will be under the  control of the Palestinian Authority. I would like to start by  extending my deepest appreciation to the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces], the chief of staff, the General Staff; especially to  the Southern Command and its commander, staff, division  commander; the operation coordinators and their commanders, for  the extraordinarily efficient and excellent manner in which the  difficult and unique mission of the orderly transfer of control  on the ground from the IDF and the other security forces to the  Palestinian police and forces -- including those issues  pertaining to civilian authorities -- was completed. I was  seriously concerned about the way, form, and order in which  these steps had to be carried out because although we are  familiar with the IDF and have confidence in it, we had no  experience with the other side. As I have learned, a fabric of  relations has emerged with regard to the important issues in  order to facilitate the evacuation of those parts of the Gaza  Strip the IDF withdrew from. This relationship permitted an  orderly and adequate transfer process. I think that this  constitutes a beginning that gives rise to hope, and gives the  Palestinian authorities the chance to translate the  just-completed transfer into orderly control, if they indeed  make full use of all their abilities as they did during the  transfer stage. As far as we are concerned, an important  chapter in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement has been concluded. I believe it offers the  Palestinians a comfortable start. A start that will permit them  to fortify their rule and bolster their control over the  population. We are especially sensitive to security aspects,  both with regard to the security of the Israeli settlers in the  settlements inside the Gaza Strip and with regard to all issues  relating to the roads used by the settlers either inside the  Gaza Strip or leading into Israel; and certainly anything  pertaining to the IDF activities in the area or to the borders  between the Gaza Strip and Israel's sovereign territory. In my  view, the activities, preparations, and implementation as  carried out by the IDF are simply worthy of the admiration of  the Israeli public and definitely that of the government and of  myself as prime minister and defense minister. The Southern  Command is indeed worthy of all praise. Thank you.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, it appears  that relations in the field between the IDF and the Palestinian  Police do not seem particularly rosy. What briefings did you  receive at the Southern Command? Can the gaps between the  parties be bridged? Can the confusion and uncertainty which is  so prevalent here in the Gaza Strip be resolved?    [Rabin] I am sorry to disappoint you. In all that pertains  to the transfer of authority, I think that things were  coordinated well. Nevertheless, let us not forget that the  mechanism stipulated by the agreements is a very complex one of  coordinating centers which are already operating. There are  joint patrols and information sharing. Any such  newly-established mechanism between two parties [two-minute  break in transmission]    ...serious fears. I would like to say that things have  been carried out much better than I expected.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela  Menashe] Are you satisfied with the IDF's new deployment and  the security of the settlers?    [Rabin] I think that our plans were drafted as best we  could. The forces deployed accordingly, and I believe we will be  able to provide maximum security. There is no foolproof  [previous word in English] security. The IDF is currently in  full control in Judaea and Samaria. A base murder occurred 10  days ago near Bet Hagay. The fact that this area is under our  control did not and cannot absolutely prevent terror attacks.  Those who think that in the current conditions, before the  whole system has stabilized, we can make sure that terror  incidents will not occur does not know and does not tell the  truth. I am convinced that our deployment and measures, some of  which are still under construction...[pauses] We arrived here  after driving along part of a fence under construction which  will divide between the Gaza Strip and Israeli territory; the  construction of other measures is still under way. When all  these are operational, they will provide the best security  possible. I would like to reiterate that there is no absolute  security against a terrorist willing to commit suicide or  against individuals willing to perpetrate terrorist attacks.    I would like to add a personal note: I am more than pleased  that IDF soldiers are no longer hanging out on the outskirts of  Gaza, the alleyways of Jabalyah and al-Shati'. I consider it a  great privilege to be part of the government that made the  decision to get them out of Gaza.    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel]  Yesterday, the police minister told the Knesset that if the  Palestinians do not abide by all their commitments the whole  process would come to a halt. Could you elaborate on this point?    [Rabin] I will clarify our position, as presented by the  police minister to the Knesset yesterday on behalf of the  government. We expect all sides to the agreement to fully abide  by their commitments. A bilateral agreement is based on the  premise that it serves the basic interests of both sides.  Therefore, our efforts will be aimed at having all sides abide  by their commitments. In spite of Palestinian statements which  could be interpreted as a possible violation of the agreement,  there will be no unilateral violation. I hope no significant  violations will occur. Agreements obviously involve two sides  and are based on the premise that each side must abide by its  commitments. Otherwise, and I hope this is not the case, Israel  definitely has all the means to insist that violations be  rectified.    [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about  incidents in recent days with the Palestinian police, including  today's incident in Jericho]    [Rabin] I will first comment on yesterday's incident. In  the wake of the killing of two IDF soldiers in the southern part  of the Erez checkpoint on Friday, we imposed a full closure on  the Gaza Strip and demanded from the Palestinian police to  station roadblocks 200 to 300 meters ahead of the IDF roadblock  so that they can be responsible for checking every vehicle  arriving at an IDF roadblock from the direction of Gaza to  confirm that the passengers are not carrying weapons.    Unfortunately, in contravention of instructions and the law,  an Israeli vehicle apparently drove into the Gaza Strip  yesterday, and then drove back toward the Erez checkpoint. At  our demand, the Palestinian police tried to stop the vehicle.  When it failed to do so, they aimed their fire at its wheels.  Nobody was hurt. In this case, the violation was unequivocally  committed by the Israeli vehicle.    As for today's incident in Jericho, I have no accurate  information. I will not comment on it until I get a report from  the IDF.    [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent about Dr.  Ahmad al-Tibi's announcement yesterday that the PNC, the  Palestine National Council, will be holding its session in Gaza  to amend the Palestinian Covenant]    [Rabin] Referring to the first part of your question, I do  not know what Ahmad al-Tibi's status is -- to the best of my  knowledge, he is an Israeli citizen -- and I am not prepared to  vouch for the extent to which he reflects 'Arafat's positions.  I only know that the agreement signed in Cairo about the  implementation of Gaza-Jericho First includes a passage in which  'Arafat undertakes to abolish those clauses in the Palestinian  Covenant contradicting the content of the letters we exchanged,  which led to the mutual recognition between the PLO and us, in  the first meeting of the PNC and to fulfill all the elements of  the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. Whether the PNC will meet  in Gaza and when, I have not received any authoritative  information about it.    Secondly, in order to go ahead with the implementation of  the  process beyond Gaza-Jericho First, we will insist that the  Palestinians demonstrate their ability to fulfill their  commitments in Gaza and Jericho and reaffirm their commitment to  the DOP, the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and the letters which led  to the mutual recognition.</p>

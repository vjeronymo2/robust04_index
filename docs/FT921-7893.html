			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Restructuring planned at Azabu Building AZABU Building, a Japanese real estate company facing increasing financial difficulties, announced a restructuring plan involving sales of its property holdings and a freeze in interest payments to its creditors. The company also appointed Mr Toshimi Shibata, a former official of Mitsui Trust and Banking, its main creditor, as president. Mr Shibata succeeds Mr Kitaro Watanabe, the stock speculator and land developer, who supplied funds to Mr T. Boone Pickens, the Texan corporate raider, in his purchase of a 26.4 per cent stake in Koito Manufacturing, which has close links with Toyota Motor. Although Mr Watanabe will retain corporate representative position, Mr Shibata, backed by Mitsui Trust, which has extended loans totalling Y200bn (Dollars 1.56bn) to Azabu group, will take actual control. Azabu's borrowings are estimated at Y700bn, including Y500bn at Azabu Building. Azabu's 33 per cent stake in Koito is also a heavy burden on the company. After Mr Pickens returned Koito's shares to Azabu last year, Mr Watanabe reached an agreement to sell 54m Koito shares, or 33 per cent stake in the company, for Y120bn to Carlson Investment Management, an independent Swedish finance company. However, Carlson has since refused Azabu's offer, due to doubts over Koito's fulfilment of TSE requirements about the number of shareholders. Azabu said it will sell Y280bn worth of property by late next year and will try to liquidate some of its real estate holdings in Tokyo and Hawaii. Azabu is in talks with its creditors, including non-bank financial institutions, over a deferral in loan repayments. Koito said it was not considering buying back its shares from Azabu, and hoped Azabu would sell its stake in the market. Koito said the adequate price for its shares, which reached a high of Y5,470 in March 1989 due to share cornering, was around Y1,000.</p>

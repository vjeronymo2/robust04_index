This will give a more realistic picture to U.S. official  circles, the Communist Party's press service announced.    Zyuganov pointed out that the Russian Communist Party and  all  Russian patriotic movements were "concerned over the inflexible  approach of the U.S. to Russian political forces and believed  that the growth in anti-American sentiment in Russia and the  U.S. unconditional support for the present unpopular executive  power have something in common."    Commenting on the situation in Russia, the Communist leader  suggested that the shock-therapy policy was dangerous for Russia  and could provoke social unrest. However, he said the Russian  Communist Party rejected both the right and the left radicalism  and was ready to cooperate with any political forces which stood  for "restoration of a strong Russia as a guarantee for peace and  stability in the whole world."    Nixon had a conversation with former vice president  Aleksandr  Rutskoy who had been released on February 26 in accordance with  the resolution on political amnesty.    The ex-U.S. president also met with the leader of the  Russian  Unity and Concord's parliamentary faction, Minister for  Nationalities and Regional Policies, Sergey Shakhray.    A meeting between Nixon and the Liberal Democratic Party's  (LDP) Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is also expected.    As it was earlier reported, the LDP received 63 seats in the  State Duma after the December parliamentary elections.</p>

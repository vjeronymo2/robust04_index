			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHELTER AIDES ARE SURPRISED BY COLD SNAP  </P> <P> County shelter officials, surprised by a cold snap that left many homeless  people shivering on the streets, said Wednesday that they will consider opening  National Guard armories to the homeless earlier next winter.  </P> <P> This year's armory program is scheduled to begin Saturday and provide shelter  to about 125 people through March 31, as weather conditions dictate.  </P> <P> Shelter coordinator Dianne M. Edwards said the Dec. 1 starting date was based  on past weather conditions and the logistics of planning for volunteers,  transportation, security and other elements of the program.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate we have had this cold blitz, but in the past three years  we've never had a weather situation that necessitated being open before  December," Edwards said. "I think as part of our planning process for next year  we will see if we need to change that time frame."  </P> <P> Many private shelters that operate for the homeless reported being at capacity  because of the cold, although few reported having to turn people away.  </P> <P> "We've had more people showing up than usual, and we're overbooked," said Cindy  Ochs, director of the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa Mesa. "We've  also been handing out more blankets to low-income residents in the area."  </P> <P> National Guard armories throughout the state were first made available to the  homeless in 1987, to be opened when weather conditions were forecast as being  life-threatening or when temperatures were predicted at 40 degrees or below or  50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain.  </P> <P> Despite some lows that dipped below 40 degrees, shelter officials primarily  track conditions in Santa Ana and Fullerton, where the county's two National  Guard armories are located, and Anaheim.  </P> <P> Santa Ana recorded a low of 42, while Anaheim dipped to just 46.  </P> <P> Edwards noted that under state criteria the county armories would not have been  able to open anyway, despite colder conditions in some areas.  </P> <P> One idea that may be looked at next year is to enlist churches as shelters on  cold nights.  </P></p>

A senior Hezb spokesman Nawab Saleem while commenting on the  foreign Office statement, said in Peshawar on Wednesday that the  claim was not understandable. "It is rank unawareness of the  realities," Saleem said.    A Foreign Office spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad on  Wednesday that the Hezb-e-Eslami was not taking part in the  current war in Kabul. The spokesman further said that fighting  was continuing between the forces of Commander Ahmed Shah Mas'ud  and Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostam.    The Hezb spokesman said that the statement was in clash with  the previous impartial stand of Islamabad on the Afghan issue.  "The fact of the matter is that the Hezb was attacked by the  Rabbani forces and Shoora-e-Nazar in Kabul without any  provocation." Saleem said, adding, "the Hezb had to retaliate in  its defence.    The other forces, who were already fed up with the  dictatorial policies of Rabbani and Mas'ud, also took up arms to  get rid of such a rule, Saleem explained. He said that his  party was not able to understand the motive behind the statement  against the Hezb-e-Eslami.</p>

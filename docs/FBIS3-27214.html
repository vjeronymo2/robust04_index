The head of the city's New Year Transport Committee, Ma  Yijun, said soldiers were being used at train stations and along  railway lines to "assist" public security officers, armed police  and railway police in maintaining order. "We've got hundreds of  plainclothes and uniformed soldiers out there every day," Ma  said. "Nobody would dare step out of line."    The number of soldiers has been increased since last  Tuesday's tragedy at Heng-yang in Hunan province where 51 job  seekers were trampled to death after two trains arrived at the  station at the same time. Ma said the Hengyang incident was "a  small thing", but admitted a national circular had been issued  since then to tighten management at train station. [passage  omitted]</p>

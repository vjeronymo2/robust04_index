			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by Patriarch Alexis II of Moscow and All Russia, </F> 17 February 1994, Moscow]    [Text] The armed conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina has  already been evoking great alarm throughout all of the Russian  Orthodox Church for a long time. The numerous sacrifices borne  by the warring sides, the grave sufferings of the peaceful  population, the destruction of cities and towns and the demise  of the habitat are the tragic consequences of the fratricidal  war into which the peoples inhabiting this region have been  drawn.    In May 1993 the Patriarch and Holy Synod of the Russian  Orthodox Church issued a Statement on the Current Situation in  the Territory of Former Yugoslavia. It in, we stated our empathy  for the grave sufferings of the Serbian people, with whom we are  tied by centuries-old knots of brotherhood and the one Orthodox  faith, and our sympathy for the other peoples of former  Yugoslavia--Catholics, Muslims and people without religion. "We  appeal," this statement read, "to all leaders of peoples drawn  into the armed conflict to immediately desist from military  activities and go over to peaceful resolution of existing  disputes through peaceful concessions.    "We pray and beseech these peoples, including the Serbian  people, who are of one faith with us, to live in peace, and  goodly concordance with one another.    "We beseech the world community to reject plans for armed  intervention into the conflict, unilateral military support or  unilateral economic blockade of any of the sides involved.    "We welcome all steps toward peace, no matter whence the  come, and pray for their success."    However, to our deep regret the tragic situation that has  evolved in relations between the warring sides has not yet  experienced any radical positive changes. Moreover the ultimatum  regarding plans by aviation of NATO countries to bomb Serbian  fire positions at Sarajevo will unquestionably lead, in the  event of implementation of these plans, to great human  sacrifice, including deaths in the peaceful population, no  matter what direction from which they are approached. The  bombing may evoke the most unpredictable military and political  consequences, and in and of itself, it would be an extremely  dangerous precedent.    We appeal to all upon whom this depends not to permit such a  dangerous development of events, and to reject the very idea of  bombing. We must persistently seek a peaceful, and only a  peaceful solution to the problem. On the road to this end, the  warring units must withdraw their heavy armaments simultaneously  and without delay, or place them under international control, so  that the blockade of the city of Sarajevo could finally be  lifted and so that humanitarian assistance could finally be  delivered unhindered to its long-suffering population.    May the Lord shed wisdom upon all decision makers, and let  them hear His voice, calling for peace and reconciliation.  The Lord shall say peace to His people and to His chosen;  yet let them not return to folly (Psalms 96, 9).</p>

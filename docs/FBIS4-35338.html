			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the YSP Political Bureau; place and </F> date not given]    [Text] Statements by 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, the planning  and development minister, have been repeated for the second day,  declaring that the battlefronts are quiet in anticipation of  talks with accredited elements in the YSP. Al-Iryani, whose  name has been linked with this war and who is one of its  advocates, planners, and enthusiasts, is sparing no effort --  after his artillery war was silenced on different battlefronts  by the action of the steadfast people and the heroes from the  army of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and its brave soldiers  -- to seek new exits and misleading excuses, in view of the  predicament in which the Sanaa authorities find themselves,  through convoluted and repetitive statements about negotiations  with what he calls the moderate group of the YSP. This reflects  the misleading style northern leaders have followed in the past  concerning stopping the war and saving Yemen from destruction.  Instead of responding to calls and patriotic, arab, and  international appeals, al-Iryani has proceeded to burn his  smelly incense in the holocaust of death imposed on the Yemeni  people by him and those like him from among the war advocates.    He has been aiming to tear apart the YSP from the first day  of the union by base methods. YSP militants and the people are  well aware of these methods, which are well known, and which  al-Iryani is now using again at this time when the Yemeni people  are aspiring for a serious stand on the war, instead of this  deceptive misleading style, which carries with it the decision  to continue this destructive war.    This party, which announced its initiative to stop the war  on  the first day that the war was touched off by the Sanaa rulers,  continues to adhere to its stand, which rejects and [word  indistinct] the war [words indistinct] by all standards.  [passage indistinct]    The responsibility for the political situation brought about  by the war must be borne by those who touched it off. The  party, with its political, social, patriotic, and popular  allies, will face this situation together in the same manner  that it rejects the war, which it condemns. It calls for the  immediate cessation of this war, the withdrawal of forces, and  peaceful negotiations. Those who imposed the war must bear  responsibility for it. Those on whom the war has been imposed  have no alternative but to defend themselves and their homeland  against the arrogance of the war criminals, who are smeared with  the blood of the innocent sons of our homeland and great people.  God gives us success.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAIG MCCAW: CELLULAR TELEPHONE INDUSTRY GIANT SHUNS THE SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Recent editions of "Who's Who in the West" and "Who's Who of Emerging Leaders  In America" describe the achievements of a son of the late J. Elroy McCaw, a  Seattle entrepreneur who built a communications empire.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, though, the listing is for Elroy's first-born son, an insurance  executive, and not Craig O. McCaw, the second son, who has jolted the big  regional phone companies by becoming the undisputed leader of the hot new  cellular telephone industry. After starting out with a small cable television  concern inherited by the four McCaw sons, 39-year-old Craig McCaw has led the  way into building Kirkland, Wash.,-based McCaw Cellular Communications into the  nation's largest cellular company.  </P> <P> The "Who's Who" omission reflects McCaw's almost reclusive style. Despite his  role as an industry powerhouse, he is little-known outside of the cellular  business.  </P> <P> He rarely grants interviews and declined to be interviewed or photographed for  this story. In fact, McCaw has asked other people not to discuss his family  with reporters. His photograph has never been in the company's annual reports.  "We ap proach our work with humility and determination to achieve excellence,"  McCaw said in the 1988 chairman's letter.  </P> <P> Becoming a corporate giant appears to be a major goal, too. On June 6, McCaw  Cellular proposed a $5.8-billion tender offer for the 91% of New York-based Lin  Broadcasting that McCaw Cellular doesn't already own. The acquisition would  give the company, among other things, Lin's important 35% stake in Los Angeles  Cellular Telephone Co. and cement its No. 1 position in an industry some  believe will eventually rival traditional phone service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Principle Passion  </P> <P> When McCaw emerges in public, it is usually to sing the praises of the cellular  industry. "He is a very good speaker. He's very knowledgeable about the  industry," said Robert W. Maher, president of the Cellular Telephone Industry  Assn.  </P> <P> "He's a great believer in this industry. He is very confident that this is a  good business and that there is potential growth to make this a very big  industry," Maher added.  </P> <P> Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based telecommunications analyst for Piper  Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, said the cellular business is McCaw's "principal and  consuming interest."  </P> <P> McCaw's other passions are yachting and flying, according to associates. He  lives near Seattle's Lake Washington and frequently pilots a seaplane and a  Lear jet.  </P> <P> Known as an extremely aggressive and tough competitor, McCaw is also said to be  likable, though quiet, socially. "I think he is a very bright and engaging  person. I enjoy talking to him. He likes to talk about his business," said C.  Lee Cox, president and chief executive of PacTel Corp., the holding company for  Pacific Telesis Group's cellular operations and other unregulated businesses.  </P> <P> McCaw is said to have likened himself to the Wizard of Oz at a company retreat  about a year ago. Not many in the industry would deny that he is a wizard of a  sort. He defied assumptions just a few years ago that the so-called Baby Bell  telephone companies, created after the 1986 breakup of American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph, would dominate new cellular business because of their financial and  marketing strength.  </P> <P> McCaw Cellular now has interests in cellular systems serving an estimated 57  million "pops" -- an industry market share measure calculated by multiplying  the number of people in a market area by the percent a firm owns of a company  serving the area. (If a company owns 50% of a firm serving a market with 10  million people, it has 5 million pops.) By that standard, McCaw Cellular is  almost twice as big as Pacific Telesis, the industry's No. 2 company.  </P> <P> To stay ahead of its rivals, McCaw has taken on a staggering amount of debt --  about $1.8 billion, according to Security and Exchange Commission filings -- in  part to finance acquisitions. Most of McCaw's debt is in "junk bonds" arranged  by investment bankers Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> The borrowing hasn't yet paid off; interest expenses contributed to the  company's loss of $297 million last year on revenue of $310.8 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Involvement  </P> <P> "He's a pretty aggressive guy," said Bradford L. Peery, an independent analyst  in San Francisco. McCaw is "willing to bet the store" to dominate the industry,  he said.  </P> <P> His style resembles that of his father, who also tended to keep his own  counsel. Although the elder McCaw assembled a radio and television empire, many  of the operations were sold to pay debts after he died in 1969. All that was  left for the four McCaw sons was a 7,000-subscriber Centralia, Wash., cable TV  system.  </P> <P> Today, all of the sons are officers and directors of the firm that grew out of  that cable operation. Together, they own about 46% of McCaw Cellular, although  Craig McCaw controls a crucial block of shares.  </P> <P> The eldest, 42-year-old Bruce R. McCaw, is a vice president. He's also chairman  of Westar Insurance Group. John E. McCaw Jr., 38, is executive vice president  for acquisitions. The youngest brother, 34-year-old Keith W. McCaw, is a vice  president.  </P> <P> Craig McCaw attended Seattle's Lakeside School, where officials declined to  talk about him at McCaw's request, and later studied history at Stanford  University.  </P> <P> After taking over the cable television franchise, Craig McCaw bought other  cable properties and a telephone paging service. In 1982, though, he began  pursuing cellular licenses and soon acquired interests in partnerships serving  a number of areas, including Seattle and Portland.  </P> <P> In 1987, the firm sold its cable interests to Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the  Washington Redskins and the Woodland Hills-based Daily News, and went public.  </P> <P> With a presence in 127 markets today, McCaw now has its eye on Lin Broadcasting  partnerships in New York, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, along with Los  Angeles. If McCaw proceeds with its proposed tender offer and completes the  acquisition, analysts say, McCaw cellular would truly become an industry  juggernaut.  </P> <P> For now, McCaw Cellular is biding its time before launching a proposed  $120-a-share tender offer, possibly waiting for the price of Lin's stock to  come down. Lin's stock price shot up to $129.50 after McCaw Cellular disclosed  its plans, apparently on speculation that another bidder would emerge. None  has, however, and the stock closed Friday at $122.50.  </P></p>

He considered this act as an attempt to kill the peace  process.    In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, al-Rajub said that  the Palestinian leadership regards the Fatah Hawks as part of  the forces that have to protect the national authority.  Consequently, we have to provide security for them. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic this evening  received special UN envoy Charles Redman. Following the talks  Charles Redman stated that the United States has very close and  good cooperation with the Croatian Government:    [Begin Redman recording in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] On this occasion I am staying in  Croatia just very briefly, on my way from Sarajevo to  Washington. Some very important decisions ought to be reached  as regards what we can do in order to strengthen the UN role in  Bosnia.    At the same time, nobody will forget that we ought to work  on  some very important issues here in Croatia. We have made  significant progress, but we still need to do more, and I hope  that my meeting and talks with Minister Granic will strengthen  this process and achieve progress in the right direction. We  are both pleased with the progress that has been achieved in the  past months. On behalf of the United States, I would like to say  that it is our intention to stay in close touch with the  Croatian Government so that this process should proceed further.  [end recording]    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said that one of the  main issues discussed in talks with the special U.S. envoy was  the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina:    [Begin Granic recording] We discussed the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular [word indistinct] Gorazde,  progress reached in talks between the Croats and the Bosniaks  regarding setting up the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  the situation in UN protected areas, the latest behaviur  displayed by the Serbs in the UN protected areas and in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the possible U.S. and UN moves.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos issued Memorandum Order  [M.O.] No. 201, creating a committee to study the expeditious  issuance of environmental compliance certificate [ECC] for  infrastructure projects. The committee is composed of the  National Economic and Development Authority director-general as  chairman, and the secretaries of the Departments of Environment  and Natural Resources, Public Works and Highways [DPWH], Energy,  and Transportation and Communications and the chairman of the  Coordinating Council of the Philippine Assistance Program as  members.    In signing the order, President Ramos said the government is  now engaged in the implementation of major infrastructure  projects that are crucial to the attainment of the Philippine  development goals. Mr. Ramos noted that lately, implementation  of this infrastructure projects has been delayed due to the  difficulties encountered in securing environmental compliance  certificates. The president tasked the committee to undertake  the following:    1. to determine the scope of environmental compliance  certificates;    2. to formulate ways and means by which the issuance of  environmental compliance certificate may be expedited; and    3. to submit recommendations to the executive secretary for  the formulation of the appropriate order. These recommendations  should be submitted to him not later than 15 May of this year.    Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. said President  Ramos issued M.O. 201 in view of the request of Public Works and  Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar for presidential assistance  for the immediate implementation of the Pampanga Delta  Development Project [PDDP]. According to Vigilar, the  submission of an environmental compliance certificate is one of  the priority requirements of the Overseas Economic Cooperation  Fund [OECF] of Japan before it issues a conforme to the  contracts of the PDDP. Vigilar said that during the president's  visit to PDDP site last 25 March, the OECF representative in  Manila, (Iteyo Tanakan) informed him that the OECF will continue  to withhold the release of PDDP funds until the DPWH has  complied with the conditions stated in the ECC. Vigilar said  that the OECF is particularly concerned with Section 1.3 of the  ECC which requires the DPWH for the contractors to secure  endorsement from every concerned local government units and  municipalities for right, suitable and acceptable relocation  scheme and conduct consultations with affected residents prior  to project implementation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aphalak Phatiyasewi in Chiang Mai] </F>   [Text] Thailand's first official vaccine trial on HlV/AIDS  prevention is likely to begin in April by the Thai Red Cross  Society on non-HlV/AIDS carriers.    Thai Red Cross Society AIDS Program director Praphan  Phanuphak said the AIDS preventive vaccine developed by United  Biomedical Inc of the United States would be tried on volunteers  of a low-risk group, after formal approval is received from the  National AIDS Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai, on February 14.    He said the Public Health Ministry had finally accepted the  need for development of vaccines to prevent HIV infection in  Thailand and had therefore given the green light.    The vaccine, already tested on people in the United States,  Australia, and China, had proved to be satisfactory, he said.    Dr. Praphan said the first phase of the trial would require  24 volunteers, to observe the side effects that could be caused,  and 100 to 200 volunteers to test the vaccine.    The results of the first stage of the trial would be known  after eight months, whereas that of the second stage would be  known within two years.    The vaccine trial would be publicized widdy [as received]  because volunteers, non-HlV carriers of the lower risk group,  would have to be carefully screened, he said.    Dr. Praphan said the volunteers would have to be given full  details of the trial because out of the 24 volunteers, some  would be given 100 micrograms of vaccine, some 500 micrograms  and some would be given placebos, without making them aware of  what injection they have received.    He said the volunteers would have to be told that the  vaccine  might be of benefit or might be of no use at all to them.    "The drawback of the vaccine trial is that during the  initial  trial period volunteers will have anti-HlV positive antibody in  their blood," Dr. Praphan said.    However, after some time this could be separated from the  HIV  positive infection that caused AIDS.    According to Dr. Praphan, the Public Health Ministry is  opening up to the vaccine trial because the AIDS problem is  rapidly increasing in Thailand.    "Even though the news media criticizes Thailand for using  its  people as guinea pigs, the ministry will ignore it because no  time can be wasted on this problem."    Other than the vaccine, Dr. Praphan said a new type of  medicine, known as "protease inhibitor", was being developed in  the United States and it was hoped it would be used by Thais by  the end of the year.    He said this new medicine would be different from AZT  because  it would not allow the virus to become active and would allow  only the production of a defective virus.    Dr. Praphan called on the Public Health Ministry and  researchers of the country to encourage vaccine trials -- and  not to bother whether the medicine had been licensed -- in order  to obtain vaccines at a reasonable cost.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: ADT plans ambitious warrant offering ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, set itself an ambitious target of a 1-for-6 warrant offering at Dollars 10 a share to existing shareholders in its annual report circulated yesterday. The report reflects the new standards of corporate governance introduced after pressure exerted last year by Laidlaw, the Canadian waste services and school bus operator which holds the majority stake in ADT. It includes far greater details in the accounts - for the year to December 31 1991 - and a commitment to issue quarterly reports from March 31 1992. Notes to the accounts reveal that litigation with Laidlaw cost ADT Dollars 11.5m, which Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, referred to in his letter to shareholders as a 'short but distracting legal dispute'. Goodwill write-offs included Dollars 278m against the acquisition of Britannia Security Group in 1990 after an extensive review suggesting assets had been materially overvalued. 'The company is discussing with its advisers the various courses of action which may be available,' it said. There are also write-offs of Dollars 146m against Christies International, Dollars 101m against Lep and Dollars 21m of security services. Mr Ashcroft said that in spite of attention given to the company's debt maturities, principal banking facilities do not mature until 1994. He said ADT continued to be in compliance with its covenants made to bankers and 'it is not expected that any such covenants will be breached.' Net cash provided by operating activities has risen to Dollars 218m (Dollars 140m), while net cash outflows from investing have slumped to Dollars 16m (Dollars 539m). Aggregate directors' remuneration fell to Dollars 4.9m (Dollars 5.6m), but included a substantial rise in directors' shareholdings, including 1.75m beneficial and 908,000 options held by Mr Ashcroft.

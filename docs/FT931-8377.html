			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The government's unseemly haste in cutting base rates after the release of December's appalling unemployment figures now looks misplaced. Traditional seasonal adjustments may have been rendered invalid by the length of the recession. As a result, December's figures may not have been as bad as they looked, while only cold comfort can be drawn from the better January data. The trend rise in unemployment is still running at over 40,000 a month, far higher than at a similar stage of previous recessions. The implications for consumer confidence are clear. There is, however, a silver lining. Productivity is now climbing rapidly and may show double-digit growth once cyclical recovery starts. In manufacturing industry, at least, that has all but offset wage inflation, which should help counter the impact of devaluation. Yet if the near-term inflation outlook is good, that is purely a function of the depressed economy. The real inflation test comes later.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: FNAC plunges to FFr31.9m Pressures on the French retail sector triggered a sharp fall in profits for FNAC, the dominant force in music and books retailing. In the year to August 31 net profits fell to FFr31.9m (Dollars 5.5m) from FFr159.5m in the previous year. FNAC has in recent months been clouded by the controversy over the decision by GMF, its troubled parent company, to sell its controlling stake to a consortium composed of Altus Finance, part of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, a property subsidiary of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux utility concern. The uncertainty over its ownership, coupled with the strains of France's economic recession, took a toll on FNAC last year. It faced the challenge of its first serious competitor in French cultural retailing due to the aggressive expansion in France of Virgin, the UK leisure company controlled Mr Richard Branson. FNAC mustered an overall increase in turnover of 8.3 per cent to FFr8.9bn from FFr8.2bn, but most of this growth came from new openings. Sales at its existing stores rose by 0.3 per cent during the year. The group increased operating profits by 14.3 per cent to FFr102.5m from FFr89.9m. But it was left with an exceptional debit of FFr77m having benefited from an exceptional credit of FFr107.8m in the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LIGHTWEIGHTS AND THE CRITICALLY APPROVED  </P> <P> I don't know what's funnier, Richard Marx thinking critics don't like him  because of his hair or Hilburn doing a whole article on people like Marx  griping about why people like Hilburn don't like him. Lighten up, guys!  </P> <P> Ninety-nine percent of rock critics are a curiosity, nothing more. A sensible  person gives no more thought to one of these scribblers than he would a  television critic, a sportswriter or Geraldo. People like Hilburn are useful in  gauging what the middle-of-the-road, hip-trendy, radical chic, yuppie crowd is  thinking at any particular moment (these are very fickle people).  </P> <P> Why should Marx, Phil Collins, Billy Joel and the rest of the "outs" care about  the likes of Hilburn? As long as "Candy" and "Ronnie" keep buying their music  and showing up at their concerts, why should they worry?  </P> <P> They're never going to make music like Newman, Simon, Springsteen or U2. And  the critics will probably turn on these "in" guys someday (they already have,  in the case of the last two). Hey, it's only rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> CHARLES CHICCOA  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

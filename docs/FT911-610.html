			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Brazil names economy minister BRAZIL yesterday launched a less abrasive style of economic management by bringing in a diplomat and former banker, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, as economy minister in place of Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello. Ms Cardoso resigned along with the entire team responsible for the country's drastic stabilisation programme. But government officials said the changes did not mean the team's policies had failed or that there would be a new economic package. Instead there would be a 'more consensual style' and 'more effective management'. Ms Cardoso was President Fernando Collor de Mello's closest supporter and an architect of his anti-inflation plan. Her departure after almost 14 months in office underlines the government's isolation at home and abroad. Her combative style in negotiations with creditor banks and with Brazil's congress, businessmen and labour leaders appeared increasingly to be a liability. By contrast, Mr Moreira, Brazil's ambassador to Washington, is widely respected for quiet negotiating skills. He is expected to change the style of government markedly, though not the substance. The 59-year-old diplomat faces the daunting task of avoiding a return to hyperinflation and mending Brazil's fences with the international financial community over payment of the country's Dollars 122bn (Pounds 71.6bn) foreign debt. His close relations with the US Treasury and his reputation among banks should ease negotiations with the IMF for a Dollars 2bn standby facility and help smooth troubled relations with Washington before President Collor's US visit next month. After Ms Cardoso's resignation on Wednesday night, others to bow out included Mr Ibrahim Eris, governor of the central bank. He was replaced by Mr Francisco Gros, who held the post briefly in 1987. Among others to go were Mr Antonio Kandir, chief economic policy maker; Mr Joao Maia, national economy secretary; and Mr Eduardo Modiano, head of the National Development Bank. Mr Eduardo Teixeira, infrastructure minister, also resigned, while Mr Jorio Dauster, chief debt negotiator, offered his resignation. Ms Cardoso, a 37-year-old former economic history professor, is relinquishing control of the world's ninth largest economy to return to teaching. Conflict to consensus, Page 3</p>

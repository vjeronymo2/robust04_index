			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average climbs to set two-year high Equities hit their highest level in more than two years on soaring volume, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average registered a low for the day of 20,930.20 in the first few minutes of trading, and then climbed to set the session's high of 21,273.75 just before closing at 21,261.95, a 219.24 net gain and the highest finish since March 2, 1992. The market shrugged off a sharp rise in the yen triggered by remarks from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, that raised the threat of unilateral trade sanctions against Japan. Estimated volume nearly doubled to 600m shares from Tuesday's 305m. First section gainers led losers by 769 to 249, with 163 stocks unchanged. The capital weighted 300 index closed 2.54 higher at 309.85 and the first-section Topix index advanced 16.16 to close at 1,697.74. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.34 at 1,407.16. The late afternoon rally that took the market to new highs was triggered by life insurers and investment trusts, which had been on the sidelines for weeks. Individual investors also began to re-enter the market as it gained strength. High-technology and large-capital stocks, market favourites on Tuesday, rose in active trade. Oki Electric, second on the most-active list, climbed Y32 to Y740, its highest level since 1991. The company gained strength from a report by New Japan Securities that forecast that Oki's recurring profit would reach Y25bn in the year to March 1995. The company had only projected Y10bn. Fujitsu, the third most active stock, gained Y50 at Y1,150, while NEC picked up Y30 to Y1,240. Among other high-technology stocks, Sharp was up Y40 at Y1,840 and Matsushita Electric Industrial finished Y30 stronger at Y1,900. Heavy electricals also gathered buyers. Mitsubishi Electric moved ahead Y18 to Y710, Hitachi rose Y20 to Y1,100 and Toshiba gained Y13 at Y842. IC manufacturers in the US and Japan have been increasing production capacity for advanced microprocessors and memory chips. Forecasts that Japan's four leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers would profit strongly from expanded demand attracted buying. Nikon was up Y30 to Y1,080, Tokyo Electron rose Y20 to Y3,180, Kokusai Electric gained Y50 at Y2,120 and Advantest added Y60 at Y3,430. Car makers were strong. Fuji Heavy Industries, Mazda, and Suzuki set new 1994 peaks for the second day in a row. Fuji moved up Y4 to 474, Mazda gained Y5 at Y626, Suzuki appreciated Y30 to Y1,510 and Nissan rose Y20 to Y886. In Osaka the OSE average reached 23,452.63, up 249.82, in volume of 89m shares. Roundup There was no common theme to trading in the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG ended firmer but trading was cautious as the market waited for the government's package to cool the overheated housing market, announced after the market closed. The Hang Seng index gained 43.30 at 9,291.18. In the event, the package, which included a ban on the resale of unfinished flats, was not expected to have much impact on property or share prices. Among property issues, Cheung Kong was steady at HKDollars 38.25, New World Development improved 50 cents to HKDollars 25.50 and Henderson Land rose 75 cents to HKDollars 41.25. SYDNEY was helped higher by firmer base metal prices and sustained buying in blue chips, The All Ordinaries index closed with a rise of 9.5 at 2,079.7. In the resource sector, CRA jumped 32 cents to ADollars 19.06: its offshoot, Coal and Allied Industries, announced plans to develop Vietnam's coal resources. SEOUL saw a technical rebound after the recent tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme which took the composite index 11.30 higher to 933.02. BOMBAY recovered from a an early downturn to close higher after an unexpected announcement of a bonus issue by Tata Tea triggered a spate of buy orders. The BSE 30-share index added 16.08 at 4,049.74 as Tata Tea surged Rs160, or 23 per cent, to Rs830. MANILA's four-day slide, which saw prices decline by 3.8 per cent, was reversed by a round of bargain hunting, pushing the composite index 22.60 higher to 3,017.15. TAIPEI rose, but closed off the day's best, in heavy trade in response to Tuesday's news that Taiwan's exports hit a record high of Dollars 8.5bn in May. The weighted index ended 28.73 up at 6,098.58, after touching 6,153, in turnover that rose to TDollars 83.8bn from TDollars 66.2bn. SINGAPORE shares closed flat in thin dealings, but Malaysian-OTC shares were hard hit by reports that Prime Minister Mahathir has set up a committee to look into money laundering in Malaysian listed companies. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 1.56 to 2,265.65. KUALA LUMPUR drifted lower in sluggish trading which left the composite index down 3.11 at 969.31. Among gainers, however, was Malakoff, which rose 91 cents to MDollars 5.45 on reports that the company would be involved in an independent power project in Thailand. BANGKOK remained worried about political stability, sparked by wrangling over constitutional reform, and the SET index lost 12.98 at 1,370.41 in heavy turnover of Bt10.1bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Federal Vote on 12 June: Swiss </F> Blue Helmets Would Not Go to Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] Berne, 18 Apr (ATS) -- Switzerland does not have to  belong to the United Nations to form a troop of blue helmets,  nor does it have to give up its neutrality. Moreover, it would  only send its men on peacekeeping missions, and not into  conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia. This is how  Swiss Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger countered the arguments  of opponents of the blue helmets. He was speaking in Bern on  Monday [18 April] in a debate organized by the Swiss radical  press association.    The head of the Federal Military Department (DMF) expressed  his concern that attention had been focused on the three most  spectacular operations involving UN blue helmets, namely, those  being carried out in the background of the wars raging in the  former Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda. These cases are  exceptions overshadowing the 14 other operations currently being  implemented successfully, for example in Cyprus, the Golan  Heights, and Cambodia.  <H5>  No Swiss Sent to War </H5>   Mr. Villiger stressed that Swiss blue helmets would not be  sent to war and would only participate in operations where their  independence was guaranteed. It would be wrong to claim that  sending out a force of blue helmets is incompatible with Swiss  neutrality. The blue helmets are precisely neutral  intermediaries between opposing forces, there to "give peace a  chance." Other neutral countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and  Austria have had blue helmets for some time.    Switzerland benefits from external security, if only by  avoiding being submerged by requests for asylum. The DMF head  stressed that the issue of possible NATO membership, if it ever  came up again, would have to be put to a vote of the people of  the Swiss cantons. It is therefore wrong to claim that the  creation of a troop of blue helmets would automatically lead to  membership.  <H5>  Bosnia Is a Bad Example </H5>   Austria's Major General Guenter Greindl, who headed the UN  forces for 13 years, also participated in the debate which was  organized in the light of the upcoming vote of 12 June. He  emphasized that Austria considers the blue helmets to be an  important aspect of its active neutrality policy. In his  opinion, the Bosnia example gave a deformed view of reality.  The radical national councilor Oscar Fritschi (ZH) also  condemned the "dangerous method" of showing just the negative  aspects. It was even possible to speak of success in the former  Yugoslavia, since blue helmets have saved hundreds of lives  there.    Peter Vollmer, the Socialist national councilor from Bern,  claimed that by participating in the UN peacekeeping missions,  Switzerland would make a major but insufficient contribution.  This was just a first step toward a more open and  solidarity-minded policy. For Mr. Vollmer, it is time to  redefine Swiss neutrality.  <H5>  No "Lack of Solidarity" </H5>   The only opponent invited to speak in the debate, National  Councillor Walter Steinmann of the Automobile Drivers' Party,  pointed to the distress of the blue helmets in the former  Yugoslavia. He considered that Switzerland would not be able to  pull its troops out of a war zone if the situation deteriorated  rapidly. Switzerland does not have a "lack of solidarity" it  has to make up. In addition to its financial support through  humanitarian and development aid, the was already showing its  solidarity through the Red Cross and the Swiss Disaster  Assistance Corps.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> JUDGE SETS DATE FOR BROWN MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> The murder trial of Anaheim Hills computer entrepreneur David A. Brown, accused  of masterminding his wife's shooting death and letting his daughter take the  blame for the crime, will begin March 29, a judge decided Thursday.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown set the trial date at Brown's arraignment  in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, after the 36-year-old defendant  pleaded innocent to the charges of murder and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Brown's daughter, Cinnamon Brown, has spent the last 3 years in a California  Youth Authority facility in Camarillo for the shooting death of her stepmother,  Linda Brown. She now claims her father directed her to commit the 1985 crime.  </P> <P> Expected to join Cinnamon Brown as a key witness against her father is the  murder victim's sister, Patricia Bailey, 20. Bailey, who married Brown about 16  months after her sister's death and also is charged with her murder, has agreed  to cooperate with prosecutors in the case.  </P> <P> In tape-recorded conversations with his daughter and with police, Brown -- who  collected $835,000 from his wife's life insurance -- acknowledged that he knew  about and took some role in a plot to kill his wife. But he has denied  orchestrating it, saying he tried to talk his daughter of out of the plan.  </P></p>

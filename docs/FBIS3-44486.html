			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429): "Background of Reform of CPC Conscription Work"]    [Text] Beijing 29 Dec (HSIN PAO)--According to a well-  informed source in Beijing, a 16 December "Internal Newsletter"  from the CPC Central Military Commission stated that  conscription work for Winter 1993 had already been concluded  satisfactorily, and new recruits were continuously reporting to  units in various places as scheduled. In this winter's  conscription, there were some 12.6 million applicants, with some  800,000 allowed to have health checks in the wake of their  initial examinations. The number of new recruits who went  underwent political examination and health checks with final  recruitment approval was some 375,000, of which, young people  from large and medium-sized cities accounted for 47 percent  (greatly exceeding the original quota of 13 percent), young  people from townships and towns accounted for 29 percent, those  with a high school education or equivalent accounted for 62  percent, those with a cadre family background accounted for 16  percent, and those who were communists or Communist Youth League  members themselves accounted for 38 percent.    According to the "Internal Newsletter," conscription work  this year has been the smoothest in eight years. In the seven  preceding years, conscription quotas in urban areas were  fulfilled only twice, in 1988 and 1992, but the quota was  basically not fulfilled in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991. In  1987 and 1991 particularly, only 78 percent of the quota was  fulfilled. Although the quota was fulfilled in 1988, the  cultural quality was not up to requirements. In addition,  Guangdong, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Hubei were criticized in a  circular for their poor conscription work. This year, however,  conscription work has been comparatively smooth in those  provinces and cities enjoying comparatively fast economic  development and higher living standards and cultural levels,  such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hubei, Shandong,  Shanghai and Beijing, and young people were competing to submit  their applications. The number of young people in employment or  at school applying to military institutions even doubled that of  1985, the highest for a decade.  <H3>  "Craze for Doing Business" Pounds At "Craze for Joining the  Army" </H3>   Why has conscription work been so smooth this year? Liu  Huaqing, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and  concurrently Central Military Commission vice chairman, said:  "We have done conscription work this winter by observing  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building and running the Army,  based on China's national conditions as well as the progress of  the times, and the principle of combining political propaganda,  ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits as well as  job arrangements. Facts evidence that such practice is correct.  That is the success of reform in conscription work." He made  the above statement at a seminar on modern warfare sponsored by  the Air Force Advanced Military Institute on 18 December.    A well-informed source said that young people in mainland  China used to have a sense of honor as well as superiority when  enlisting in the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, and they would enjoy  a brighter future. When their enlistment expired, they might  continue to serve in the Army as cadres, with higher average  wages than ordinary staffers and workers and even cadres in  localities. Even when they were demobilized, generally better  job arrangements were made for them, and those who originally  came from rural areas might transfer their residence  registration to urban areas. That being the case, young people  vied to be enlisted. Some of them even managed to join the Army  through their connections or the back door, and the "craze for  joining the Army" could be found everywhere in mainland China.  However, with the deepening of reform and opening up in the  1980's and 1990's, especially the development of the market  economy, there has been a repetition of the "craze for doing  business"; many young people have made profits in business and  have greatly improved their living standards. They have seen  that those who joined the Army did not enjoy a brighter future  than those who remained civilians; naturally, they changed their  concepts and no longer believed that joining the Army was the  best choice for the future. In addition, some young people  learned that in recent years, the wage income of military cadres  had gradually fallen behind staffers, workers and cadres in  localities, and even their dependents working in coastal areas,  special economic zones, and economically developed areas.  Furthermore, if they were stationed at frontier posts  characterized by hardship and remoteness, they could suffer  psychological imbalance resulted from material differences in  addition to possibly sacrificing their lives at any time, and  they flinched from joining the Army. In short, the "craze for  doing business" buffeted the "craze for joining the Army," and  conscription work was impeded.  <H5>  Remove Anxieties For One's Future After Enlistment </H5>   Aiming at such conditions while dealing with the needs of  the  Army subject to the overall situation of aggregate national  construction at a Central Military Commission discussion meeting  on 1 November 1984, Deng Xiaoping indicated: "Training people  for both military and civilian jobs is also in the general  interest. Our Army has been doing a good job in this respect  and has much to its credit. That's fine. The Army trains these  people in the interests of national development, and local  authorities will warmly welcome the trainees. Such training  will make it easier for demobilized cadres and soldiers to be  transferred to civilian jobs." Not long ago, when Deng Xiaoping  learned about the difficulties in conscription work, he said:  "Reform is also called for in conscription work; first, quality  should be insured, and second, it is necessary to a good job of  making arrangements for the livelihood, jobs, and housing of new  recruits as well as officers and men in active service after  demobilization."    In line with Deng Xiaoping's instruction, the Central  Military Commission conducted reform of conscription work, and  set out the aforesaid "principle of combining political  propaganda, ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits  as well as work arrangements." The spirit of this principle  lies in the demand that it is necessary to do political and  ideological work in conscription work, as well as resolve  practical problems. "Treatment in pay and benefits" means a new  recruit during his enlistment will continue to enjoy his  original pay and benefits along with subsidies, and  readjustments in wages and promotion will also be conducted  according to his original work unit. "Work arrangements" means  that when those demobilized servicemen return to work in the  city, their wages will be set one grade higher than those of  staffers and workers during that period, and an outstanding  demobilized serviceman or one with a record of meritorious  service may enjoy wages two grades higher, and all units that  have conditions should give priority to them in the distribution  of housing. Regarding demobilized servicemen who return to  rural areas, prefectural and county governments should give  priority to them in making arrangements for them to work in  local government organizations, enterprises, and institutions  according to their performance during their enlistment, their  speciality, and educational background. Their wages should be  determined with reference to the length of enlistment, and an  additional 20 percent of the area's average annual income per  capita would be considered appropriate; in addition, their  relocation allowance should generally not be lower than 5,000  yuan.    The aforesaid reform has succeeded in relieving young  people's anxieties for the future after enlistment.  Furthermore, over the past few years, units have universally  attached importance to bringing up people for both military and  civilian jobs in various forms, including training people on the  job, transferring them to new posts, self-study through  correspondence courses, and building bases for concentrated  training in rotation, thus creating better conditions for the  broad officers and men seeking knowledge and becoming qualified  people as well as employment after demobilization.  Consequently, resistance to conscription work has been greatly  reduced over the past two years.  <H5>  Worrying About "Defeating Oneself" </H5>   The well-informed source added that, despite a basic  solution  to conscription work difficulties, the Army's political quality  had became a conspicuous issue. Since the beginning of this  year, senior commanders such as Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, and the director of Deng Xiaoping's  office, Wang Ruilin, have made inspections and fact-finding  tours of various military regions, and they all found that how  the Army should bring forward the fine traditions and maintain  the true colors of the old Red Army under the new situation of  developing the socialist market economy was a serious issue.  Old generals, including Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, and Xiao Ke  have also written to Deng Xiaoping and the Central Military  Commission indicating that are many problems among the troops,  especially that there was no time to lose in resolving problems  with the Army's political quality.    That being the case, the Central Military Commission and the  General Political Department convoked a "Discussion Meeting on  Army Ideological and Political Work" in Guangzhou in mid-May.  In its wake, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, the two vice chairmen  of the Central Military Commission, signed an important article  in the 26 July issue of RENMIN RIBAO, on the eve of the 66th  anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA], to discuss the extreme importance of the Army bringing  forward its fine traditions under the new situation.    The understanding of the Army shared by the CPC top echelon  is that the Army is facing a new test while China enters a  period of peacetime construction with building the socialist  market economic structure as the goal. With the development of  the market economy, officers and men will gradually enhance  their concepts of competition, effect [xiao yi 2400 4135], time,  and the legal system; all this is conducive to Army  modernization. Nevertheless, in the wake of expanding opening  up, some decadent ideas and lifestyles will seize their  opportunity to infiltrate the Army. These things, together with  some remnants of feudal ideas left over from Chinese history,  will shape into money worship, hedonism, and  ultra-individualism, which will corrupt and erode the ideals and  faith of the officers and men. There have been many examples in  Chinese and foreign history where armies became lordly, luxury-  loving, lax, and idle, indulged in pleasure, and lost their  combat effectiveness under a peaceful environment, which was  shrouded in an atmosphere of singing and dancing to extol the  good times, with civil officials indolent and military officials  frivolous. Consequently these armies were defeated by peace, and  themselves. We must draw lessons from this to avoid the  repetition of such a tragedy.    In actual fact, Deng Xiaoping advised the military top  echelons on the eve of the 14th CPC Congress in October 1992  that the Army must bring forth its fine traditions and maintain  the Red Army's true color. In the wake of the 14th CPC  Congress, Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military  Commission gave a systematic discussion on the PLA's fine  traditions, which he generalized into 10 aspects. However, the  value concepts of officers and men vary today; under conditions  where the spirit of hard struggle and selfless devotion is being  eroded, it is difficult to continue education in tradition.  Western strategists are expressing doubt about the combat  effectiveness of the PLA, which is now "looking forward to  money," and believe that should such a trend continue, worse  than that could happen.    It has been learned that the Central Military Commission has  already set forth that "arming the thinking of the broad  officers and men" with Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory is the  basic task of political work in the Army; at the same time, the  improvement of conditions and administration will be  supplemented so that officers and men might establish the  correct outlook on life, values, and ethical concepts.  Nevertheless, some military cadres who have a good inside  knowledge of the military have expressed their doubts about the  effectiveness of such an approach on the grounds that corrupt  phenomena have already become far too serious!</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (1): Strength of the Kiwi spirit - After years of stagnation, New Zealand appears to be in the early stages of an economic upturn. However, in spite of the new mood of optimism, the country is convalescing, rather than fully recovered SHROUDED IN an eerie darkness broken only by the occasional street lamp and headlight, Wellington at night is reminiscent of East European cities before the collapse of the Berlin wall. The lights are off this winter because of an acute hydro-power shortage brought on by drought, and New Zealanders are reacting with remarkable feats of conservation to avoid black-outs and short-time working. The energy crisis may strengthen the Kiwi spirit. But it could hardly be worse timed, just as a decade of economic gloom appears to be lifting. Optimism positively gushes from most of New Zealand's politicians and economic forecasters. It is of recent origin. Barely six months ago despair was ubiquitous, the country weighed down by a sense of embattled isolation given added emotional intensity - to an extent unappreciated abroad - by controversy with the US over nuclear warships visiting the country's ports. 'New Zealanders have been going through the hardest times most of them can remember,' writes Mr Bryce Harland, until recently high commissioner in London, in a trenchant study published this month*. He considers the price of independence as 'continuing deprivation, at least disappointment', with New Zealand 'more on its own than it has ever been before'. The country, he concludes, 'has become what the poet R. A. K. Mason described 70 years ago as a 'solitary hard-assaulted spot/ Fixed at the friendless outer edge of space'.' In Wellington, at any rate, such pessimism is already old hat. Last year New Zealand recorded its first current account surplus in two decades, with a strong export performance not just in primary agricultural products but also in manufactured goods. East Asian markets are growing rapidly (25 years ago the South Pacific and East Asia took a fifth of New Zealand's exports; soon it will be two-thirds). Tourism, now the country's biggest business, is booming. The three months to March saw GDP growth of 1.1 per cent, the third successive quarterly rise. This followed news that inflation rose by only 1 per cent in the year to June, the lowest rate of all 24 countries in the OECD. Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister in Mr Jim Bolger's National (right-of-centre) government, is jubilant. 'We now know we can succeed. The positive signs are here; they are unmistakable; and they are all around us.' Even old friends are coming back. President Bush's decision to remove tactical nuclear weapons from US warships may open the way to a resumption of security ties. Mr Bolger, whose party was compelled by public opinion to accept its Labour predecessor's anti-nuclear policy before the last election, is trying to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible. All that said, New Zealand is convalescing, not recovered. Its growth projections are impressive only compared to its recent past. Investment is weak. The country's export base remains comparatively narrow; and prospects for sustained improvement in its agricultural exports depend largely on a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. Not that Wellington is beyond reproach when it comes to tariffs: last month Mr Philip Burdon, the trade and industry minister, handed down a raft of 'anti-dumping' levies on imported footwear, clothing and cars. New Zealand has played an effective part in the Cairns Group, and Mr Tim Groser, its chief Gatt negotiator, is in constant orbit. But as one trade official puts it: 'There's still a lot of goodwill from Britain, but who thinks Bush and Mitterrand give a damn about us?' Above all, it will take more than a year or two of growth to overcome the legacy of the 1980s, New Zealand's most traumatic decade this century. Economic stagnation scarred a people who only 20 years before had enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world. The causes were simple enough: a collapse in prices and markets for New Zealand's narrow range of agricultural exports and a rapid deterioration in the debt and fiscal situations with dire implications for the majority of the workforce - in manufacturing and the public sector - dependent on government largesse, variously provided through subsidies, salaries, export incentives and state investment. Sir Robert Muldoon's National government vainly pretended that nothing had happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It has one great achievement to its name: the 1982 Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia, which began a rapid progress towards free trade between the two countries, from which New Zealand has been the principal gainer. The present government sees it as a model for agreements with other Asian countries. For the rest, Sir Robert paid dearly to stave off the inevitable. It was his defeat by Labour in 1984 which heralded the New Age, as most New Zealanders see it. Dubbed 'Rogernomics' after Sir Roger Douglas, the Labour finance minister who masterminded the first bout of reform, it saw market regulation swept aside, the subsidy regime axed, the public sector rationalised and its organisation turned upside down, the tax system overhauled (with a sales tax introduced and the top rate of income tax halved to 33 per cent), and a melt-down of the entire structure of import licensing and export incentives. It was little short of a revolution, justified to a sceptical Labour party and electorate as the price of recovery. When recovery failed to materialise, bitter recrimination started. Civil war erupted in the Labour party with first Sir Roger, then Mr David Lange, the prime minister, forced to quit. And in 1990 the voters took their revenge, returning National under Mr Bolger with a landslide majority. Mr Bolger, a relaxed and reassuring North Island farmer, appeared to offer an end to upheaval. But once in office, his government only intensified it. Within months Ms Richardson, an avowed admirer of Sir Roger, had taken Rogernomics into health and welfare in a self-styled 'mother of all budgets', and the Employment Contracts Act, enacted at the same time, extended it to industrial relations. A year on, the storm which greeted those two measures has largely abated, calmed by a succession of strategic retreats. But the experience has only deepened popular disillusion with the politicians. It is not just resentment about promises flagrantly broken: it is one manifestation of the acute anxiety felt by most New Zealanders about their personal prospects after a decade of stagnation and restructuring. Says Mr Lange, now a columnist: 'The fact of it is divisions in society were papered over with money from guaranteed export sales, then with borrowed money. Now these divisions are raw and sore to the point where increasing numbers of people are impatient with an existing order they see as unfair.' It is not helped by the fact that New Zealand's politicians seem to be forever campaigning. With only a three-year parliamentary term, governments are barely installed before they are fighting for their lives. The knuckles are already bare for the autumn 1993 contest. Labour - led by Mr Michael Moore, briefly prime minister at the tail-end of the last Labour government (1984-90) - is ahead in the polls. But National is narrowing the gap, buoyed by a by-election victory earlier this year in a seat widely expected to fall to the newly-formed Alliance, an electoral coalition of minor parties (Labour came a poor third). The hot money is backing Mr Bolger to renew his lease on the top-floor suite of the Beehive, the tower housing Wellington's entire cabinet. Not that much would change were he to lose. Ms Richardson's reforms have been hotly contested by Labour, but it accepts virtually all the constraints driving current policy. 'Raising the tax burden simply isn't an option', says Dr Michael Cullen, Labour's finance spokesman, mindful of the conventional wisdom that Labour's 2.5 percentage point increase in general sales tax in its last budget before the 1990 election killed the nascent recovery stone dead. However, whatever its outcome, next autumn's election is arguably of less importance to the future of New Zealand politics than the possible fall-out from a more immediate test: a national referendum on proportional representation to be held on September 19. A decision by the electorate to shift from the current first-past-the-post system to a form of PR could destroy the existing two-party system and lead to unstable, shifting coalitions. PR is expected to win in September, but it will take another referendum next year before it is introduced; and even then it will not take effect until the election after next (due in 1996). 'PR in New Zealand is Public Revulsion,' says Labour's Mr Moore. Maybe prosperity will come soon enough to reconcile Kiwis to their politicians. If it doesn't, New Zealand is in for social unrest and a period of acute constitutional turbulence. *On Our Own: New Zealand in the Emerging Tripolar World, Institute of Policy Studies, Victoria University of Wellington.</p>

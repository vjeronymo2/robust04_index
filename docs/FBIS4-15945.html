			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Chronicle" rubric: </F> "Unemployment Figure Could Rise"]    [Text] The year 1994 will possibly be considered a triumph  for the bloc of social ministries if they manage to prevent a  rise in the number of people living below the poverty line.  That was stated by Russian Federation Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov  at a press conference in Moscow. Labor Minister Gennadiy  Melikyan, who was also there, announced that according to the  figures for February, 16.7 percent of Russians were living below  the poverty line. "This is the lowest figure since 1991," he  noted. At the same time, Vice Premier Yu. Yarov noted that a  sharp increase in the number of unemployed is expected this year.</p>

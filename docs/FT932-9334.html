			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Party confident of holding the line APROPHECY in a political reference book that Christchurch could become the safest Tory seat of all is certain to be dashed in the forthcoming by-election. But there are signs that the Conservatives will be able to hold on in spite of their recent drubbing at Newbury, where a 12,000 Tory majority was turned into a 22,000 Liberal Democrat triumph. Christchurch, a pleasantly leafy constituency stretching from the Dorset coast near Bournemouth up into the New Forest, could be a much harder nut to crack for the Liberal Democrats. Mr Robert Adley, the popular, independent-minded local MP who died yesterday, held the seat at the last general election with a majority of more than 23,000, making it the sixth-safest Conservative seat in the country. In the county council elections a week ago, Dorset as a whole succumbed to the Liberal Democrats, who captured 17 seats and are now the largest party. But in the parts of the county covered by the Christchurch constituency, the Conservatives held on to all their seats. 'It must be the only Conservative constituency in the country where we didn't lose a single seat,' said a local party boss. The Liberal Democrats admit they have a poor local organisation in the area in contrast to the rest of the county, and in contrast to the experienced and effective local Conservative organisation. Mrs Judy Jamieson, Mr Adley's agent since 1984, is vice-chairman of the Conservative Agents Association and has no doubts about the outcome of a by-election contest. 'We are confident,' she said. 'The Conservatives in this constituency have a reputation for being caring and for getting things done, and I think this will count.' The constituency is divided between two local councils, Christchurch and east Dorset. In Christchurch the Conservatives have a majority of only one, but the opposition is divided between a 'rainbow alliance' of independents with no cohesion or political compatibility. 'It is a Liberal Democrat-free zone,' said Mrs Jamieson with relish. The east Dorset part of the constituency could create more problems for the Conservatives as there are 14 Tory councillors, 14 Liberal Democrats and 2 Independents. The coastal strip of the constituency is the most heavily populated and has a high proportion of retired people and pensioners. Further inland, in areas like Ferndown, West Moors and Verwood, the population is more mixed with a big influx of younger people in recent years. Dorset as a whole has had one of the fastest growing populations in the country over the past two decades. This has put some strains on local government services, especially the provision of health care for the elderly. Mr David Fox, Liberal Democrat regional organiser, believes the party will be able to put up an impressive fight in spite of the failure to capture any local county council seats. 'We still took 34 per cent of the vote and that was with a relatively poor organisation, unlike at a by-election,' he said. Labour, which trailed third with less than 7,000 votes at the general election, seems certain to be squeezed as at Newbury and faces losing its deposit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  stated that Egypt is undertaking a leading role in the Middle  East in view of its good relations with all the parties. In  this regard it is playing an important role in the peace process  to achieve stability and prosperity in the region.    President Mubarak was speaking during a meeting he held  today  with a delegation of the American Association of Chief Editors  of Newspapers and Magazines, which includes 14 chief editors and  publishers from various parts of the United States.    Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the Presidential Press  Office, stated that President Mubarak described U.S.-Egyptian  relations as good.    President Mubarak said the peace agreement between the  Palestinians and the Israelis was just a start and that Egypt is  doing its utmost to achieve stability in this part of the world.    President Mubarak stressed that peace has become a  necessity.  After it is achieved, numerous marginal problems could be  solved. He explained that Egypt's firm goal is to establish  peace and security in the region, offering prosperity to  everyone.    Asked about Egyptian-Iranian relations, President Mubarak  said that since coming to power, he has wanted to maintain good  relations with every country. But the Iranians have policies of  their own.    President Mubarak reaffirmed that terrorism has no future in  Egypt and Egypt embraces many Arab institutions and acts  according to the law and Constitution. We abide by the law, he  said.    He noted: We could have ended terrorism within a few days  had we resorted to emergency measures. But we abide by the law.  We are encouraged that all the popular factions are against  terrorism and do not sympathize with it. Citizens' reports on  the terrorists and their activities were a primary factor in  uncovering and arresting them.    'Abd-al-Mun'im said that President Mubarak emphasized that  religions are a very sensitive issue, adding that the  establishment of religious parties must be avoided and noting  that the extremists do not seek democracy. Ultimately they want  to establish their own style of dictatorship, he said.    President Mubarak explained that he is not against anyone  but  always works for stability and security.    Regarding U.S. aid, President Mubarak said: We know the aid  will not continue forever. We need this aid for a few more  years until peace is established throughout the area. We use  most of this aid to strengthen the Armed Forces. He noted that  many security problems exist in the area.    The president also dealt with the population issue. He  affirmed that the birth rate has recently dropped and noted that  he has drawn attention to this problem because it constitutes a  real threat to the state. He also noted that the popular  response has been positive.    In response to a question on tourism, President Mubarak  said that the number of tourists dropped after the Gulf war and  increased after the acts of violence by terrorists. [sentence as  received] He noted that there is now a noticeable improvement  as everyone realizes that the wave of violence, which is  supported by certain foreign countries, has ebbed. He stressed  that Egypt is firm on dealing with terrorism within the  framework of legitimacy and law. He pointed out that efforts of  those who are trying to threaten Egypt are to no avail. He  discussed the domestic situation since he assumed power and  reviewed the great projects in the fields of infrastructure,  transport, energy, housing, schools, factories, and new cities.    'Abd-al-Mun'im said that in his meeting with the U.S. press  delegation, President Mubarak touched on investment in Egypt and  explained the removal of numerous obstacles, the last of which  was exempting investors from routine measures, which will cost  the government 10 million pounds. He noted that these steps  have greatly encouraged investment and that three months after  making this decision, 180 projects were begun in Suhaj and other  areas in Upper Egypt.    In discussing the water problem and its scarcity on regional  and international levels, President Mubarak stressed that if  peace does not prevail, frictions and conflicts may flare up  because of water scarcity. He noted that Egypt is using its  water resources in the best possible way.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders confirm QMH Pounds 2bn limit Shareholders of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group in talks with its banks over refinancing its Pounds 1.3bn of debt, yesterday confirmed the group's borrowing limit of Pounds 2bn at two special meetings. Some shareholders used the meeting to ask questions about indemnity insurance for the company's directors. Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, refused to answer these questions saying they were outside the scope of the meeting, but said it was normal for large public companies to take out insurance covering directors against liability. Mr John Bairstow, the group's former chairman, said later that when he was in charge at QMH the group's indemnity cover of Pounds 10m cost Pounds 34,000 a year. The premium is now reputed to be Pounds 700,000. This would reflect the substantial change in the group's position with massive losses, the shares suspended, a department of trade and industry investigation proceeding and threats of litigation. Mr Bairstow changed his vote at the meeting. In advance of the meeting he had voted his 8m shares against the resolution by proxy but in the poll taken at the meeting he voted in favour. At the meetings Mr Metcalfe said the group's results for 1993, which will incorporate a new property valuation, should be completed by the end of April. He said the restructuring talks were progressing, and the foundations for a reconstruction were being laid. He said he was sorry it was taking so long but there were a number of complex issues involved. He hoped that the shares, which were suspended in March last year, would be relisted as soon as shareholders approved the restructuring.</p>

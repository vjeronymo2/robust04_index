			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Weak dollar complicates Greenspan's task: Michael Prowse on market-created tensions on the eve of Fed chairman's House testimony Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, faces an unusually difficult challenge in today's testimony before the House of Representatives budget committee. Gobal financial markets will be looking for signals that the Fed is willing to take tough measures to defend the dollar, which has plunged on foreign exchange markets in recent days. Many investors believe the Fed must tighten monetary policy another notch and lead another round of global intervention to support the US currency. Yet Mr Greenspan's Capitol Hill audience will not be greatly concerned that the dollar has fallen through key support levels against the yen and D-Mark. Legislators worry about domestic growth and jobs; they care about dollar weakness only to the extent that it pushes up long bond yields and thus threatens to depress US economic activity. Many are still not convinced the increases in short-term interest rates announced earlier this year were necessary, and worry that the tighter policy is already retarding growth. The views of senior administration officials fall somewhere between these two extremes. They certainly want to avoid a dollar free fall, yet they see no reason why domestic US economic policy should be dictated by fleeting shifts of mood in global financial markets. But for the turmoil in markets, US policymakers would probably feel fairly relaxed. Most forecasters believe the underlying pace of economic growth is moderating from an annual rate of about 5 per cent in the second half of last year to a more sustainable 3 to 3.5 per cent. Some believe growth could slow to an annual rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the second half of this year, in line with the economy's long-run potential. At the same time, despite increases in commodity prices, there is little hard evidence of strong upward pressure on inflation. The administration view is that nearly all components of demand point to more moderate growth. Consumer spending must decelerate because consumption outpaced personal incomes last year, sharply depressing the savings rate. Housing will provide less of a boost because the sharp increase in mortgage rates since February is reducing consumer demand. Growth of business investment will remain healthy but must moderate somewhat since spending on information processing equipment cannot grow at double-digit rates indefinitely. Government spending will remain weak, reflecting continuing efforts to reduce the federal deficit. Net exports are likely to remain an economic drag at least until early next year because the US is still growing more rapidly than most of its trading partners. Several recent reports appeared to support this comforting prognosis of steady, but not worryingly rapid growth. Retail sales fell in April and May. Housing starts have failed to regain last year's peaks. Growth of industrial production has slowed sharply. Figures yesterday showed a decline in exports in April and an increase in the trade deficit. But administration officials admit the economic picture is blurred. The jobless rate has fallen far more rapidly than anybody expected - to 6 per cent in May against 7 per cent in December. This puts it at or below most estimates of the natural or 'non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (Nairu)'. In the late 1980s inflation began to rise quite rapidly once unemployment fell below the Nairu. But officials say the data may be misleading because the way unemployment is measured has recently been changed. Since payroll employment is also growing rapidly, estimates of output based on projections of hours worked and productivity point to much faster growth than suggested by the spending data. Hours worked, for example, point to real growth at an annual rate of 6 to 7 per cent in the second quarter, more than double the pace indicated by expenditure estimates. On domestic grounds, Mr Greenspan probably regards further increases in short-term rates as desirable but not yet an urgent priority. He is probably less confident than the administration that growth is slowing to a sustainable pace and more worried about the inflation outlook: producer prices, for example, rose at an annual rate of more than 3 per cent in the first five months, a sharp acceleration from last year. Leading indicators suggest consumer price inflation could rise this autumn. The dollar's weakness, however, complicates matters. Last month, the Treasury signalled that it cared about the dollar's absolute value, not just its rate of change against other currencies. It wanted to do more, in short, than maintain 'orderly' conditions in currency markets. Yet on a longer view, the administration believes that currencies must reflect economic fundamentals, including differences in relative inflation rates. It may thus feel ambivalent about defending any particular nominal exchange rate for fear this would provide a one-way bet for speculators - rather as Britain did when it tried to maintain an unrealistic parity against the D-Mark. History suggests US policy will be geared mainly to the needs of the domestic economy. Mixed signals on growth and inflation suggest the Fed will raise short-term rates again but perhaps not as aggressively as demanded by some global investors. The Treasury and Fed will try to keep currency markets off balance by intervening to support the dollar when least expected. But while anxious to prevent erratic currency shifts, it is not yet clear that US officials put the same priority on exchange rate stability as their colleagues in more open, and thus more vulnerable, European economies.</p>

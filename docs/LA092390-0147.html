			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LACK OF LEADERSHIP COSTS OCCIDENTAL IN A 28-10 LOSS  </P> <P> Occidental College had no answer for Azusa Pacific quarterback Brian Hunt in a  28-10 nonconference football loss Saturday night at Occidental.  </P> <P> Hunt, the second-leading passer in the NAIA Division II ranks, completed 19 of  37 passes for 240 yards and one touchdown. The senior from Glendora also ran  for touchdowns of two and six yards.  </P> <P> "He's a really, really good player, I can't imagine we'll see a better player  than him," Occidental Coach Dale Widolff said.  </P> <P> Not only was Occidental unable to pressure Hunt in the last three quarters, nor  cover his many receivers, the Tiger offense could not move the ball after the  opening drive.  </P> <P> Occidental (1-2) scored first on its only sustained drive of the first half.  Brian Madlangbayan, a 5-foot-6 scatback, scooted outside and found running room  on the second play of the drive for a 20-yard gain. Madlangbayan carried three  more times for 11 yards and freshman quarterback Derrick Williams picked up  four yards on a keeper. But Williams could not convert on third-and-seven from  the seven so Occidental settled for a 27-yard field goal by Mark Collinsworth.  </P> <P> Though Williams was impressive last week in a 38-13 win over Whittier, he  lacked a passing touch against Azusa Pacific (2-1).  </P> <P> When the left-hander had time to throw, he overshot his receivers. And when he  was chased out of the pocket, he underthrew them.  </P> <P> With eight minutes 18 seconds left in the first half, Williams was replaced by  junior John Selle. Williams hit on two of seven passes for seven yards before  leaving.  </P> <P> Williams started the second half, but after two possessions without a first  down, he was replaced again by Selle, who threw an interception with 1:59 left  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Selle finished with two completions in 10 attempts and had two passes  intercepted. Williams completed four-of-14 for 25 yards. It took third-string  quarterback Scott Thompson to bring the Tigers a touchdown. His 36-yard pass to  Charles Jordan set up his 1-yard touchdown keeper with two seconds left to  account for the 28-10 final.  </P> <P> "Derrick Williams is a great talent," Widolff said. "He can do some great  things. But he can also make some bad plays and we have to hope there's more  good plays than bad ones."  </P> <P> Widolff doesn't feel as though he has to name one of them his starter and stick  with him.  </P> <P> Widolff hadn't given consideration to adding Thompson to the mix until he saw  Thompson lead the Tigers to their only touchdown. The junior transfer from  Butte College completed three of four passes for 67 yards.  </P> <P> "That is his history," Widolff said. "You look at him and there's nothing  special, but he gets the job done. That (playing Thompson) is something we may  have to consider."  </P></p>

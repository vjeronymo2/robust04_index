			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / New Delhi to press ahead with reform INDIA plans further substantial reforms over the next three years, according to a Finance Ministry discussion paper marking the first two years of the government's economic restructuring programme. The document - Economic Reforms: Two Years After and the Task Ahead - says a number of further measures are needed to remove disincentives to exports, including the phasing out of quantitative restrictions on exports and reductions in the customs duty structure. The 1991 payments crisis which triggered the reforms underlined India's vulnerability on the external payments front, it says. 'Rapid export growth is the only sure way of achieving self-reliance, enabling us to finance our import needs without excessive reliance on foreign borrowing.' Among the changes planned are further cuts in subsidies, a more flexible approach to prices administered by the government, a move to a simpler tax structure with a broader base, greater emphasis on primary education and basic health, and faster reform of the financial sector. However, the ministry is restrained on plans for privatisation, a sensitive political issue. It says there is 'considerable merit' in a proposal for a committee on restructuring and disinvestment in public sector enterprises. Among the committee's tasks would be to detect incipient financial problems in the enterprises, and to shut down those which were irretrievably loss-making. It highlights a problem in the implementation of industrial reforms: although the central government has removed many restrictions on industrial investment and production, these are still pervasive in many states. 'The requirements for licences, permits and inspections at state and local level continue to be onerous and extract a heavy toll in terms of effort and resources from industrial units,' the report says. Companies face difficulties in obtaining land, water and electricity. To achieve its goal of reducing the central government's fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, the ministry plans further cuts in fertiliser, food and energy subsidies. User charges for basic services such as electricity, irrigation, road transport and non-primary education must be raised progressively. Where prices for services such as power and transport continue to be administered by the government, they should be changed frequently to prevent build-up of losses. The ministry aims in the long term to introduce a value-added tax, but says this requires constitutional changes on the allocation of taxation powers between New Delhi and state governments.

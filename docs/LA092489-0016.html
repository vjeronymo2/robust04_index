			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COCKTAILS AND CONGA LINES;  </P> <P> HOSTESS JEAN HOWARD'S PARTY SHOTS CAUGHT HOLLYWOOD OFF GUARD IN A MORE  GLAMOROUS AGE  </P> <P> THE LOW, SPRAWLING Spanish-style house, hidden by tall hedges along Coldwater  Canyon, has been the scene of some of Hollywood's most glamorous parties. The  stars who passed through its doors included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh,  Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon,  Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and Judy Garland. For more than half  a century, it has been the home of Jean Howard (above), legendary hostess,  professional photographer and chronicler of stars at play when Hollywood was  still a small, close-knit town. She has brought together her experiences in  "Jean Howard's Hollywood," a book of her photographs from the early 1930s to  the early '60s to be published by Harry N. Abrams next month.  </P> <P> "I think of Hollywood as a person," says Howard, seated in her living room,  which retains the chinoiserie accents and tortoise-shell-paneled pedestals that  were the trademarks of Hollywood's premier decorator, former silent star  William Haines. "In the '30s, Hollywood was still sort of a teen-ager and was  still growing up in the '40s. Hollywood came into its own in the '50s -- really  achieved its maturity. I call them the Nifty '50s."  </P> <P> Howard, now 78, became a witness to that history when she came to Hollywood  from Dallas in 1930 to break into movies. She became a Ziegfeld girl and an MGM  starlet but gave up acting after her marriage to super-agent Charles Feldman in  1934. Although they were divorced in 1946, she and Feldman remained friends and  continued to host parties together. In the mid-'40s, Howard studied photography  at the Art Center in Los Angeles; later, she won assignments from such  magazines as Life and Vogue to cover films in production and shot portraits of  such great '50s stars as Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. All the while, Howard  kept up with her busy international social life as seasoned party-giver and  party-goer.  </P> <P> While looking at the photographs in Howard's book, it is difficult not to be  dazzled by the sheer glamour of her celebrated subjects, captured so  unobtrusively with her camera. She assures you that her friends were as relaxed  as they seem in the pictures. It's also difficult to ignore two elements that  date the photographs: the omnipresent cigarettes, and the dress, formal even  for casual lawn parties. "People dressed reasonably," Howard says. "In those  days, men always wore jackets and ties in the evening, and the girls wore  cocktail dresses.  </P> <P> "I think Hollywood parties today are purely for publicity," Howard says, "but  our parties were purely for fun. They were usually on Saturday night, so you  had Sunday to get over them. If there were parties on Sunday, they were always  early, because everybody had to get up on Monday morning and go to work."  </P> <P> Certain parties stand out in Howard's memory. "One of them was a most wonderful  tea dance George Cukor gave for Vivien Leigh," she says. "It began at 4  o'clock, and he had found enough good-looking single fellows who could dance,  and not one woman was left sitting down. The husbands could go off and talk  business, and we women could dance and dance.  </P> <P> "Jack Warner had a party almost every Sunday night, and they were my favorites.  You would see some rushes and a movie. Jack was the first to have a screen that  came up from the floor. Jack didn't just show Warners pictures but the best  movies before they were released, and nobody was allowed to comment during the  movie."  </P> <P> During the 1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles, Howard received a phone  call from Pat Lawford, John F. Kennedy's sister: "Jean, I'm in a terrible spot.  Jack suggested I call you. Jack would like to see a lot of people, and we  haven't enough room." Howard told Lawford that there would be "no problem" and  hastily assembled 60 members of Hollywood's elite to honor the next President.  </P> <P> "The party ended at around 4 in the morning, and as I was straightening up, I  heard a scratch on the window. It was Jack. He said that every place was closed  and asked if I could scramble him some eggs. I did, of course, and we talked  till dawn.  </P> <P> "Charlie was a great friend of Jack's, and later on, we were invited to the  White House. I think Jack was paying me back for the scrambled eggs. . . . I  couldn't very well take my camera to the White House, but Jack said, 'Why don't  you photograph me? After all, I am the President.' "  </P> <P> Howard intended to take the President up on his offer, but history intervened,  and for her, as for many others, his assassination brought an end to a carefree  era.  </P> <P> Photographs copyright 1989 Jean Howard.

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SURE-FOOTED;  </P> <P> ARREOLA STRIDES CONFIDENTLY IN MIDDLE DISTANCES AND HER PERSONAL LIFE  </P> <P> It was a gift from her grandparents when Darcy Arreola was a junior in high  school.  </P> <P> And the "Born to Run" necklace that the Cal State Northridge junior wears  describes her now -- she is one of the nation's finest young middle-distance  runners -- as accurately as it did in 1986 when she won the state high school  title in the 1,600 meters and was ranked second in that event in Track and  Field News' national high school rankings.  </P> <P> While running is still Arreola's top priority, her reasons for competing have  changed since high school.  </P> <P> Running served as an escape for Arreola then. Enjoyment and satisfaction keep  her going now.  </P> <P> "I liked going out there and running every day by myself, because at my house  there were four kids," said Arreola, who will run in the semifinals of the  1,500 meters in The Athletics Congress track and field championships tonight at  the University of Houston. "I shared a room with two sisters and I never had  any time to myself. I think I liked running so much because it allowed me some  time to be with myself."  </P> <P> These days, Arreola, 20, spends much of her time with her boyfriend, Dan Lange,  who won the hammer throw for Northridge in the 1987 and '88 California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships.  </P> <P> "Before, running was all I had," said Arreola, who placed third in the 1,500 in  the NCAA Division I championships two weeks ago. "But now, I have a serious  boyfriend and that's helped me to relax. There's more to my life than just  running. . . . I still want to win as badly as before, but I have something  else, which makes it more fun."  </P> <P> Her athletic success also has helped transform Arreola from a painfully shy  girl into a fairly gregarious woman.  </P> <P> Arreola wouldn't talk to her teachers in elementary and junior high school, and  she was "terrified" when reporters interviewed her in high school. Now she  smiles and laughs when interviewed.  </P> <P> "They used to tell me in high school that I was the worst interview," said  Arreola, who has earned eight NCAA Division II All-American certificates in  track and cross-country. "I was so afraid of talking to reporters back then. It  was scary. Now, it's a lot easier because I'm used to talking to people.  </P> <P> "That's what got me over my fear. I was forced to talk to people. I couldn't  just walk away."  </P> <P> Lange, 24, has noticed a big change in Darcy's personality since he was  introduced to her in 1987.  </P> <P> "She was just a very shy, little girl when I met her," Lange said. "It took me  about a year to get to know her before I asked her out. . . . She just has a  lot more confidence now in herself and her ability to express her feelings.  She's better at communicating with people and it's helped her confidence."  </P> <P> Arreola attributes some of her childhood shyness to a family tragedy. Her  mother was killed when she was 3 years old, after which she, her two sisters  and brother were raised by her grandfather, Fernando Arreola, and his second  wife, Diane.  </P> <P> "She was known as the little girl who didn't speak to anyone," Diane Arreola  said. "She was the little shy one of the family. Her brother and sisters were  much more outgoing than she was."  </P> <P> Said Darcy: "Although I don't remember anything, it had to have affected me.  Perhaps me worse than my brother and sisters. If I saw a 3-year-old kid  suddenly put in a new home -- a completely different environment -- I would  expect it to have an effect on that kid."  </P> <P> Arreola's older brother Paul introduced her to running when she was in  elementary school. After she graduated from junior high in 1982, he agreed to  buy her running shoes and clothing if she continued in high school. He also  promised to continue a tradition of buying her doughnuts after she won races.  </P> <P> "I did pretty well when I was a little kid," Arreola said. "Although I never  trained. I just ran the races and whenever I won, I got my doughnuts, and  thought, 'cool.' "  </P> <P> After being ineligible her freshman year at La Mesa Grossmont High because she  lived in the district of another high school, Arreola became serious about  running in her sophomore season after winning the 800 meters in 2 minutes, 13  seconds at the Grossmont League finals, and, a few weeks later, the San Diego  Section 800 title in 2:16.  </P> <P> "It was a big surprise," she said. "But it made me think, 'Hey, I could be good  if I started training more.' "  </P> <P> After training diligently in the summer of 1984, Arreola reaped the benefits in  her junior season, winning section titles in cross-country and in the 1,600.  She placed second in the 800 and third in the 1,600 at the state championships  and ran bests of 2:09.06 in the 800, 4:38.6 in the 1,500 and 4:56.43 in the  1,600.  </P> <P> As a senior, she successfully defended her section cross-country and 1,600  titles, ran 4:23.9 in the 1,500 and 4:42.77 to win the 1,600 in the state  championships.  </P> <P> She intended to run for San Diego State that fall but was informed on a  recruiting trip to Arizona that she had failed to meet Proposition 48  requirements in core curriculum classes, having completed only 1 1/2 years of  science classes when two were required.  </P> <P> "I had never heard of Proposition 48 until then," Arreola said. "My counselors  didn't know what it was and neither did my coaches."  </P> <P> Having been mistakenly told that she couldn't make up the required units in  summer school, Arreola considered going to Grossmont College before Division II  schools Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Northridge entered the picture. She  initially favored San Luis Obispo over CSUN, but when Northridge Coach Don  Strametz expressed more interest in her than Mustang Coach Lance Harter, she  became a Matador.  </P> <P> Harter's loss was Strametz's gain. It enable him to work with a Division  I-caliber athlete at a Division II school. But he has been wary of abusing the  privilege.  </P> <P> "If anything, she is undertrained," Strametz said. "Judging by what I have seen  and what I have read, her best years are way down the line. She's not going to  run her best times until she's in her late twenties. . . . My goal is to have  her graduate from here with a healthy body so that she's capable of doing  that."  </P> <P> Arreola had a superb freshman season, placing 11th in the Division II  cross-country championships in Riverside, running 2:05.73 in the 800 and  4:15.35 in the 1,500, and finishing second in both events at the Division II  meet in Cape Girardeau, Mo. She concluded her season with a 10th-place finish  in the 1,500 at the TAC meet in San Jose.  </P> <P> Her progress has been painstakingly slow since then, however.  </P> <P> Although she won Division II titles in both the 1,500 and 3,000 -- in which she  has a personal best of 9:13.2 -- in San Angelo, Tex., as a sophomore, Arreola  failed for the first time to lower her 1,500 best (running 4:15.39) during the  season.  </P> <P> "It was frustrating," she said. "Because I had always improved a lot each  season until then. . . . I was in shape to run a lot faster than I did last  year."  </P> <P> According to Strametz, Arreola had a legitimate shot at nabbing the third and  final place on the 1988 U. S. Olympic team, but she ran poorly in the trials in  Indianapolis -- finishing 11th in a semifinal (4:18.48) -- and failed to  qualify for the final.  </P> <P> "She was in 4:05 or 4:06 shape," Strametz said. "But she just didn't run well.  It was the end of a long year. It had been 10 1/2 months with no breaks since  she started the cross-country season. And she was scared. She felt that she  didn't belong at that level."  </P> <P> Arreola concurred with her coach, saying that she was confident of running well  at the trials until she stepped to the starting line in her qualifying heat.  </P> <P> "I was just like, 'No way, these girls are just way better than me,' " said  Arreola, who won the 3,000 and placed second in the 1,500 (personal best of  4:14.15) in last month's Division II meet in Hampton, Va. "I didn't feel like I  belonged there. . . . Looking back, it was stupid. I had as much right to be  there as anyone."  </P> <P> Strametz hopes that the experience of last year's trials and this year's  Division I and II meets has taught Arreola a lesson.  </P> <P> "She is very conscious of splits and at times that's caused some problems,"  Strametz said. "She always wants to run fast. She needs to worry less about  certain times and more about just competing. She competed at the Division II  meet and she ran a (personal record), even though she probably didn't expect  to. She competed at the Division I meet and although she died in the last 300,  she competed."  </P> <P> Ah, yes, the last 300 meters of a race, the bane of Arreola's racing career at  Northridge.  </P> <P> Never the strong point of her race, her kick was particularly weak in the  Division I meet, which was held in the rarefied air at Brigham Young  University, 4,549 feet above sea level.  </P> <P> Running stride for stride with Wisconsin junior Suzy Favor at the 1,200-meter  mark, Arreola watched helplessly as Favor (4:15.83) surged away in the final  300 meters, and as Rosalind Taylor (4:21.97) of Maryland swooped past her in  the final 10 meters of the race.  </P> <P> "I was really into that race mentally, but I just slowed down so much in the  last lap," said Arreola (4:22.40), who ran a 58.4 final 300 after averaging 68  seconds per 400 for the first three laps. "With a lap to go, I was thinking,  'relax, relax.' I was feeling so good -- and it felt so easy -- that I was  thinking, 'I can win this.' But when she took off, I just tensed up and started  to slow down. When (Taylor) passed me, I just thought, 'OK, come on, where are  the rest?' "  </P> <P> Strametz attributed Arreola's demise to the altitude. He said that many of the  runners -- such as Favor -- had been in Provo for two weeks prior to the meet,  which allowed them to become better acclimated to the elevation than Arreola,  who flew into town a day before she ran in the semifinals.  </P> <P> "With a 300 to go, it looked like someone had erected a brick wall in lane 1  1/2 and she hit it and Favor went through on the inside," he said.  </P> <P> Altitude notwithstanding, Arreola learned from that race that she must improve  her upper body strength to become one of the nation's top runners. "Stram told  me that in the past," Arreola said, "and I know he's right now. I mean, you  look at the other girls and I look a lot weaker than them."  </P> <P> Strametz said that the 5-foot-6, 108-pound Arreola needs to increase her  workout weight in the bench press from 90 pounds to 120.  </P> <P> Serious weightlifting will have to come later in the year, however, as Arreola  could be racing in late August if things go well this weekend. If she places  among the top two collegians at TAC, she will qualify for the World University  Games in Duisburg, West Germany, Aug. 22-30.  </P> <P> "I just want her to compete this week," Strametz said. "If she competes, I  think we're both going to come back with big smiles."  </P> <P> Characteristically, Arreola is looking for a fast time.  </P> <P> "I think I'm in shape to run under 4:10, but I could live with a 4:11," she  said, laughing. "Four-fourteen is just not doing it."  </P></p>

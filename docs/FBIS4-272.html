			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The report by a working committee, saying that  an election cannot take place under the present circumstances in  KwaZulu, is receiving strong opposition. A joint working  committee comprising members of the Independent Electoral  Commission, officials of the kwaZulu government, the South  African Department of Home Affairs, and the South African  Police, jointly recommended that the present climate in kwaZulu  would not make a free and fair election possible in kwaZulu.  [passage omitted]    The Office of the State President says the government has  taken note of the working committee's view that political  measures are necessary in kwaZulu and adds that talks between  State President de Klerk, Mr. Nelson Mandela, King Goodwill  Zwelithini, and Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, will offer the  opportunity of finding a solution to these problems.

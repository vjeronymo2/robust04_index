			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Beyond Japan's trade surplus JAPAN'S swelling trade surplus, which is on course to return to mid-1980s proportions this year, will, regrettably, guarantee a tense run-up to July's summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Tokyo. The surplus continues to provide a red rag to the same US protectionist bulls responsible for yesterday's anti-dumping tariffs on steel imports. But the Japanese government can pre-empt these complaints. It is stagnant imports into Japan that are swelling the surplus; domestic stimulation is the best way to stem the tide. Japan's export performance has, in fact, been rather disappointing recently. US not Japanese industry has better demonstrated how to soften the blow of a fall in domestic demand by shifting production abroad. US export volumes grew by 5.8 per cent in the year to the third quarter of last year while Japanese exports grew by just 1.2 per cent over the same period. But US import volumes rose by 9.2 per cent while Japanese imports fell by 4.4 per cent. These trends are likely to continue over the coming year. An accelerating US recovery, alongside a sluggish world economy, will mean a rising US trade deficit. Meanwhile, yesterday's news confirms that the slump in Japanese consumer confidence and spending is deepening. Department store sales fell by 3 per cent in 1992 and 5.7 per cent in December, compared with a year earlier. Naturally, Japan's bureaucrats are nervous about stoking up the economy merely to stave off international trade pressures. Excessively low interest rates in the late 1980s were to blame for the subsequent inflation. But domestic considerations now demand a looser policy stance. Bank lending remains sluggish, industrial output fell last month by 8.2 per cent on the previous year and the high level of unsold inventories shows no sign of falling. A recovery in private domestic demand is many months away, despite the official view that recovery is imminent. A further, and sizeable, cut in the official discount rate is long overdue. But there is little chance that interest rate cuts alone will persuade Japanese industry to start investing; and debt-burdened banks will not be able to start lending again for years. The priority for the Bank of Japan must be to tackle these bad debts directly, before profit-taking pushes the stock market down further. For rapid results, Japan needs a fast, and easily reversible, fiscal stimulation. Reversibility argues for public spending over tax cuts; speed is best achieved by accelerating planned public works spending into the first half of the year so that the coming financial year's austere budget can be bolstered by a supplementary budget announced at July's G7 summit. Rather than pandering to the protectionist lobby, President Bill Clinton could then present a US budget deficit-reducing package as a mutually beneficial G7 deal.</p>

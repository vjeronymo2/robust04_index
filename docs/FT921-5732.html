			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott publishes motorists' charter - Transport LABOUR yesterday sought to counter suggestions that it is the anti-car party by publishing a charter for motorists. The 31-point plan, produced after consultation with motoring organisations, sets out proposals for giving better consumer protection to motorists and tightening up on road safety. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said private motor cars were 'an indispensable and inescapable fact in the quality of life of millions of people in modern Britain'. He denied suggestions that an incoming Labour government would axe the Department of Transport's Pounds 20bn roads programme to pay for a big increase in spending on public transport: 'What we are talking about is a six-month moratorium on the placing of new road-building contracts to give us time to decide a new order of priorities.' Labour would replace separate planning for investment in roads, railways and air transport with a single transport infrastructure programme spanning 20 years. Common criteria would be adopted when deciding which means of transport to invest in. Most important of these would be improving mobility, reducing environmental damage and relieving congestion. For car users, proposals in the motorists' charter include: A central record of the make and model of vehicles involved in accidents, so figures can be used to rank the safety of different cars. Insurance companies should be required to notify all accident claims to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre. Prospective purchasers of second-hand cars would then be able to check a vehicle's history for a small fee. Vehicle mileages should also be notified to the DVLC when they are MoT tested. It should be illegal to use a hand-held mobile telephone while driving. Tax incentives on company cars would probably be phased out. Labour argues this would lower the price of new cars to private buyers by eliminating big fleet purchases. Quality Motoring. The Labour Party, 150 Walworth Road, London SE17 1JL. Free.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS SACRIFICE SELVES TO PROTECT CASTE PRIVILEGE;  </P> <P> INDIA: SCORES OF MIDDLE-CLASS YOUTHS HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE TO PROTEST OPENING  MORE JOBS TO THE POOR.  </P> <P> Monica Chadha, a 19-year-old student, looked up from her morning newspaper,  which described a rash of protest suicides by Indian teen-agers, and announced  that she was going to kill herself.  </P> <P> Monica "told us she was going to burn herself to death -- just like that," her  elder sister Sonia recalled the other day.  </P> <P> "I told her, 'Monica, come on, you're joking.' And she said, 'No, it's not a  joke. I am very serious. If all these other boys and girls can sacrifice  themselves like this to shout down the policies of this prime minister, then I  will sacrifice my life as well.' "  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Monica kept her word. As her family went back to their  breakfast and a lighthearted movie on television, she went out to the terrace,  poured gasoline over herself, lit a match -- and turned so she could be seen by  those, including her father, Gulshan, who were attending a nearby political  rally against Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh.  </P> <P> It took Monica Chadha 10 days to die. But as her life ebbed away Wednesday  night, she mumbled repeatedly: "Today, I want to teach a lesson to V. P. Singh.  I am proud of what I have done."  </P> <P> Monica Chadha is just one of more than 150 middle-class Indian students and  teen-agers who in the past month have attempted to kill themselves by  immolation, poisoning or hanging. Nearly half have succeeded.  </P> <P> All have done so with the stated purpose of protesting Prime Minister Singh's  controversial policy of altering India's ancient Hindu caste system -- a  "positive discrimination" order that dims the future for high-caste families  like the Chadhas by reserving 27% more government jobs and university  placements for India's downtrodden lower castes.  </P> <P> The order has touched off mass demonstrations that rival anything seen in New  Delhi since the assassination six years ago of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  Repeatedly, police have opened fire on demonstrators.  </P> <P> "Only V.P. Singh is responsible for my death," wrote one student, Sushil Kumar,  before he swallowed a lethal dose of insecticide in Haryana state. And in the  state of Punjab, Narinder Kaur hanged herself and left a note in which she  donated her eyes to the prime minister "so that he can see better for himself  the misery 'the report' has brought upon the student community."  </P> <P> The 900-page report she referred to was drafted more than a decade ago by a  commission headed by B. P. Mandal, a member of Parliament. Although it was  written while Indira Gandhi was prime minister, neither she nor her son and  successor, Rajiv Gandhi, could muster the political consensus or will to  implement its findings.  </P> <P> According to unconfirmed reports, Indira Gandhi wrote on her copy of the Mandal  report: "If these are implemented, there will be civil war."  </P> <P> Not until the renegade politician Vishwanath Pratap Singh came to power a year  ago, at the head of a minority government promising a new political order, was  any action taken to carry out Mandal's proposal for a quota system.  </P> <P> On Aug. 30, Singh put the system into effect, declaring that it was time the  upper castes surrendered some of their power and prestige to what are  officially called "Other Backward Classes." These are the lower castes,  estimated to number 3,743, that are officially identified in the Indian  constitution.  </P> <P> The quota concept is not new. For four decades, since the present constitution  was adopted, 22.5% of all government jobs and university slots have been  reserved for India's Untouchables, the non-caste Hindus whom Mohandas K.  (Mahatma) Gandhi renamed harijans in his campaign to liberate them from  centuries of oppression.  </P> <P> But Singh ordered that the quotas now would apply to low-caste Hindus as well,  a step that in effect more than doubles the number of beneficiaries. This sent  shock waves through the emerging middle- and lower-middle classes, which are  dominated by the three Hindu groups considered upper caste -- the Brahmins, the  Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas.  </P> <P> What is more, the new Mandal quotas came amid a rush of consumerism,  materialism and unprecedented pressure for upward mobility in the middle class,  which is believed to account for 20% of the population and which relies heavily  on government placements to build their fortunes.  </P> <P> Instantly, the protests began. Student leaders at New Delhi University quickly  formed the Anti-Mandal Commission Forum and took to the streets in  demonstrations that often ended in bloody clashes with police. And the protests  spread rapidly to other states where the upper castes are dominant in a  spontaneous, though largely uncoordinated, national movement.  </P> <P> Few politicians were willing to take up the cause. Privately, most of Singh's  opponents and independent analysts alike have charged that the prime minister's  order was a blatantly political attempt to build personal support.  </P> <P> They note that the lower castes affected by the quota system account for 52% of  the Indian population, and they emphasize that Singh, now dangerously close to  losing key coalition partners that keep his minority government in power, needs  this power base to remain in office.  </P> <P> "V. P. Singh, by these reservations, has created for himself a very large  majority vote almost overnight," said Lokesh Chandra, a Hindu scholar who heads  the International Academy of Indian Culture.  </P> <P> "It's a political masterstroke, and if a few children have sacrificed  themselves, what does it matter? It sounds cynical, but in reality no  politician can speak out against the Mandal commission and survive."  </P> <P> Bharat Wariavwalla, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Center for the Study of  Developing Societies, agreed, saying:  </P> <P> "For whatever reasons V. P. Singh has taken this step, and I agree they were  probably cynical ones, the fact remains that it is the most important and  symbolic assault on the caste system since Mahatma Gandhi staged his fast until  death on behalf of the harijans in 1931.  </P> <P> "And today, for the first time, no one -- absolutely no politician with any  ambitions for the future -- can appear to be anything but committed to the  reservations system in the Mandal report."  </P> <P> Wariavwalla likened the quota system to the quotas for blacks that were  introduced amid similar controversy during the civil rights campaign in the  United States. Now, he said, Singh must take harder and more fundamental  economic steps, such as land reform and liberalization of the private sector,  if the move is to be more than symbolic.  </P> <P> Public pressure on Singh to implement such sweeping economic reforms is not  likely to ease in the coming months. For while the politicians have been  silent, the increasingly vocal middle class -- students and parents -- have  not.  </P> <P> It was the first teen-age suicide attempt that ignited the students' flagging  movement, on Sept. 19, at a rally in New Delhi. When it appeared that the  politicians were ignoring the students, Rajiv Goswami, 19, suddenly doused  himself with kerosene and set himself ablaze. As the flames licked around him,  he whispered that his motive was to rekindle a movement that "would have died  out . . . without this sacrifice."  </P> <P> Goswami lived, although he is still listed in critical condition in a New Delhi  burn ward. But scores of teen-agers who followed his example have not.  </P> <P> In what Indian psychologists describe as a series of copycat suicides, boys and  girls throughout north India have joined in at a rate of two or three a day.  </P> <P> Most have been upper-caste, middle-class students, but psychologists and others  insist that the quota system is merely one small piece in a mosaic of  frustration brought on by the wave of consumerism and capitalist ambition.  </P> <P> In many ways, Monica Chadha was a prime example. Her family of nine lived in  Greater Kailash Colony, one of Delhi's most posh neighborhoods. But she and her  sisters were crammed into the one-room tenement that doubles as her father's  place of business.  </P> <P> Monica's father, who with his parents fled Pakistan at the time of partition in  1947, owns an antique shop that caters to the diplomatic community. And he  dabbles in politics, serving as block chairman for the opposition Congress-I  Party. He concedes that this takes him away from his family at times, as it did  on the morning of his daughter's suicide.  </P> <P> The Chadha family was not unfamiliar with personal tragedy compounded by  official neglect. Two years ago, another of Gulshan's daughters, 7-year-old  Sulekha, was run down and killed by a government bus. The eldest Chadha  daughter, Sonia, was injured in the accident, and she wrote a letter of  complaint to then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  </P> <P> "I never did receive a reply," Sonia said during the interview this week.  </P> <P> She said she shared with her sister Monica a growing sense of frustration in  being unable to affect a system that appears increasingly stacked against them.  </P> <P> "Before she set herself on fire," Sonia said, "Monica kept talking about this  girl who had just killed herself in Haryana, saying if she could sacrifice her  life to change things, so could Monica.  </P> <P> "I told her that I agreed with what she was saying, but that it was wrong. 'Why  burn yourself?' I kept asking her. 'You're just hurting yourself.' There have  been so many of these burnings, and they've made no difference to V.P. Singh at  all."  </P> <P> Her parents interrupted, presenting dozens of newspaper clippings that  mentioned their daughter's suicide prominently.  </P> <P> "You see, these children look at their future and all they see is darkness,"  Gulshan, the father, said.  </P> <P> "It's education that's important," Malti, the mother, added. "It's the only way  to survive in India, and this is what V.P. Singh is taking away from us."  </P> <P> Sonia, 20, listened quietly for nearly an hour, then picked up where she had  stopped.  </P> <P> "Even after Monica burned herself, she was talking," she said softly. "I was  with her in the hospital every day. And she did not feel she had done a wrong  thing. She kept remembering the girl from Haryana, saying, 'Sister, do not cry.  I have donated my life, and you donated yours.'  </P> <P> "Then she turned to me and told me, 'Sister, don't be angry. I have done this  because, inside my heart, something said I should donate my life, that somehow  it will mean something now. And now, I'm proud of myself.' "  </P></p>

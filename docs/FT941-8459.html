			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: No probe into bid for Anglia Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has cleared the Pounds 292m bid for Anglia Television by MAI, the television and financial services group. Mr Heseltine said yesterday that the bid would not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission following undertakings given by MAI. The undertakings are the same as those obtained in Carlton Communications' acquisition of Central Independent Television and Granada's hostile bid for London Weekend Television. Under the terms of the undertakings MAI must reduce its involvement in television advertising sales to below 25 per cent of the total television market. This could mean disposing of stakes in sales houses or terminating sales contracts. The 25 per cent barrier can be marginally exceeded to allow enlarged companies like MAI to sell advertising for smaller ITV companies which might be disadvantaged because of lack of clout in the advertising market. The Independent Television Commission is now reviewing its position on how large a slice of advertising revenue a single ITV company can control.</p>

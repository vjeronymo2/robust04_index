Hata, also deputy prime minister, will hold separate talks  on  Saturday with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier  Li Peng, and will meet President and Communist Party General  Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning to Tokyo later  in the day.    Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in  New York in late September and again in Seattle in November --  will cover bilateral and international affairs, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the  Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said.    Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept  international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since  Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they  said.    In talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle,  Jiang pledged that Beijing will use its influence with Pyongyang  "on the plus side" and would not exert influence that could turn  into "a minus."    Hata may also urge China to agree to a comprehensive ban on  nuclear testing, the officials said.    Japan wants China to engage in negotiations expected to  begin  this year in Geneva on a treaty for a global ban on nuclear  testing.    China conducted an underground nuclear test in October  despite Qian's speech at the United Nations General Assembly in  September to open test ban talks as early as possible.    Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for China's bid to  join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the  officials said.    Hata and Qian will also discuss the two nations' roles in  the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, review APEC's  activities and also discuss the upcoming Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional forum, they said.    On bilateral issues, Hata will tell Qian about Japan's new  aid programs for China after the current five-year loan program  winds up at the end of fiscal 1995, in March 1996, they said.    According to ministry sources, Japan plans to shorten the  duration of the aid programs from the current five or six years  to three years starting in fiscal 1996. Japan has extended  yen-denominated loans to China under five- or six-year programs  since 1979, making China the only yen loan recipient under a  program lasting more than one year.    China has been reluctant to accept a single-year program  because it follows multiyear economic planning, the sources  said. Under the current 1990-1995 loan program, Japan is  extending 528.2 billion yen to finance 42 Chinese projects.    Hata and Qian may also discuss plans to conclude a bilateral  treaty on the environment, which would enable Japanese and  Chinese experts to conduct a joint survey on acid rain and other  environmental problems, they said.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Chinese gamble pays off for investors - But foreign fund managers are troubled by currency problems Investors who gambled on the shaky foundations of China's latest experiment in capitalism have seen a drastic improvement in their fortunes in 1993. Promises of positive intervention by the authorities have left the Standard Chartered B share indices for Shenzhen and Shanghai up 51 per cent and 47 per cent respectively since the start of the year. Local investors had always shown a hearty disrespect for the fundamentals of equity investment, as was shown most clearly in August's Shenzhen riots over a government lottery for new issue shares. But the B shares, available to foreigners, have only recently begun to reflect the performance of their local counterparts. Main impetus for the latest rally has been external issues: these include the decision temporarily to ignore a ban on local buying of Shanghai B shares, and suggestions that Shenzhen shares will change from local currency settlement to US or Hong Kong dollars, thereby saving foreign institutions from the vagaries of China's currency swap centres. As far as fundamentals are concerned, fund managers will soon get a genuine sense of what they have bought in China, when last year's flotations reveal the first sets of results as listed entities. Assuming no major shocks, the markets will still appear expensive. Standard Chartered Securities estimates that the Shanghai B share market is trading on a 1993 price-earnings ratio of 17 times, while Shenzhen is on a p/e of 26. By comparison, Hong Kong is trading on an estimated 1993 p/e of 11. Among the Chinese companies there are some attractively priced businesses profiting from booming consumer demand in Shanghai, or southern China; but most analysts believe the majority of stocks are overvalued. The picture has not been improved by the rapid weakening of the Renminbi, the official currency. The RMB/US dollar swap rate has declined by 11.5 per cent so far in 1993, and a substantial devaluation in the official exchange rate is anticipated this year. This reduces foreign investors' profits, and makes Chinese stocks appear more expensive. Given these circumstances, fund managers are increasingly tempted to look at cheaper opportunities for buying Chinese stocks in the more liquid and regulated markets of the US and Hong Kong. The number of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong is set to increase drastically, as Beijing launches its first run of nine state industries on the Hong Kong market during 1993. These will definitely absorb much of the cash held by the growing numbers of China funds. One positive factor this year will be the unleashing of the Hong Kong speculator on the hitherto protected B share market. Previously, all flotations have been issued through private placement to professional investors, due to Hong Kong restrictions. Shares have ended up in a few select hands, and secondary market turnover has tended to be limited. However, Wardley Capital, the merchant banking arm of HSBC, has lodged the B share prospectus of Shanghai Outer Gaoqiao Free Trade Development  - a Shanghai property developer - with the Hong Kong Companies registrar. Approval seems certain, and this would allow the shares to be sold to Hong Kong investors as a public offer. This sets a trend for B share issuers to tap a market which recently led to the oversubscription of the HKDollars 402m (USDollars 52m) offer for Chinese car manufacturer Denway by more than HKDollars 240bn. It is estimated that there will be 20 new issues in Shenzhen this year, compared with nine in 1992, so the existence of a new investor base across the border will be an important factor in the performance of the market. In Shanghai, bankers expect up to 25 flotations this year; but of these only five companies are expected to issue B shares, compared with 10 already in existence. The collapse of share prices in the second half of 1992 has limited the prospect of flotations, suggesting that the new issues market should continue to perform well. However, the small size and light trading on the secondary markets means that the only certainty for 1993 is that the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets will remain extremely volatile.</p>

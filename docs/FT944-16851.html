			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Protest at Brazil logging The environmental pressure group Greenpeace has brought to Brazil its global drive to save ancient forests, AP reports from Rio de Janeiro. Its ship, also called Greenpeace, was set yesterday to begin a 30-day voyage down the Amazon. The organisation's Brazilian rainforest co-ordinator, Mr Jose Augusto Padua, said Greenpeace will protest at illegal logging and at the poisoning of rivers by mercury used by gold miners. Brazilian mahogany is in danger of extinction because of logging by both lumber companies and tribal peoples. The biggest buyers of such wood are in the US and the UK. Greenpeace launched its forests campaign last May in Siberia. It has already visited Canada, the US, Central America and Guyana.</p>

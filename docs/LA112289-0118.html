			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT STAFF GEARS FOR YEAR'S BUSIEST DAY  </P> <P> Just under 20,000 travelers are expected to jam John Wayne Airport today,  prompting officials to beef up security, add extra parking lot shuttles and  urge people to arrive early -- or not at all.  </P> <P> An extra 6,000 passengers are anticipated, adding to the more than 12,000 who  pass through the crowded terminal on an average day. This year's holiday  throngs also face detours and unfamiliar surroundings resulting from  construction involving the airport's $310-million expansion program.  </P> <P> The project includes a new, $50-million terminal scheduled to open April 1.  </P> <P> The day before Thanksgiving usually is the airport's busiest, airport officials  said, although last year passenger volume was heaviest on the Monday and  Tuesday following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  </P> <P> Everything is expected to be on a big scale, ranging from traffic and security  police to food and drink at the airport restaurant, which has been stocked to  accommodate the big crowds expected today and on into next week.  </P> <P> "It's going to be hell . . . from 10 a.m. on," said Bill Pemberton, assistant  chief of airport operations. "Our main concern is to reduce the congestion as  much as possible at the terminal."  </P> <P> A three-year veteran of directing Thanksgiving Day traffic at the airport,  Pemberton said that holiday traffic is "going to be particularly bad this year"  because the construction is at its "height" and many roadways have been  narrowed to single lanes in some places.  </P> <P> Pemberton suggested that people park in the remote parking lots -- where  additional free shuttles are scheduled to run to and from the terminal area  every 10 to 15 minutes -- and avoid the terminal-loading area or the metered  lot nearby.  </P> <P> The Southwest Parking Structure, one-tenth of a mile from the terminal, or the  lot on Main Street between MacArthur Boulevard and Red Hill Avenue are best  bets, he advised.  </P> <P> Airport-bound traffic from the Newport Beach area, traveling north on Campus  Drive, will be unable to turn left into the airport due to construction there,  officials said, so drivers are encouraged to use Birch Street and then  MacArthur Boulevard, Pemberton said.  </P> <P> All other traffic is expected to use the MacArthur Boulevard entrance south of  the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> Airport Manager George Rebella advised travelers to arrive at the airport at  least two hours before flights are scheduled to depart. He also suggested that  those coming to the airport to pick up arrivals wait about 15 to 25 minutes  after the scheduled arrival time to meet passengers. "By that time, they'll  have their luggage and be ready to hop right in the car," he said.  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff Department's two-man staff has been increased by one  to help direct traffic and provide security today and also on Sunday and  Monday, when traffic will swell again, Pemberton said.  </P> <P> And 17 skycaps are scheduled to work both the morning and evening shifts today,  up four from the usual 13, to help passengers with luggage and keep the traffic  in front of the terminal moving, skycap supervisor Eric Burke said.  </P> <P> Inside the terminal, Anita Lewis, manager of Delaney's restaurant and coffee  shop, said she is ready for the rush and expects heavy use of the cocktail  lounge.  </P> <P> "We've had to put more people on (work shifts). We've had to order quite a bit  extra," said Lewis, who expects a 30% increase in business.  </P> <P> On a typical day, officials said, the airport handles 12,500 or so passengers.  Today, they expect between 18,000 and 20,000 people, compared to nearly 17,000  on the day before Thanksgiving last year. Crowds are expected to thin somewhat  on Friday but increase again Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> Officials had little advice for those travelers seeking the best time during  peak periods to head for the terminal.  </P> <P> "Wednesday, Sunday and Monday are just terrible," Pemberton said. "I don't  think there is a good time."  </P></p>

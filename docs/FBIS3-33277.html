			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has reported that he  instructed judicial authorities to take severe legal action  against Roosevelt Hospital employees and officials whose  irresponsibility has cost at least one person her life.    [Begin de Leon recording] This unfortunate incident has  happened because of the state workers' irresponsibility. Instead  of meeting with the economic cabinet at the Finance Ministry and  talking to try to find a creative solution, they want an  unrealistic solution by demanding salary raises. It is their  fault.    There are only two ways of meeting their demands. One would  be to start operating the little machine and print unsupported  currency. Such an action would be irresponsible because, by  meeting the demands of a minority, 100,000 or 150,000 public  employees, the economy of 10 million Guatemalans would be  jeopardized. This I cannot and should not do. The other solution  would be to transfer investment resources from other sources.  For the first time we will invest 28 percent of the investment  budget in drinking water systems, health, and education.  Diverting money from the health and education sectors to raise  salaries would be an irresponsible decision. I could not, should  not, and will not do this.    Instead of playing around with the Guatemalan people's lives  -- there is already one victim, and one human life is worth as  much as 10, 20, 100, or 1,000 lives -- they should be seated and  talk as representatives of Guatemalan state workers are doing  today. I understand that a meeting is in progress and a general  assembly will be held tomorrow to continue these talks. I regret  deeply that their position has already cost a person her life.  By looking after their particular interests only, they are  violating the Guatemalan people's rights.    Of course, I have issued instructions to conduct an  investigation and ordered the Attorney General's Office to take  drastic measures against these persons, who are responsible as  individuals and as members of the institutions. They must be  punished according to the law. We are dealing with human lives.  As president of the Republic, I must act accordingly, regardless  of whether it is only one life or more and no matter to which  social level this person belonged. She was a Guatemalan woman  who lost her life because she was neglected, because the workers  only looked after their own private interests, workers whose  duty it was to look after her. These workers are being paid a  salary to attend to the population. This is an outrage, which  falls in the category of crime. [end recording]</p>

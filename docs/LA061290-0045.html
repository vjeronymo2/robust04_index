			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA, BUILDERS EXCHANGE ACCUSATIONS OVER STALLED PROJECT  </P> <P> Tensions between Santa Clarita and the developer of the controversial Santa  Catarina project have been heightened by the exchange of stinging letters  between the developer and city manager, each accusing the other negotiating in  bad faith.  </P> <P> "In your letter, you allege that the city has negotiated in bad faith," City  Manager George Caravalho wrote to Dan and Geoff Palmer of G.H. Palmer  Associates. "This is totally inaccurate, and I find it appalling that you could  make such a statement."  </P> <P> In their letter, the Palmer brothers charged that the City Council misled  company officials who thought city approval of the Santa Catarina project was  virtually assured. Instead, the developers wrote, a timid City Council was  cowed by the protests of homeowners and refused to approve the development  proposal.  </P> <P> "The fact that the city may no longer have the political will to live by the  results of its own planning process is certainly not a justifiable basis for  denying the project," the Palmers wrote.  </P> <P> Caravalho responded that the city negotiators never guaranteed that the project  would be approved. "A comment such as this is presumptuous and naive,"  Caravalho wrote.  </P> <P> The letters, exchanged last Thursday and Friday, are the latest developments in  the lengthy debate over the proposed Santa Catarina development in Canyon  Country. Palmer Associates originally proposed 1,452 condominiums on 135 acres  north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street. The council  members said they would approve a maximum of 800 units.  </P> <P> The Santa Catarina project is part of a larger development agreement that would  allow Palmer Associates to build three housing projects in return for millions  of dollars in road improvements. Negotiations over that agreement, started a  year ago, have reached a stalemate.  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to discuss the agreement tonight.  </P> <P> In their letter, the Palmer brothers offered the city two alternatives. The  company could build 1,292 units and in return extend Golden Valley Road between  Soledad Canyon Road and Sierra Highway. Under the second plan, the company  would build 1,000 units but not complete Golden Valley Road.  </P> <P> In their letter to Caravalho, dated last Thursday, the Palmers said they would  never have entered into negotiations with the city if they had known the city  could recommend an economically disastrous project of 800 units.  </P> <P> "The council's counter-proposal cuts project revenues by over $100 million  while increasing estimated road construction costs by 140%," the Palmers wrote.  </P> <P> The developers also had harsh words for homeowners who said the project would  inundate the neighborhood with traffic and would destroy a valuable wildlife  habitat near the Santa Clara River.  </P> <P> "The opponents' hackneyed, NIMBY criticisms were misunderstood by some members  of the council as factually legitimate, ignoring the obvious political  motivations behind both the criticisms and the repeated and deliberate attempts  to confuse the council," the letter said.  </P> <P> In their seven-page letter, the developers portrayed themselves as victims of  city politics. "Some council members have matched our good faith cooperation  with a disappointing degree of what appears to us to be crowd pleasing speeches  and political posturing," they wrote. "We are not politicians nor are we a  charitable foundation."  </P> <P> Caravalho, in his letter dated last Friday, replied that the city was not a  foundation either, and was not "in business to make money for developers."  </P></p>

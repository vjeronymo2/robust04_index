			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> OVERTURNED CRANE PUTS VENTURA FWY. IN A VISE  </P> <P> An overturned crane closed eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway this morning,  trapping commuters in gridlocked traffic and sending thousands of cars flooding  onto surface streets.  </P> <P> The operator of the crane suffered minor cuts and bruises in the 4:50 a.m.  accident, which occurred as the crane was moving a five-ton concrete barrier  into place at the interchange with the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> No one else was injured, but thousands of morning commuters found themselves in  a virtual parking lot as eastbound traffic was backed up to Tampa Avenue, more  than five miles away.  </P> <P> Traffic on the San Diego Freeway was also slowed by the accident.  </P> <P> "It's a mess," Los Angeles police Officer Clarence Dean said this morning.  </P> <P> Normal traffic flow was restored about 9 a.m., California Highway Patrol  Officer Jayne Suits said.  </P> <P> According to Jim McAllister, Caltrans' resident engineer for the ongoing  Ventura Freeway Improvement Project, crews were replacing guardrails on the  interchange. One eastbound lane of the Ventura Freeway and several transition  roads were already closed for the work between midnight and 5 a.m.  </P> <P> At the time of the accident, the crane was replacing 20-foot temporary concrete  barriers. Crews had already replaced 15 to 20 of the barriers and were  scheduled to reopen the freeway lanes and transition roads as soon as the final  barrier was in place.  </P> <P> McAllister said the crane, which was in a closed fast lane, tipped and rolled  onto its side. Weighed down by the concrete barrier, the arm of the crane fell  onto the transition road from the southbound San Diego Freeway to the eastbound  Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> All eastbound lanes of the Ventura Freeway were closed between 8:25 a.m. and  8:40 a.m. as crews righted the crane and moved it out of traffic lanes.  </P> <P> To avoid congestion on both freeways, thousands of commuters spilled onto  surface streets.  </P></p>

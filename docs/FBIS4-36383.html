			<p>BFN     [Text] Under the patronage of President Zine El Abidine Ben  Ali and at the invitation of the Tunisian radio and television  company, the 17th session of the General Assembly of the Arab  Broadcasting Union convened in Tunis today. The meeting was  chaired by Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia who made a speech in  which he conveyed to participants greetings from President Zine  El Abidine Ben Ali and his good wishes for the success of the  meeting.    He stressed that in the Tunisia of the new era, proceeding  from awareness of the importance of joint inter-Arab action, we  are seeking to host any inter-Arab activity, particularly those  aimed at finding ways of fruitful cooperation and entrenching  concord between the Arab states.    It should be underscored that at its morning meeting the  General Assembly of the Arab Broadcasting Union elected  Abdelhafidh El Hargem, director-general of the Tunisian radio  and television company, as chairman of the Union and of its  Executive Bureau.</p>

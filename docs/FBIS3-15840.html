The  president answered questions of journalists, one of whom was an  Interfax reporter.    Asked by Interfax's Boris Grishchenko about the civil peace  in the country, Yeltsin said,    "I called for civil peace and accord in the presidential  message to the Federal Assembly and in my talk to parliament.  We must work out an appropriate document on this. An accord  must be reached between various parties, movements and branches  of authority. This idea was supported by the leadership of the  State Duma and the Federation Council, the government and  numerous parliamentary groups.    I invited the leaders of these organizations to meet at  10:00  tomorrow, Thursday to agree on working out the document on civil  peace and accord. It must be drafted within about two weeks.  Then we will decide in what procedure it should be adopted.  All strata of our society should contribute to the wording of  this document if a genuine civil accord should follow its  signing. I hope that this will be so."    He had this to say about his Wednesday meeting the  television  officials:    "I had a difficult talk with Aleksandr Yakovlev and Oleg  Poptsov about political processes in the country as well as  television. I had told the Federal Assembly that the first and  second channels must be state-owned. This caused what can be  described in mild terms as agitation in Ostankino (television  center), as far as I know.    I don't think this should be dramatized. In particular,  Yakovlev suggests a `softer' version of the future presidential  decree. Poptsov has his own view of the problem. All this can  be negotiated. But we must come out with a solution, otherwise  we stand to lose state channels to various parties and  movements. The channels may be fragmented and bribery may take  its toll."    Speaking of the economic situation in the country Yeltsin  said, "In the morning I had a thorough talk with Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, in particular on agriculture.    I am saying this for the first time to the Russian people,  the CIS member states and the world: for the first time in  three or four decades we will not buy grain abroad at all this  year. Somebody can be surprised that we will not buy wool,  eiher, because we could never do without imported wool but this  year we will. Nor will we buy flax. All Russian processing  factories have a good supply of agricultural raw materials. In  particular, we have grain of good quality for the spring sowing.    As recently as two years ago many people said that hunger  was  imminent but now we are in a position to say that the Russians  will undoubtedly have enough food. We can discuss variety of  foodstuffs and their quality which should be at least as high as  in foreign products. We are thinking of more reasonable prices."    Answering questions about the status of the Russo-American  relations, in particular the spying scare in the U.S.A., Yeltsin  emphasized,    "This has happened on numerous occasions. Every country has  an intelligence service. Whoever catches a foreign intelligence  officer wins, those who are caught lose. No dramatic  conclusions should be made from such events. I am sure that  this will not affect the Russo-American relations.    Now, former U.S. president Richard Nixon met with Rutskoy,  Zyuganov and others of this kind. But he came here for a  meeting with me.    I appreciate President Bill Clinton's disavowal of Nixon."    Interfax's question: Will you receive the U.S. ex-president?    Yeltsin: No, not after this. He will not be received by the  government, either. Nor will [presidential chief of staff]  Filatov receive him. Mr. Nixon must know that Russia is a  great country which must not be trifled with.    The Americans and we must prepare carefully the Vladivostok  meeting of foreign ministers (scheduled for March 14). The  Russo-American partnership was not easy to come by and we should  not lose it. I am sure that we will not."</p>

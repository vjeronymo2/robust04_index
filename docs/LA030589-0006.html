			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I want to thank the creators and writers of "The Wonder Years" for producing  the most brilliant comedy series since "Taxi." I am 33 years old and grew up in  western Pennsylvania, where I was Kevin Arnold's age in the '60s. It seems as  though that series was made about my life. We said and did everything they do  in the show. "Wonder Years" is a comedy filled with sad moments, dramatic  moments and hilarious moments -- not just a stream of silly punch lines. Thanks  for the careful thought, research and quality that goes into such a wonderful  series.  </P> <P> James J. Germann, Northridge  </P></p>

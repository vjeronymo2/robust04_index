			<p>BFN     [Text] The Czech Republic wants the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] to help, in particular in  restructuring Czech industry. This was mentioned in today's  speech delivered by Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik at the  EBRD conference in St. Petersburg.    According to the minister, the Czech Republic has already  concluded the first stage of the transition to a market economy.  However, the country's economy is now confronted with great  posttransformation challenges. The minister also expressed his  appreciation of the positive changes that have occurred in the  EBRD since Jacques de Larossiere became its director.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUOTES  </P> <P> Here are some quotes I'd like to read in the paper:  </P> <P>  -- "We can't loan your country any more money. You see, we're in debt  ourselves."  </P> <P>  -- "We're going to reduce the debt, not just the deficit. Reducing the deficit  only means we're overspending a little less than last year."  </P> <P>  -- "We can't just give you a welfare check -- would you be willing to work if  excellent, free child-care is provided?"  </P> <P>  -- "Just because I've been selling drugs, you're telling me that you're going  to lock me up and throw away the key?"  </P> <P>  -- "What do you mean that owning an assault rifle is a felony?"  </P> <P>  -- "As your congressman, I'm going to start listening to what the people want  instead of the NRA."  </P> <P>  -- "I'm guilty. I feel that I owe something to society and do not wish to  cause the huge expense of a trial."  </P> <P>  -- "We are not going to build that $8-million military plane, but instead we  are going to use the funds for low-income housing for working families."  </P> <P> ALLEN DAVIS  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

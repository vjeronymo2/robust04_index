			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: The jury is still out - Television To those of us who campaigned to get television cameras into the British Houses of Parliament it seemed that the battle might last a lifetime, and still be lost. Debates were held, politicians were told that the cameras would destroy tradition, seriousness, and reputation, the vote was taken, and the motion lost. It happened not once but over and over again. Then, five years ago, MPs voted for an 'experiment', the cameras went in, and it immediately became obvious that they would never leave. Television has extended the public gallery into every home in the land. Clearly it can do the same for our courts, but that battle is still being fought and it is, if anything, even more difficult since the judges do not have open debates or public votes on the matter. However, BBC2 is currently transmitting a five part series which must, surely, carry the campaign forward. It is still impossible to film inside courts in England or Wales, but Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope, the Lord President, allowed cameras into Scottish courts to make The Trial which is now going out at 9.00 on Friday evenings. Nick Catliff, Ben Gale and Elizabeth Clough have produced a series which, at the start, put you in mind of the court coverage we have seen from major cases in the US and elsewhere. But anyone who watches the entire series will realise that there is much more to it than that. This is not just five visits to the courtroom, let alone five big 'sexy' cases. The first programme did deal with murder, but last week's included shoplifting and evasion of a taxi fare (or anyway an associated charge of resisting arrest). Each programme stands up well on its own but watching all five gives you a fair - albeit sketchy - idea not only of the courts but of the Scottish system of justice. This does not seem so very different from England's, even if the Scots do have 'Advocate Deputes', findings of 'not proven', and judges' robes startlingly covered in big red crosses. Last night's programme concentrated on the work of defence solicitors, and the last episode, on December 16, looks especially at the prosecutors from the Procurator Fiscal's department. So it is not a matter of merely taking cameras into court. The producers visit prisons, lawyers' chambers, and even the scenes of crimes, to eavesdrop on the conversations of the chief protagonists, or to film statements from those involved - though everything is presented 'verite' with neither reporter nor voice-over. The effect is to make it more shriekingly obvious than ever that, even when cameras do get into court, they are still invariably excluded from the place we most want to be: the jury room. This is not just a matter of insatiable curiosity, it is a consequence of watching even the most complex cases edited down to fit into 50 minute slots. At the end of the first programme, about a murder on a lonely footpath, a reasonable viewer would surely have said that, however guilty the defendant appeared to be, however significant his failure to go into the witness box, and however telling the presence of a watch said to be his beside the body, the prosecution had clearly not proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet a guilty verdict was brought in. The viewer was left to wonder whether the jurors were stupid or whether their decision would have seemed reasonable to the rest of us if television had broadcast the entire case. The series illustrates what is known to anyone who has regularly attended court: that the system is imperfect; that juries sometimes bring in the right verdict despite the evidence; that the guilty occasionally go free while the innocent are punished; that real people, including lawyers, are often poor public speakers, hesitating and stumbling and sounding nothing like the articulate paragons in LA Law. Some will argue that comments such as these merely prove that cameras in court bring the law into disrepute, but that is superficial. What we need, and what we shall surely have in the end, is the right to take cameras into any court (yes, with judges' rules to avoid misuse) and then enough time on one of the thousands of digital networks which are already technically feasible to show not 50 minutes of a case but 50 hours if that seems right.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Swedbank to seek state support SWEDBANK yesterday became the latest Swedish bank to seek government support, in a further indication of the extent of the crisis facing the country's financial sector. The bank, which claims to be the largest bank in the Nordic countries after being formed from 11 savings banks, said it was worried that continuing recession in the Swedish economy would put it in breach of international capital adequacy requirements during 1993. Mr Goran Collert, Swedbank managing director, also warned the bank's 1992 deficit could be even greater than the SKr8.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn) predicted last October when credit losses for the year were anticipated to total SKr14.5bn. 'It could be another SKr1bn more,' he stated. Swedbank had already warned it might have to seek state support if the economic outlook did not improve. Its decision to seek discussions with the Finance Ministry means Svenska Handelsbanken is the only leading Swedish bank not to be inquiring about or already receiving state support. In the first eight months of 1992, Swedbank suffered an operating loss of SKr6.5bn, after loan losses rose to SKr10.4bn. Its capital adequacy ratio stands at around 8.5 per cent, but is likely to fall below 8 per cent this year without an economic upturn.</p>

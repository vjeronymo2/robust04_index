			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Forex sale cancelled as naira plunges NIGERIA'S central bank yesterday responded to a continuing plunge in the naira by cancelling the result of Wednesday's foreign exchange auction in which the currency fell sharply against the dollar for the second successive week. Bankers in Lagos said last night that most bids ranged between 30 and 33 naira to the dollar. It was valued at 25 after last week's auction, and 20.6 on January 19. In a statement, the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) said: 'In view of the outrageous rate that emerged from Wednesday's auction, authorised dealers are advised that the CBN is constrained to cancel the result.' Banks 'would be advised in due course' when the next sale will take place. At last week's auction 80 of the 120 eligible banks participated, but bids from 18 banks accounted for all the Dollars 80m on offer. A similar amount was put up for auction this week. The naira, worth more than a dollar in the early 1980s, was devalued by 41 per cent last March to close a gap with the parallel market. The currency is expected to come under more pressure. The federal government's 45 per cent pay rise for its staff last June was followed by matching demands by state government employees and private sector unions. Inflation exceeds 45 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP) was committed to the Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP], but it should be carried out at provincial and  local government level, IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi  said on Wednesday.    Speaking in the debate on the president's opening speech he  congratulated him and those leaders who preceded him "in your  struggle to have brought us here today."    He lamented the fact that KwaZulu/Natal had to go to the  elections in -- and remained in -- a state of emergency. "It is  the only fly in the ointment of the overflowing cup of joy which  is before us."    The government of national unity faced a challenge of  titanic  proportions, not only to succeed, but to make the Reconstruction  and Development Programme actually work for the people. "We in  the IFP are committed to do what we can," he said. The IFP  accepted the challenge, but gave notice that it would bring into  play the wide variety of the country's diverse community. "We  must ensure that all political parties will continue to play an  active role in supporting the RDP effort through to its final  implementation."    Hidden political agendas had to be avoided, Mr Buthelezi  said.    Though he found Mr Mandela's vision for a new South Africa  and the RDP proposals commendable, there might be differences of  approach on detail between their two parties. "We should not  have a top-down programme. The people must be empowered to  develop and implement programmes for their own communities,  entrusting the execution to grass roots level."    All chapters of the RDP falling under the functional areas  of  the provincial authorities should be developed autonomously by  the provinces, while the central government was restricted to  receiving and co-ordinating such programmes. "Let us have the  true courage of empowering people at local and provincial  government levels. It is only with this approach that we will  carry into the programme the rich diversity of our people," Mr  Buthelezi said.</p>

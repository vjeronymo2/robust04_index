			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Submittal of trial burn plans for interim status facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Today's proposed rule would require interim status hazardous waste incinerators (proposed &sect;270.74(a)(1)) and BIFs (proposed &sect;270.74(b)) to submit a trial burn plan with their initial Part B permit applications. EPA believes that the trial burn plan for interim status facilities should be subject to public notice and available for review with the initial Part B application, as it is for new facilities seeking permits. EPA's objective in proposing these revisions is to involve the public much earlier in the interim status facility permitting process than current regulations require. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends that today's requirements regarding submittal of the trial burn plans for interim status facilities will: (1) Specify the point in the permit process when the facility submits the trial burn plan, which will be the same point as for new facilities; and (2) explicitly provide that interim status facilities must conduct the burn in accordance with an approved plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since EPA is proposing a specific point for trial burn plan submittal in the proposed rule, i.e., with the Part B application, the Agency is deleting the current provisions that refer to the trial burn plan submittal (&sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Approval of trial burn plans for interim status facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In &sect;270.74(c)(1), EPA is explicitly requiring that any interim status combustion facility that seeks a permit must obtain the Director's approval of the trial burn plan before conducting the trial burn. EPA is also proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(4), that the Director, after approving a trial burn plan, must specify a time period during which the facility shall conduct the burn. EPA adds this latter requirement to ensure that facilities conduct trial burns in a timely manner. The Agency believes that requiring the permitting agency's approval of interim status trial burn plans will ensure that the facilities submit plans that reflect, and the permitting authority reviews the plans in the context of, current EPA policy and guidance. EPA also believes that today's proposed requirements will ensure that, in most cases, the burns will supply adequate data and information to set permit operating conditions. This proposed requirement for interim status facilities is equivalent to the permitting procedures for new facilities seeking permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted, however, that unlike the procedures for new facilities, approval of the trial burn plan for interim status facilities is on a separate track from the rest of the permit application. As mentioned earlier in this preamble, a new combustion facility must receive a permit before building the combustion unit and conducting the trial burn. Review and approval of trial burn plans for these facilities is concurrent with review and approval of the entire permit application; the trial burn plan is just one of many components. However, for interim status facilities, the permitting authority does not issue the draft permit, or the notice of intent to deny the permit, until after the facility conducts the trial burn. Since facilities must conduct the burn in accordance with a plan approved by the permitting agency, it is clear that the plan must be on a separate approval track from the rest of the permit application. Furthermore, interim status facilities typically must revise their permit applications to reflect the results of the burn, so that the conditions set in the permit can be based on conditions known to ensure compliance with the performance standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Notices of trial burns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's proposed rulemaking, EPA is seeking to expand opportunities for public involvement during the trial burn phase of the combustion permitting process for both new and interim status facilities. EPA requests comments on whether the facility or the permitting authority should be responsible for publishing the public notices discussed in the following sections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

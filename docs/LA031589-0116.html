			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES UP ON HOPES OF COOL ECONOMY  </P> <P> Bond prices rose Tuesday in quiet trading on speculation that the economy may  be slowing.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose about 1/2 point, or $5 for every  $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its  price, declined to 9.11% from 9.16% late Monday.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped 0.4% in February,  the biggest decline in almost a year. Sales fell to a seasonally adjusted  $138.2 billion last month after rising a strong 0.7% in January.  </P> <P> The drop-off was most apparent in sales of durable goods, normally the first to  be affected by higher interest rates. Many banks raised the prime rate to 11.5%  last month. The prime rate is a benchmark against which banks measure a variety  of consumer and business loan charges.  </P> <P> "It leads to expectations the economy is slowing in response to higher interest  rates," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets  Group in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 9.813%, up from 9.75% late Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Personal View: Search for solution to UK pay puzzle Profound changes have occurred in the British system of pay determination in the last decade. Despite this, the government has had to create some 3m unemployed to get wage settlements down. Once unemployment really starts falling, it is unlikely that Britain will continue to enjoy many nominal settlements of 3 per cent and less. Many fewer employees are covered by collective bargaining now than 10 years ago. Then, nearly three-quarters had their pay set by bargaining. Now that figure is less than half, and collective bargaining no longer dominates. Hand-in-hand with this decline, union membership has haemorrhaged, the closed shop is almost extinct, and, where collective bargaining remains, almost all employees are now covered by single employer agreements. In recent years, also, national agreements have been abandoned in a diverse range of sectors and, simultaneously, the fragmentation of bargaining inside the company has been moderated: most multi-plant employers now bargain at company rather than workplace level. Decentralisation of bargaining towards the organisation level is also taking place in the public sector. These alterations all strengthen the link between pay and the performance of the individual employee and the fortunes of the company. Merit pay, employee share ownership schemes and profit sharing have all spread rapidly. Finally, virtually all comparability machinery and protection for the low paid have been axed. The government has achieved almost everything it set out to do concerning Britain's system of pay determination. This has produced important gains in efficiency. But the plain fact is that the pay/jobs trade-off has not improved in the way that free market economists led us to believe that it would. During the whole of the 1980s the rise in average annual earnings never fell below 7.5 per cent. And between 1983 and 1990 real earnings growth for those in work was a record high. It is only in the last couple of years - as unemployment doubled - that the pay outcomes changed. Pay settlements plummeted. The independent research body, Industrial Relations Services, puts average settlements at 3.6 per cent, only half the figure of a year ago. Higher unemployment meant job losses and falling profits in the private sector, both of which traditionally lower pay inflation. In engineering, a staggering 207 settlements out of 346 reported between November and January were either frozen or deferred to later in the year. Higher unemployment, coupled with the decline in union presence, has also led to a huge widening of the pay distribution. Earnings are much more unequal now than they were in 1960. Once recovery gets under way and unemployment falls, pay settlements will surely edge up again. Company profits will rise, skill shortages will bid up pay and public sector employees will wish to recoup recent real wage losses. Employers increasingly use pay as a management device to elicit effort, commitment and teamwork in the company. Earlier this year - in the trough of the present recession - Imperial Chemical Industries paid its 20,000 manual workers 14.5 per cent in return for sweeping changes in working practices. So the need for greater flexibility at work will also lead to higher average pay rises in the mid-1990s than are being enjoyed at present. The British pay predicament - how to get low settlements and rapid employment growth - remains intact. The pay conundrum only appears to have been solved because of the tragedy of nearly 3m unemployed. Almost no one would advocate a return to the old corporatist arrangements of the 1970s. But the Treasury and the Department of Employment must work much harder to establish a consensus on what pay increase is affordable. This process should start now. The Seven Wise Men who comment on Treasury performance might be asked to advise on sensible settlements. The CBI should then emphasise this advice in its own excellent pay briefing mounted for members each autumn. The employment department could contribute too. Why not convene an annual forum involving the largest 50 private sector organisations to discuss the recommendations of the wise men? Consensus building involving the social partners will involve some modest changes to Britain's institutions and pay processes. But without it, inflation will inevitably return.

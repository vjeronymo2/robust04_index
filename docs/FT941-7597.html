			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories join attack on army job cuts The government was criticised by all parties at Westminster yesterday over a new round of army redundancies. Tory backbenchers joined MPs from the opposition parties to attack the 7,000 job losses made under the third phase of a cuts programme. There was particular concern about the prospect of redundancies among officers and other ranks serving in Bosnia. Downing Street officials said last night that the number of compulsory redundancies among troops in Bosnia would 'only just' run into double figures. Redundancies would be 'across the board'. It would be the same for troops in Ulster and elsewhere as it would be for those in Bosnia. Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, giving details of the cuts in a parliamentary written answer, said there would be just over 1,000 redundancies. All those selected would be notified today. Mr Winston Churchill, a Tory member of the cross-party Commons defence committee, said: 'We are strongly opposed, on an all-party committee basis, to these cuts.' Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said the government was 'badly mismanaging British military forces'.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Whiff of tiffs if Ziff sells in a jiff: Louise Kehoe opens the covers of a US computer magazine publisher The headlines in PC Week and PC Magazine, the flagship publications of Ziff Communications, are written for computerphiles: PC Labs test 70 notebook PCs, ISVs ready usage-based licences, Trio dispensing cure for SNMP ills. The covers feature machines rather than humans. Yet these and Ziff's 13 other titles, all geared to specific segments of the computer market, are attracting attention from a new group of readers whose interests are in dollars and cents rather than bits and bytes: the world's largest publishing houses. Ziff has been put up for sale by the three grandsons of William Ziff, its founder. Dirk, 30, Robert, 27, and Daniel Ziff, 22, are the heirs to about 90 per cent of the business which their father, William Ziff Jr, built into the pre-eminent US computer industry publisher. 'Publishing has been at the centre of our family's business interests for two generations,' said Dirk Ziff last month. 'But since our father's retirement last fall, Robert and I have realised that the company is not where we want to spend our careers. After consulting with our brother Daniel (a student at Columbia University) and our father, it was clear that we should focus where our skills and interests lie, in the investment field.' The proceeds of the sale will go into Ziff Brothers Investments, a budding firm founded by Dirk Ziff that holds stakes in real-estate investments and trades in equities and convertible securities. The announcement came as a shock to industry observers and company employees, who had expected the Ziff brothers to retain ownership of the family publishing empire, even if they did not personally become involved in its management. There is 'sadness, a sense of betrayal' among Ziff staff, said one senior magazine editor. Some have gone so far as to describe their feelings in a computer-style acronym - GLZ for 'greedy little Ziffs'. However, the proposed sale has sparked excitement in the publishing industry. The bidding process, handled by the US merchant bank Lazard Freres, is reported to be attracting broad interest, particularly in Europe and Asia. Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group which owns several other trade publication companies, including Boston-based Cahners Publishing, is seen as a likely bidder. This week Reed said it was considering making a bid to expand its presence in the US and was examining the Ziff group. It is expected to decide whether to make an offer next month. K-III Communications Corp, the publisher funded and partly owned by financiers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, as well as Hachette Fili-pacchi Magazines, the publishing arm of France's Matra Hachette, have also expressed interest. Two other potential bidders, International Data Group and CMP Publications, Ziff's direct competitors in the US computer trade press, have been ruled out by the Ziff brothers. If sold as a whole, Ziff Communications could raise about Dollars 2bn, industry observers suggest. Some see the price going as high as Dollars 3bn. The company may sell at a premium because its magazine titles are the leaders in their field. 'Ziff has set the pace in computer trade publications,' said William Bluestein, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, a high-tech research firm. Known in computer publishing as tough, hard-driving and ambitious, Ziff is far from a traditional publishing house. It is often described as a 'yuppie company' that relies upon the energy and drive of hard-working, highly paid young editors and sales representatives. Its critics - and there are many - charge that Ziff is 'bureaucratic' and 'management-heavy'. Few, however, can afford to ignore Ziff, a powerhouse in computer publishing. Ziff's advertising revenues outpace its competitors. According to Adscope, an advertising tracking service, Ziff publications took 34 per cent of US computer business advertising last year and in the first half of this year advertising sales in the group's seven US business titles reached Dollars 341.8m, up 8 per cent from the same period a year ago. Ziff sold 50,000 pages of advertising worldwide last year, with 7,000 pages in PC Magazine alone, which has a paid circulation of more than 1m, according to the company. Ziff also publishes six computer magazines in Europe. Other ventures include a PC market research group, conferences and trade shows. The Information Access unit publishes industry information on CD-ROMs, while Ziff-Net, an online information service, offers PC users articles from the company's magazines as well as discussion forums and libraries of computer industry information. Bidders for this cornucopia of businesses will have to move quickly, however. Ziff's 4,300 employees have been told to expect a buyer to be named by November 11, in time for the Comdex computer show in Las Vegas, one of the most important events of the year in the world of PCs. This apparent haste worries some observers. 'They seem to be in a great hurry to sell,' said a Ziff magazine editor, who wonders if the Ziff brothers may have decided that the financial performance of the group has peaked. With the growth of the 'home computer' market, PC makers are increasingly favouring general interest magazines and newspapers for their advertising. At the same time, competing trade publishers are targeting Ziff's market with publications that are narrowly focused on lucrative segments, such as purchasers of computer networking equipment and software. The company retorts: 'Ziff is having a record year and the outlook for our business has never been brighter.' Yet Ziff has recently embarked upon some expensive and risky ventures. Interchange, a new online news service offering news from the Washington Post and several other newspapers and news agencies, faces fierce competition from established services such as America Online and Compuserve, as well as other entrants, such as Apple Computer's eWorld and a similar service that Microsoft, the computer software leader, is expected to launch this year. Ziff's entry into the consumer market - with Family PC, a joint venture with Walt Disney, to be introduced this month, and Computer Life, for 'sophisticated consumers', scheduled for release in September - is also a gamble. Another venture, launched yesterday, takes the company into television programming with four-weekly shows for computer buffs. 'The pending sale of the company hasn't slowed us down one bit,' Ziff boasts. Top management, including Eric Hippeau, chairman and chief executive, has reassured employees that it intends to remain with the company after the sale, and insists that a change of ownership will not put a crimp on Ziff's ambitious growth plans. Whether a new owner will want to continue investing in the new Ziff projects, started by Mr Hippeau, is questionable. Keeping him and many of Ziff's key people on board will, however, require the current 'hands-off' approach to be preserved, employees say. That may be a lot to ask on top of a premium sales price.</p>

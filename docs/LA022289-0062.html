			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WILL BE CUT? CONGRESS ASKS BUSH  </P> <P> President Bush prodded the Democratic-controlled Congress Tuesday to start  negotiations on a compromise budget package, but key lawmakers demanded more  details on the President's proposed cuts in domestic programs before beginning  serious talks.  </P> <P> Budget Director Richard G. Darman, appearing later before the Senate Budget  Committee to echo Bush's plea, came under sharp Democratic attack but warned  that a prolonged stalemate over a federal spending plan is "fraught with risk,"  adding: "Although the real economy remains strong, interest rates are rising  and markets seem less firm than one would wish."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talks to Continue  </P> <P> The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House Budget committees, who attended  a White House meeting with Bush, agreed to continue private talks with Darman  but complained that they lack the information needed to negotiate.  </P> <P> Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.)  and chairmen and ranking Republican members of the budget, appropriations and  tax-writing committees sat in on the hourlong talk with Bush less than two  weeks after he submitted his $1.16-trillion revised budget.  </P> <P> Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), head of the Senate Budget panel, said that the Bush  budget proposes $10-billion worth of cuts in $136-billion worth of domestic  programs but fails to say how they should be carried out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Budget Hearing  </P> <P> "Where are the cuts going to come from?" Sasser asked as his committee held the  first Senate hearing on the Bush plan. "We don't know where the cuts are at  this point -- the Bush Administration has yet to tell us."  </P> <P> His House counterpart, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), said after the White  House breakfast meeting that the budget process is on the right track but  added: "When does he (Bush) start to make the tough choices? That's part of the  process -- to find out what the choices are."  </P> <P> However, Darman would not be specific about where cuts in domestic programs  should be made and only offered options. He said that lawmakers could accept  former President Ronald Reagan's proposed spending level, freeze the outlays at  the current level or negotiate with the Administration on a compromise figure.  </P> <P> "You can't have it both ways," Sasser told Darman. "The Administration wants a  line-item veto but it doesn't want to give us a line-item budget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discounts Bush Proposal  </P> <P> Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S. C.) said that he does not regard the Bush budget  as a serious proposal, telling Darman: "You want us to hurry up to get a  two-year budget to get past the next election . . . . You are more  Jack-be-nimble than Stockman."  </P> <P> Hollings' reference to David A. Stockman, Reagan's first budget director, who  acknowledged that he had manipulated budget figures on behalf of the White  House, drew laughter from the audience.  </P> <P> As for the lack of detail in Bush's plan, Hollings added: "President Bush must  think this is a CIA covert operation." Only "dummy Democrats," he said, would  be willing to enter budget talks with the White House on this basis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meeting Called Productive  </P> <P> However, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, Sen. Pete V. Domenici  (R-N. M.), said that the meeting with Bush was productive because "everyone  agreed to get on with the negotiating process" rather than delay budget-making  decisions for most of the year.  </P> <P> Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N. H.) also had an encouraging word for Darman.  </P> <P> "Every budget sent up here for the past eight years has been pronounced dead on  arrival," Rudman said. "Yours is still quivering, so I guess you're ahead."  </P> <P> Democrats heaped criticism on the President's proposal, however. Sen. Frank R.  Lautenberg (D-N. J.) said that it called for a reduction of $1.2 billion in  sewage construction grants, noting: "It doesn't sound kinder and gentler -- it  sounds dirtier and harsher."  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said that Bush had failed to present a bold program to  attack the budget deficit, estimated at $170 billion for the current fiscal  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Assault on Deficit  </P> <P> "Basically, he ducked," Simon said. "The danger is that we are going to do the  same thing. I hope we don't dance at the edges of this deficit but make a real  assault on it."  </P> <P> Federal law requires the deficit, as measured by the Office of Management and  Budget, to fall below $110 billion for the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1. A  higher figure would trigger an automatic across-the-board reduction in  spending, divided equally between domestic programs and defense, known as a  sequestration.  </P> <P> When Sasser told Darman that some senators favor sequestration to adoption of  the Bush budget because it would provide more total money for domestic  programs, Darman said he favors a compromise because it would be less damaging  to national security.  </P> <P> "My personal view is that we are very, very likely to reach agreement on a  defense reduction program that will reach the (deficit) targets," Darman said.  </P></p>

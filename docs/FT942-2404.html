			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Beckett proud to be described as leftwinger Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday underlined her credentials as the candidate of the left in Labour's leadership election by raising the prospect of renationalising the water industry and making it clear she remained committed to nuclear disarmament. But Labour's acting leader was also careful to highlight her experience and to promote herself as a candidate capable of uniting the party. She said on BBC TV: 'I would be happy and proud to be described as a leftwinger but what I am is somebody who has always made up their mind on the merits of a case and tried to argue that case honestly and forthrightly.' Mrs Beckett invited a resurgence of Tory claims that a Labour government would be soft on defence by acknowledging that she might remain a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament if she became prime minister. Stressing that she would leave CND if it became a pacifist organisation, she said she was still a member because it was the only body working for nuclear disarmament. But she said she would be prepared to tolerate higher defence spending if she was convinced this was in Britain's interests. On the water industry Mrs Beckett said she was 'not averse' to it coming back into public control, depending on 'what degree of public ownership is needed for that'. She added: 'What I certainly want to see is the water industry taken under very firm control. I think it is outrageous the way people are being rooked at present by an industry which is paying huge salaries to the people who run it and making huge profits which go to a small group of people.' Her comments appeared to open a new gap on policy with Mr Tony Blair, the arch-moderniser who is firm favourite to succeed the late John Smith as Labour leader. Mr Blair recently told the Financial Times: 'I think that most people would not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . . . that you renationalise the water industry as opposed to, say, spending money on health or education.' Mr Blair is expected to launch his leadership manifesto later this week and to follow this with a series of six speeches setting out his views on individual issues. The subjects are expected to be education, the economy, constitutional change, Europe, the welfare state and the future of the Labour party.</p>

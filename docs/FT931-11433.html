			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Fifth of passenger rail routes selected for sell-off PASSENGER services on nearly a fifth of Britain's railway network are likely to be in private sector hands by the end of next year, the government announced yesterday. It also came up with a surprise package of grants and other incentives aimed at encouraging freight traffic to switch from road to rail. Grants will in some cases give private sector freight carriers a free ride on the railway tracks if that is what it takes to persuade them to use rail instead of roads. The government also plans to raise maximum lorry weights from 38 tonnes to 44 tonnes for special vehicles which transfer their loads from road to rail for the larger part of their journey. The announcements came as Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, defended the government's controversial rail privatisation plans in the second reading of the railways bill, which last night received a government majority of 33. Mr MacGregor named seven parts of British Rail which will be split from the network this year and managed autonomously by BR staff on an experimental basis pending privatisation. Ranging in size from the Isle of Wight railway to ScotRail, they also comprise three InterCity routes, East Coast, Great Western and Gatwick Express, and two Network SouthEast commuter services - the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line and the whole of the South West division between London Waterloo and south-west England. The government hopes that by preparing these routes for privatisation now, they can be moved swiftly into private hands after the planned launch of the privatisation process in April 1994. Other parts of the passenger railway will take much longer, but Mr MacGregor said the government's proposals for franchising out the operation of all BR's passenger services would be mapped out shortly. The proposals mean that the InterCity network looks likely to be split into separate franchises. InterCity's management had hoped to bid for the franchise to operate the network intact. The Department of Transport said it had not reached any conclusions on the future of InterCity, and that it had not ruled out the possibility that a single bidder could win more than one franchise. The proposals won praise from Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, who welcomed measures to boost freight. Test franchises, Page 15 Letter, Page 22</p>

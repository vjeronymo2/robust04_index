Our  investigation of the 0.50-micron LDD [lightly doped drain] PMOS  process indicates that the LDD can greatly suppress the  hot-carriers effect, short-channel effect, and the hot  electron-induced punch through (HEIP) effect in the PMOS  material. Finally, we have developed an optimum LDD PMOS process  and have applied it to fabricate 0.50-micron ICs.    On N (resistivity = 1-2 ohm-cm) silicon wafers, we have  adopted the PMOS process. After polysilicon-gate fabrication  (gate oxide layer thickness of about 28 nm), we did the LDD  preparation with the following process flow chart:    (a) BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] implantation to form lightly  doped P[.sup]-[/] region; implantation dose = 7 x  10[.sup]12[/]-8 x 1O[.sup]13[/]/cm[.sup]2[/],  implantation energy = 25-60 keV.    (b) LPCVD [low-pressure chemical vapor deposition]  SiO[.sub]2[/], 400 nm.    (c) CHF[.sub]3[/] RIE [reactive ion etching]  SiO[.sub]2[/] to  form 0.20-nm Si0[.sub]2[/] side wall.    (d) Side-wall mask BF[.sub]2[/][.sup]+[/] heavy  implantation to form S/D P[.sup]+[/] doping; implantation  conditions: 40 keV, 2 x 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/].    (e) Annealing for 30 min at 950 C to form the LDD  structure.    After this, a conventional CMOS [complementary metal oxide  semiconductor] process is used to complete device fabrication.    Using this optimized PMOS LDD process combined with an  optimized NMOS LDD and a self-aligned titanium-silicide process,  we have developed a set of submicron CMOS processes. ICs  fabricated with this process include a 0.5-micron  voltage-controlled oscillator [VCO] with a 600 MHz speed and a  gate delay of 130 ps [picoseconds], as well as other submicron  circuits, with very good results [refs. 11-12].    Five figures show various relationships among device  parameters. There are no tables.  <H5>  Selected references [from total of 12]: </H5>   1.

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Personal View: Ministers must get a grip on reality of British Rail There is something about railways that brings out the worst in British politics. The current debate about privatising British Rail has proceeded in the privacy of a Cabinet committee, with the public informed only through leaks by ministers to the lobby correspondents. Their reports are disturbing. The ambitions of different ministers appear incompatible - to recreate the four pre-war companies; to separate ownership of tracks and trains to permit competition; to franchise operators of commuter services; and to privatise the Inter-City network as a single unit, while keeping the rest of BR in public ownership. They suggest that ministers are out of touch with reality. If this debate had taken place in public, perhaps on the basis of a green paper, ministers would not have been limited to the advice of their own staff - who, outside the Department of Transport, have little knowledge of railways - and the weaknesses of some of the proposals being discussed could have been exposed. Four facts should be in ministers' minds when discussing the privatisation of BR: the railway system ranges from the modestly profitable Inter-City services, through the modestly unprofitable London commuter services, to the regional services which cover about a third of their costs; their management is weak, and there is no obvious surplus of talent in other transport industries with which to strengthen it; operating a railway involves a lot of people, many with specialised skills; British railways cannot use foreign rolling stock, so their equipment has to be specially made, and there is no effective second-hand market. Any entrant would have to take over some of BR's employees, and ensure their co-operation if trains were to be run efficiently and safely. It would also have to use BR's existing rolling stock if it was to operate services soon. Once new equipment had been delivered, the buyer would have to reckon that its life was at least 25 years, and that it could be sold only to another UK operator of similar services. The cost of entering the railway business is high, therefore, partly because leaving it would entail heavy losses. The cost and potential losses would be even higher if the entrant had to buy and maintain the track, which also has no other uses. Railways are unlike the bus and airline industries, in which equipment can be bought and sold in the second-hand market. Rolling stock, therefore, does not provide adequate security for borrowing; nor can it support commercial leasing operations, which are now common for aircraft. The high cost of entering the railway business implies that the option of separating ownership of track and trains could fail for lack of entrants. Potential operators might want a monopoly on a route before committing themselves; and be unwilling to pay the full cost of the tracks they would use. Potential buyers of the infrastructure would in turn be uncertain about the income from the track. And, because only BR runs train services at present, potential entrants to the railway business - unlike entrants to the bus or airline industries - are likely to be managed by newcomers to the industry. The risk of misjudgment leading to failure is therefore increased. Similar problems would arise if the government sought to franchise the operation of unprofitable services, while retaining ownership of the track they used. There would be few if any bidders for such franchises unless the subsidy guaranteed a commercial return, the existing trains could be leased from the government, or the franchises were long enough to permit investments in new rolling stock to be depreciated. In one case, the franchisee could not improve services significantly; in the other, the franchise system would create little competitive pressure. In all cases, the subsidy is liable to rise. It would be a remarkable act of faith to expect this scenario to improve the quality of commuter services. Splitting BR into four regional companies would also create difficulties, whether or not a separate company was to operate Inter-City services and to own its tracks. The profitability of the four would vary with the proportion of commuter or regional services provided; if Inter-City was sold separately, they would all be unprofitable. There would also be conflicts between companies where services crossed regional boundaries. If ministers were realists, they would accept that British Rail can best be privatised as a single unit. The efficiency of the subsidised and Inter-City services could be improved by a change of ownership that reduced direct political intervention and removed investment from the constraint of the public sector borrowing requirement. Efficiency could be further improved if local authorities provided the subsidy, and regulated fares and quality: they could then strike a contract with the privatised railway company that specified services, fares and subsidy, which should give some of the benefits claimed for franchising such services. Privatising Inter-City alone would imply that the subsidised services would remain in public ownership indefinitely, if efforts to franchise them are unsuccessful, as seems likely. The possibility of competition should be regarded as a subject for experiment. European Community rules will ensure that other companies can in future run trains on BR's tracks if they so desire; and the possibility of franchising subsidised services could be tried on a small scale. But the main competition for rail services will always come from cars, buses and aircraft. In their pursuit of the will-o'-the-wisp of direct competition between railway operators, ministers seem to have forgotten that politics is the art of the possible. They should return to the simple solution of privatising BR as one unit. The author is an economics consultant.</p>

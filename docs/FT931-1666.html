			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings about Venezuelan gold rush - Over-enthusiastic prospectors are driving up land concession prices depending on your point of view - blame for the world's latest gold rush, tries to convey his excitement. 'There was visible gold in many of the rocks. It was stunning. I had seen nothing like it.' He communicated that enthusiasm about his visit to the so-called Kilometre 88 gold camp in south-east Venezuela in a report distributed to clients of Burns Fry, the Canadian stockbroker that employs him. Kilometre 88 was, he suggested, 'shaping up to be the most important gold discovery in ten years'  -the most important since gold was found on the Carlin Trend in the early 1980s and triggered Nevada's gold rush. His comments were perfectly timed. Speculators who had been pouring money into Canada to feed the diamond exploration rush in the Northwest Territories were ready for something new to satisfy their appetites. Mining stock promoters were casting round for another way of lightening the wallets of nutty or naive investors while the markets were still 'hot'. The share prices of a number of small, Vancouver-quoted Canadian companies with Venezuelan connections soared as Freeman's opinions became widely circulated. Many prices doubled in a few weeks. Other small Canadian mining companies moved into the area. Controversial, high-profile promoters such as Robert Friedland and Murray Pezim are aggressively promoting their Venezuelan holdings. No wonder Mr Freeman suggests: 'Kilometre 88 will likely become the hottest exploration play in 1993'. Canadian companies swarming into Venezuela are finding the local mining laws and laws of title exceptionally complex. So they are attempting to buy existing mining concessions and driving prices up wildly. Mr Freeman says that one Venezuelan group recently talked to five Canadian companies in two days. 'The Venezuelans are asking some fancy prices for concessions now,' he says. Concessions recently priced at Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m are now being touted for Dollars 10m or more. 'The Venezuelans might not be very good miners, but they are darned good businessmen,' says Mr Freeman wryly. All this activity has produced mixed feelings in the boardrooms of companies that have been gold hunting in Venezuela for some years. While executives are happy that their foresight in choosing Venezuela is at last being recognised, they despair at the reckless claims being made and at the rocketing prices for land concessions. Mr Tony Ciali, chief executive of Monarch Resources, a London-quoted company that has been operating in Venezuela since 1987, says the rush is affecting his company's negotiations with local land owners by giving them an entirely false perspective of what their property is worth. Ironically, Monarch, which probably has the biggest single land holding in Venezuela - but some way from the Kilometre 88 camp - originally decided to restrict its activities to Venezuela because of the country's history of gold production, stable government and lack of competition from big gold companies. The country has a long history of gold mining, concentrated principally in the El Callao mining district of Guayana province but, in spite of political democracy and relative stability since 1958, there has been limited foreign investment because of an inhibitive tax regime. This included a 60 per cent corporate tax rate, which was not reduced (to 30 per cent) until last year. Most upset by the Venezuelan brouhaha is Placer Dome, one of North America's biggest gold producers, which has a joint venture property, Las Cristinas, 88 km (50 miles) south of Eldorado, near Puerto Ordaz on the Guyana border. Placer has a 70 per cent interest in Las Cristinas with the rest in the hands of the state-owned CVG (Corporation Venezolana de Guayana). Las Cristinas is in an area where about 10,000 local wildcat miners or garimpeiros worked in the 1980s, using primitive equipment that allowed the extraction of gold only from the first 15 to 30 metres of weathered bedrock. They are estimated to have removed about 1.6m troy ounces of gold. Placer has spent Dollars 2.4m to drill about 120 holes in a 400-by-200 metre grid, each hole being an average of 160 metres deep and enabling the company to collect about 7,000 metres of core samples. Burns Fry originally suggested Placer eventually would outline 'in excess of 10m gold ounces on the property,' but has backed away from that prediction recently. Mr John Willson, Placer's new chief executive, says crossly: 'We don't want to be associated with guestimates. We are very pleased with the way exploration is going (at Las Cristinas) but it is far too early for us to estimate resources there. We might have a partial resource estimate by the middle of this year. I don't want investors buying Placer Dome stock because of other people's estimates of what we have in Venezuela. When we know what resources we have there, we will tell them.' Nevertheless, you can't stop analysts speculating. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg Securities, suggests: 'It seems likely that Las Cristinas will be developed as an underground mining operation.' He points out that some geologists believe Venezuela's Guayana shield contains about 10,000 tonnes of recoverable gold. 'Geologically, there is no doubt that the country has huge potential and in years to come could emerge to rival Australia and Canada as a leading gold producer.' However, analysts also suggest that small mining companies of the type that are at present making much fuss about their Venezuelan credentials are unlikely to win many of the potential spoils. Burns Fry's Freeman points out that the Kilometre 88 area is designated a 'wilderness area'. This means permission is required before any disturbance to the environment is permitted. The garimpeiros flouted this law and also employed traditional methods to win their gold - using mercury which devastated many areas in the Kilometre 88 region. Consequently, says Freeman, environmental law is enforced by the National Guard, 'so violators are faced by a man carrying not a clip-board but a machine-gun'. Venezuelan law also requires a number of reports to be filed regularly with the government and simply fulfilling these obligations takes time and money in Venezuela. So, 'when added to the environmental restrictions, it makes acquiring properties in that country a much more tricky proposition than, say, getting into the US'. Mr Ian Austin, Placer Dome's chief financial officer, goes even further. He suggests that only big mining companies will be able to develop gold mines in Venezuela because only big companies will be able to offer responsible environmental programmes.</p>

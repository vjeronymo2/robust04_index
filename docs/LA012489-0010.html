			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: KITTEN-CAT: WE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE  </P> <P> Another entry is heard from in the kitten-cat verse question. Who was first?  Ogden Nash ("The trouble with a kitten is THAT/Eventually it becomes a CAT") or  Richard Armour ("One dreadful truth I rather wish /I did not know is that/The  woman who is kittenish/May one day be a cat").  </P> <P> Now Ruth Merriam Spaeth comes forward with one by Carl Van Doren, which she  thinks antedates both:  </P> <P>  Gather ye kittens while you may,  </P> <P> For time brings only sorrow.  </P> <P> And the kittens of today  </P> <P> Will be old cats tomorrow.  </P> <P> "Probably Van Doren was before your time (1885-1950)" she says. "Not mine. I'm  93 now."  </P> <P> I suspect that the observation is as old as cats and man.  </P> <P> By the way, Blanche Campbell says she always thought that Richard Armour's  verse "Going to Extremes" ("Shake and shake/The catsup bottle/None will  come/And then a lot'll") actually read "none'll come" instead of "none will."  </P> <P> Armour tells me that "none will" is correct, explaining that "none'll" would  have weakened the surprise of "a lot'll" in the last line.  </P> <P> The writing of light verse is a passing affliction. Few master it as Nash,  Armour and Dorothy Parker did.  </P> <P> Merle Wollman offers her first effort in a poetry class:  </P> <P>  The sun goes down,  </P> <P> The tide drifts in.  </P> <P> Now I can start  </P> <P> My glass of gin.  </P> <P> Light verse is often employed in amorous pursuits. Screenwriter Melville  Shavelson confesses that he courted his wife with this one:  </P> <P>  Of course we should do what is proper  </P> <P> to do/And act as we're told we must;  </P> <P> And the world will say we are wise,  </P> <P> and true,/And the world will  </P> <P> say we are just.  </P> <P> But couldn't we wait for another year  </P> <P> To prove to the world our worth?  </P> <P> Oh, think of the terrible taxes, dear,  </P> <P> If we should inherit the Earth.  </P> <P> Shavelson notes: "The lady continued to resist, but she did have a sense of  humor. She married me."  </P> <P> Shavelson also recalls a verse he wrote "in the Middle Ages" as a humor  columnist for the Cornell Daily Sun:  </P> <P>  Men seldom make passes  </P> <P> At girls who wear glasses  </P> <P> So Dorothy Parker has writ.  </P> <P> But they pass at the lasses  </P> <P> Who empty their glasses,  </P> <P> Eh, Dorothy -- isn't that it?  </P> <P> Joe Ansen contributes a verse he wrote for a dinner in honor of Leon Kaplan,  Hollywood entertainment lawyer, last month:  </P> <P>  We are here to pay tribute to Lee,  </P> <P> But my brief will be brief as can be,  </P> <P> A Lawyer like Leon  </P> <P> Comes one to an eon,  </P> <P> He's as rare as a reasonable fee.  </P> <P> Dick Pettit of Laguna Beach, who says he has little time for correspondence  because the 1989 bikini season is open, recalls a verse by another of my  favorites, Samuel Hoffenstein:  </P> <P>  You have a most attractive pan  </P> <P> And I'm a very foolish man  </P> <P> And in between the two I fell  </P> <P> As deep as Dante into hell.  </P> <P> My favorite Hoffenstein is this one:  </P> <P> The ocean spills upon the sands  </P> <P> Water with a thousand hands  </P> <P> And when the ocean all is spilled  </P> <P> The sand is dry, the ocean filled.  </P> <P> I discovered Hoffenstein in my teens and bought his book, "Poems in Praise of  Practically Nothing." Their nature can be guessed from some of his chapter  titles: "Songs to Break the Tedium of Riding a Bicycle, Seeing One's Friends,  or Heartbreak"; "Poems of Passion Carefully Restrained So as to Offend Nobody";  "Poems Intended to Incite the Utmost Depression"; "Poems of Fairly Utter  Despair."  </P> <P> A few years ago I found a copy of the 1928 first edition (autographed to Mrs.  Ann Baum) at Smith's Acre of Books in Long Beach. It still had the jacket, in  almost mint condition, with a blurb by Dorothy Parker: "Were I to be cast alone  on a desert island (this) would be the book I should wish to have along with  me!" H. L. Mencken said: "Incomparable."  </P> <P> What happened to light verse? Here's a clue from Ogden Nash:  </P> <P>  I'd rather flunk my Wasserman test  </P> <P> Than read the poems of Edgar Guest.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Unity relief masks ERM fears IT WAS, as they say, a game of two halves in the foreign exchange markets yesterday. The turning point between nervousness and relief was marked by the German ruling on the Maastricht Treaty, writes Peter John. Dealers bought D-Marks first thing and sold rival currencies as a hedge against the possibility that the German constitutional court would decide that the Treaty on European Union was unconstitutional in its current form and might ask for changes. A negative vote was expected to throw concern over the exchange rate mechanism into relief and sent European currencies except the D-Mark down sharply; any vote to reject Maastricht would have given the German authorities more freedom with economic policy. The effect of the position taking was heightened by thin trading in the aftermath of public holidays in Japan and the US on Monday and the D-Mark rose against the Belgian Franc, the French Franc the dollar and sterling and the Lira. Then, at midday European time, the court announced that the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary and Economic Union was constitutional and in accord with the country's democratic principles. The few caveats were less exacting than feared but most of the hard hit currencies only experienced short-lived gains. Economists said the early selling reflected wider concerns over the European exchange rate mechanism, which were beginning to resurface and the impending court judgment was the catalyst. Also, the D-Mark was held up by overseas buying of bunds as a shift to a variable repo increased hope that interest rates might fall soon. Sterling was down at DM2.4385 at one stage, within a whisker of a five-month low reached at the end of September. It closed at DM2.4450, still a pfennig down on balance. The Belgian franc hit BFr21.81 at one stage and closed barely changed at BFr21.77. The French franc fell to a low of FFr3.5160 against the D-Mark and only recovered to FFr3.5120. It was marginally higher than Monday's close of FFr3.5140 but failed to be ignited by positive comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister. The Italian lira hit L990.75 and clawed its way back to L986.10 against the D-Mark up from L990.20. Most surprisingly, the dollar failed to recover gain earlier weakness. It reached a low of DM1.5935 before the judgment was given and bounced briefly to DM1.6020 afterwards. Subsequently it drifted back again to close nearly a cent lower in London at DM1.5960. Mr Brian Hilliard at SGST, the French-owned securities house, said: 'The disappointment for the dollar is that whenever there has been an opportunity for a rally - first the Russian crisis and now this - it has failed to hang on to its gains.'</p>

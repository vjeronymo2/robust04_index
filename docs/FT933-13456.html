			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Efim liquidation blocked by EC subsidies dispute: Deadlock over Pounds 2.93bn for banks and suppliers A BITTER dispute between Italy and the European Commission over state subsidies is blocking disbursement of L7,000bn (Pounds 2.93bn) earmarked by the Italian government to pay banks and suppliers owed money by Efim, the state industrial holding company placed in liquidation last July. Italian officials maintain that if the matter is not resolved quickly, the liquidation process risks being undermined and the cost of the operation increased. Already the eventual cost of liquidating Efim - which controls about 120 companies ranging from helicopter makers to health spas - is expected to be as much as L17,000bn. The group has debts of L18,000bn. Representatives of foreign banks, seeking to recover principal and interest on L3,500bn, were told bluntly last week at a meeting in Rome with the Treasury: 'Don't blame us, blame Brussels.' The banks had suspected the Treasury of using the stance taken by Brussels as an excuse not to pay, but they now accept the deadlock is genuine. The matter is all the more embarrassing to the Italian government since the original liquidation announcement was so badly handled that it affected Italy's international credit rating. The banks were not consulted in advance and were initially led to expect a two-year moratorium with repayment at below market rates of interest on what amounted to sovereign debt. The Efim funds have been blocked since April on the grounds that they constitute a form of unfair aid, albeit retrospective, to state-owned companies invoking articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty of Rome. EC officials insist it is a question of Italy conforming to the rules. The Italians have countered by saying the liquidation process is precisely to prevent the state from subsidising the Efim group of companies further. The Treasury also maintains it has a legal obligation to honour the debts since Efim has been recognised in effect as sovereign risk. The foreign banks meanwhile are angry at the way Brussels is telling them that they should have checked more carefully whether the Efim subsidiaries were unfairly subsidised by the state. Italian officials believe the liquidation of Efim has been caught up in the broader conflict between Italy and the EC over state subsidies to industry. Italy is currently refusing to accept the view of Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, that writing off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) of aid to Ilva, the state steel producer, amounts to state assistance.

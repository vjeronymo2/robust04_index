			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Electronics Industry Association said that average remote control power is 4W, while some are as low as 2W; electronic tuning uses less than 1W, brightness sensor less than 1W. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 3&hyph;4). Thomson said that remote control uses 3&hyph;6W and that a brightness sensor consumes essentially no power in itself and offers no energy benefit not otherwise available to the consumer by using the customary picture control adjustments. (Thomson, No. 49 at 6, 7). The Electronic Industries Association provided data on voltage-regulating power supplies. It said that a change in the type of regulator from shunting to switching can save approximately six watts at an additional cost of $1.50. Other comments were provided for other design options, but no additional data were submitted. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considered all comments on design options by analyzing standby power; power supply efficiency improvements, including voltage-regulating power supplies; and step down transformers for electronic tuning. These design options are shown in the cost/efficiency tables in the Technical Support Document. Data submitted by the Electronic Industries Association and previously submitted data from manufacturers were used to develop these tables. While a switch to allow consumers to turn off the remote control portion of the television (suggested by the Rocky Mountain Institute) would likely save some energy, the amount would be determined by consumer behavior and is not predictable. The Department discovered no data on improved transformer materials with low core loss nor any data on the energy use, as measured according to DOE test procedure, for the German models. The Department did develop data on Japanese models measured according to its test procedure. These data were included in the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several comments questioned the feasibility of establishing energy conservation standards for television sets. The Electronic Industries Association said that television set efficiency has improved over the years because manufacturers have been steadily limiting power to reduce internal heat. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 2). Thomson said there is little, if any, opportunity for further reductions in energy use. Thomson also said the major factors that influence energy use are controlled by the consumer: Operating hours, brightness, sound level, and control settings. (Thomson, No. 49 at 2&hyph;6). The Electronic Industries Association argued that efficiency standards would impede the development of high definition television. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 6). G&amp;A Consultancy suggested that DOE ``not place retarding restrictions upon television sets because precluding the television set's potential role as an energy control may inadvertently deny the American homeowner a far more valuable system of energy savings.'' (G&amp;A Consultancy, No. 50 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considered all these comments in the decision-making process for television set standards. With regard to such standards precluding the potential for a television set to become a home energy controller, it is the Department's belief that if television sets were transformed to home energy controllers, the nature of the appliance might have changed sufficiently for it to be considered a new appliance. If so, it would not be a covered product and subject to an energy conservation standard for television sets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments stated that standards are inappropriate for television sets, stating that they already are energy efficient, leaving little room for improvement. (Electronic Industries Association, No. 30 at 7; Thomson, No. 49 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department analyzed television set standard levels by the methodology proposed in the advance notice, thereby taking into account the costs and benefits of any potential efficiency improvements. The Department found that the efficiency of the typical television set can be improved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Product-Specific Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Room Air Conditioners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range of standard levels for room air conditioners. Table 4&hyph;1 presents the seven efficiency levels selected for analysis for the twelve classes of room air conditioners. Level 7 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Niyazov and K. </F> Zhigitekov, sociologists: "What the Scales of Public Opinion  Show; Pre-Session Rating of Republic's Leaders (Results of  November Poll)"]    [Text]    [Begin boxed material]    In the period from 19 through 26 November of the current  year, our sociological group conducted a routine questionnaire  survey of respondents.    A total of 1,978 persons were polled. The sampling was  distributed as follows:    BY REGIONS: In the city of Bishkek 272 respondents were  surveyed; in Osh Oblast--623; in Dzhalal-Abad Oblast--359; in  Issyk-Kula Oblast--191; in Naryn Oblast--109; in Chuysk  Oblast--338, and in Talas Oblast--86 respondents.    BY SEX: Men - 1,034 (52.3 percent), women - 944 (47.7  percent).    BY NATIONALITY: Kyrgyz - 1,217 persons (61.5 percent),  Russians - 380 (19.2 percent), Uzbeks - 237 (12 percent),  Kazakhs - 30 (1.5 percent), Germans - 25 (1.2 percent), and  other nationalities - 89 (4.5 percent).    BY AGE: Respondents under 20 years of age - 158 persons (8  percent); 20 to 29 years of age - 588 (29.7 percent); 30 to 39  years of age - 604 (30.5 percent); 40 to 49 years of age - 388  (19.6 percent); 50 to 59 years of age - 153 (7.7 percent), 60  and over - 87 (4.4 percent).    BY OCCUPATION: Blue-collar workers - 398 (20.1 percent);  workers in agriculture - 324 (16.4 percent); employees in state  institutions - 878 (44.4 percent); entrepreneurs - 42 (2.1  percent); students and trainees - 140 (7.1 percent); housewives  and pensioners - 127 (6.4 percent); unemployed persons - 69 (3.5  percent).    [End boxed material]    We posed a number of questions concerning the current  socio-political situation in the republic. Today we present to  the reader part of the responses, in which the respondents give  an evaluation of the republic and oblast leadership, as well as  their attitude toward the Constitution and the Zhogorku Kenesh.    The political processes during our transitional period are  rather fast-moving. We believe many readers recall with  nostalgia that "stagnant" period when certain leaders could  spend decades at the head of structural subdivisions which  provided comfortable positions for them. That time has passed,  never to return. The political situation today changes  practically every week. It is influenced by numerous factors,  domestic as well as foreign, objective as well as subjective,  central as well as regional. The effort by certain regions to  exert pressure on the course of the current session was felt not  only by the deputies, but also by inexperienced listeners and  viewers. Therefore, in every case in our publications we also  give readers the responses in a regional cross-section. (Tables  1 and 2).    Table 1.

Assuming this fact, we also included questions on this, which  for some is really the "thirteenth," session. The results are  presented below. We will not comment on them at this time,  leaving this possibility for the future. (Tables 3 and 4).    [End boxed material]    Table 3.

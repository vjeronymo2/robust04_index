			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Heir steps in to take the encore: Richard Waters reports on how Wells Fargo, the US bank, plans to sustain growth Mr Carl Reichardt has decided to quit while he is ahead. The 63-year-old Texan heads what is generally regarded as one of the best-run big US commercial banks, with stock market ratings to match. Driven by falling costs and expansion into mutual funds and other investment products, Wells Fargo's shares have jumped from under Dollars 15 when Mr Reichardt took over to more than Dollars 150. They are now trading at nearly 2.3 times the bank's book value, and a multiple of 10.5 times this year's projected earnings. The question now is, what can it do for an encore? Mr Reichardt announced last Tuesday that he will retire at the end of this year, after 12 years as the bank's chairman and chief executive. The move clears the way for Mr Paul Hazen to take over. Currently the bank's president, 54-year-old Mr Hazen has already served as Mr Reichardt's number two for a decade. Mr Reichardt and Mr Hazen flew to Philadelphia two weeks ago to break the news to Mr Warren Buffet, the US investor who is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. 'He doesn't think people should retire - ever,' Mr Reichardt said. Mr Buffett's close interest in who is at the helm of the San Francisco-based bank is understandable. He bought 10 per cent of Wells Fargo's shares in 1990 for around Dollars 290m (Pounds 187m), and has since taken his stake to 12.6 per cent - a holding worth slightly more than Dollars 1bn. Mr Buffett last week declared himself 'more than comfortable with the new leadership'. Mr Hazen indicated that he intended to continue with the formula that made his double-act with Mr Reichardt a success. 'There's a lot of growth still in the basic businesses,' he said. The next two to three years will be spent increasing Wells Fargo's market share with a number of products: he singles out car leasing, investment products and consumer lending. He also talks of expanding Wells Fargo's commercial property lending again. Despite the market downturn at the end of the 1980s, 'when you look at it over a whole cycle, returns were extraordinary', he says. Heavy commercial property lending was nearly the death of Wells Fargo. Its Dollars 13bn of loans at the end of 1990, against shareholders' funds of Dollars 3.4bn, made it the most exposed big bank in the country to the property downturn (its share price halved, to around Dollars 40, in a matter of weeks during the summer of 1990). Unlike many others, it did not rush to liquidate loans. Many of the assets recorded as non-performing today yield around 8.5 per cent in cash. 'That's a hell of a non-performing portfolio.' According to Mr Reichardt, over the past six months Wells Fargo has begun 'buying portfolios - we have been actively looking at troubled loans'. Internal rates of return on these investments are in the range of 20-30 per cent, he says. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo seems unlikely in the near future to take any of the radical steps being considered last year: a big bank merger, for example, or a move to give up its status as a bank holding company altogether. Many US bank chairmen talk whimsically of dropping their bank charters: it would liberate them from the costs of the federal deposit and insurance fund and the equal lending provisions that, bankers claim, put them at a disadvantage to non-bank rivals. It also 'gives the holding company greater flexibility in its activities, as well greater flexibility in who can own it', said Mr Hazen. Wells Fargo got further than most in debating the issue. However, the alternative that it considered - becoming a savings and loan institution - would have brought its own limitations, principally in the form of a restriction on the bank's ability to make commercial loans. Despite this, the issue of whether to give up being a bank 'is still one we might look at from time to time', Mr Hazen says. Nor does Wells Fargo seem likely to become involved soon in a big takeover or merger. Mr Reichardt talks with regret of his failure to persuade First Interstate, the bank's Los Angeles-based neighbour, to agree to a merger last year. He adds: 'I think that from a theoretical standpoint, putting together two large branch systems like this . . . and being able to take out Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m expenses a year is a sensible business proposition.' With Dollars 54bn in assets against Wells Fargo's Dollars 52bn and an extensive branch system in the western US First Interstate would have provided a springboard for the bank to mount a stronger challenge to BankAmerica, the giant West Coast bank created by the merger with Security Pacific two years ago. Jilted by First Interstate, Mr Reichardt now talks of spending the bank's money on buying its own shares instead. With a tier one capital ratio of 10.1 per cent, Wells Fargo is well endowed with capital. The bank has just approved purchases of up to 10 per cent of its own shares (though it has set no timetable for the exercise) at a cost of around Dollars 800m at the current share price. The buy-back programme will help to support the bank's earnings per share in the short term. But it does not answer the bigger question of how Wells Fargo can maintain the earnings growth that made Mr Reichardt, according to Forbes magazine, 'Warren Buffett's favourite banker.'</p>

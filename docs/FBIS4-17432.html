			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayev and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 23 Apr -- Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev  and Sergey Baburin, the head of a Russian State Duma delegation  and coordinator of the deputy's group Russian Path, who met  today in Baku, spoke out in favor of restoring, developing, and  strengthening ties between Azerbaijan and Russia.    On the issue of the situation of Russians in Azerbaijan, the  president stressed that they are and always have been an  integral part of society, citizens of the republic with full  rights. He said that "Azerbaijan's multi-ethnicity, its  different languages, and use of Russian in many spheres have  played an important role in the development and making of the  culture of the people of Azerbaijan."    Geydar Aliyev familiarized the Russian parliamentarians with  the current situation in the conflict zone between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. He said that Azerbaijan was making efforts toward a  peaceful settlement of the conflict, but that the republic's  interests have to be taken into account. Russia, in whom  Azerbaijan holds great hopes, has not yet adopted a position in  principle on this issue, he believes.    The leader of Azerbaijan believes that some progress in the  peacekeeping process could be made if Russian President Boris  Yeltsin were to visit the region. He said that this was  proposed to the Russian leader and that Azerbaijan are ready to  provide for his security during his stay here.</p>

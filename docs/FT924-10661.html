			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: UAL blames summer fare wars for 14% decline UAL, parent of United Airlines and one of the three biggest US carriers, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent decline in third-quarter net income. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, described the results as 'exceptionally poor for what is traditionally the strongest quarter in the airline industry'. For the three months to September 30, UAL had net earnings of Dollars 21.5m, or 89 cents a share, against earnings of Dollars 25m, or Dollars 1.05 a year earlier. United's weak third-quarter earnings follow particularly poor third-quarter performances from the other two US mega-carriers. AMR, parent of American Airlines, posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 85m, its worst results for a July-September period, and Delta reported a net deficit of Dollars 106.7m. The fares wars over the summer hurt United's yields - passenger revenue per mile flown - in spite of an increased load factor. System revenue passenger yield fell 6.3 per cent in the quarter to 11.26 cents, while United's load factor rose 4.1 per cent to 76.1 per cent. Looking to the fourth quarter, Mr Wolf said: 'We are concerned with booking levels, particularly in our Pacific division, where soft demand reflects current Japanese economic conditions.' In addition, UAL's yields remain under pressure, although Mr Wolf expects them to firm considerably from their low, third-quarter levels. At the operating level, UAL saw income advance 16.4 per cent to Dollars 68m from Dollars 58m, while operating revenues rose 10.5 per cent to Dollars 3.24bn from Dollars 3.58bn. Operating costs were 10.4 per cent higher at Dollars 3.51bn. America West Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, posted a third-quarter operating loss of Dollars 17.2m and said its results were hit hard by the industry-wide summer discounts. During the quarter, the company took restructuring charges of Dollars 31.3m and incurred reorganisation expenses of Dollars 8.5m. A year earlier, America West had reorganising charges of Dollars 43.4m. Including these items, net loss narrowed to Dollars 70.8m, or Dollars 2.97, from Dollars 85.2m, or Dollars 3.77, in the 1991 quarter. Mr Michael Conway, chief executive, said passenger yields started to improve in September and 'upcoming holiday bookings are strong. Accordingly, we are anticipating a return to positive cash flow from our operations in the fourth quarter'.</p>

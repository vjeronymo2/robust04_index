			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores weak There were a variety of bearish stories doing the rounds in a muted stores sector. Boots and Kingfisher were under pressure from talk that one of the big supermarket operators was about to embark on a promotion of its toiletries range which could lead the way to margin pressures similar to those that have afflicted the food sectors. Stores analysts were largely dismissive of talk of a 'cosmetic price war', arguing that the supermarkets were unlikely to add to their already tough margin pressures. Kingfisher was also undermined by nervousness ahead of Darty's postponed results on Friday. The shares slid 12 to 719p, although turnover was thin. Boots was additionally pressured by a big seller. The stock fell 15 1/2 to 534 1/2 p. Meanhwile, the stores sector continued to be plagued with rumours of dull pre-Christmas sales. Signet, which has been one of the worst hit stocks, yesterday managed a half-penny recovery to 17 1/2 p. But elsewhere, WH Smith 'A' dipped 3 to 507p, Storehouse 3 to 229p, Marks and Spencer 2 to 444p and Dixons 1 to 284p.</p>

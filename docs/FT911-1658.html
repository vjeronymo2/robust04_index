			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Observer: Desk reading What's so special about chief executives' desks? SQ Mile magazine, a new quarterly glossy for City folk, has decided to find out. It has come up with the rather quirky idea of handing a psychologist pictures of the desks of captains of industry and finance, and asking him what they reveal about the owner. For instance, who's this? 'He is an analyst, first and foremost, a man of formidable intellect and powers of cognate penetration. He reaches out and clutches the heart of the matter in The Meeting, his assistants or enemies have long since lost their nerves and minds. Never to his face, some unkind observers have described him as a 'bit of a cold fish'.' Answer: Sir Eric Parker, chief executive of Trafalgar House. Oddly enough, SQ Mile belongs to Simon Broackes, son of Trafalgar House's ritzy Sir Nigel. The magazine is also getting the psychologist to answer readers' queries. The next, to be shrinked in the summer issue, is: How can I tell if my managing director is mad? The questioner is 'a chairman'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eros Bicic: "Tudjman `Fires' on Italy"] </F>   [Text] Pisino -- Yesterday the Croatian regime endeavored  to celebrate the Anti-Fascist Struggle Day, thus attempting to  convince the world that the Croatian people, and therefore  present-day Croatia, also made a major contribution toward  overthrowing Nazism and Fascism. However, in his celebratory  speech held in Pisino, in the heart of Istria, Croatian  President Tudjman did not resist the temptation to fire point  blank on Italy, the Italian minority in Istria, and Istrian  autonomist aspirations.    Speaking of the Italian minority in Croatia, Tudjman said  that most of its members had collaborated with the Fascist  regime, although he acknowledged that some Italians had joined  the struggle waged by the partisan forces which, however, had  been led from Croatian territory.    He did not say a word about native Italians or the Istrian  exodus, but added another threatening, retaliatory sentence:  "Democratic Croatia favors cooperation with a democratic Italy,  and will respect the rights of the Italian ethnic group in  accordance with international conventions, but we request the  same rights to be recognized for the Croatian minority in Italy,  from Trieste to Molise, a minority which is larger than the  Italian minority in Istria."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems have  prepared a plan for the execution of Serbs captured in the area  of Mt. Ozren in northeastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb sources have  told TANJUG.    The Bosnian Serb humanitarian aid organisation has apprised  the International Committee of the Red cross (I.C.R.C.) office  in Bijeljina about the planned execution of the Serbs captured  on Mt. Ozren, and appealed to the I.C.R.C. officials to take the  necessary steps to save the captives' lives.    In a letter to the I.C.R.C. office, the Serb humanitarian  organisation says that Moslem extremists have brutally murdered  and then mutilated the bodies of large numbers of captured Serbs  in the course of this war, especially in the areas of Fakovici,  Kamenica, Kravica near Milic, Brcko and elsewhere in eastern  Bosnia.    In mid-1992, Moslem troops stormed and torched 43 Serb  villages in eastern Bosnia, massacring 960 Serb civilians,  mostly old men, women and children.    Serbs who have fled Tuzla with Croat help for  Serb-controlled  territories testify that the position of their ethnic kin in  Tuzla is worsening, with the town's Moslem authorities evicting  them from their homes and taking them away in an unknown  direction.    In fear of their lives, Serbs in Tuzla are taking shelter  with Croat families in the area, witnesses say.</p>

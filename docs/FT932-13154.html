			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Money Markets: Rates fall again THERE were continuing expectations of lower interest rates in parts of Europe yesterday after the Bundesbank unexpectedly eased its discount rate by 25 basis points at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz. Following the German move, the Bank of France said that it was cutting its intervention rate from 8.75 per cent to 8.50 per cent with effect from Monday. At the same time, it also cut its 5-10 day rate, the effective ceiling to market rates, by 25 basis points to 9.50 per cent. The move helped to push down French money market rates. One month French francs dropped from about 9.30 per cent to around 8.40 per cent at the end of the day. The June French franc contract rose 13 basis points at one stage, but later closed a net 3 basis points up on the day at 92.01. Inside Germany, the cost of cash also fell sharply to accommodate the new structure of German rates. Call money was quoted at around 7.50 per cent at the end of the day from a previous close of 7.80 per cent. Dealers said the official rate cuts had combined with a surplus of liquidity in the German banking system to bring the cost of call money down. However, the easing of conditions in the German cash market coincided with a sell-off in most Euromark futures contracts. The June contract fell 15 basis points to close at 92.67. The September contract was down 17 basis points to a close of 93.48. One dealer said the sell-off reflected the belief that Thursday's rally had been too euphoric. The easing of interest rates had also raised fears of higher inflation in the bund market, leading to a fall in German bond prices which had an impact on currency futures. Conditions in the sterling cash market were very tight after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. Bills were only offered in the afternoon and the overnight rate peaked at 7.5 per cent. Three-month money remained unchanged at around 6 per cent. The June short sterling contract fell 9 basis points on the day, to close at 93.84. This followed speculation that base rates had bottomed at 6 per cent following yesterday's stronger-than-expected retail sales figures for March showing a 0.5 per cent increase on the month.</p>

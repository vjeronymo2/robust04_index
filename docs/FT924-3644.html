			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Slovene president set for re-election INITIAL election results in Slovenia yesterday showed President Milan Kucan headed for a landslide victory in his bid for re-election, winning 64 per cent of votes in the first elections since the republic broke away from Yugoslavia in June 1991. The new 130-seat bicameral parliament seemed likely to be split among a leftist coalition, liberal and centre-right parties. The Liberal Democratic Party looked set to be the biggest parliamentary party, with 27 per cent of the ballot, according to a television exit poll. The Slovene National Party headed by ultra-nationalist Mr Zmago Jelincic had 9.8 per cent. But many Slovenes in Ljubljana, the capital, yesterday worried whether Mr Jelincic would win support. He has called for the expulsion of some 130,000 guest-workers from the former Yugoslavia. Mr Peter Bekes of the reformed Communists' party warned against playing down the significance of Mr Jelincic's popularity. 'Hitler at first captured only 3 per cent of the vote.' Turnout was expected to be high throughout the republic. Results are expected today. Amid battles in Bosnia, General Aly Abdul Razek, the commander of UN forces in Sarajevo, at the weekend declared the failure of their peacekeeping mission. He called on the international community to set a one-month deadline before intervening militarily to end the war in Bosnia, where Serbs have seized control of 70 per cent of the republic. In Sarajevo, fighting intensified after Serb forces continued their onslaught on the Bosnian capital as they seized control of Otes, a key western suburb.</p>

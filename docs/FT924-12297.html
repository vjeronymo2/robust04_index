			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (7): It was love at first sight - Profile of Bosch THREE years ago this week the first contractors moved on to the Pounds 100m site outside Cardiff chosen by Bosch as its UK home for production of a new generation of lightweight, compact alternators for the motor industry. Fifteen months later, just after New Year's day 1991, Bosch, the German power-tools-to-hydraulics and car parts company that is a world leader as a motor supplier, pressed the buttons that saw the first alternators come off the production line. Gerhard Turner, Bosch's commercial director at the plant, and one of the few Germans with the company in Wales, says that when the project team first saw the area it was 'love at first sight'. Subsequently, production has accelerated smoothly, targets have been met and the millionth alternator came off the line just eight months after the factory was officially opened by Mr David Hunt, the secretary of state for Wales. Despite the recession and the collapse of sales of cars and lorries across Europe, Bosch is on target to produce the two-millionth piece of this specialist equipment before the end of this year and the plant now employs 670 people. The investment, says Mr Turner, has been money very well spent. By 1995 it expects to be employing 1,200. Bosch chose Cardiff as part of a clearly thought-out strategy. 'We have an imbalance between what we produce in Germany and what we produce in the rest of the world,' Mr Turner says. 'So the company has been looking for some years to boost its non-German production.' Given that strategy, the UK was chosen because of the strength of the domestic motor industry, boosted in the previous decade by the arrival of first Nissan in the north-east, then Honda at Swindon and Toyota in Derbyshire (together with its engine plant in north Wales). 'The renaissance of the British motor industry was very important to us,' Turner says. 'We had a new product, one that depended on new models for acceptance. The number of new companies in Britain producing those new models meant the British market was almost designed for us.' Britain was not the only location Bosch could have chosen. The Stuttgart-based company is wary about revealing its detailed thinking but after a working group had been set up in 1988 to look at expansion Spain was a clear possibility. So, too, was the US and the Far East, both of which have subsequently been sites for Bosch investment. For Bosch the discovery of the commercial delights of Wales has enabled it to join a large and growing club. The principality has been indelibly linked with Japanese companies such as Sony, now one of the country's largest manufacturing employers, Panasonic, Brother and Yuasa Batteries ever since Takiron pioneered the way in 1972. If the Japanese have basked in the spotlight other countries have also chosen Wales. Bosch is only one of 49 German companies now in the principality and there are more than 100 from the US. German companies represent 15 per cent of the number of overseas companies in Wales, with names such as Ina Bearing, Alfred Teves and Rehau in the manufacturing field recently joined by financial-services group Das. These companies now employ more than 3,000 people and with Ina having just completed a Pounds 15m expansion programme at Llanelli and Teves having undertaken a Pounds 14.3m investment at Ebbw Vale they clearly see the future as good. Having decided its strategy, Bosch chose Wales rather than another site in the UK because of its infrastructure, especially its road links with the rest of the country, and the availability of good labour. The plant sits within sight of the M4 motorway half a dozen miles west of Cardiff, an area where industrial relations have always been good. Wales was the first part of the UK to accept single-union plant deals and Bosch quickly settled on a deal with the then electricians, now part of the engineers. Within Wales the response was also encouraging. The then secretary of state, Mr Peter Walker, actively massaged relations at the personal level with top management in Stuttgart and Mr Turner concedes 'there was great co-operation not only from the Welsh Office but also from the Welsh Development Agency and the local authorities. 'What we found was that the authorities had all the necessary permissions on matters such as planning that we wanted. So we were able to get from plan to production in the shortest possible time.' This infrastructure of aid had been honed by co-operative action among all the bodies concerned with inward investment for some years. Earlier this month, for instance, Welsh secretary David Hunt completed a swing around the Far East 'selling' the attractions of Wales. He was accompanied by Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, and officials. If there is a downside for the company it is that vocational training in Wales, like so much of the rest of Britain, is not thought to be as good as in Germany. 'There is no equivalent to the way in which we undertake vocational training,' Mr Turner says. 'We had to set up training programmes to match our needs and were very fortunate in having the greatest co-operation of the local authorities.' Bosch is 'not dissatisfied' with what has emerged. Nor is Wales. So far the company only sources a fifth of its bought-in parts from the UK. Most of the rest comes from Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium. The devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark could give a push towards greater local sourcing. Nissan in the motor industry and companies such Sony and Panasonic in consumer electronics have shown it is possible to find suppliers in Britain able to produce the right goods at the right quality standards. Bosch is confident it will, too, which will do a lot for the local economy.</p>

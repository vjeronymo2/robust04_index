			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Japan negotiates plan to lift flagging economy JAPAN'S ruling coalition yesterday opened what is set to be painful internal bargaining over a plan to lift the flagging economy, due to be tabled in mid-September. Government departments have proposed more than 70 deregulation measures, although details are still confidential, said ministers after a cabinet meeting. The Japan Research Institute, a private body, estimated that more than 1m new jobs and over Y10 trillion (Pounds 64bn) worth of demand could be created by curbing government regulations on industry. However, the outcome depends on the details of the proposals and how many of them survive the intense inter-ministerial bargaining. An indication of the difficulties ahead came when Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, yesterday quashed speculation that the government would cut income tax to try to stimulate consumer spending. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, wants tax reductions, but the powerful bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry administration oppose cuts. Mr Fujii himself used to be a Finance Ministry bureaucrat as director general of the powerful budget bureau. One controversial draft proposal made public yesterday is to ease the present 2,000 kilolitre-per-year minimum production allowed for Japanese brewers. If made law, this would break the 30-year, four-company oligopoly of Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory - the only brewers big enough to qualify - and is likely to run into fierce opposition from them. Mr Ishida will hold an emergency meeting with ministerial colleagues responsible for the economy next Tuesday before starting negotiations with the ministries involved. Further evidence of Japan's deepening economic gloom came yesterday from the latest jobless figures, showing there were only 72 job offers for every 100 applicants last month - the lowest for six years - down from 74 in June. However, the unemployment rate remains unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 2.5 per cent. Consumer spending remains sluggish, as big retailers yesterday said sales fell 5 per cent last month from the same period last year, the 14th consecutive monthly drop. These figures add weight to fears that the recovery might be further away than some government economists had expected and will increase already heavy pressure on the coalition to find a way to improve consumer confidence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wei Wei (7279 0251): "NATO Expansion and the </F> 'Partnership for Peace' Program"]    [Text] Beginning this month, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization [NATO] dispatched delegations one after another to  central and eastern European countries to explain the substance  of its "partnership for peace" program so that those countries  would sign the "framework document of partnership for peace"  more quickly. By 8 February, six central and eastern European  countries including Romania, Hungary, and Ukraine had signed the  document with NATO, and thus the promotion of the "partnership  for peace" program was quickly started.    The so-called "partnership for peace" program was initiated  by the United States and adopted by the NATO summit meeting on  10 January, with a view to not letting central and eastern  European counties join NATO immediately, so as to avoid  irritating Russia, but allowing them to join in stages: First,  by signing the "treaty of partnership for peace" with NATO, then  strengthening military and political cooperation, and finally  join the organization.    The issue of NATO expansion has been raised for many years.  Nevertheless, as central and eastern European countries and  Russia on the one hand, and NATO states on the other, have their  own interests and calculations on the issue, NATO has found it  difficult to pursue expansion.    Central and east European countries have an urgent demand to  join NATO. Since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact, led by  the Soviet Union, in 1991, NATO has become the only military  bloc in Europe. To seek a security guarantee, former Warsaw  Pact states, such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia, asked for NATO membership one after another.  Particularly in recent months, the rise of the Russian  nationalist forces has caused worry that the development of the  Moscow situation would pose a threat to them. Therefore, they  became increasingly eager to join NATO. On 5 January, Polish  President Lech Walesa openly accused Western countries of taking  "a passive attitude" toward the demands of such countries as  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join NATO and  stressed that this would "cause the East to begin to pursue a  policy that will not necessarily satisfy the West" and "cause a  greater and greater threat to security in Europe."    One important reason NATO has not boldly entered the East is  Russia's firm opposition. Russian President Boris Yeltsin  maintained: NATO expansion to central and eastern European  countries would make Russia "feel being isolated and  surrounded." He warned that if countries bordering on Russia  joined NATO it would lead to military and political instability.  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev more pointedly said:  "The process of NATO expanding its membership poses a certain  threat to Russia." He stated: If NATO expands its sphere of  influence to areas near Russia's borders, Russia will need to  reconsider its defense concepts, including reorganization and  redeployment of its armed forces and changes in operations  planning. The Russians contend: Eastern Europe's security must  be "jointly safeguarded" by Russia and NATO.    In fact, NATO does not necessarily hope to immediately  absorb  the former Warsaw Pact member states for several reasons:  First, the current social and political situation of Poland,  Hungary, and the Czech Republic is not stable and national  conflicts continue to emerge, and NATO is worried that if these  countries become its members, its member states will surely be  involved in state-to-state conflicts. Second, NATO is a  collective organization rather than an organization providing  aid to other countries. A NATO state will be given membership  only after having assumed necessary economic responsibility.  But at present, the central and eastern European countries  which have asked to join NATO have not been able to rid  themselves of their economic crises and are still unable to  shoulder economic responsibility, and none of the 16 NATO member  states is willing to pay the amount of money required for their  poor brothers. Third, NATO is a military bloc. Eastern European  countries are far, far behind NATO states in terms of military  equipment, logistics, telecommunications, training, and command  systems. According to specialists' estimates, it will take 10  years for central and eastern European countries to reach the  NATO armed forces' levels. It can thus be seen that NATO is not  well prepared for accepting those countries as new members, both  militarily and financially.    The United States is taking a prudent attitude toward NATO  expansion. One of the three pillars of U.S. foreign policy is  expanding the camp of "democratic" countries. Adhering to this  principle, naturally, it hopes that eastern European countries  and the former Soviet republics will join NATO. However, it  worries that this will give Russia a sense of isolation and  irritate Russia's "ultra-Right forces." In order not to offend  Russia, and at the same time, not disappoint the central and  eastern European countries wishing to joint NATO, the United  States initiated a compromise "partnership for peace" program,  which opens doors for the former Warsaw Pact states to join NATO  and at the same time, pointed out that NATO expansion "is a long  process of gradual advance."    Of course, the "partnership for peace" program includes two  obvious U.S. intentions, namely, continuing to control Europe  while reducing its own defense responsibility on the continent.  The developed countries of the world are mostly concentrated in  Europe. At the present stage and for a considerably long period  of time to come, Europe is and will still be the center of  international struggle. Moreover, the United States' allies are  chiefly in Europe. For the United States to become the leader  of the West and the world, first of all, it must maintain its  leading position in Europe. Therefore, after the end of the  Cold War, the United States still intends to have 100,000 troops  stationed in Europe. While putting forth the "partnership for  peace" program, the United States also supports NATO and former  Warsaw Pact member states in establishing "a multinational task  force" which is able to maintain peacekeeping operations in the  European region without U.S. participation. Apparently, this  program will help lighten the United States' burdens and drop  the idea of some European countries favoring an armed force  outside NATO, thus maintaining U.S. influence in Europe. If  NATO expands to Russia's borders overnight, it will be directly  exposed to Russia's forward position and the United States will  thus lose a buffer zone. Moreover, eastern Europe and Russia  are instable areas. As such, the United States will be easily  involved in these areas. This is what the United States is  doing its utmost to avoid.</p>

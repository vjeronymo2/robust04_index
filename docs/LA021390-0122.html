			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO VOTE ON GUN DEALER MEASURE  </P> <P> After more than a month of discussions, the City Council is expected to vote  tonight on an ordinance that would require local gun dealers selling  concealable firearms to register with the Police Department and pay an annual  $200 licensing fee.  </P> <P> About 50 local gun dealers and gun owners protested the ordinance when it was  last considered in January and the council decided to postpone a vote on the  measure until it could be discussed among the interested parties.  </P> <P> Many gun dealers argue that the licensing fee is too expensive, and that the  city ordinance would be redundant because state and federal regulations already  require gun dealers to be registered.  </P> <P> The city proposed the ordinance earlier this year after the state attorney  general issued an opinion recommending that local law enforcement agencies  register businesses selling concealable firearms such as pistols and revolvers.  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's Department and the cities of Cypress and Fountain  Valley have also decided to impose licensing fees in the wake of the attorney  general's opinion.  </P></p>

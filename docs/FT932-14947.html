			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Nigeria reverses 90-day ruling on letters of credit THE Central Bank of Nigeria has withdrawn its 90-day moratorium on payment of all letters of credit, a ruling introduced on March 1 which drew strong criticism from the business community and damaged Nigeria's credibility with foreign suppliers. A circular issued by the central bank says that payment for transactions under confirmed and irrevocable letters of credit at sight is again permissible. The change of policy is back-dated to March 1 enabling suppliers to be credited without further delay. The private sector in Nigeria has welcomed the decision, which is seen as an admission of error by the bank. One banker said: 'The 90-day rule showed a serious lack of understanding of commercial procedures on the part of leading central bankers.' The bank's justification for the 90-day ruling in March was to stop abuses of the exchange rate system. Bankers believe that the real motive was to delay payment of scarce hard currency for as long as possible. The effect was quite different, as importers in Nigeria bore the 90 days financing costs, passed on by their suppliers, resulting in higher import prices. The only beneficiaries of the bank's previous ruling were the suppliers' banks, outside Nigeria, who were able to have use of the money for an extra 90 days. The central bank has yet to reverse last month's the other directive in March which blocked payment of an estimated Dollars 1bn to suppliers who have allowed Nigerian importers delayed payment terms.</p>

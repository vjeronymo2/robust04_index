			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft clears public offering obstacle Metallgesellschaft has cleared an obstacle to a possible public offering of its controlling interest in Metall Mining, the international mining arm of the troubled German group. Metallgesellschaft's 50.1 per cent stake in Metall Mining, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, is worth about CDollars 530m (USDollars 389m). The German group plans to sell the Metall Mining interest as part of its efforts to recover from huge losses suffered in international oil trading last year. However, the disposal is complicated by agreements between Metall and its partners in various joint ventures, under which the partners either have a right of first refusal on Metall's stakes in their projects or a right to demand that the shares be transferred back to Metallgesellschaft in the event of the German parent relinquishing control of Metall. Metall has, however, modified its agreement with Mr Norman Keevil, whose family shares control Teck Corporation, the diversified Vancouver-based mining group. Mr Keevil has relinquished his right to require Metallgesellschaft to take over Metall's multiple-voting Class A shares in Teck if the German company spins off its stake in Metall. In the event of a third party taking control of Metall, Mr Keevil will acquire voting rights over Metall's interest in Teck as well as the right to buy the shares himself. Metallgesellschaft has agreed to sell its 47 per cent stake in the Kolbenschmidt car components company to Dana Corporation, a US components group based in Toledo, Ohio, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed. Kolbenschmidt, with 7,600 employees, is set to generate sales of DM1.1bn (Dollars 655m) in the current business year, against the Dana group's DM8.6bn turnover. The Kolbenschmidt holding was earmarked for disposal soon after Mr Kajo Neukirchen took over as Metallgesellschaft chief executive in December. The proposed sale follows the disposal of a number of smaller holdings, most recently the CDollars 127m sale of a 6 per cent stake in Methanex, the Vancouver-based company which is the world's biggest methanol producer.</p>

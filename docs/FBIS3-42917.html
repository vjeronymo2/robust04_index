			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Changes in the Oblast Administration"] </F>   [Text] In connection with the creation of new  sociopolitical circumstances in Chelyabinsk Oblast, analyzing  the two-year experience of the administration's work under the  conditions of emerging market-type relations, and taking into  account the need to reform the structure of the executive branch  in this oblast for the purpose of making further progress along  the path of economic changes, the oblast administrative  head--V.P. Solovyev--adopted a decree on changes in the  structure and leadership of this oblast's administration. The  decision of the Oblast Council of People's Deputies "On the  Scheme for Governing the Oblast and the Structure of the Oblast  Administration's Organs," dated 12 November 1992," was reversed.    The decree adopted on 24 January 1994 abolished the  positions  of all the oblast administration's deputy heads, including that  of the first chairman of the coordinating council and the  administrator of affairs.    In order to head up and coordinate the activities of the  oblast administration's structural subdivisions under the new  conditions, the above-mentioned decree introduced seven deputies  instead of the previous nine ones. The following persons were  appointed deputy heads of the oblast administration: for affairs  of industrial policy and infrastructure development--V.B.  Bukrin, for affairs of budgetary policy--A.Ye. Prokin, for links  with the public, mass media, and the development of education  and culture--B.A. Mizrakhi, for affairs of economic,  privatization, and investment policy--V.B. Khristenko, for  affairs pertaining to the development of market-type relations  in the field of public services, foreign-economic activity, as  well as the fight against crime and corruption--N.R. Sudenkov,  for affairs involving agrarian policy and the development of  market-type relations in agriculture--Zh.K. Altynbayev, and for  affairs involving social policy, public health care, as well as  eliminating the consequences of natural disasters and  rehabilitation--V.A. Yachmenev.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   L.A. Ivanova submitted her resignation from the post of  deputy head of the Chelyabinsk Administration. She gave as the  reason for her departure the fact that--as an official--she bore  responsibility for the absence of monitoring controls on the  spending of budgetary funds in the committee on medicine. As our  readers probably know already, the office of the municipal  procurator has uncovered instances of large-scale  misappropriations or even thefts in this structural subdivision.  There is an ongoing investigation into this matter.</p>

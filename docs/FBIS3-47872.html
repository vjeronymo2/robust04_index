			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yoshihisa Komori] </F>   [Text] Washington, 30 Nov -- A U.S. Government  organization recently finished translating Blueprint for  Building a New Japan [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku]  written by Ichiro Ozawa. The translated version will soon be  distributed to government offices in charge of diplomacy toward  Japan. It is quite exceptional for the U.S. Government to  translate the full text of a book published in Japan, and in  such a short time. In recent years The Japan That Can Say  `No', which was co-authored by Akio Morita and Shintaro  Ishihara, has been the only Japanese book translated by  Washington. It is said the United States is interested in  Ozawa's book because it considers him a behind-the-scenes strong  man in the present Japanese coalition government, and thus is  closely observing him. However, the actual opinion of Ozawa by  U.S. Government officials seems to be a mixture of praise and  apprehension, or trust and suspicion.    The Clinton administration is paying close attention to  Ozawa. His book "Blueprint for Building a New Japan  was published in May. Since then, it has been on the  best-sellers list. The translation was undertaken by the  Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), an organization  related to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). FBIS's main  tasks include monitoring radio broadcasts of foreign countries,  picking up news reports and comments concerning the United  States, and translating them. Because of its superior  capability in foreign languages, FBIS is sometimes asked to do  emergency translations, as in the case with Ozawa's book.    The translation of the book into English is reportedly  finished. In December, the translated version will be published  as a monograph and distributed as an FBIS publication intended  for U.S. Government use by officials of those departments and  offices dealing with Japan, as well as to concerned members of  Congress.    A copy of the English version obtained by SANKEI SHIMBUN  recently shows that the entire 258 pages of the original, from  the "Foreword" to the very last word of the text, were  translated in full in 118 pages of English text. The English  translation is marked "For Official Use Only," indicating this  is only to be used as internal reference material by the U.S.  Government, apparently a move to avoid any copyright violations.    The Japan That Can Say No was also translated in  full in 1989. In the book Ishihara discussed "the export of  high-technology products which can be converted to military use  in the USSR." This drew the Department of Defense's attention,  which commissioned a private specialist organization to do the  English translation.    However, this time a CIA-affiliated organization is directly  involved in the translation. On 29 November a U.S. Government  source explained the reason for this unusual procedure. He  stated: "This shows that the U.S. Government believes that  knowing the role played by Ozawa, and being acquainted with his  thinking, is most important to projecting on Japanese politics,  which presently are in a crucial phase of transition."    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has published three books  in  Japanese. So far the United States has not reacted in a similar  manner.    Another U.S. Government source who has been involved in the  Japan policy of a number of U.S. administrations said: "From  the time Ozawa was deputy secretary general of the Liberal  Democratic Party, his personal ability and positive attitude  toward relations with the United States, plus his connections  with Kanemaru and Takeshita, led to a tendency on the part of  the United States to count on him for alleviating Japan-U.S.  friction. Such expectations remain unchanged."    It is true that people inside the U.S. Government have a  highly favorable opinion of Ozawa for successfully concluding  the very difficult negotiations with then U.S. Trade  Representative Carla Hills during the 1989 Japan-U.S.  telecommunication talks. Those who actually participated in the  negotiations say that "his thinking and logic is sharp, and he  has great implementation ability." They add that "he holds a  vision which designates maintaining strong relations with the  United States as the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy."    U.S. public opinion of Ozawa remains favorable. However,  some people express concern that Ozawa "plans to introduce an  independent line for Japan's long-term security; he will  eventually oppose the U.S. line." They feel that "one needs to  be careful about his role as a power broker, his involvement in  money politics, and his nationalistic aspect." This is also  regarded by some as one reason for undertaking a full  translation of his book.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Devaluation leaves most unaffected CITY SPECULATORS have made a killing, the government has lost face, but for most people this week's devaluation of the pound on the foreign exchanges makes little difference. At least for now. There will be some immediate winners and losers among the general public. Those people lucky enough to be sitting on an uncashed dollar or D-Mark cheque will have made overnight windfall gains as a result of Wednesday's sterling devaluation. People planning foreign trips will now find that their holiday savings buy fewer beers by the beach. But for the majority of people there are no immediate harmful effects and some goods news too. The chilling prospect of a rise in mortgage interest rates has receded. Wednesday's rise in interest rates, as the government attempted to defend the value of sterling against foreign exchange dealers, has been reversed. Indeed, life outside the exchange rate mechanism may allow single-digit interest rates in Britain before long, were the government to choose to postpone its proposed re-entry into the ERM. Meanwhile, the domestic purchasing power of the incomes and savings of ordinary people will initially be little changed by Wednesday's events. Some importers may react by raising their prices immediately. But the impact of the fall in the foreign exchange market value of sterling does not mean - as Mr Harold Wilson pointed out in his prime ministerial broadcast after the 1967 devaluation - 'that the pound here in Britain - in your pocket or purse or in your bank - has been devalued'. The most important, if least obvious, initial effect of the devaluation of sterling is its impact on the competitiveness of UK exporters. The impact of the fall in the sterling exchange rate should boost the profitability of British exporters of internationally traded goods over the coming year. The 7 per cent devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark means that exporters, by leaving the foreign currency prices of their goods unchanged, can boost their sterling margins. The rise in industrial profitability, towards European levels, should make manufacturing in the UK more attractive and help to close Britain's trade deficit - unless, that is, sterling's devaluation is followed by a renewed burst of domestic wage and price inflation. That has certainly been the British experience in the quarter of a century since Mr Wilson's apparently reassuring words. At home, a pound is now worth little over a tenth of its 1967 value. Its purchasing power has fallen by 89 per cent since the beginning of that year. So a pound earned in 1967 would buy only 10p worth of goods at today's prices, as the upper chart shows. The fall in the international purchasing power of sterling has been almost as severe. A pound would buy Dollars 2.80 worth of goods in the US at the beginning of 1967. Since then the pound has depreciated by 36 per cent against the dollar to Dollars 1.78, while the fall in the dollar's domestic purchasing power is 77 per cent. As a result, the US purchasing power of a 1967 pound has fallen by 85 per cent. The fall of the purchasing power of a UK pound in Germany has been sharper. Germany has had a slower rate of consumer price inflation - the domestic purchasing power of a D-Mark has fallen by 59 per cent since 1967 - but the depreciation of the value of sterling has been 76.2 per cent. So the overall purchasing power of a pound in Germany has fallen by 90 per cent. The devaluation of sterling on the foreign exchanges means that the amount of foreign goods that a pound sterling buys has been eroded further. But if the fall in the value of sterling is once more followed by higher UK price inflation, then the gains in competitiveness will also disappear. One reason for resisting calls for a devaluation was that British manufacturers were not uncompetitive in international markets. But even if a rise in the profitability of exporters is needed, a devaluation might not deliver that. The government has argued that the beneficial effects of a devaluation tend to disappear within two years as employers and workers increase their wages rather than expand capacity. Will the combination of still high interest rates and rising unemployment damp these inflationary pressures? If not, then this sterling devaluation will be no different from any other.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Book Review: Panic and heroism in the heat of the night THE STORY OF CHERNOBYL by Piers Paul Read Secker &amp; Warburg, 478 pages, Pounds 16.99 Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear accident, is a tantalising target for a writer. The events of the night of April 26 1986 were shrouded in KGB-protected secrecy by the Soviet government for years, despite the clamourings of other countries to know how the accident happened. But as the Soviet Union disintegrated, the print-outs from the reactor's computers, the tape recordings of the men in the control room, and the medical records of the surrounding population gradually emerged. Chernobyl's scientists and directors have also been increasingly prepared to talk to foreign writers; many appear remorseful for having helped cover up the full story. Piers Paul Read has interviewed two of the most senior staff in control of the reactor that night: Victor Brukhanov, Chernobyl's director, and Anatoli Dyatlov, deputy chief engineer. By far the best part of the book is the account of the panic, terror and extraordinary courage on the night of the explosion. Scientists and technicians - who thought at first that war had broken out - streamed along corridors in the dark as their instruments failed. They heaved at twisted metal doors to reach the control rods and put their hands into radioactive pools to turn safety valves. They slung injured colleagues over their shoulders as they fled for the exits, even though the radioactivity from the contaminated clothing burned deep sores into their flesh. Read provides a powerful reminder, too, of the peculiarly horrible effects of radiation on the human body, one of the reasons why western Europe's environmental pressure groups are so fiercely opposed to nuclear power. Thirty-one people died immediately or within days. They watched their own bodies rot, their intestines dissolve and the skin on their legs fall down like loose socks. The book goes a long way to explaining how the disaster happened, pointing a finger at the Soviet planning system. Components to build Chernobyl's four reactors - secured after tortuous negotiations with the strangely named Ministry of Medium Machine Building - rarely arrived in working order or on time. The plant's directors, says Read, struggled to meet impossible construction targets, while juggling Communist party demands to diversify into consumer goods and to construct two hay barns for a local farm. Locked into that system, Chernobyl's staff believed that initiative, even on the brink of disaster, would be penalised. That led them to persist with an experiment on the plant's electricity turbines even when it started to go wrong - ironically, the reactor ran out of control during long-overdue tests on its safety. The book makes too much of the faultiness of the reactor's control rods, although the imperfections were confirmed this year in a report by the International Atomic Energy Authority, the nuclear watchdog. The ill-designed safety tests and the generally poor standards of construction were the main causes. It also does little to solve the main remaining mystery of Chernobyl: how many people were made ill, or saw their children born deformed. Read points out, movingly, that figures are hard to establish because the general health of the population is so poor, undermined by pollution and inadequate nutrition. But he cites estimates - which range from the 31 who died to 'as many as (in) the second world war' - without saying which should be taken seriously. This is a symptom of the book's biggest weakness. It relies heavily on secondary sources - particularly Ukrainian and Russian newspaper reports - and attributes too few of its main assertions to any identifiable source. Important points lack substantiation, such as his claim that, before the explosion, there was 'anxiety in the highest quarters about the shortcomings in construction'. His fondness for the passive tense also leaves too many questions dangling about who took critical decisions at the plant - the identity of the person who ordered the go-ahead for evacuation of the town, for example. Surprisingly, given his talent as a novelist, the pace suffers from Read's technique of retelling the events several times to reflect the different perspectives of the plant's workers, the politicians and the local residents. He also indulges in at least half a dozen repetitions of passages, and in clumsy metaphors, although it is perhaps inevitable that the glowing core of the destroyed reactor is compared to a glimpse of hell. Unfortunately, towards the end, his prose not only describes but resembles the ponderous and labyrinthine ways of the Soviet command economy. That said, he is right that Chernobyl has become a powerful symbol. The explosion has come to represent the atrophy of the Soviet Union and 'its subsequent melt-down', as Read puts it. It is also seen as a turning point in the promise of nuclear power to deliver cheap energy without much risk, even in poorly managed countries. Read's final suggestion - that human fallibility means nuclear power can never be safe - seems unnecessarily fatalistic, however. The lessons of Chernobyl are precise ones - the apparent impotence of United Nations bodies such as the IAEA, and the way the nuclear industry's military connections are frequently used to restrict information. Western countries also have plenty of evidence now that there is a threat of a second Chernobyl at some of the crumbling reactors in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. They know that sending money, technicians and components could reduce the risks. There is an argument, which Read does not explore, that if another accident were to occur, the blame should fall on the inadequacy of western action rather than on the innate dangers of nuclear power.</p>

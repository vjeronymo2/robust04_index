			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Tension grows over Heron restructuring ADVISERS TO some creditors of Heron, the property and trading group negotiating a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing, are complaining about Heron's decision to stop paying fees it regards as not essential to the restructuring. Heron said it could not comment on individual fee arrangements, but that its action had been taken in the interest of creditors. Fees involved so far amount to nearly Pounds 40m. Tension is mounting between the parties to the restructuring plan which is due to be put to the banks by the end of this month. 'It is all coming to a head now,' one said, adding that in such cases it was only when negotiations became fraught that progress was made. Without a refinancing Heron would go into receivership - an outcome the group believes would realise less for credit-ors. The depths of Heron's problems are revealed in a letter sent to the advisers by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Heron's merchant bank. This, says the group, 'will only have cash funds available to pay fees up to January 31'. The steering committee of banks, the letter says, is considering providing new money of Pounds 1.6m to meet in part the company's cash requirements for February. Heron's advisers and those of the banks have agreed to 'defer a substantial proportion of their fees for a year' and make payment of those fees, amounting to Pounds 1.2m, 'contingent on the restructuring being implemented'. The letter proposes that fees for the advisers to the bond holders 'will be paid contingent upon, and immediately after, implementation of the restructuring proposals'. Some advisers say that if they recommend bond holders to accept the restructuring plan, the holders will say their advice is biased by the prospect of a fee.</p>

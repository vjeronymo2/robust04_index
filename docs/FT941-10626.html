			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Nato nears ultimatum to Serbs over siege of Sarajevo Nato is expected today to agree on an ultimatum demanding that Bosnian Serb forces withdraw from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of the city or face western air strikes. After intensive contacts yesterday which brought the 16 Nato allies close to agreement, ambassadors of the alliance were expected at a meeting in Brussels to approve formally a plan to give the besieging Serb forces a limited time to withdraw. The allies are responding to a request from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, to prepare for air strikes against any artillery shelling Sarajevo, following last week's marketplace mortar attack which killed 68 people. The carnage pushed the west towards doing what it has threatened to do since last August when Nato announced it was preparing air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs if they continued their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo. The French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, said last night he believed Nato ambassadors would endorse the ultimatum plan. 'I think we shall be able to present a joint, especially French-US, position demanding the lifting of the siege, that is to say the pull-back of besieging forces,' he told French television. He warned that France might pull its peacekeepers out of Bosnia if Nato backed down. 'France will not associate itself with a non-decision,' he said. However, the US placed new emphasis on the search for a diplomatic solution, without ruling out the use of force. A White House official said a strategy approved by President Bill Clinton would entail increased US representation in the peace talks, but not to the point of putting 'undue pressure' on the Bosnian government. Mr Juppe said that under the proposal the Bosnian Serbs would be requested to pull back 20-30km from the Bosnian capital and place all heavy weapons within that area under UN control. In London, an emergency meeting of senior UK ministers chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, agreed to support an ultimatum. British officials refused to discuss the details of such a warning ahead of today's Brussels meeting. Earlier Mr Major had indicated that Britain had softened its previous opposition to air strikes when he told the House of Commons that the UN forces must apply 'immediate and strong pressure' to halt attacks on Sarajevo. Any final Nato agreement on an ultimatum is likely to anger Russia. Moscow opposes air strikes on the grounds that they would make the conflict worse, but also has strong traditional links with the Serbs. The Russians have accused Mr Boutros Ghali of exceeding his powers. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said last night that any aircraft attacking Serb forces would be shot down.

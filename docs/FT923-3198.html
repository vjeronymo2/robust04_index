			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Brief respite for Italy's coalition government THE realignment of the lira within the European Monetary System (EMS) agreed yesterday is likely to give Italy's four-party coalition government only a brief respite to demonstrate its ability to tackle the country's deteriorating public finances. This breathing space could last until little more than the end of the month, according to market analysts. Even that could prove optimistic if the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20 shows a rejection of the treaty. Ministers also recognise an internationally credible 1993 budget must be prepared as soon as possible. This depends on parliament approving outline plans for reforms of pensions, the health service, local government and the civil service. The budget has to be presented to parliament by September 30  - but it is still not clear if and when both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate will endorse these reforms. The debate has been clouded by the decision on Wednesday of Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, to submit a law to enable the government to invoke emergency economic powers in the event of an economic crisis. Since the idea was launched, politicians have been voicing increasing reservations, even those within the government coalition. An editorial over the weekend in the influential daily Corriere della Sera newspaper said the request for such emergency powers was like the pilot of a tumbling aircraft asking for new engines. This view was widely echoed by key officials dealing with the economy. Prof Amato indicated he was willing to water down his proposal to ensure the sovereignty of parliament was not infringed on. One suggestion being mooted was that he would trade the dropping or watering down of the proposal for parliament's quick endorsement of the outline reforms essential for the budget's preparation. The government will now have to confront the consequences of a currency realignment. Prof Amato last night said keeping inflation under control would be a priority. Italy's inflation was scheduled to fall to some 4.5 per cent by year end. The prime minister added that Italy's foreign trade was mainly conducted in dollars and the lira had not been realigned against the dollar. He hoped interest rates would come down: the discount rate is currently at 15 per cent to defend the lira and every one-point fall reduces the government's annual borrowing requirement by L15,000bn (Pounds 7bn). Apart from seeking early evidence of a desire to reduce the budget deficit now more than 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product, the markets are likely to continue to press the government to accelerate further the privatisation process to encourage domestic and international confidence. Last week the government said it would sell off stakes in Credito Italiano, one of the top six commercial banks, and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy engineering subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern. Ever since the Amato government took office on June 29, it has been under pressure to realign Italy's overvalued lira. However, devaluation has been constantly resisted in the short term for two main reasons. Italy's European partners were not prepared for a realignment, especially the British, and until this weekend the French government had rejected Italian requests to permit a lira devaluation before the Maastricht referendum. The government regarded devaluation before the 1993 budget as of only short-term benefit unlikely to convince the markets and risking being inflationary. Thus although it has seen a realignment with the first set of conditions satisfied, the second has yet to be. The government has taken heart from the concerted European response which officials last night said should warn the markets that unilateral pressure on the lira would eventually affect other members. The Bank of Italy maintains that by calling on unlimited credit from the Bundesbank, and to a lesser extent from the Belgian central bank, it reminded the Germans that defending the lira risked creating liquidity problems at home.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 17 (AFP)--Egyptian riot police fired  tear-gas at thousands of lawyers trying to march on to a  presidential palace here Tuesday to protest the death of a  jailed colleague allegedly tortured to death last week.    About 6,000 lawyers gathered at the Bar Association's  headquarters in central Cairo. Riot police intervened with  tear-gas as the demonstrators neared the gates to start their  march.    The lawyers, who had assured the protest would be peaceful,  were forced back into the grounds. Most of Egypt's 180,000  lawyers went on strike Sunday. They are protesting the death of  'Abd-al-Harith Madani on April 27, a day after he was detained  for allegedly acting as a go-between for jailed Moslem  extremists and their contacts abroad. He was a defence lawyer  for Moslem fundamentalist spiritual leader Shaykh 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman and other members of Islamic groups fighting to  overthrow the government.    Last week, the Prosecutor General's Office issued a  preliminary report by legal medical experts concluding he had  been tortured to death. But, the Interior Ministry insisted he  died of an asthma attack.    The Lawyers' Association described Madani's death as  "premeditated murder," and the Egyptian Organization of Human  Rights also charged he died of torture.</p>

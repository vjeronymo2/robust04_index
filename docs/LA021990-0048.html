When asked what he thought of the spy satellite, Vladimir  Lapygin, the committee chairman and head of the delegation, replied with a  smile: "We have no special secrets . . . . I think you are wasting your money."  The group toured areas where shuttles are worked on, a launching control center  and a launch pad.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> After all the media Israel-bashing lately, it was gratifying to read Rubin's  article presenting a more realistic view of the Middle East problems. Our  Bush-Baker policy is so self-defeating and foolish, in addition to again  emphasizing the double standard we seem to apply only to Israel.  </P> <P> The U.S demanded that the PLO stop using terrorism before we would negotiate  with it. Therefore, we can't recognize any of its terrorist acts, obvious as  they are, or we'd have to abandon our peace-process policy. How self-defeating.  </P> <P> Israel needs little prodding to seek peace. Her yearning and need for peace is  open and well-known, even to the extent of the fall of her government. It's the  Arab side that refuses to be satisfied with the whole nation of Jordan as its  Arab-Palestinian state, and continues to demand Israel-granted land west of the  Jordan River.  </P> <P> Let's encourage our Administration to be evenhanded in its Middle East peace  policy.

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Frogmore pays Pounds 10m for two properties Frogmore Estates has bought two properties - a residential scheme and an office building - for almost Pounds 10m. The company said both properties reflected its philosophy of investing a proportion of its resources in purchases that had substantial future potential for capital enhancement, but currently yielded no income. With its joint venture partner, Pamlion Properties, Frogmore is acquiring Inverforth House and the ad-joining Inverforth Close, at Hampstead Heath, London. Frogmore has also acquired the recently completed 46,500 sq ft Imperial House office building in Stevenage, Herts.</p>

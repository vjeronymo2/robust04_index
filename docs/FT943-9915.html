			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Schroders' slip will lead to Pounds 4m payout A technical slip by Schroders, one of the City's leading financial advisers, is to result in an unprecedented Pounds 4m compensation payment to investors who sold shares in a takeover target on the basis of a misleading announcement. The merchant bank's mistake - the failure to include a standard phrase in a statement to the Stock Exchange - was described yesterday by one adviser involved in the bid as 'like leaving a full stop off the end of a sentence'. It could have spelled failure for a bid by Schroders' client, the US funeral group Service Corporation International, but the Takeover Panel yesterday provisionally forgave the lapse as an 'innocent mistake'. As a result, SCI made a third offer for Great Southern, which finally got the backing of the controlling shareholders of the UK funeral company. The new bid, at 775p per ordinary share, values Great Southern at Pounds 112.9m. The Panel tomorrow morning will hear an appeal against its provisional decision to allow the new offer to proceed. The error appeared in Schroders' statement to the Stock Exchange last Tuesday, when it announced that SCI had made a 'final offer' of 680p, but failed to list the standard exception that the bid could be revised if another bidder emerged. The full offer document issued the following day included the standard contingency clause. In the intervening period, however, SCI bought close to 27 per cent of Great Southern's enlarged share capital in the market, and a potential competing bidder had arrived on the scene. One neutral merchant banker said yesterday: 'You may be able to change the terms of a final offer but you have to specifically say so at the time.' SCI has therefore agreed to pay the difference between the two offers to all investors who sold shares last Tuesday and Wednesday. The refund will amount to 95p per ordinary share, and 38p per convertible share. The bulk of sales was made to SCI itself, and the compensation on those sales would amount to about Pounds 3.73m. Mr David Challen, Schroders' group director of corporate finance, said: 'The issue of where the cost of this falls is simply not one which has at this stage been discussed', but he admitted the possibility that some compensation might be paid to SCI. Schroders claimed the mistake was the joint responsibility of the entire advisory team, which included Smith &amp; Williamson Securities and lawyers Linklaters &amp; Paines. Baring Brothers is appealing against SCI's increased bid on behalf of Loewen Group, a Canadian funeral operator which emerged last week as a potential 'white knight' bidder for Great Southern. However, members of the Takeover Panel said last night that Schroders' omission had been made in 'wholly exceptional circumstances'. SCI, the world's largest private burial company, made its first offer for Great Southern at 600p a share. The original offer was rejected by the Field family, who controlled 56 per cent of the company's ordinary shares through JD Field. However, yesterday, the Fields accepted the enlarged deal, which will be worth about Pounds 51m to them. Lex, Page 16 Great Southern falls, Page 18</p>

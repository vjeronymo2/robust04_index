			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL CLAIMS REAGAN SHOULD HAVE TESTIFIED IN NORTH TRIAL  </P> <P> Oliver L. North's superiors, including former President Ronald Reagan, tried to  cover up the Iran-Contra scandal, and Reagan should have been questioned on the  matter at North's trial, lawyers for the former White House aide said Friday.  </P> <P> "Mr. Reagan was in a position to testify, as no other witness available to  North could," about whether the President authorized a cover-up of a 1985  shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran, North said in a brief urging a federal  appeals court to overturn his convictions.  </P> <P> Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter told North that Reagan, at  a Nov. 12, 1986, meeting, had not disclosed to congressional leaders his 1985  authorization for the Hawk shipment, North testified at his trial.  </P> <P> "That statement by Poindexter certainly provided a reasonable basis for  concluding that Mr. Reagan had made clear that U.S. involvement in the Hawk  shipment should not be disclosed to Congress," North's court filing said.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell quashed North's subpoena for Reagan's  testimony, saying the court record contained no proof the President had  authorized North to break the law.  </P></p>

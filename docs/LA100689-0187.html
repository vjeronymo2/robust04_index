			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> YOUNG MOTHER, ALIYSA ARE FAVORED  </P> <P> Young Mother, a 3-year-old French filly, and the Aga Khan's Aliysa are  favorites in an unspectacular field for Sunday's 68th running of the  $1.3-million Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Race Track.  </P> <P> Nineteen horses are entered in the turf race at a distance of a little more  than 1 1/2 miles.  </P> <P> The absence of Nashwan, until recently hailed as one of Europe's best  racehorses of the last decade, has thrown the field open. The British colt was  unbeaten in six races, including the Epsom Derby, but then fared miserably in  the Prix Niel here last month, finishing third behind Golden Pheasant and  French Glory.  </P> <P> Young Mother, trained by Frenchman Jean-Marie Beguingne and with Alain Badel  aboard, had a convincing win in the recent Prix Vermeille. Aliysa, ridden by  Walter Swinburn, has not competed since July but is highly thought of, as is  Cacoethes, second to Nashwan at Ascot and in the King George.  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finland namesbank head THE Bank of Finland yesterday named Ms Sirkka Hamalainen as the new governor of the central bank, in an attempt to calm the country's turbulent financial markets. News that Mr Rolf Kullberg, the governor of the bank for the past nine years, had tendered his resignation because of a public dispute with Prime Minister Esko Aho over economic policy sent a shock-wave through the Finnish money markets in yesterday's half-day trading. Ms Hamalainen, aged 52, will take over as governor on July 1. She has been a member of the Bank of Finland's board of management since last November and has spent the last 30 years at the central bank.</p>

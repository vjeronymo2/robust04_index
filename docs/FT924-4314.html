			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Telecoms body warns Brussels EUROPE's 11 leading telecommunications equipment suppliers have warned the Brussels Commission that they will be at a disadvantage against North American and Japanese competition when the single market opens next month, unless the EC acts. The European Information Technology Round Table, chaired by Alcatel Alsthom of France, has asked Brussels to negotiate fair access to non-European markets before January 1, when an EC directive to create free competition in public procurement for telecommunications equipment comes into force. 'Why should we open European markets to competition from outside Europe without getting anything in return?' said Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom. The directive obliges public purchasing authorities to buy from the cheapest source, almost irrespective of origin. They may discriminate in favour of European suppliers only if the European tender is less than 3 per cent above the cheapest foreign offer. Member states had asked the Commission to negotiate the same freedoms for EC suppliers in non-European markets, under the principle of reciprocity. Yet the round table - which includes Siemens and Daimler-Benz of Germany, Philips of the Netherlands, and Olivetti of Italy - complains that Brussels has failed to obtain such a deal. It says the directive should be delayed until Brussels does so, or only apply to foreign suppliers from countries with reciprocity agreements with the EC. Telecommunication operators in the key non-European markets own or control their principal suppliers, while vertical integration of this kind barely exists in Europe.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / VW apology for halting Skoda deal VOLKSWAGEN, the German car manufacturer, yesterday apologised to the Czech government for its sudden cancellation of a DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, only hours before the deal was due to be signed in London last week. VW reaffirmed its commitment to expand and modernise production at Skoda and promised to increase the variety of cars to be produced at the Czech plant. 'Volkswagen expressed regrets over the embarrassment caused to Skoda's majority shareholder (the Czech government) by its last-minute decision made last week,' said a statement issued at the end of a three-hour meeting in Prague. The meeting was attended by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, Mr Werner Schmidt, VW finance director, and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, as well as Mr Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund, which oversees privatisations. VW's decision to call off the loan at the last minute came as a shock in Prague. Only a day before the announcement, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, had welcomed the planned financing, which was to be guaranteed by the Czech government. VW said the financing package was no longer necessary because productivity improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be considerably lower than initially planned. The VW group is undertaking a fundamental review of its capital spending plans and is expected to announce further far-reaching cuts in November after a meeting of its supervisory board. VW took a 31 per cent share in Skoda in 1991 and is due to raise its holding to 70 per cent by 1996. It had previously announced plans to invest DM7bn over 10 years, but this figure is now expected to be reduced significantly. It has planned to more than double Skoda's production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, modern-ising its facilities and expanding products with the introduction of a second car range. The cancellation of the loan increased fears in Prague that VW was reducing its commitment to the venture. Relations between the Czech government and the German carmaker had soured recently following a dispute caused by Skoda's decision to increase sharply the prices of its cars, and Czech concerns that VW was no longer interested in developing a local nework of suppliers. Neither issue was discussed at yesterday's meeting.</p>

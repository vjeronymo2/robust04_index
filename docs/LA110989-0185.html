			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARRIORS' LISTER MAY MISS SEASON AFTER SURGERY ON ACHILLES' TENDON  </P> <P> Golden State Warrior center Alton Lister, who had appeared in 167 consecutive  NBA regular-season games, is expected to miss the remainder of the season with  a ruptured right Achilles' tendon, the Warriors said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 7-foot center was injured Tuesday night in the third quarter of a 118-94  victory over the Clippers. The injury necessitated surgery Wednesday at Eden  Hospital in nearby Castro Valley.  </P> <P> Lister, 31, acquired from Seattle in the off-season for a first-round draft  pick, had missed only 13 games in eight seasons.  </P> <P> "It felt like somebody kicked me and I fell down," Lister said Wednesday. "When  I tried to get up and walk, I knew something was wrong. I have never been  injured before so that's what will make the recovery process so tough. But  fortunately I have almost a year to get this healed and that's encouraging."  </P> <P> The injury leaves 7-1 Uwe Blab and 7-7 Manute Bol as the Warriors' only big  men. Injured Jim Petersen, 6-10, is still recovering from Sept. 18 knee  surgery.  </P> <P> Coach and General Manager Don Nelson said the team will be picking up another  big player to replace Lister "as soon as we can. . . . We're in the process of  doing that already."  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Royals The stock market took a churlish view of third-quarter profits from Royal Insurance and the shares dropped almost 20p after the headline figure was announced. Subsequent reappraisal of underlying nuances in the results prompted furious two-way trading which saw turnover of 15m shares. The volume was the highest since February 1992 but then Royal had announced that its losses had plunged to Pounds 373m and shareholders would receive no dividend. The picture yesterday was altogether brighter. Nine-month profits came in at Pounds 311m, against Pounds 113m a year ago, and although they were at the lower end of forecasts some analysts had been over enthusiastic following bumper second-quarter figures. The main hit of Pounds 19m came from the rebalancing of Royals' investment portfolio - the group has spent the last year shifting Pounds 400m from bonds to equities. But Mr Charles Landa of SGST, remained positive on the stock, arguing that Royals was 'sacrificing investment income today for capital growth tomorrow'. Analysts also said the presentation was impressively upbeat. The shares, which have performed very strongly over the past few weeks, rallied from their low but closed 5 off at 295p.</p>

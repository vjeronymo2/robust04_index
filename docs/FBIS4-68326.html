V. Boykov, V. F. Galazin, Ye. V. Korablev; </F> UDC 528.225:629.783]    [Abstract] In the 1970's and 1980's, the Main Directorate  for Geodesy and Cartography set out to revamp the state geodesic  network. That task has been helped considerably by satellite  geodesy, which, over the past 25 years, has involved three main  areas: the development and observation of passive satellites  such as Pageos, Lageos, and Etalon; the development and  observation of satellites such as Geo-IK; and the use of  satellite navigation systems such as GLONASS and GPS. This paper  examines the results of the use of the domestic Geo-IK  satellites, which were used in 1977, 1985, and 1990 to ascertain  the geodesic parameters of the Earth, i.e., the main  astronomical and geodesic constants; the characteristics of the  coordinate base; and planetary models of normal and anomalous  gravitational fields of the Earth and local gravitational-field  characteristics. The Geo-IK has been used in efforts to make the  GLONASS- and GPS-system coordinates compatible. NPO Applied  Mechanics is developing the new Geo-IK-2, whose capabilities  will include accuracies to centimeters rather than meters.  Figures 1.</p>

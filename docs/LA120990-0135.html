			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: GOING FOR MOOD MUSIC AT ST. MARK'S IN VENICE  </P> <P> St. Mark's, the jazz club-cum-California/French restaurant that opened in  Venice earlier this year is going through changes. First, Francois Petit, who  helped start St. Mark's and ran the restaurant portion of the operation, has  left. His one-time colleague Mike Quinn, who had originally confined his  activities to the music end of the place, has taken over both the restaurant  and the club as operating partner. He hopes to reclaim the interest of the  dining public. Gil Saulnier, who had been chef at the now-defunct Le St.  Germain in Hollywood before joining St. Mark's as executive chef, remains in  charge of the kitchen.  </P> <P> "Basically," Quinn says, "we found that the music kind of overshadowed the  restaurant at times. But we have so much good talent in the kitchen that we  feel we have to represent them strongly. We're trying to give people a style of  music now that's more compatible with dining and with the style of our food.  What was happening with some of the bands we booked, especially when we had  dancing, was that the room changed a little too fast and a little too radically  from early to late -- so that people who were in here dining would sometimes  feel that they were sitting in a different place than the one they had come  into. Now we're starting the music earlier, around 6:30 or 7 p.m. Wednesdays  through Saturdays, but it's more low-key, with usually a piano player who  sings, and a bassist and guitarist. Our idea is to have a big-name entertainer  come in once every two or three months to kind of highlight the place." The  menu, he adds, has changed slightly since St. Mark's opened. Pizzas, for  instance, are now available as appetizers. "It's in response to the seasons,"  Quinn says, "and to what people seemed to like and want."  </P> <P> FENNEL GOES BISTRO: According to restaurateur Mauro Vincenti, his Fennel in  Santa Monica -- whose kitchen is the province of Jean-Pierre Bosc and  alternating French-based chefs Michel Rostang, Andre Genin, Michel Chabran and  Yann Jacquot -- is in the process of being transformed into a more casual, less  expensive restaurant. "The chefs want to make it into a bistro," he says. "The  main reason is that Michel Rostang, besides his own restaurant, has three very  successful bistros now in Paris, and he would like to do something like that  here." (Genin also has a bistro in addition to his main Paris restaurant, Chez  Pauline.)  </P> <P> The restaurant will be remodeled to look more bistro-like, Vincenti adds, and  there will be plenty of new ideas on the menu. He expects the changes to be  complete by early next year. But, he adds, "We're dealing with permits and  things now, and you know how that can go."  </P></p>

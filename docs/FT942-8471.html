			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Painful choices on disabled bill: Concern over the cost of compliance The prime minister yesterday spelt out to the House of Commons the hard economics which lie behind the political furore over the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Mr Major cited the official estimate of Pounds 17bn in non-recurring costs (plus Pounds 1bn a year in subsequent costs) and the potential bill from litigation as reasons for the government's opposition to the private member's bill. But are these cost figures realistic? The Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, which have been lobbying effectively against the bill, believe that they are. Disability lobbyists say they are not. The institute argues that the bill is loosely drafted and does not properly address the issue of who pays. It says that the cost of compliance could close thousands of small businesses across the country, and even interfere with the privatisation of British Rail (the government estimate of the costs to the rail system is Pounds 2.85bn). Mr Ira Chalphin, a re-searcher with the IoD, points to the dangers of following the US experience. He says that the Americans with Disabilities Act 1990 will turn out to be the second most costly piece of business legislation to be enacted in the country, after the Clean Air Act. Both the CBI and the IoD stress that they are not opposed to anti-discrimination legislation for the disabled, and accept that business will have to bear some of the cost. The CBI says, however, that this should happen through the 'normal legislative channels' after full consultation with business. The government has been encouraging business lobbyists to make public their arguments and its own cost estimates. But the figure of Pounds 17bn is more than double the true cost, according to Ms Victoria Scott, the disability lobbyist and daughter of Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible for the disabled. Dr Roger Berry, the Labour MP who introduced the bill, says the figure is 'absurd' and takes no account of the cost savings from employing more disabled people. Dr Berry, who has made no estimates of his own, says several government departments have produced summaries of costs which include a large number of 'guesstimates' as well as being based on the recommendations being introduced within five years. Dr Berry said: 'The bill as amended says that the timescale would be subject to the decisions of the secretary of state. So the government could control the costs.' The heaviest costs, according to the government estimate, would be incurred by improving access to and within non-domestic buildings, including state schools, shops and business premises. Here the cost 'guesstimate' for the private sector alone is around Pounds 10bn. The next heaviest bill falls on the transport industry, with changes to land-based vehicles estimated to cost Pounds 5.5bn-Pounds 6.2bn. The Department of Transport says that for a typical bus operator the proposed changes would cost about Pounds 20m. But the operators of rail services would face the heaviest cost burden. While only 712 of the 2,796 trains on the heavy rail network remain inaccessible to wheelchair users, the replacement costs for them would be Pounds 2.85bn. Changes to airlines are not included in the estimates but the department says costs would vary greatly. One main schedule operator calculated non-recurring costs of Pounds 2m while a charter operator suggested improved access to 10 aircraft would cost around Pounds 16m.</p>

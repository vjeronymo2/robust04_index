			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Spens is denied not guilty verdict LORD SPENS, the former corporate finance managing director at Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, was yesterday refused a formal not guilty verdict in the recent Guinness trial. He sought a formal acquittal after the Serious Fraud Office decided not to continue prosecuting him for his part in the Guinness takeover of Distillers Group in 1986. Mr Justice Henry also refused to order costs of between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 400,000, which Lord Spens incurred before being granted legal aid, be paid from public funds because 'he brought the prosecution on himself'. However, the judge said, because of Lord Spens' financial circumstances, he would not have to pay a Pounds 100,000 legal aid contribution. The judge ruled that the fraud and false accounting charges against Lord Spens remain on the file and not be proceeded with without the court's permission. Afterwards Lord Spens, who was clearly shaken and angry, said he would challenge the rulings by way of a judicial review. The second Guinness trial ended last month after psychiatrists expressed concern about the mental state of Lord Spens' co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, who conducted his own defence. The prosecution of Mr Seelig was halted by a nolle prosequi, which stayed the proceedings against him but did not acquit him. The SFO decided, in the circumstances, it would be unfair to proceed against Lord Spens who then sought a formal acquittal. Mr Justice Henry said yesterday both he and the SFO had believed there was sufficient evidence to proceed against Lord Spens. The decision against a second trial had been taken on other grounds. An order staying proceedings against Lord Spens would leave him in the same position as Mr Seelig, the judge said. Dealing with the application for costs, the judge referred to evidence Lord Spens had given to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. That evidence, which had not been put before the jury before the trial was aborted, concerned Lord Spens' conduct in relation to Mr Seelig's request that he recruit Guinness share supporters under indemnities against loss. The judge said the City code imposed an obligation on advisers to consult the takeover panel about any 'grey area' of City practice. Lord Spens had been faced with a highly unusual transaction beyond his immediate experience and had chosen not to consult the panel. The judge said: 'If he had consulted the panel it is clear from the evidence he would have been told not to have anything to do with the transaction. There would not have been a prosecution and none of the unhappy consequences to him and his family would have occurred. He brought the prosecution on himself and it would be wrong to use public funds to protect him against the consequences of that.' Mr David Hood, counsel for Lord Spens, twice interrupted the judgment. He complained about the judge's 'subjective interpretation' of the evidence and said he and Lord Spens did not accept any of what the judge was saying about matters that would have been contested at the trial. It was, Mr Hood asserted, wholly wrong for the judge to give judgment on matters on which the prosecution had offered no evidence as if they had been determined at trial.</p>

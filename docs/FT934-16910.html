			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ludicrous for US to impose high textiles tariffs Sir, I am delighted that your leading article 'End game in the Gatt' (September 29) highlights the need for reductions in the high US tariffs on apparel and textiles to levels comparable to those of the European Community. It is quite ludicrous that the US, one of the world's strongest economies, continues to impose tariffs which, on some textile products, can exceed 40 per cent. The tariff-cutting formula agreed in Tokyo in July requires these tariff peaks to be reduced by half, but the US administration has so far failed to carry this agreement into effect. Its latest offer would still leave peak tariffs of almost 30 per cent - a totally unacceptable position. Of course, even the tariffs imposed by the US are low compared to the 100 per cent-plus tariff rates found in many developing countries, often accompanied by wide-ranging import bans. These other countries must be persuaded to play their own part in reducing trade barriers in apparel and textiles - but a revised offer by the US incorporating the agreed Tokyo formula is an essential preliminary.

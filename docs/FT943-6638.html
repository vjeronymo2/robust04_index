			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Cashback - the Revenue replies If you are choosing between different types of mortgage incentives, one significant tax question remains unresolved. Lenders have been encouraging borrowers to take variable rate mortgages by offering a lump sum cash payment or a discounted rate for a limited period. In general, the discounted rate tends to offer better value - but the costs of moving house are such that many people choose the cash. The problem is that the Inland Revenue has not said clearly if these cash payments are taxable. Only in the case of the Cheltenham and Gloucester's Cashgift scheme - details of which were submitted by the society - has the Revenue said tax would be payable as a capital gain if borrowers had used up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT exemption. Now, however, the Revenue has agreed to answer questions from the Weekend FT. Q. What is the logic behind taxing the C&amp;G cashback as capital gain? Some accountants believe the cashback payment should be treated as a reduction in the borrower's total interest paid for the tax year, and their mortgage relief reduced accordingly. A. Under the C&amp;G scheme, borrowers who took out new mortgages on or before July 31 1994 (and have personal deposits with the society) were entitled to receive in cash a certain percentage of the amount borrowed from the society. This is clearly a contractual arrangement between C&amp;G and the borrower. The receipt is a capital sum derived from the contractual right. It is, therefore, chargeable under Section 22 (1) of the Capital Gains Act 1992. If the cashback were a rebate of interest, the borrower's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would be reduced accordingly, and it would be up to the lender to operate the Miras arrangements on the reduced amount of interest. But we are not aware of such schemes. Q. Other accountants say that since the C&amp;G cashback is conditional - the borrower would have to repay it if they redeem the mortgage within three years - it cannot be treated as a gain until the three years are up instead of the year in which it was taken. What is your view? A. The cashback is treated as a capital receipt chargeable to CGT in the year it is received. If, in the event, it was repaid, we would look at this in the context of Section 49 TCGA (contingent liabilities) and whether the borrower would then be entitled to make a claim under sub-section (2) to have any assessment reduced. Q. Must lenders show you details of their scheme before you can make a decision? Surely the principles are similar with all cashbacks? A. Although the principles may be similar, it is unlikely that any of the schemes will be quite the same. A proper opinion cannot be provided without examining the relevant documentation. Q. Presumably if a borrower showed you details of a cashback before taking out it out, you would be able to give him a clear answer regarding its tax treatment? A. Unless the borrower had already signed up, we would only be able to advise on schemes we had considered. But the lender could submit the scheme for consideration. Q. Is there a difference in the tax treatment of a repayment mortgage rather than an endowment one? A. It is unlikely that the type of mortgage involved will make a difference.</p>

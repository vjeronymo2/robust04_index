			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Offensive to talk of a vegetarian 'menace' Sir, The headline on Giles MacDonough's review of vegetarian books in the Weekend section ('Vegetarian food 'terrorism' ', September 17/18) and the title, 'The vegetarian menace', on the front page of the FT were gratuitously offensive. Calling vegetarianism a 'menace' and a form of 'food terrorism' is perverse in the extreme, given that it is a lifestyle which rejects violence against creatures capable of experiencing pain and suffering. 'Food terrorism' is a term more appropriate to describing the systematic abuse of animals inherent in today's factory farm systems of meat production. As for Hitler, there is a rotten apple in every pile. But demonising all vegetarians because of him is as absurd as making all omnivores guilty of Stalin's crimes. Plenty of vegetarians have made outstanding contributions to their age: Gandhi, George Bernard Shaw and Paul McCartney among them. Tony Carritt, Kapellalaan 21, 1950 Kraainem, Belgium</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPISCOPAL PASTOR CALLS FOR STAND AGAINST U.S. ROLE IN GULF;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PASADENA MINISTER DOESN'T RULE OUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IF NEEDED.  MANY CHURCHES ARE URGING A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION INSTEAD OF COMBAT.  </P> <P> The pastor of the largest Episcopal parish on the West Coast has called on  churches to "stand against (our) nation going to war" with demonstrations and  civil disobedience if necessary.  </P> <P> Although the Rev. George Regas, rector of the 3,000-member All Saints Episcopal  Church in Pasadena, agrees with overwhelming religious sentiment that Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait was villainous, he told his congregation last Sunday that  "war is no longer a viable option in 1990. War is always tragic."  </P> <P> Most Christian leaders have urged the United States to negotiate a solution to  the crisis and have questioned President Bush's reference in early August to  preserving the American "way of life" as he dispatched armed forces to oil-rich  Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> And, most recently, evangelical activist-editor Jim Wallis has urged U.S. troop  withdrawal and Regas' own bishop, the Right Rev. Frederick Borsch, has pointed  to troublesome ironies in the American moves.  </P> <P> The Sisters of Mercy, a 7,000-member, nationwide Catholic religious order based  in Louisville, Ky., this week opposed the U.S. military response and urged a  peaceful resolution. "We oppose any invasion or bombing of Iraq," said the  organization's statement.  </P> <P> But few, if any, religious figures have signaled clearly that they would stage  protests against American military action. "We must go to jail, we must do  anything to stand in the name of God against another monstrous war," Regas  exhorted from his pulpit.  </P> <P> Parishioners at All Saints probably weren't surprised at Regas' comments during  his sermon and a forum on the Persian Gulf crisis that followed.  </P> <P> Many times before, the impassioned liberal priest had condemned nuclear  weapons, U.S. policy in Nicaragua or increases in military spending. And the  church became the first Episcopal sanctuary for Central American refugees in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Recalling "severe" criticism that he and All Saints received for opposing the  Vietnam War in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Regas said that people asked  then how the church dared not to support the President at a critical time.  </P> <P> The parish also stirred some controversy during the 1980s when it helped to  found and then housed the Interfaith Center to Stop the Arms Race. As  contributions dried up late last year when the Cold War ended, the center moved  out and is debating its future.  </P> <P> Regas, whose parish delves into social-political subjects like few other  congregations, said the spirit of God was calling the churches to declare that  war would be "preposterous" at a time when prospects for world peace and a  "peace dividend" of anti-poverty money looked so promising.  </P> <P> "The church must stop blessing war. . . . War lays hold of the noblest elements  in the human character, with which we could make heaven on Earth, and uses them  to make hell on Earth," Regas said.  </P> <P> "There is no question that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is an unwholesome  character," Regas said. "I don't want to give any support to him."  </P> <P> He added that Americans are right to support President Bush and pray for him.  "We ought to love the soldiers who have gone there because the country asked  them to go," Regas said.  </P> <P> Churches as varied as Angelus Temple in Los Angeles and St. Thomas More  Catholic Church in Rialto have made special prayers for U.S. soldiers and for a  peaceful solution to the crisis. Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos of New York  asked western hemisphere parishes last Sunday to join in a national prayer for  peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Members of the San Luis Rey United Methodist Church and Temple Etz Chaim in  Thousand Oaks have mailed letters and cards to troops.  </P> <P> The 151,000-member Church of the Brethren, a pacifist denomination based in  Elgin, Ill., has joined with several Mennonite bodies to declare an "oil-free  Sunday" on Oct. 21. Church members will be asked to curtail their normal use of  gasoline and oil that day to illustrate "that our nation is willing to go to  war to keep the oil flowing."  </P> <P> Economic reasons for stationing American troops in Saudi Arabia disturbed  church leaders and groups such as the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc.,  which passed a resolution this month in Los Angeles to oppose spilling American  blood for oil.  </P> <P> The evangelical magazine Sojourners, published in Washington, decrying the  "distinctly low profile" taken by American churches on the issue, says in its  October issue that Hussein must be opposed, but by regional or U.N.-supervised  forces.  </P> <P> The predominant U.S. military presence on the side of Kuwait seems directed  toward "making the world safe more for feudalism and gas guzzling than for  democracy," wrote Wallis, the editor. "Are we prepared to bomb the children of  Baghdad, if necessary, to protect 'our oil'?" he asked.  </P> <P> A cautious statement was issued by the National Council of Churches' Executive  Coordinating Committee in mid-September. The growing American military forces  and "apparent open-ended nature of the U.S. involvement in the region give rise  to serious questions which we believe the churches should consider with care,"  said the committee.  </P> <P> Likewise, the Rev. Teruo Kawata, interim United Church of Christ executive for  Southern California, said in a regional newsletter to 140 congregations this  month that he "would not presume to second-guess the President" in the  difficult crisis, but he urged prayers that Bush and Hussein "not act out of  pride and anger."  </P> <P> Borsch, writing in his diocesan newspaper to church members in six counties,  said there were plenty of tactical and moral questions to ask. Without swift  containment of Hussein, the Iraqi leader could have been emboldened to swallow  up more neighboring countries, Borsch suggested. "And what of the day when  Hussein may have nuclear weapons?" the Los Angeles bishop wrote.  </P> <P> Yet, Borsch said things rarely turn out the way planners plan.  </P> <P> "No matter our intentions, our long-term military presence may make matters  worse for everyone but a few oligarchies that do not exactly represent American  ideas of democracy," he said.  </P> <P> "The pressures on our own already weakened economy grow. It would be, at the  least, ironic if, in seeking to keep our economic lifestyle, we should lose  it."  </P></p>

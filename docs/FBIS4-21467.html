			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 4 Apr--A decision on the dumping of  radioactive waste into the sea can only be made by the Russian  Government, and the Maritime Kray administration has no  authority to decide this question independently. Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister for the protection of the  environment and natural resources, said this during the course  of a meeting today with Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Koji  Watanabe. The minister gave this explanation in reply to the  ambassador's expressed concern over Japanese press reports that  the Maritime Kray authorities were allegedly planning to  sanction the further release of radioactive waste into the Sea  of Japan.    Danilov-Danilyan made the supposition that a decision on the  dumping ``may easily be avoided, especially if Japan provides  financial and technical assistance at the right time, and we are  able to set up temporary coastal capacity to store the waste.''  [passage omitted]    During the course of today's meeting, Danilov-Danilyan  highly  appraised Japan's desire for cooperation in this sphere. He  also gave an assurance that his ministry would carry out a  thorough ecological study, both of temporary capacities for  storing liquid radioactive waste and of capacities for turning  it into solid waste.</p>

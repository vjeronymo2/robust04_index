			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO TO BUY ANAHEIM BANK COMPANY  </P> <P> Wells Fargo &amp; Co., continuing its yearlong bank-buying spree, has agreed to  pay at least $48 million to purchase an Anaheim bank holding company and its  two units, Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in Anaheim, officials  of both companies said Friday.  </P> <P> The purchase price of Citizens Holdings could go up to $50.5 million by the  time banking regulators approve the deal and the transaction is concluded --  possibly by December -- under a provision that would reward the owners for  continued good financial results.  </P> <P> "These have been wonderful banks, and we've been successful in them. They have  had very good management," said Robert Katz, chairman and chief executive of  Citizens Holdings. "While we had other suitors, we felt that Wells was the  strongest and best choice for providing service to our customers and support to  our people."  </P> <P> Wells has agreed to offer jobs to all of about 200 employees at the two banks,  which have a total of six branches and combined assets of $264.6 million.  </P> <P> The branches -- three at each bank -- are "in very nice locations," said Liam  McGee, executive vice president and head of Wells Fargo Bank's Southern  California branch network. The offices will be added to Wells Fargo's 39 other  branches in the county.  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Wells, which only Tuesday agreed to buy ailing Great  American Bank's 130 California branches for $492 million, has been increasing  its presence in Southern California. In the last year, the bank has acquired  two other Southern California banks, along with a Bakersfield operation and a  Northern California institution.  </P></p>

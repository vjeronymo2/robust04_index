			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prem Shankar Jha: "Indo-U.S. Relations at </F> Crossroads"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] First there was the U.S. successful bid to stop the  sale by Russia of cryogenic rockets to India. Then came Mr. John  Malott's speech telling India how it should conduct its domestic  and regional policy, which was remarkable not for its content  but its eschewal of a two-year epoch of private diplomacy that  was the best indicator of warming Indo-U.S. relations, and a  return to public postures and rhetoric.    Then came Ms. Robin Raphel's extraordinary remark that the  U.S. no longer believed that the Simla agreement provided a  framework for settling the Kashmir dispute, because very few  discussions had taken place under the agreement in the past 20  years. One could say as much about the border between the U.S.  and Mexico.    We will pass over Ms. Raphel's gaffe on the Instrument of  Accession: A close look at the text of her statement shows that  she was caught unawares and did not realise the full implication  in international law of what she was saying. But only days later  we heard that the Administration intends to withdraw the  Pressler amendment and replace it with a new comprehensive  foreign aid law that will apply the Pressler-type restrictions  to all non-NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) countries and even  those signatories (read China) that are seeking to expand their  nuclear arsenals. India will, of course be included in the first  category.    And, as if our cup of woe was still not full we had to  listen  to Mr. Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human rights,  who told an Indian newsman that the U.S. disapproved of India's  Human rights record in Kashmir, and did not believe that a  nation's right to put down insurgency excused, let alone  justified, some abrogation of these rights.    At any normal time, such sustained, public arm-twisting,  would have signalled a deliberate decision by the U.S. to  replace cooperation with pressure as the basis of dealing with  India. But are these times normal in the U.S.? Are the postures  it is adopting, not only towards India, but towards China,  Japan, the EEC, and the United Nations on various issues,  sustainable? Above all, do the pronouncements coming out of  Washington reflect carefully worked out foreign policy  positions, or are they products of `Gung Ho activists in the  foreign policy establishment shooting from the hip'?    The truth lies somewhere in between. And this is presenting  New Delhi with a foreign policy dilemma that it may understand  but has, clearly, not been able to resolve. So far New Delhi has  carefully refrained from any public posturing and its  communications with the U.S. have been carried on strictly  within diplomatic channels, (although paraphrased in the press).  The tone of its communications, except on the issue of the  Instrument of Accession, has also been markedly moderate.    This would have been the correct response, had the U.S. got  its foreign policy act together. But if its policy is being made  largely by individuals shooting from the hip, then moderation is  just the wrong attitude to have adopted, for it has made India  appear defensive on issues like Human rights, Kashmir and to a  lesser extent, NPT, and has encouraged activists like Ms. Raphel  and Mr. Shattuck to think that they can push this country  around, a belief that Ms. Raphel has not bothered to hide.    The truth is that just at this moment the U.S. does not have  a clearly articulated foreign policy, except in one or two areas  such as supporting economic reform in Russia, de-nuclearisation  (again mainly in the former Soviet Union), and freer trade. Two  of even these have gone grievously wrong with the elections in  Russia.    Outside these core areas, the Clinton administration has  only  vaguely formed attitudes pushed by public opinion manipulated by  the media, whom Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher has  described somewhat querulously as the aspiring North Star of  American policy.    Thus it does not like Human rights violations; it wants all  countries to sign the NPT, and put their facilities under  fullscope safeguards; it wants a cleaner environment, and it  reserves its right to use bilateral trade pressure to secure  concessions in selected areas of trade, notably intellectual  property rights. It wants global stability, brokered by itself  and the NATO where it feels it more directly threatened, and  according to the U.S. permanent Representative to the U.N., Ms.  Madeleine Albright, by the U.N., which it considers a junior  partner, where it does not.    India could not fail to be at the receiving end of nearly  all  these concerns, despite the fact that it shares most of them,  because any attempt to force one country's views and `solutions'  on another, ends by denying the latter a large part of its  sovereignty. In effect the message being sent to India is `join  us and we will look after you; resist us and we will press down  on and eventually hurt you.'    The choice might have been a real one if these concerns had  reflected deeply felt convictions and not just vague attitudes.  But this is far from being the case. On Human rights no less an  organisation than the American Human Rights Watch has condemned  the Clinton administration of adopting double standards,  pressing for their observance where no other national interest  is involved, and giving them the go by when there is. It has  specifically indicted Mr. Clinton's record in this respect  towards Israel as being worse than Mr. George Bush's.    The U.S. has adopted double standards in a more fundamental  way: In Somalia its helicopter gunships blew away somewhere  between 150 and 300 Somali civilians in a retaliatory attack  designed to kill Aideed, for the killing of a single U.S.  soldier by one of his gunmen. The U.S. spokesman said that in  such an operation there were no innocent bystanders. And when  Mr. Keith Richburg of the Washington Post  investigated the casual killing of a Malaysian CARE worker by a  U.N. patrol while he was out buying his lunch, the U.N. command  said `Guerillas fire from crowds. They use women and children as  human shields. There are bound to be civilian casualties when  U.N. troops fire back in self-defence.' Does that sound familiar  Mr. Shattuck?    On the role of the U.N. as a world policeman, realism, burst  the media's pipe-dream of a new world order when none other than  President Clinton decided to pull U.S. troops out of Somalia  after the killing of 18 soldiers, and to start political talks  with Aideed and the other warlords. Within the U.N. Secretariat,  disillusionment with the forward policies that have been thrust  on the organisation by the rich nations in the heady afterglow  of the Gulf War is complete. There is a total consensus that the  U.N. must not undertake any more military actions under the  mandatory chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, and that even  supervisory or humanitarian actions under chapter 6, will not be  possible if national contingent commanders do not place  themselves unreservedly under the U.N. commandant. Ms. Madeleine  Albright's September dream of U.S.-U.N. partnership is already  light years out of date.    The administration's lack of commitment reflects an even  more  profound lack of interest in the American public. In civilised  drawing rooms from Washington to Cambridge, no one is talking  about foreign policy. What true American liberals are appalled  about is the crime bill that has been rushed through Congress.  Children over 13 will now be treated as adults and can be  sentenced to death mandatorily on as many as 19 (or is it 29)  counts. The passage of this bill has focussed attention as  nothing else could have on the internal social problems of the  country -- the growing racial divide, the violence, crime and  decay in the inner cities; the growing inequalities in health  care, the fact that a large part of the population has grown  poorer in the Eighties and Nineties; the rise in highly educated  white collar unemployment, and the deterioration in the status  of blue collar workers all over the country.    These are Mr. Clinton's real worries, and he has unabashedly  little time to spare for a foreign policy that is no longer  rooted in an acute sense of national insecurity. But the foreign  policy establishment is a leftover of the old days when this was  where the best and the brightest went. Activism is therefore  part of its very blood. But it is now activism without a guiding  beacon, or a steady restraining hand. So every one is shooting  from the hip. New Delhi may choose not to shoot back but it must  show that it has little respect for Washington's cowboys. And,  it must rebuild its relations with China.</p>

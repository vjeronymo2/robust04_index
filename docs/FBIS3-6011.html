			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- The Japan-U.S. agreement on  cellular phones trade did not come because Tokyo bowed to U.S.  pressure to open its market but as a result of a private-level  accord, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday.    "It is not that we yielded to U.S. pressure... but it came  after private-level talks made headway," the top government  spokesman told a news conference.    But he also said, "Frankly, we are delighted at the result."    Earlier Monday, a Japanese Government source criticized the  U.S. Government for overly intervening on behalf of a specific  company.    The source said the way Washington helped Motorola Inc. to  increase its market share in Japan was something Tokyo would  never contemplate.    The Motorola negotiations were a matter of private business,  and the U.S. Government could not deny it was working for a  specific company, he said.    The source said he expects the U.S. may take a similar  attitude in future trade negotiations.    "As long as Japan has such a huge trade surplus, Japan  cannot  take a tough stance toward such a U.S. attitude," he said.    Under the Japan-U.S. accord reached Saturday, Nippon Idou  Tsusin Corp. [Japan Mobile Communications Corporation] (IDO)  will launch a full-scale expansion of service in the Tokyo and  Nagoya areas using the Motorola system. IDO will shift some  service now geared to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. to  the Motorola-oriented service.</p>

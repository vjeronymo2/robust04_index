			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Leaders to meet over cost of unification: Top-level attempt to reach an accord follows poor support from voters in Berlin MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), will attempt at top-level talks tomorrow to cobble together a basic understanding on financing the rising costs of German unification. Both sought yesterday to present themselves as open-minded and ready to compromise after their respective parties - Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the SPD, its main national rival - suffered a humiliating drain of support in Sunday's local council elections in Berlin. At the same time both men firmly ruled out any talk of a 'grand coalition' to deal with the country's financial squeeze. The Berlin results showed widespread dissatisfaction with the two big national parties, large-scale abstention (the total turnout was at a post-war low of 61.2 per cent), and a drift to more extreme parties on the left and right. Opponents of a grand coalition in Bonn point to the fact that the Berlin backlash is aimed precisely at such a ruling coalition in the city senate. The biggest beneficiary of the Berlin result was the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the renamed former Socialist Unity party, alias the Communist party of East Germany, which won 11.3 per cent of the total vote, and 29.7 per cent in the districts of former East Berlin. Mr Gregor Gysi, leader of the PDS, said he was satisfied with his party's recovery, which proved that it could no longer be ignored at local and national level. All the established parties voiced relief that the extreme right-wing Republicans only managed to achieve 8.3 per cent of the overall vote, short of the 10 per cent which had been forecast in opinion polls. They won only 5.4 per cent of the vote in east Berlin, but in the west of the city managed 9.9 per cent. Mr Kohl's CDU slumped in east Berlin to 14.3 per cent of support, although it managed to top the poll in the west with 35 per cent: overall it lay second to the SPD, which won a constant 31.8 per cent on both sides of the former Berlin Wall. Indeed, the SPD was the only party whose support suggested that east and west Berlin were both parts of a single political system. The Berlin results confirmed a growing disenchantment with the main political parties in Bonn, refocusing attention on tomorrow's talks. In an interview with the German press agency (DPA), Mr Kohl said yesterday that he was prepared to discuss 'quite openly all the different proposals'. While he rejected the latest call, by federal President Richard von Weizsacker, for a wealth tax to finance the cost of unification, he no longer sought to limit the forthcoming debate. 'We must find a medium-term and long-term solution, a solution based on reason, to the financing problems of the union, the federal states and the local authorities,' he said.</p>

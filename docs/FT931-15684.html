			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UN resolution on the new border IN A resolution running to 34 operative paragraphs, approved on April 3 1991, the UN Security Council called on the secretary-general 'to lend assistance to make arrangements' with Iraq and Kuwait to demarcate their boundary, writes Our UN Correspondent in New York. The Council so decided to guarantee the inviolability of that boundary and 'take as appropriate all necessary measures to that end in accordance with the Charter'. After a series of meetings in New York and Geneva, the UN Iraq-Kuwait's boundary demarcation commission, set up under the resolution, announced that physical demarcation of part of the border was completed last November. The commission decided that the line should be moved north effective on January 15 - next Friday. But a map of the proposed changes has not yet been issued. However, a commission official said yesterday that at the widest point the loss of Iraqi territory under the proposed changes amounted to no more than about 700 metres. A flight-exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel was imposed on Iraq after the Gulf war, mainly to protect the oppressed Kurds. Coalition members invoked Security Council Resolution 688 of April 1991 which demanded that President Saddam Hussein stop oppressing his own people. The resolution did not threaten force. But last week, in giving Iraq 48 hours to withdraw anti-aircraft missiles from the no-fly zone imposed on the south to protect the Shias, the US, UK and France warned of an appropriate, decisive response if Baghdad did not comply.</p>

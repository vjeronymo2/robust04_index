			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / IMF chief cool to Clarke's aid plan The plan of Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, to sell some of the International Monetary Fund's gold to help ease some poor developing nations' debt burden had a cool reception from Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, yesterday. He did not reject the idea but said all other instruments should be considered before disposing of the Fund's 'family jewels'. The IMF's 103.4m fine ounces of gold, worth Dollars 40bn, was being put to good use by the Fund, he declared. It was used to guarantee the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) which had provided support to 26 poor developing countries on concessional terms. The IMF had also pledged 3m oz in support of a programme to help countries in arrears with the IMF regain the ability to borrow from the fund. Peru and Sierra Leone were among countries that had benefited.</p>

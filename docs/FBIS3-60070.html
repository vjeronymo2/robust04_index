			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Alvarado] </F>   [Text] The economy of the towns of Nuevo Casas Grandes,  Janos, Ascencion, and Juarez has embarked on a period of crisis  due to the inactivity of drug traffickers in the region. This  claim was made yesterday by the Federal Judicial Police first  commander, Javier Norona Guerrero.    He declared: "People are complaining that there is no money,  because the traffickers have stopped circulating their cash  through various establishments."    Norona remarked that drug shipments through the region are  no  longer large, since dealers now prefer to risk only small  quantities of their merchandise.    According to information obtained by the commander, towns  such as Nuevo Casas Grandes, Janos, and Ascencion have lost  business in jewelry and discotheque establishments.    Although to a lesser extent, Ciudad Juarez also has felt the  effects of the battle against the drug traffic, because money  laundering has declined, according to the commander.    He declared: "Drug dealing has been reduced and, in some  towns, businesses are operating with very little money too,  because of the lack of drug traffic."    Norona presumes that the investments made by drug  traffickers  will decrease, and remain at low levels during the coming  months, as a result of a battle that has been started to curb  them.    The operation called "Blockade Against Drugs and Weapons"  provided for investigative and surveillance work by Federal and  State Judicial Police [PJE] agents who, since its initiation,  have been combing highways and villages in the northern  Chihuahua region by air and land. Official reports obtained  yesterday by the Sub-Agency of the Office of the Attorney  General of the Republic [PGR] indicated that, within just four  days (1-4 December), the operation made it possible to seize 400  kg of marijuana.    The Federal Police commander declared: "We are hitting the  drug traffic very hard, and this will continue."    Norona took office as first commander in mid-November, after  the PGR's representative in the state, Teresa Jardi, charged  that the battle against the drug traffic had failed because of  corrupt acts on the part of the previous commander.    Norona commented: "The volume of drugs that we seized early  this month will be tripled before we finish."    In Nuevo Casas Grandes, a town that has seen the  proliferation of shopping centers, discotheques, and jewelry  shops in less than 10 years, the drug traffic has stopped  injecting stratospheric volumes of capital, according to the  commander.    Norona claims that the clearest sign that the same thing is  about to occur in Ciudad Juarez is the fact that large drug  shipments have stopped passing through that town during recent  weeks.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON SUED OVER MOBILE HOME RENT LAW  </P> <P> Carson's largest mobile home park filed a federal lawsuit against the city this  week, asking $25 million in damages and seeking to overturn portions of the  city's strict mobile home rent control ordinance.  </P> <P> Citing a federal appeals court decision, the suit seeks to eliminate a  provision, known as vacancy control, that prevents park owners from increasing  the rent for a space when a resident sells a mobile home to a new tenant. The  suit, filed Monday by the 409-space Carson Harbor Village, says this provision  is unconstitutional.  </P> <P> In a second line of attack, the suit also seeks to relax Carson's formula for  rent increases, which in general permits them only to pay for higher operating  costs and capital improvements. Referring to a recent state Supreme Court  decision, the attorney for the park said rent control should not prevent park  owners from earning a reasonable profit on their investment.  </P> <P> The filing of the federal lawsuit follows a series of similar lawsuits filed in  state Superior Court by the Colony Cove, Carson Gardens, Avalon Carson and  Shangri Lodge, all Carson mobile home parks. The cases, which date from last  October, are still pending.  </P> <P> In challenging Carson's vacancy control, the Carson Harbor Village lawsuit  cites a 1986 federal appellate decision in a case involving a Santa Barbara  mobile home park. The ruling said preventing rent increases when a tenant moves  out can result in an unconstitutional seizure of private property by the  government because rent control may enable mobile home residents to sell their  units at artificially inflated prices. Park owners, whose rents remain low, may  lose out, the court held.  </P> <P> The appellate decision was cited May 30 by Senior U.S. District Judge Laughlin  E. Waters when he struck down vacancy control for about 7,000 mobile homes in  the city of Los Angeles. Waters awarded $1 million in damages to the owners of  the Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> In arriving at the amount of damages, Waters analyzed comparable sales of  mobile homes and ruled that 48 mobile home owners who had sold their units  during the preceding year had reaped profits averaging $20,000 because the new  tenants' rents remained controlled.  </P> <P> In the suit filed against Carson, attorney Richard Close said a study of sales  in Carson Harbor Village estimates that the value of a mobile home there is  about $50,000 higher than the value of a comparable mobile home in areas  without vacancy control. The suit seeks damages for each unit, whether or not  it has been sold.  </P> <P> But Coni Hathaway, chairwoman of Homeowners Against Rent Decontrol, the city's  most active mobile home owners organization, said mobile homes in Carson do not  sell for more than those in comparable parks outside the city where there is no  rent control.  </P> <P> Hathaway said her organization is collecting data on mobile home sales prices.  "Our preliminary analysis shows that, comparable-to-comparable, they are the  same," she said.  </P> <P> Hathaway said the city should fight to keep its mobile home ordinance to  maintain the stock of affordable housing.  </P> <P> "Because real estate values have gone up so high, mobile homes now provide an  ideal way for a family or an older couple to be able to afford a home," she  said.  </P> <P> Close countered that the city is ignoring the federal appellate decision at  considerable legal risk and urged that Carson eliminate vacancy control, as  several other cities have done, before a judge forces the issue.  </P> <P> "Carson will lose like the city of Los Angeles lost," he said. "Can the  taxpayers of Carson afford the bill? What services is the City Council going to  cut to pay various mobile home park owners?"  </P> <P> In attacking the often-upheld concept of rent control, Close said he hopes that  the reasoning of a more conservative state Supreme Court will be persuasive in  the federal lawsuit.  </P> <P> He pointed out that in a case involving Proposition 103, the auto insurance  initiative, the state Supreme Court recently held that insurance companies are  entitled to fair rate of return.  </P> <P> "Likewise, we say that landlords are entitled to a fair rate of return," Close  said.  </P></p>

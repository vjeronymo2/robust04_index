			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Bottomley sparks row over hospital beds Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was yesterday at the centre of a political row over the National Health Service after she forecast a reduction of 50,000 beds by the year 2002. Mrs Bottomley told the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in Brighton that surgical advances would make many hospital stays unnecessary. She said keyhole surgery would account for 80 per cent of operations by 2002, while 60 per cent of operations would be carried out on a day-care basis. The figures demonstrated a 'dramatic shift in the balance between the hospital and the community', she said. A reduction of 50,000 beds would amount to 40 per cent of existing capacity. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said Mrs Bottomley was right to draw attention to the potential impact of techniques such as keyhole surgery on demand for beds. But he said the NHS internal market in health services had made sensible planning impossible because hospitals were 'obsessed with commerce and accountancy'. Mr Blunkett said hospital waiting lists had risen by a third in 10 years because of the government's 'muddled' approach to the NHS. 'All we have to show for the Tory vision of the NHS is a vast increase in management and bureaucracy. Cutting so many more beds while waiting lists remain so high will not help patients.' The row over beds follows sustained criticism of Mrs Bottomley's handling of a reorganisation of London's health services, which involves closing some well-known hospitals. She is also involved in a dispute with Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, over the treatment of single mothers. The growing criticism of her performance has fuelled persistent rumours that Mr John Major, the prime minister, will move her to another portfolio in the cabinet reshuffle expected soon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J.M.: "Dialogue, but Only in a Basket"] </F>   [Text] Last night Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov returned from a  four-day working visit to Germany and issued the following  statement at Skopje Airport:    "The visit functioned as a participation in a European forum  where we had the opportunity of presenting our general policy  and our views about Europe and the Balkans, about everything  that has happened in the past two years, particularly after the  Yugoslav crisis and the war in this region, and my opinion is  that it was well accepted. Our stance coincides with the  deliberations of different circles in Europe concerning the  future actions to be undertaken with the aim of having a united  Europe one day, when all the states will have their opportunity  according to how they are prepared, internally and externally,  to join such a union.    "The goal of the visit was to realize various contacts with  high-ranking German politicians and my opinion is that it was  done in the proper time, having in mind the embargo of our  southern neighbor and all the consequences emerging from it  inside the community itself. At the same time, we transmitted  our views about the situation here and about the way we view the  solution for the problems we have with the Republic of Greece.  Not a single interlocutor could find an excuse for the measures  undertaken by Greece against Macedonia, and on the other hand,  it was very important that I had the opportunity of expressing  our readiness for further discussions. We have hitherto also  emphasized that we are ready to talk about all questions, but we  also stressed that we could have no discussions if all the  basket was not put on the agenda, in order not to leave anything  unclarified that could tomorrow serve as a reason for  misunderstandings or new embargoes.''    Asked about the meeting and the discussions with Mr. Van den  Broek, President Gligorov replied: "The meeting occurred at his  request and we had long discussions about the ways out of this  situation. I underlined that the basic issue was how Europe  would find a solution for the embargo, because our stance is  that it is not just a problem of the Macedonian-Greek border,  but it refers to a part of the border of the European Union.  Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union is also  involved in this problem, because it is not a bilateral, but a  unilateral act of a state. My opinion is that there were no  differences in the stances, however we talked a lot about the  possible modalities, but without reaching a firm stance on how  to get out of that situation."</p>

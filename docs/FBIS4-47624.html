			<p>A      recent interview with a Serb regional leader from Herzegovina  has revealed the potential for a rift between Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.  In  the interview published in the independent Montenegrin weekly  Monitor on 6 May, Bozidar Vucurevic, mayor of Trebinje and  virtual warlord of eastern Herzegovina, acknowledged that he has  promoted the idea that Karadzic should become president of "all  the Serbs."  After demurring that he had intended the suggestion  as a "joke," Vucurevic immediately contradicted himself--and  alluded to other supporters of the idea--by declaring that, "if  it comes to an alliance of all Serbian countries, we shall  propose" that Karadzic be its president.  While heaping praise on  Milosevic, Vucurevic insisted that he only represents a part of a  Serbian leadership triumvirate that includes Karadzic and Bosnian  Serb Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik.  Of Karadzic,  Vucurevic opined that he is a "great politician" whom "God  himself sent to the Serbian people."  Vucurevic apparently is not  alone in his opinion that Karadzic should supplant Milosevic:  The results of a poll published in Belgrade last year claimed  that Karadzic was the most popular politician in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), even at the time  of the supposed "rift" between the two after the Bosnian Serb  assembly rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan in May 1993 (Nedeljna  Borba, 5-6 June 1993).      Milosevic, who is promoted by the dominant Belgrade media that he  controls as the preeminent leader of the Serbs of former  Yugoslavia, is likely to be infuriated by the suggestion that  Karadzic should supplant him as leader of the Serbian cause.  While Karadzic often defers to Milosevic as acknowledged leader  of the Serbs of former Yugoslavia, at a time when Karadzic is  demanding the eventual creation a unitary Greater Serbia (Borba,  4 May), Milosevic is likely to view Vucurevic remarks as a bid by  Karadzic for recognition as chief Serb leader and spokesman for  the Serbian cause.  Although it is unlikely that Milosevic would  withdraw his support of Karadzic as he has with others who  challenged his authority such as Krajina Serb leader Milan Babic  and former Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, he may well seek to  undermine Karadzic's support among the Serbs to help create the  appearance that his own political base remains solid.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "Those Who Make Decisions Are </F> Accountable for Them"]    [Text] It is intolerable that Russian soldiers should be  sent to locations where their lives will be endangered as a  result of decisions made without Russia's participation, Vitaliy  Churkin, the Russian president's special spokesman on  Yugoslavia, said in Zagreb with regard to the possible dispatch  to Bosnia of the unit of Russian "blue helmets" stationed in  Serb Krajina.    The order to transfer 400 servicemen (around one-third of  the  personnel of the Russian battalion) was given to battalion  commander Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy by the headquarters of the  UN forces in Zagreb Monday without coordination with Moscow.  Aside from the fact that there was a breach of normal procedure  here, which presupposes consent to such measures on the part of  the Russian leadership, French General Jean Cot, commander of  the UN contingent in Yugoslavia, has acted improperly at the  very least. On two counts, moreover.    Evidently the intention was to station the Russians in the  Sarajevo region, where additional forces are now required -- and  at the moment when the NATO ultimatum deadline is about to  expire. That is, were NATO to carry out its threatened air  strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, Russian soldiers would be  required to suffer the disastrous consequences of the punitive  bombing. But, first, the decision on bombing raids was taken by  NATO without prior consultation with Russia and, what is more,  Moscow was told that NATO "has no intention of being preached  to." Second, France, Britain, and the United States have done  everything they can to prevent the convening of the Security  Council -- as Russia has proposed -- for the adoption of a  special decision on the threats to bomb Bosnia. Therefore the  Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries have quite justifiably  forbidden the command of the Russian battalion to carry out the  redeployment order. Evidently there is still serious talking to  be done with our Western partners over future cooperation in  peacekeeping operations.    Meanwhile, U.S. newspapers have reported that the Clinton  administration indicated Tuesday that it will agree to a  compromise that does not go as far as NATO's demand for the  Bosnian Serbs' guns to be withdrawn from Sarajevo or placed  under UN control by the end of the week. In the opinion of U.S.  officials, some heavy artillery can stay on the hills above the  Bosnian capital. However, the United States will insist on  guarantees that these guns will not be fired.    According to reports from the Serbian part of Sarajevo,  competitions have been held on Jahorina Hill in honor of the  10th anniversary of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Thus, the  Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated their respect for the  International Olympic Committee's call for a truce during the  Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.</p>

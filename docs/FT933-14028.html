			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Big fall expected in BR pension surplus THE SURPLUS in British Rail's pension scheme is expected to have shrunk dramatically when its actuarial valuation is completed this autumn, raising questions about whether the scheme will be able to pay full pensions indefinitely after privatisation. The Pounds 8.5bn pool with about 130,000 contributing members was said to have had a surplus of about Pounds 1bn at the time of its last valuation in 1990. That surplus is expected to have shrunk by nearly two-thirds, reflecting the effects of contributions holidays for BR, benefit enhancements for scheme members, lower than expected dividend income, a switch into lower-risk investments and the effects of the actuarial treatment of overseas investments and agricultural properties. Because of BR's redundancy programme, the scheme's investment managers have been forced to switch to lower yielding but less risky instruments. The scheme has moved roughly Pounds 1bn out of equities into fixed-interest securities within the past year. The government has proposed the scheme should operate for all BR employees left in the industry after privatisation, with existing assets used to pay their pensions and those of future pensioners. But trustees fear that without a single employer behind the scheme, it will be necessary for the government to provide a 'solvency' guarantee, to ensure benefits are paid. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has promised the trustees of the BR scheme, who include BR management and employees, that he will study their solvency guarantee proposals. Many UK pension schemes undergoing a triennial valuation this year are reporting shrinkages in surpluses. Most actuaries have assumed dividend growth of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for the period just passed, and dividend growth has been flat for the past 18 months. British Telecommunications earlier this year reported that lower than expected dividend growth and changes in the rate at which pension schemes can reclaim advance corporation tax on dividends had cut its surplus this year by nearly Pounds 1bn.</p>

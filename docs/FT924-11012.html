			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind outlines savings on EFA SAVINGS of up to 30 per cent in the cost of the European Fighter Aircraft project can be achieved, meeting the demands of Britain's partners in the venture, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs yesterday. He said the reductions required by Italy, Germany and Spain to save the EFA would not affect its military capability. The identification of cost savings follows government-commissioned studies of the project on which 28,000 UK jobs depend. Production costs could be reduced by up to 20 per cent. Further savings, up to 30 per cent, were possible, he said. Mr Rifkind expressed the hope that all four countries would continue to take part in the project. 'Both the Italian and Spanish defence ministers have indicated that they are very impressed with the savings identified,' he said.</p>

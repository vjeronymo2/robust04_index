			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (7): A pernicious symptom of recession - Slower payment is adding to industry's heavy burden ONE man's meat is another man's poison. Directors of big, publicly quoted companies might reflect on this if they boast about their cash management achievements during the current financial reporting season. Reduced working capital is achievable in a number of ways including better stock control. But as every company accounts department knows, one of the crudest, if most effective, methods is to chase up customer debtors and keep supplier creditors at bay. The problem of late payment always surfaces during a recession - when money is tight and banks are twitchy - and the economic downturn of the early 1990s has been no exception. All companies suffer but small businesses with limited resources definitely bear the brunt. Legislation is planned which will force businesses of a certain size to state publicly in their annual accounts how long it takes them to pay their bills. But there are growing calls for tougher action, including compulsory financial penalties for offenders. All the recent evidence suggests that the recession is lengthening payment delays. The Association of British Factors and Discounters says that the time taken for European companies to pay their debts increased on average by one third in 1992. Even in Germany, payment periods have widened from 30 to around 50 days. Trade Indemnity, the UK credit insurer, showed in a survey published last month that only 3 per cent of 600 companies polled in December were being paid on time. The additional cost of interest on borrowed money (or loss of interest for companies in the black) obviously feeds through to lower trading margins. Creditors without a formal funding facility, of course, will suffer bigger penalties so that profitable companies can run into serious cash flow difficulties. On top of this the cost of systems and resources allocated to address overdue debt should not be forgotten; nor can the VAT effects of late payment be overlooked. Businesses are often paying output VAT before the money has been received from customers, thus leading to a further cost of/loss of interest. All in all late payment could amount to 3 to 5 per cent of operating costs - a significant number in today's tough market conditions. German experience may indeed be worsening - but given that the annual average payment delay in the UK is more like 78 days what is happening elsewhere is of more than academic interest. The average collection period in the US is 54 days. The Deparment of Trade and Industry has issued a payments procedure. And the Confederation of British Industry, which says that late payment threatens the survival of one in five of its members, has a 'prompt payers' code. Only 400 businesses out of the 250,000 members have signed up though the list includes Esso, Boots, British Airways and Glaxo. The Government's disclosure plan - which should be in force by the end of the year - is the first legally binding initiative in the late payments area. The hope is that large companies will be embarrassed to admit to bad practice, and will therefore be shamed into pulling up their socks. The rights of redress for an injured party have always been available through the Sale of Goods Act - but many smaller suppliers are reluctant to cause a fuss for fear of losing out on future business. Mr Kerry McKevitt, a director of UCMCL, Beaconsfield-based credit consultants, regrets that the legislation does not go further. 'It is unfortunate that it does not include the statutory requirement of all companies to disclose both their collection days and their payment days, to enable direct comparison,' he says. 'If, for example, a company showed it collected its debts in 45 days there would be little moral justification for paying its creditors in 65 days - the difference equating to an additional 20 days financing from its creditors.' Many small business lobbyists - such as the Forum for Private Business  - believe there should be a statutory right to interest on overdue payments. All EC member states - except Britain and Ireland - have such a legal right but according to the European Commission there is no conclusive evidence that this improves the situation. McKevitt suggests that rather than compulsorily debiting offending companies it may be better for the interest at least to be separately accounted for by businesses. This would provide the DTI with evidence of the cost and effect of late payment to industry - and enable the Department to take better remedial action in future. McKevitt acknowledges the administrative complexities of such schemes, but he claims the introduction of statutory interest in Germany has been beneficial for investment. The idea of a prompt payment standard - or kitemark - has recently been floated by the Institute of Credit Management which has approached both the British Standards Institution and the government for a response. The institute's original plan was for a prompt payment clause to be added to BS5750, a quality management standard which has won widespread acceptance. But this was rejected by the BSI. The proposed kitemark would commit companies to paying their bills by the date stipulated in the agreed terms.</p>

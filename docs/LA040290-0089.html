			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FROM GENUINE EMOTION TO SHOW BIZ;  </P> <P> BENEFIT: CROSBY, STILLS, NASH &amp; YOUNG HONOR THEIR DRUMMER DALLAS TAYLOR,  WHO NEEDS A LIVER TRANSPLANT, AND RAISE FUNDS TO BATTLE DRUG ABUSE.  </P> <P> Benefit concerts have turned into rock's hottest guessing game. As soon as the  official lineups are announced for these multi-act shows, fans begin  speculating on who'll show up for the de rigueur all-star jams at the end.  </P> <P> The guessing at events that charge more than $100 a ticket usually begins with  one of the Big Bs -- Bob or Bruce -- and proceeds through the alphabet: R these  days for Bonnie Raitt, S invariably for Sting, and so forth.  </P> <P> On Saturday night at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the guessing lasted  until just after midnight, when it was apparent that the only "extra" was the  man in whose honor the concert was held: drummer Dallas Taylor.  </P> <P> Taylor, the original drummer with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, sat in with  his old mates for the first time in nearly 20 years on two of CSNY's best-known  numbers, "Wooden Ships" and "Teach Your Children."  </P> <P> Taylor, whose career was ruined in the '70s by drug abuse, has been an abuse  counselor himself for about five years and learned last November that he is in  desperate need of a liver transplant. He is now on a waiting list.  </P> <P> Saturday's concert -- which also featured Don Henley and the Desert Rose Band  -- was designed to focus attention on the organ donor program and to raise  funds for the Freda Foundation, a nonprofit drug abuse research and education  organization. It was expected to raise about $125,000.  </P> <P> Even though the artists said good night as they left the stage, much of the  audience remained, waiting for some sort of surprise. Since David Crosby and  Chris Hillman -- now leader of the Desert Rose Band -- were both on hand, maybe  there would be a repeat of the Byrds mini-reunion that occurred in February at  the Roy Orbison/homeless benefit at the Universal Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Or because Neil Young and Stephen Stills had both performed, there was a chance  of a partial Buffalo Springfield regrouping. Henley's presence could have meant  a partial Eagles assembly.  </P> <P> But the closest any of this came to reality was early in the evening when  former Eagle Timothy B. Schmit joined Henley as he sang the Eagles' 1974 hit  "The Best of My Love."  </P> <P> While the speculation is inevitable in a city that is home to so many  celebrated musicians, the preoccupation with "surprise" and "history" tends to  undercut the natural drama of the evening.  </P> <P> Aside from the emotional surge of seeing Taylor on stage again, the musical  highlights of the night were tied strictly to individual artistry, not  nostalgic repackaging. The most compelling art was provided by Henley and  Young.  </P> <P> Their approaches were vastly different. Henley was joined by a dozen musicians  and surprised the crowd with his own version of Johnny Mercer and Harold  Arlen's "Come Rain or Come Shine," while Young paced the stage anxiously with  just his own guitar.  </P> <P> They were linked by the independence and excellence of their material, as both  men sang about troubling social concerns -- Henley's "The End of the  Innocence," Young's "Rockin' in the Free World" -- without sacrificing idealism  and hope.  </P> <P> Surprise guests at the end might have given the evening more of an emotional  buzz, but it is unlikely that they would have matched the power and passion of  Henley and Young. Yet the curiosity lingers. The mainly acoustic program was to  have been repeated Sunday night, this time to benefit the California  Environmental Protection Act. And Saturday you could hear people on the way out  already speculating on who might join the lineup. The guessing was soon halfway  through the alphabet.  </P></p>

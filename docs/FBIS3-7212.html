			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Cao Vang] </F>   [Text] A special characteristic of the oil and gas industry  in Vietnam is that 100 percent of the products are imported from  abroad and then sold on domestic markets. Since 1991,  approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas have been sold on  domestic markets each year. That is the equivalent of $600  million. (Most of the oil and gas is imported from Zone II  markets.)    In previous years, the state made the Oil and Gas General  Corporation (Petrolimex), which is subordinate to the Ministry  of Commerce, responsible for all commercial aspects, including  import and distribution functions, and for providing unified  support on markets nationwide. But since 1991, various  corporations (such as the Oil and Gas Import-Export Corporation,  the Central Petroleum Corporation, the Saigon Petrol  Corporation, the Vung Tau Joint Oil and Gas Services  Corporation, and the Aviation Oil and Gas Corporation) and also  a number of other units and organizations in the southern  provinces have been participating in commercial activities and  competing against the Oil and Gas General Corporation.    We realize that along with switching to a market mechanism,  it is necessary to have many business entities and competition  among the entities in order to prevent monopolies, give vitality  to market activities, improve results, improve the quality of  the commercial activities, and serve the consumers better. But  what should be pointed out here is that competition on the oil  and gas markets in Vietnam today is very different from this.  Competition today is spontaneous and disorderly and is carried  on to serve local and individual interests rather than to  support production and the lives of the people. This is why the  corporations and commercial organizations subject to state  ownership lack wholesome competition and have failed to achieve  results in importing and distributing oil and gas.    There are several main problems in our country's oil and gas  markets that need to be given attention:    First, a number of corporations, units, and organizations  engage in tax evasion (in both import and distribution  activities). The state is losing both import duties and income  taxes. According to regulations currently in force, the import  duty on each ton of oil and gas is 40 percent of the import  price, and the income tax is about 2 percent of the selling  price. If a ton of imported oil and gas costs $220, the import  duty is $88 (which is about 1 million dong). And if the selling  price of a ton of oil and gas (approximately 1,200 liters) is 3  million dong (2,500 dong per liter times 1,200), the income tax  is 60,000 dong (2 percent times 3 million dong). Thus, for every  ton of oil and gas on which the taxes are not paid, the state  loses 1,060,000 dong in revenues. According to statistics, of  the approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas imported and  sold every year in Vietnam today, the Oil and Gas General  Corporation handle approximately 72 percent (about 2.16 million  tons). The other corporations and commercial organizations  handle approximately 28 percent (about 840,000 tons). Basically,  the state can control and collect only the taxes owed by the Oil  and Gas General Corporation. The state cannot control or fully  collect the large percentage of the taxes owed by the other  corporations and commercial organizations.    Second, because of tax evasion, competition between the oil  and gas enterprises is not fair. As we know, the Oil and Gas  General Corporation, which is directly managed by the state,  must perform two functions: it must carry on profitable  operations and also provide oil and gas to support the targets,  including remote locations such as the mountainous areas where  transportation is difficult and expensive, at unified "ceiling  prices" (without distinction between remote and nearby and  difficult and easy markets). In this situation, it is obviously  difficult for the the Oil and Gas General Corporation to remain  dynamic and keep up with market changes, and it is hard for it  to compete with other oil and gas corporations and enterprises  that are not directly controlled by the state. Because they are  not directly managed by the state, these corporations and  commercial organizations can not only avoid paying taxes but  they can also easily raise or lower oil and gas prices instead  of adhering to the state's stipulated price. Actual surveys have  shown that the selling price of a liter of A76 gasoline in July  1993 varied as follows: In Hanoi, a liter sold for 2,900 dong  while in Danang it cost 2,500 dong. In Ho chi Minh City it cost  2,400 dong, and in Can Tho the price was 2,300 dong. Clearly,  these prices do not reflect a wholesome and fair nature in  commerce. The main reason for this is that many oil and gas  corporations and enterprises avoid paying taxes and so they can  sell their products at a price below the stipulated price.  Another reason for this is that they don't have to incur  expenses in transporting gasoline to distant markets.    Third, because the oil and gas business lacks unified  organization and management, investments have been skewed, and  much capital has been wasted. It is estimated that the  corporations that became involved in the oil and gas business  just recently have invested more than 630 billion dong to build  storehouses and to purchase means of transportation. At the same  time, according to data of the Oil and Gas General Corporation,  the existing storehouse system and means of transportation are  adequate to satisfy the needs for storing and transporting all  the oil and gas needed.    In order to solve the above problems, in my view, the  following measures should be implemented:    1. The state must implement a mechanism to reestablish order  in the oil and gas markets with respect to imports and internal  distribution. The question is: On what viewpoints should this  order be reestablish? In order to reestablish order, on one  hand, there must be many commercial subjects to compete with and  stimulate each other in order to improve commercial results and  quality and to satisfy the varied needs of consumers. On the  other hand, in terms of mechanisms, the state must have concrete  and binding stipulations on commercial functions and  responsibilities and commercial locations (nearby and remote)  for each oil and gas business subordinate to the state sector.  At the same time, commercial activities, from importing to  distributing oil and gas within the country, must be monitored  closely and tax evasion must be opposed in order to increase  budget revenues. Based on this, fair competition must be ensured  between the various types of subjects. This means that in all  circumstances, to hit the state's macrocosmic targets of  collecting the taxes in full and stabilizing the markets, market  safety and civilization must be maintained based on the  principle of "ensuring national interests and not interfering  directly in the commercial activities of the primary-level  economic units." The oil and gas business must be maintained  based on a state-controlled market mechanism. There must be  flexible coordination between commercialization of prices and  oil and gas "ceiling price" management on markets nationwide.    2. In order to ensure that state control of the oil and gas  sphere is effective, the immediate thing is to reorganize the  system of oil and gas corporations and units and not to have too  many oil and gas import centers or too many oil and gas import  corporations and enterprises as at present. At a level of 3  million tons of oil and gas a year, we need only about four  commercial subjects. This is a sector in which in the state  monopolizes business. Thus, units and individuals cannot be  allowed to "dominate" business and run after profits alone.    In reality, the oil and gas subjects used to have a close  relationship, but because they are subordinate to many different  organizations, they compete for profits. On the other hand, the  organizational system has many intermediary echelons and is  dispersed, and this has created many difficulties for oil and  gas activities throughout the country. In order to overcome this  situation, the state's macrocosmic management mechanism with  respect to the oil and gas sector must be changed. First of all,  oil and gas prices must be stipulated based on having "ceiling  prices by region" and stimulating the corporations in remote  areas, particularly the mountain areas. Through this, it will be  possible to bring about fairness in business and differentiate  commercial areas (near and far) based on stimulating things  using prices. In cases in which a subject must carry out both  commercial tasks and political and social tasks, the state must  implement concrete policies on prices, particularly for  transportation expenses for long trips.    3. Viewpoints must be renovated, and forms for participating  in domestic oil and gas activities must be expanded for the  economic elements. Should the "dealer" form, in which foreign  economic elements can open dealerships to sell oil and gas to  the oil and gas corporations of the state, be used? Based on the  experiences of Malaysia, of the 385 state oil and gas  enterprises, Petronas, the state oil and gas corporation, has  directly invested in only seven of 7 of the enterprises in order  to provide a model and gain experience in managing and guiding  things. The other 378 businesses are all dealerships. Using the  "dealership" form has the following effects:    Adaptations to changes in the oil and gas market can be made  quickly, trading periods are longer, and sellers are tied more  closely to the business because it is more profitable.    The staff can be reduced quite a bit. For example, the Zone  1  Oil and Gas Corporation presently has 70 stations with more than  500 employees selling oil and gas retail. Altogether, the  corporation employs 1,300 people. If the dealership form is  used, this staff can certainly be reduced by about 30 percent.    This will put a stop to the negative aspects and corruption  in the retail sale of oil and gas, because there will be  unanimity between dealers and commercial interests.    The above effects will improve the commercial results of  each  station and of the entire oil and gas sector in our country.    Naturally, there must be a mechanism to manage the dealers,  and the state oil and gas corporations must directly manage the  dealerships with respect to the technical aspects.</p>

The final monograph included in &sect;358.110(c) (21 CFR 358.110(c)) products containing 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum, glycol plaster vehicle. Such products were included in the monograph based on the agency's evaluation of data from three clinical studies (Ref. 1) (see comment 13, 55 FR 33246 at 33253). The directions for such products were included in &sect;358.150(d)(3) (21 CFR 358.150(d)(3)), as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly.'' (If appropriate: ``Cut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply medicated plaster at bedtime, leave in place for at least 8 hours; in the morning, remove plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed) for up to 12 weeks.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In discussing the labeling for these products (also in comment 13), the agency stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If there are any special directions that relate to using a particular product, then such information should appear as part of the manufacturer's additional directions for the product. The monograph provides the minimum directions necessary for use of the product. Manufacturers may supplement these directions with additional information necessary to use their specific product. For example, the agency notes that the manufacturer's directions for its specific product include statements to ``keep plastic film on the top of pad facing up and to apply sticky bottom side to the wart.'' The agency finds no need to include such directions in this final monograph; however, manufacturers may add such information, as appropriate, to the labeling of their products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequently, the agency became aware that a manufacturer of this product had the following additional statements in its product's labeling (Ref. 2): (1) ``Smooth wart surface with emery file supplied,'' and (2) ``Apply a drop of warm water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry.'' The agency has rereviewed the clinical studies (Ref. 1) for this product and determined that this additional labeling information is based on the manner in which the clinical studies were performed. The agency notes that use of an emery file and application of a drop of warm water to the wart site as part of the directions for this type of product were not included in the labeling suggestions made by the manufacturer when the final monograph was being prepared (see comment 13). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is concerned that similar products in the marketplace may have different directions_some recommending use of an emery file and a drop of warm water to prepare the wart site and others not mentioning use of an emery file and a drop of warm water. The agency believes this situation could lead to consumer confusion. (Although the agency is aware of only one such marketed product, this does not rule out small volume operations and private label products.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clinical studies (Ref. 1) did not show that using an emery file and a drop of warm water were necessary to prepare the wart site before application of the medicated plaster. However, these studies also did not show that these procedures were not necessary, that any adverse effects occurred, or that any interference with the product's safety and effectiveness occurred when an emery file and a drop of warm water were used. Because the procedure used in the studies included the use of an emery file and a drop of warm water, the agency has determined that these items should be part of the directions for this product. The agency is also making a minor format revision in one sentence of the directions. Accordingly, the agency is proposing to amend the directions in &sect;358.150(d)(3) for 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum, glycol plaster vehicle, to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> For products containing salicylic acid identified in &sect;358.110(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly. Gently smooth wart surface with emery file supplied.'' (If appropriate: ``Cut plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply a drop of warm water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry. Apply medicated plaster at bedtime and leave in place for at least 8 hours. In the morning, remove plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed) for up to 12 weeks.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Comment No. RPT2, Docket No. 80N&hyph;0238, Dockets Management Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Labeling for Trans-Ver-Sal, included in OTC Volume 16CFMA, Docket No. 80N&hyph;0238, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts. The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that no one of these rules, including this proposed rule amending the final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products, is a major rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for OTC wart remover drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small business. The final rule may require some very minor relabeling; however, such relabeling should be a one time nominal cost. The agency is currently aware of only one such product in the marketplace, and it already has this labeling. Other manufacturers who may market this product will have 1 year after publication of the final rule to implement this labeling. The cost to do so will be minimal. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC wart remover drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with relabeling or repackaging. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC wart remover drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or before March 29, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments and objections are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 358 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, it is proposed that 21 CFR part 358 be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 358_MISCELLANEOUS EXTERNAL DRUG PRODUCTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMAN USE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

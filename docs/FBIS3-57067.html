Their Arrest Has  Provided Cause To Revise the `Tragic January' in Vilnius"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The most independent of  Lithuania's independent newspapers, RESPUBLIKA, in one of its  recent issues cited K. Gashki, a member of the Seimas National  Security Committee, as saying that such an action [the  Belarusian authorities' arrest of Lithuanian Communists in  Minsk] may threaten Lithuania with an undesirable political  scandal for two reasons: First, Lithuanian armed officials have  crossed the Lithuanian- Belarusian border; and second, the  capacity in which Lithuanian General Prosecutor Arturas  Paulauskas visited Minsk to hold talks about the possibility of  arresting Mikolas Burokyavicius and Yuozas Yermolavicius.  According to Gashki and another member of the Seimas National  Security Committee, A. Ivashkyavicius (who, it will be noted,  has no sympathy for either communism or communists), the  operation to detain these persons, who have long been on the  wanted list of Lithuanian law enforcement bodies, could have  been carried out only by Belarus officials, whereupon they were  handed over to the Lithuanian side on the border of the two  states. Incidentally, the above mentioned members of the  Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee suggest that the  arrest of Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius became possible only  because they were "sold out." "We would never have gotten  Mikolas Burokyavicius or Yuozas Yermolavicius if it was not  beneficial to Moscow," K. Gashki told RESPUBLIKA's  correspondent. "They were transferred to Lithuania so that in  the course of a judicial process in Vilnius some tasks  confronting a `third party' could be resolved; in other words,  Moscow is imposing its own rules of the game on Lithuania."  According to the National Security Committee members, it would  be a mistake to think that Burokyavichus and Yermolavichus were  the organizers and perpetrators of the coup attempted in January  1991. The Lithuanian communist leaders could not have played a  role greater than stage director assistants because "they had no  way of calling in a paratroopers division from Pskov or  summoning V. Sakalauskas, former chairman of the Lithuanian  Council of Ministers, who at the time was a staff member at the  Soviet Embassy in Mozambique and was allegedly tasked with  composing a new Lithuanian government. Also, it certainly took  more than the desire or will of the Lithuanian communists to get  Soviet armored cars into the streets of Vilnius. [passage  omitted]    Time will tell whether the ongoing trial of the communist  leaders in Vilnius will be used to strip some veils of secrecy  from the January and subsequent events. On one hand, it would  be very attractive for Lithuania to reveal the role of a third  state. But on the other, there is the danger of also exposing  some internal mechanisms and levers about which the Lithuanian  social democratic weekly LETUVOS ZHINES wrote recently.  According to the paper, the leaders of Sajudis, which was in  power in 1990-1991, came to the conclusion that Moscow could be  forced to abandon its plans of preserving Lithuania as part of  the USSR precisely by aggravating the situation because it  feared bloodshed. Sajudis members, the paper writes,  deliberately insulted and provoked the army, and calls for armed  resistance were coming from all quarters. In chess, a victory  appears the more brilliant the more pawns and other pieces have  been sacrificed. On the evening of 12 January 1991 the radio  and TV were urging the people to congregate around the TV tower  in Vilnius, assuring them that Soviet soldiers would be using  only blanks. As a result, 13 people were killed and hundreds  wounded or injured. According to LETUVOS ZHINES, it was the  persistent sadistic propaganda about armed defense that gave the  attackers cause for using firearms against peaceful, unarmed  civilians. Gunmen from the Alfa group, the paper writes,  accepted the offered chess sacrifice: It was the final response  from the USSR leadership -- a personal punishment for Vytautas  Landsbergis.

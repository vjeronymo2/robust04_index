			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erica Ramirez; from the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government has announced the publication, in the  next few days, of laws reached by consensus in the National  Assembly to reinforce the value of compensation bonds. As for  statements by Congressman Robert Torricelli, Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo said that U.S. aid is in no way in jeopardy.    Minister Lacayo said that, as soon as the laws to reinforce  bond values and on the privatization of Telcor [Nicaraguan  Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute] are published,  it will become evident once again that the domestic compensation  system is moving in the right direction. He added that  Torricelli's statements are in keeping with his duty as a U.S.  congressman:    [Begin recording] [Lacayo] That is his work, to ensure that  in Nicaragua we remain on this path to maintain excellent  relations with the United States. But that does not imply that  the aid is in jeopardy. I want to clarify that the aid is not  in jeopardy. We are very confident with what we have done since  1990 in this regard.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] also has congressmen friends  in  the United States. Do you believe that the government will not  need to implement a diplomat strategy or visit Washington to  ensure that the aid is not jeopardized or that the amendment is  not enforced?    [Lacayo] We must show that our domestic process works. To  ensure this we need to reinforce our bond system. We already  have many alternatives in this regard, and we are presently  working on this. We are trying to reach consensus agreements  with the National Assembly. We must show that cases continue to  be settled. Three or four cases that are important to them were  settled recently. Two, three, four, five, or as many cases as  possible will be settled next week involving not only U.S.  citizens, but also Spaniards, Germans, and so on. [end  recording]    As for the plans of certain workers to block the  privatization of Telcor, he pointed out that this privatization  is a strategic need for the country in order to obtain resources  and compensate those who were unjustly confiscated:    [Begin Lacayo recording] Those opposing the privatization of  Telcor will oppose the distribution of title deeds and oppose  the legalization process. In other words, they would oppose the  entire Sandinist leadership's wishes that they have voiced to  us. They would also contradict the wishes of the entire  leadership of the former UNO [National Opposition Unity]  political parties and the wishes of a great majority of our  country. In other words, they have no representation, because a  majority of the people want title deeds issued to the new  beneficiaries, and they want compensation paid to those who had  property unjustly confiscated. Two birds will be killed with  one stone: the privatization of Telcor. [end recording]    Minister Lacayo added that Nicaragua is the country that has  settled the most cases. So far, he added, 117 properties owned  by U.S. citizens have been settled, that is, 42 percent of the  total. USAID recently offered support to continue the  compensation process, and this shows that the government of  President Chamorro is indeed solving a problem it inherited.</p>

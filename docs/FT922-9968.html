			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Royal paid under Pounds 15m for options - Move to dampen rumours on cost of election investment strategy ROYAL INSURANCE has moved to dampen speculation that a deal designed to protect the value of its UK equities portfolio against the general election result has lost it tens of millions of pounds. The beleaguered insurer, which virtually doubled its pre-tax losses last year to Pounds 373m and passed its final dividend, bought put options last autumn to protect itself against a drop in the FTSE 100 index following a hung parliament or a Labour election win. It said yesterday that it had paid less than Pounds 15m for the options, that the expense was part of last year's accounts and that the options, lasting a year, remained tradeable. There had been speculation that the cost of the puts was between Pounds 15m and Pounds 40m. A large part of its Pounds 400m portfolio of UK equities is covered. The options' seller would buy shares from Royal if the FTSE fell below the a trigger level, which Royal has also refused to disclose. It said yesterday that the cash it would have received had the election result been different was 'not a big deal'. Since the election, the FTSE has risen by about 10 per cent - it closed at 2659.8 on Friday. But it is not clear what increase there has been in the value of Royal's portfolio to compensate for the cost of the options. Royal would only say they were taken out in the autumn. Between September and November the FTSE fell from 2679.6 to 2420.2, with the sharpest drop coming in mid-November. The options were revealed with the final results in February. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said that in the run-up to a general election, 'we simply could not afford the risk of the market going into free fall.' The company added yesterday: 'All we have done is to take out reinsurance against a possible loss.' The protection of the balance sheet against a significant decline in equity values was regarded as prudent after the battering inflicted by two years of heavy losses. The important solvency margin - measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - was improved from 29 per cent to 34 per cent by the sale of its Dutch operations for Pounds 166m in February, but was still giving some cause for concern. The announcement that the final dividend would be passed, saving Pounds 96m, came a few days after this disposal.</p>

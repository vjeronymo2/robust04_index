			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Pollution Is Worse in Some </F> Areas of Country"]    [Text] Environmental pollution has worsened in some parts  of the country.    The situation has occurred because of relaxed enforcement of  State laws and regulations on environmental protection.    The findings are from a recent national inspection on  environmental law enforcement by the State Environmental  Protection Agency (SEPA).    The investigation determined that many local policy makers  sacrifice their environment for the sake of economic profit.    Local governments must further tighten supervision over  implementation of environmental laws and regulations and crack  down on illegal conduct that endangers the environment,  according to SEPA official Hu Baolin.    Hu said his bureau will continue its publicity campaigns to  raise environmental awareness across the nation, especially that  of leaders at various levels.    The agency will map out some new regulations and revise old  ones in accord with changed economic and social situations.    It hopes the central and local governments will increase  their budgets for environmental work.    SEPA, jointly with the environmental protection committees  under the State Council and the National People's Congress  (NPC), just concluded a four-month environmental inspection in  seven provinces and regions.    They include Heilongjiang, Shandong, Yunnan, Guangdong,  Anhui  and Jiangsu provinces and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    It is the first phase of a nation-wide environmental law  enforcement inspection. The whole programme will take two years.    This year's inspection focused on the enforcement of State  laws on environmental protection and wild life preservation.    The inspection discovered that a contract responsibility  system has been introduced in many provinces to protect the  environment. And environmental protection work has been included  in provincial social and economic development programmes.    The seven regions have altogether promulgated some 50 local  regulations on environmental issues.    Yet, some local leaders have neglected environmental  problems  while pursuing profits.    Lunan County in Yunnan Province, for example, constructed a  cement plant in the State "Stone Forest" scenic area.    And a vice-governor of Dali Prefecture decided, without  authorization, to stop collecting pollution charges from local  industrial enterprises for three years.    Jixi Iron and Steel Company in Heilongjiang Province, which  is the biggest pollutant in the city, did not complete its  pollution treatment projects on time and refused to hand over a  fine of 10,000 yuan (about $1,724).    In Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang Province, about 80  percent of the 56 enterprises inspected discharge untreated  pollutants into the environment.    Meanwhile, some harmful wastes have been imported into the  country.    Some small township enterprises, closed in the past by the  State for contaminating the environment, have reemerged in some  places.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Greenpeace warns of disease threat Global warming brings with it the risk of an increase in parasitic diseases such as malaria in the UK, says Greenpeace. Quoting a government report, which it claims was suppressed for two years, the environmental group lists Leishmaniasis, Rickettsiosis, and bubonic plague as the diseases which could arrive with warmer weather. These would find a population without natural immunity to resist them. Greenpeace says the government should combat these risks with a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said to cause global warming, by 20 per cent by the year 2005.</p>

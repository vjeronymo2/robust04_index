According to a recent conference held here recently on  suburban livestock farming, the total output of non-staple food  remained high in 1993, and a range of non-staple food centers  with high production in the city's suburban areas has taken  initial shape.    These suburban counties provided more than 3.76 million pigs  last year, a three-percent rise over a year ago.    The weight of eggs supplied to the capital's markets jumped  by 6.2 percent over the figure in the previous year.    Over 2.2 million pigs and 171 million kilograms of eggs were  produced by large and standard farms.    To bolster market sales, 62 integrated economic complexes  and  670 pig-breeding farms which combine the breeding, production  and processing in one place, have been built in the suburban  areas.    Hundreds of meat and egg sales centers have been set up  across the district areas of the city to step up the delivery of  the non- staple food, so that citizens are able to enjoy the  food fresh the same day or even within several hours.    The city has also set up quarantine stations at the  municipal  and county levels and trained about 1,000 quarantine specialists  to ensure the residents have healthy, clean food.    Some 40 quarantine stations have been built alongside the  highways and roads that lead to the city center and 118 markets  all have appointed hygiene staff.</p>

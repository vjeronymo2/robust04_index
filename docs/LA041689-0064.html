			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARK, KELL WILL TANGLE ONCE AGAIN  </P> <P> Veteran Councilman Tom Clark plans to challenge Mayor Ernie Kell for the city's  top elected post next year.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to be a tough campaign, but I have a lot of support," Clark  said last week in announcing his candidacy for the April 8, 1990, election.  </P> <P> Citing crime and police-related matters as the city's top priorities, Clark  said he supports the controversial concept of creating an independent body to  investigate allegations of police misconduct.  </P> <P> Clark, 62, had considered running against Kell in last year's race, but bowed  out to support Councilwoman Jan Hall after initial surveys showed she had a  better chance of beating the popular Kell. Hall, however, was soundly defeated  last June as Kell walked away with 60% of the votes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Expensive Race  </P> <P> Last year's election, the first in which voters selected a full-time mayor,  became the city's most expensive, and next year's race promises to come close,  if not surpass the $1 million spent on campaigning. Kell, who spent about  $600,000 to beat Hall, said he may spend about the same. Clark said his budget  will be closer to $300,000.  </P> <P> Kell expressed optimism about his chances for reelection, adding that Clark,  his longtime political foe, "will have a difficult time finding people who are  displeased with the direction the city is taking."  </P> <P> Upon being told of Clark's announcement, Kell launched into a recitation of his  achievements -- providing a glimpse of the campaign speeches to come. Among  other things, Kell cited creation of the city's Office of Education and Office  of Neighborhood and Historical Preservation. Kell conceived both as campaign  issues last year.  </P> <P> But Clark said there are many who are displeased with what they perceive as  Kell's lack of leadership. According to a recent poll conducted on Clark's  behalf, 33% of 300 registered voters would support Kell's reelection. The poll,  conducted by Moore Information of Portland, Ore., asked whether Kell performed  well enough to deserve reelection, or whether it is time to give another person  a chance to do better.  </P> <P> Clark declined to disclose the percentage of respondents who said they would  vote for him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Council 23 Years  </P> <P> Clark, an optometrist who has served on the council for 23 years, said that he  has taken a "more pro-active" stance than Kell on a number of issues through  the years. He noted, for example, that he was the first to propose developer  fees to create more parks, and to ask for an increase in the hotel room tax to  support the arts.  </P> <P> Clark said he has long considered running for mayor, and his decision  apparently did not surprise Kell, among others. "He's been running ever since I  beat Jan," Kell said.  </P> <P> Clark was one of the early supporters of creating the full-time, elected  position to replace the ceremonial mayoral position that, until last year, was  filled by a council member chosen by his or her colleagues. As the elected  mayor, Kell is paid $67,500 annually.  </P> <P> Both served previously in the ceremonial position; Clark was mayor three times  and Kell was mayor twice. In 1984, the contest between the two men became  heated when the council split 4-4 until a ninth councilman broke the tie in  Kell's favor.  </P> <P> The mayor's first term was limited to two years to allow future mayoral  elections to coincide with those of other elected citywide offices. The mayor  will serve a four-year term in the future.  </P></p>

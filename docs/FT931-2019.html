			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (22): Users want more freedom - Open systems: OSI in the doldrums PRESSURE is mounting for governments to open up their definition of open systems. The policy of requiring systems based on 'official' standards has had mixed results and users in the public sector have begun to demand freedom to adopt the technology they want. Since the 1980s, users in the public sector have been required to adopt network products based on the official OSI standards. But some of those standards have had little impact in the market, and other technology has been more practical. 'Back in 1989 or so, we believed everything that was said - that there would be no alternative, and OSI would be a panacea to all our ills,' says Len Graves, county information technology (IT) officer at Essex County Council. 'Now, we are frustrated. The deliverable has never really materialised.' In the 1980s, the European Commission was forging ahead towards its 1992 target for a common market and, beyond that, to greater unity. Goods and people had to move freely around Europe, and to provide public services on a European basis, government departments and other public bodies had to work together. To achieve this, the governments' IT systems had to have a common language. At the time, IBM and the other suppliers were using their own communications protocols, which limited the choice users had, and cut them off from other users' systems. The international standards bodies were working on standards for open systems interconnection (OSI), which promised to solve this. Whatever systems you had, once the suppliers installed OSI communications, they would communicate with each other. In 1987, the European Commission passed a Decision, stating that all public procurements above a certain value must refer to international standards. The Decision required the OSI standards for communications. The move was meant to kick-start an OSI market. If the whole public sector asked for the same thing, suppliers would change their proprietary ways. Public bodies would be able to communicate with each other, and have free choice of the systems they bought. The private sector would follow. Free communications would make European businesses stronger and more competitive. That was the theory; in practice, the standards were almost unworkable. They included a vast number of options, and there was no guarantee that products would communicate. To deal with this, the European standards community took on more work. Tighter standards, called profiles, were defined, along with conformance tests which would establish whether a product met a particular profile. The UK government's IT adviser, CCTA, weighed in with the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP), a procurement guide which helps users buy products which work with other GOSIP products. A European handbook on open systems (EPHOS) based on GOSIP, is under development. Up to a point, this has worked. OSI protocols have been in development for 13 years, and there are now products available which do work together. But they are finding, like Rip van Winkle waking from his long sleep, that things have changed. OSI was designed to tackle problems which are no longer so serious. Vendors, suffering from recession and technical change, cannot impose their will on users so easily, and are co-operating more readily. In the 1980s 'industry standards' were imposed by single suppliers, and OSI opposed them; in the 1990s, industry standards are developed by consortia with much the same goals as the standards bodies. Ironically, users acknowledged this situation more quickly than the authorities. When users in the public sector were required to adopt open systems and standards, they responded by buying systems based on the emerging operating system, UNIX, which communicates with the TCP/IP protocols. It is claimed that TCP/IP and related network protocols have inferior features to the equivalent OSI standards. What they do have is a proven track record, and easy availability. Whatever the technical merits, many public sector users would rather have an 80 per cent solution now, than a 99 per cent solution in five years. But they are saying it privately, because the EC decision requires them to have an OSI strategy. The irony is that, although these protocols are excluded from the policy, because they are not international standards, they actually provide most of what the EC wanted from OSI in the first place. They offer easy connections and are free from the control of any one supplier. Public bodies are meeting the EC's objectives, but they are doing it by misunderstanding the guidelines, or using loopholes to get what they want. Fortunately, the decision allows plenty of exceptions. The EC never wanted to force users to waste money, so other protocols are allowed if standards-based products are uneconomic over the life of the system, if the standards are ill-defined or untestable, or if the technology is new and unproven. They are also allowed, for compatibility with existing systems. Purchases below 100,000 ECUs are exempt. Larger bodies are still positive about using the OSI protocols on 'backbone' networks: 'Most people are persevering,' says Seth Mason, of the National Health Service's Information Management Centre. 'With the advent of EPHOS and maturing of GOSIP into two boxed sets, it has become easier to reference OSI specifications.' The biggest networks are run by the telecom operators. Like large public bodies, they look to OSI to solve the big problems, such as global directories and network management, areas where there is little alternative work. But in bodies the size of local authorities, there is frustration. 'If it is in reality a waste of time, then it is also a waste of money,' says Roger Toms, general manager for information systems services at Surrey County Council. 'If OSI is truly becoming an irrelevance, then they have to be honest enough to say so, and not force the public sector through an artificial process, which increases our procurement costs and causes delay.' Mr Toms fears the OSI requirement could put the local authority's own departments at a disadvantage in a compulsory competitive tender against outsiders from the private sector, who are not subject to the same procurement restrictions. Often the TCP/IP solution is so much cheaper that it falls beneath the 100,000 ECU threshold, but public sector bodies still have to go through the lengthy process of claiming exemption. Consultant Ray O'Connor, who has advised the EC on this issue, says: 'Governmental policy needs to be more flexible, recognising that OSI has an important role to play, but that it has little chance of becoming the universal solution which was expected.' CCTA is opening up its policy a little. Its published guide keeps an optimistic tone, with a suggested target date of 1994 for a complete transition to OSI. When advising individual organisations, however, CCTA it is reported to be more relaxed, and it supports the use of agreed specifications from industry, such as the Portability Guide from the X/Open group. But there is not much hope of a new policy. The EC wants to keep up its pressure for open systems, of whatever kind, but the Treaty of Rome's principle of subsidiarity would only allow legislation binding in all the member-states, in an emergency. There is now no emergency. It seems all too likely that the present system of lip service to a 1980s solution will continue. Meanwhile, users will adopt the solutions that industry provides in the 1990s, which will be a mixture of the available protocols.

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV URGED TO DRASTICALLY ALTER ECONOMY  </P> <P> One of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's principal economic advisers proposed  radical changes Monday, including a 30% cut in the Soviet defense budget, in an  effort to restore popular faith in Gorbachev's reform program.  </P> <P> Abel G. Aganbegyan, secretary of the economic section of the Soviet Academy of  Sciences, called on the government to spend a quarter of its foreign earnings  to import Western consumer products and to cancel dozens of major industrial  projects and use the money for new housing.  </P> <P> Aganbegyan, writing in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, called for an  intensive three- to four-year effort to satisfy widespread expectations, so far  unfulfilled, that perestroika -- as Gorbachev's political and economic reforms  are known -- would bring a better life.  </P> <P> "Most Soviet families are not feeling changes for the better," he said,  acknowledging that the resulting disappointment is building into a serious  political problem for the Soviet leadership. "On paper, we have been taking one  step forward, but in practice we have been going back two steps."  </P> <P> Going boldly beyond most other reform economists, Aganbegyan urged a massive  effort to satisfy consumer demand, which greatly outstrips supplies for  everyday necessities and for luxury goods, in order to build confidence in the  reforms and to spur faster economic growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Video Recorders, Computers  </P> <P> Aganbegyan sees in the pent-up demand for consumer goods -- particularly luxury  items such as videotape recorders, personal computers, high-quality furniture  and passenger cars -- a way of accelerating economic growth -- 4.4% last year  compared to the planned 6.6% -- and building the political as well as economic  momentum needed for reform.  </P> <P> The whole Soviet economy is changing too slowly, Aganbegyan said. The technical  level of production and the quality of Soviet products have improved only a  little despite the reforms of the past four years, he said.  </P> <P> "It is necessary to go two or three times faster," he said of the effort to  restructure the Soviet economy. For example, passenger car production, now  about 1.8 million vehicles a year, should be increased by 2 million to 3  million annually, he said.  </P> <P> The urgency with which Aganbegyan views the need to bolster popular confidence  in the reforms, as well as his desire to foster an economic takeoff, takes him  well beyond the proposals offered by other reform economists and the positions  taken by Gorbachev himself in the debate on the country's economic strategy.  </P> <P> Where Gorbachev has announced a 14% reduction in military spending, Aganbegyan  calls for a 30% cut so that the savings can be used in the civilian sector.  </P> <P> Where other reform economists are suggesting that some foreign loans might be  used to purchase as much as $7 billion in Western consumer goods over two or  three years, Aganbegyan proposes doubling such purchases so that they  constitute at least 25% of all Soviet imports. He calls for cutting back on the  purchase of machinery to make this possible.  </P> <P> And where others have questioned the immediate need for some of the major  development projects, Aganbegyan demands the immediate cancellation of two  giant hydroelectric plants and several massive new irrigation canals, along  with any other project that cannot quickly pay for itself. He also urges the  closure of money-losing state enterprises.  </P> <P> "The principal problem is to meet people's demands," Aganbegyan wrote in  Pravda, "but the measures should not be administrative -- quite a new approach  is needed to expand independence (of enterprises) and abolish directive-type  planning."  </P> <P> But Aganbegyan, once the leading proponent of major price reform as the key to  fundamental economic reform, urged the government to postpone for three or four  years any effort to restructure the Soviet price system. He had earlier  insisted that these changes, essential if market forces are to play the larger  role advocated by most reform economists, be completed by 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Implications  </P> <P> If Aganbegyan's proposal is accepted by Gorbachev, it would stretch out the  overall economic reform effort and have major political and social  implications.  </P> <P> "The main thing now is to take measures to make the ailing economic mechanism  healthy," he said, arguing that the country is not prepared for the fundamental  shifts he believes are needed.  </P> <P> Market-driven growth could be "a powerful engine for the renewal and  improvement of the whole economy," he continued, but it would require a number  of support measures, including the large-scale shift of resources now  controlled by government ministries and state enterprises.  </P> <P> Another major economic goal of his proposal is to reduce inflation, widely  estimated at 6% to 7% but potentially much more than that, by meeting the  demand for high-cost items. At the same time, he hopes to cut the government's  budget deficit through the profits brought in by the sale of the new products.  </P> <P> In his proposal, one of several put forward by leading Soviet economists in  recent weeks, Aganbegyan dodges responsibility for the failure of Gorbachev's  initial reforms -- of which he was the principal architect -- to fulfill the  implicit promise of a better life.  </P> <P> The country's economic stagnation is even deeper than he and other specialists  had realized, Aganbegyan said, and resistance to the reforms is greater than  anticipated.  </P> <P> As they have been implemented, he said, the reforms are largely half-measures  and not radical enough to transform the economy.  </P></p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (15): It helps to learn the native tongue - Language / While not essential, some knowledge of Catalan - spoken in and around Barcelona - is an advantage ONE OF the most popular television programmes on the Catalan language channel of TV3, following the common format of an open debate, is called 'Right to Speak'. One moment which attracted a kind of awed gratitude recently occurred when a Japanese couple among the audience joined in and spoke in Catalan. This is the other side of what those who speak Castilian - the main language of Spain - can sometimes find a frustration when they visit Barcelona. A Castilian-speaking Frenchman who came to the city to research a cultural topic recently was amazed to find that some of the books published by the Generalitat (the autonomous government) appeared in both Catalan and English, neither of which he understood. Catalans can occasionally be obstinate about sticking to their native tongue if they feel that it is not being accorded due respect. Alternatively, they can often be more receptive to someone speaking Catalan. So though, for most practical purposes, for foreigners there is no necessity to understand or speak Catalan, rather than Castilian, there are advantages. The language itself has a more abrupt, less inflected sound than Castilian. Both are derived from Latin, but it seems that Catalan comes from a later form of it, as did Provencal, the language spoken on the other side of the Pyrenees and to which it is in some ways similar. In Barcelona, there is a form of bilingualism which is probably unique. When two people say goodbye, often one will say 'Adios' and the other will say 'Deu' or 'Adeu'. Everyone can understand both: Castilian, because it was the only official language until Franco died in 1975; and Catalan, either because it is their mother tongue, or because the regional government's law to normalise the use of the language has been so successful. The Generalitat's department of linguistics affirms that 94 per cent of the population in Catalonia understands Catalan, though a large minority are immigrants from other parts of Spain or the children of immigrants. It even occasionally happens that a conversation between two friends is held in both languages, with each speaking the language in which he is most comfortable. This pervasive bilingualism can occasionally be confusing for a visitor  - for example, over street names. These are all signposted in Catalan, but are often referred to in Castilian. There is not much difference between Passeig de Gracia and Paseo de Gracia, but there is between Carrer Roger de Lluria and Calle Lauria, or Carrer de l'Argenteria and Calle Plateria. A director of the American Institute in Barcelona in the 1970s, shortly after the restoration of democracy, is reputed not only to have learnt Catalan but to have sung in the cors de Clav, traditional Catalan choirs. This is about as far as it is possible to go, but it is at least wise to know that Castilian is not the only official language.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> LYNN DYMALLY NAMED TO FILL SCHOOL BOARD VACANCY  </P> <P> Lynn Dymally, daughter of Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), was appointed to the  Compton Unified School District Board of Education on Tuesday night to replace  Bernice Woods, who resigned this month after being elected to the City Council.  </P> <P> The appointment, which came without any advance public notice by the board, was  made on a 4-2 vote, with Trustees Kelvin D. Filer and John Steward voting  against it. According to Filer, he and Steward voted no because they wanted the  voters, not the board, to decide on Woods' replacement.  </P> <P> Under state law governing school board resignations, Dymally can serve only  until November. At that time she must step aside or face the voters in order to  continue to serve the two years remaining in Woods' four-year term.  </P> <P> Several people have expressed interest in running for Woods' seat, as well as  for four other seats that will be open this year on the seven-member school  board. Filing for the November election opens July 17 and closes Aug. 11.  </P> <P> This is the second time Dymally has served on the board. She was elected to a  four-year term that ended in 1987, when she chose not to run for reelection.  </P></p>

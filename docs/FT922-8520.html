			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Letter: No remit for back-door advertising Sir, l would like to clarify one area raised by Raymond Snoddy in his comprehensive feature (Management: Marketing and Advertising, 'Turning to television for the power and the glory', May 7) about the broadcasting of company annual general meetings on BBC Select. While the BBC believes that improving shareholder access to company information is perfectly in keeping with its public service remit, it is also important to ensure that the service does not allow advertising by the back door. So any mention of products on the new service must be clearly within the context of the meeting, and must not be promotional in tone. The use of BBC airtime to cover events such as product launches will not be permitted. Chris Grayling, commissioning editor, BBC Select, 80 Wood Lane, London W12</p>

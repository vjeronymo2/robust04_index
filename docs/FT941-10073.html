			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sentence discounts for guilty pleas The judicial practice of giving discounts on sentence in return for an early guilty plea is to be put on a statutory basis, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced yesterday. A new clause in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill will require courts in England and Wales to take into account early guilty pleas by defendants, and to announce any discount they give on sentences in court.</p>

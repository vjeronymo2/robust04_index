			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The Kirov shows off its Bayadere - This production demands to be seen THE HISTORY of La Bayadere in the West is odd. It is one of Petipa's most fascinating works, typical of his mature creativity - it dates from 1877 - in its combination of exotic theme and spectacular effects, and testimony to the vivid dramatic excuses he sought for his dance sequences. It has survived in Petersburg despite revolution and ideological nit-picking. In the West, while some of the old Mariinsky ballets percolated into the repertory, no company could find the forces to mount such an undertaking. It was during the first Kirov season in London in 1961, when the Shades scene was part of a gala evening, that the importance of this choreographic marvel was made clear. Nureyev's subsequent Shades staging for the Royal Ballet was proof that the West might honourably emulate Russia. A BBCTV transmission of the Kirov production in 1973 was significant; a decade later Makarova revived the full-length ballet for American Ballet Theatre (and very astutely reconstructed the last act that Leningrad had dropped 'for lack of proper forces' after the Revolution.) This staging she was later to mount for the Royal Ballet, and in Milan, Stockholm and Rio. Rudolf Nureyev's last gift to the Paris Opera was a Bayadere which reproduced the Kirov version. La Bayadere had become part of Western ballet's traditions. But the Kirov could not tour it. One of the joys of seeing ballet in Petersburg was the magnificence of the Bayadere scenery - dating from the turn of the century, and too fragile to travel - as frame for Kirov classic manner and mimetic dignity. Now the company has had the old scenery copied - impeccably - and can show the West this ancestral treasure. It looked fine on a first London outing on Thursday night. The Coliseum stage is somewhat small for its grandiose scale, and the lighting was less than subtle, but the painted sets are magnificent, and, making greatest sense of Petipa's artifices, there are the Kirov artists. The version is slightly edited - where was the Danse Manu, and some variations in the Grand Pas? - but it is the authentic Bayadere, and demands to be seen. La Bayadere is a ballet most serious in its dramatic underpinning - sacred love in conflict with profane passion - and vastly challenging for soloists and principals. The confrontation between Nikiya and Gamzatti which ends the first act is as emotionally challenging as anything in the old repertory. The division of dance interest - the passionate Gamzatti given the bravura Grand Pas; the 'holy' Nikiya rewarded with the Shades scene - reveals Petipa's astute sense of theatre. Solor is a numbskull, but a tormented one, and the part rewards bold playing - as Mukhamedov, Bocca and Manuel Legris have variously shown us. The technical demands of the Grand Pas and the Shades sequence are among the greatest in 19th century ballet, and Petipa's dramatic skill can be seen in the hallucinatory entry of the Shades as in the spacious exposition of narrative. Minkus' score - given in the wise version preserved at the Mariinsky - is no mean support for the drama, as the eloquent orchestral playing proved. But Bayadere demands potent central interpretations. Olga Chenchikova was the Gamzatti of the this first performance, and opulently right. Her dancing is magnificent in scale and assurance, commanding space in step and outline, womanly rather than girlish - and how welcome for this fact. She provides a physical force, a psychic intensity, that make the character fascinating in temperament as in dance. Konstantin Zaklinsky was a Solor credible at every moment, competent in his few dance passages, but notable for the stylistic intelligence with which he illuminated conventional dramatics. We believed in him. I could not, though, believe in Yulia Makhalina as Nikiya. She is a beautiful young woman, her silhouette long, sophisticated, her technique forcefully brilliant. Alas, she plays Nikiya on the terms of her own self-absorbtion. The role does not exist save as a display-piece for extravagant prowess. The temple-dancer looks like a visiting star; the Shade is concerned only with technical dazzle. Those spiritual qualities with which Makarova and Asylmuratova have imbued the role - the dance as declaration of holiest feeling, and gaining in luminosity thereby - are foreign to Makhalina's reading. It is lit by technical fireworks rather than the sacred fire of the first scene. The three Shades soloists displayed Kirov classicism at its most satisfying. I have already praised Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova this season. Their companion, Irina Shapchits, is no less admirable. In the third variation she produced ravishing dancing: exquisite in control, pure in form as in manner. I have never seen the solo better done. The Kirov season continues at the Coliseum until July 31</p>

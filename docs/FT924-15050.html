			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost-cutting behind 30% rise to Pounds 6.6m at Barry Wehmiller BARRY WEHMILLER Internat-ional, the specialist packaging equipment group, reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 on the back of a cost-cutting programme. Profits worked through at Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 5.03m) on slightly reduced sales of Pounds 73.7m (Pounds 75.4m). Net cash stood at Pounds 4.9m, achieved after last year's Pounds 12.9m rights issue combined with an 18 per cent reduction in inventory levels and strict control of costs and working capital. Interest received of Pounds 133,000 compared with Pounds 1.1m payable. As part of the cost-cutting exercise the number of employees was cut by 199 to 1,222. The vision division, which scans bottles and packages, turned a Pounds 1.63m operating loss into a profit of Pounds 670,000 by sorting out technical problems associated with the launch of a new product. The new management at the division made significant reductions in the level of stock. A reduction in demand from UK customers affected both food equipment, where operating profits fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 3.5m, and general packaging, with operating profits down from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.3m. Almost 70 per cent of the group's turnover is generated overseas. While sales in the UK fell to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 28.4m) they increased to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 16.1m) in the US. The group reported a recovery in demand from the US market which helped the food equipment division partly offset the adverse economic conditions in the UK. Earnings per share rose to 10.7p (9.8p). The final dividend is again 4.3p making a maintained total of 6.7p on the increased capital. Mr Nigel McLean, chairman, is to retire at the annual meeting in December in favour of Mr Michael Windsor, deputy chairman. A new non-executive director will be appointed.</p>

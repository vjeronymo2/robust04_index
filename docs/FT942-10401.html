			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / North Yemen leaders sack prime minister North Yemen's political leaders yesterday stepped up their propaganda offensive in the civil war by denouncing the prime minister, Mr Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas, and stripping him of all government powers. Mr Attas is the fifth southerner dismissed in a week as northern political leaders attempt to consolidate and legitimise their authority throughout the country. The military situation remained unclear, with each side broadcasting its own version of events. Heavy fighting is reported around Aden, where northern troops were said to have advanced to within three miles of the city on Monday. But reports from Aden said the situation there was normal. Northern troops appear to have secured the region around Lodah, about 100 miles to the north-east of Aden, and to have sent reinforcements on the road to Ataq, 350 miles north-east of Aden, in anticipation of further fighting there. Southern troops, reported to have taken heavy losses in last week's fighting, are now regrouping to rebuff the expected northern advance. So far, the main oilfields have been spared direct involvement in the fighting. But observers say that could easily change as the battle unfolds in and around Aden, the southern stronghold. The north's main oilfields, which produce about 180,000 barrels a day, are located at Mareb, 150 miles east of Sanaa. The south's main fields are in the Hadramout Valley at Wadi Masila and produce 150,000 b/d. But oil men say that between those fields 300 northern and southern tanks are now arrayed against each other. If a battle should take place there, they admit, it could mean one side or the other taking all the country's oil. The dismissal of Mr Attas followed his appeal last week for outside forces to help end the civil war, now in its second week. The Yemeni parliament, meeting without its southern members, insisted that Mr Attas's actions were illegal and notified embassies in Sanaa, the northern capital, that he no longer represented the government. The Sanaa government, which now describes itself as having the only constitutional legitimacy in the country, has also sacked Mr Saleh Abu Bakr bin-Husaynoon, oil minister.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Black &amp; Decker earnings halved BLACK &amp; DECKER, the home appliances and power tools maker, saw its first-quarter earnings halved, but it hoped that an economic revival and low retailer inventories would boost profits later this year, writes Bernard Simon. Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 4.1m, or 7 cents a share, from Dollars 10m, or 17 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn, thanks to the inclusion of information systems business acquired as part of the 1989 purchase of Emhart Corp. Product sales dipped by 7 per cent. Financing costs fell by 9 per cent to Dollars 78.5m, reflecting lower interest rates. The company said business conditions remained difficult in the US, the UK, Canada, Brazil and Australia. Temporary plant closures are squeezing margins, but are expected to bolster cash flow.</p>

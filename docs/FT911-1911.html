			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / QC says Lloyd's fudged discipline THE AUTHORITIES at Lloyd's of London insurance market were guilty of 'part retreat and part fudge' in enforcing their own disciplinary procedures, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, representing 24 members of syndicates formerly managed by the Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agency, now in liquidation, alleged that Lloyd's had failed to protect Names from the consequences of mismanagement at Oakeley Vaughan. Late in 1981 the Committee of Lloyd's found Mr Charles St George unfit to continue to manage the Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agency. The committee instructed Mr St George to reduce his voting shares in the agency to not more than 10 per cent, and to relinquish management control. In what Mr Lyndon-Stanford described as 'complete disdain' of the committee's instructions, Mr St George wrote to Mr Peter Green, the then chairman of Lloyd's, at the end of 1981 declaring he was making himself managing director of the agency. He took no steps to reduce his voting shares. Mr Lyndon-Stanford said the Committee of Lloyd's had subsequently failed to enforce its instructions to Mr St George. This was 'most regrettable' - even taking into account that Mr St George and other members of his family 'were not easy people to deal with'. The court was given details of a lengthy series of meetings among committee members of Lloyd's during 1982, in which the problems of Oakeley Vaughan were discussed. The need for a chief executive, other than Mr St George, to run the agency was repeatedly stressed. Oakeley Vaughan was given a deadline of September 30 1982 for the new appointment. The deadline passed with no chief executive being appointed, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said. The case continues today.</p>

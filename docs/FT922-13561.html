			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Amec hit by Pounds 60m property charges AMEC yesterday became the second UK construction and engineering group in two days to announce pre-tax losses caused by the slump in housing land and property values. Its Pounds 9.9m pre-tax loss, after Pounds 60m of write-downs, followed Costain Group's Pounds 69.2m loss, mostly caused by housing and commercial property. Last year's deficit compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 63.4m. Two thirds of Amec's Pounds 60m exceptional costs came as a response to falling house prices. Last year the Fairclough Homes subsidiary sold 1,300 houses at an average price of Pounds 90,000, down from more than Pounds 100,000. Mr John Early, finance director, said the new land value calculation started from a selling price of Pounds 85,000 per house, of which just over 20 per cent was allowed for the land. This had led to the 'swingeing' write-down, compared with about Pounds 20m over the previous two years. The 1991 Pounds 20m exceptional charge for commercial property had been done on a site-by-site basis. Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the aim was to reduce the capital in housing and property. Some money would be diverted into the building and civil engineering and the mechanical and electrical divisions, which made profits of Pounds 57.8m, down from Pounds 68.9m. Amec maintained its final dividend at 6.25p to give a total of 10.25p, up slightly from 10.125p last year. The diluted loss per share was 3.2p compared with 1990 earnings of 17.5p. Mr Early said: 'The dividend is uncovered but backed by cash and we are confident we can cover it in future.' After a Pounds 110.6m rights issue last March, at 200p a share, Pounds 76.7m net cash remained at the end of the year. Mr Early said about Pounds 30m had been spent on acquisitions. While there had been no cash outflow in 1991, he said 'pressure on cash will intensify across the industry this year and we will have a trading outflow'. Last year turnover inched ahead to Pounds 2.34bn from Pounds 2.22bn, while operating profit fell to Pounds 47m, from Pounds 71m, after Pounds 7m of rationalisation costs and a Pounds 4m provision for bad debts. There was Pounds 3.6m interest, compared with a Pounds 4.8m payment last year. Details Page 24</p>

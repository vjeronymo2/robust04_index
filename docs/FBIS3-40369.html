This joint  development is considered a step forward in the field of  electric commercial vehicles (delivery vehicles and city busses)  and could help reduce exhaust in cities, metropolitan and resort  areas.    Moveable battery exchange stations in a container are to  improve short-term prospects for battery-driven busses used for  public local passenger transportation and in delivery vehicles  within the city. Modern exchange stations would avoid the  drawbacks of relatively short ranges and operating times which  are currently preventing the use of electrically driven busses  and commercial vehicles.    These mobile charging stations using a container format  require only a small space (the required area for a standard  version is 2.5 x 6.0 meter) and can be set up practically  anywhere. Recharging the batteries from the AC line current  requires only a 380 V outlet.    As Rainer Bitthin, head of systems development at Varta,  points out, this allows unrestricted 24-hour scheduled city bus  service. Neither "refuelling" at fixed charging stations which  takes hours nor the rather cumbersome battery exchange by  fork-lift truck are necessary.    As he explains, the bus driver himself can exchange the  battery at the mobile charging station within a few minutes. To  start the semi-automated battery exchange the bus rolls  backwards to the charging station with its charging flap open.  Two roller belt arms from the changing station are connected to  the bus. When a button is pushed the empty battery automatically  moves across the roller belts to an empty charging site at the  station.    By pushing another button a charged battery is automatically  moved across the roller belts into the rear section of the  vehicle. All the bus driver has to do is to connect the  batteries.    Depending on the version, the battery exchange containers  can  accept four to six batteries. They are placed in two shelves on  two or three levels each and can be charged there. The required  charging devices including the water supply for the Varta  Aquamatik system are in a separate compartment inside the  container.    According to calculations by the experts at Neoplan and  Varta, for instance, five batteries would be needed for  permanent scheduled service with two busses between 6:00 a.m.  and 10:00 p.m including the required battery exchange intervals.  For the pilot projects, Neoplan and Varta are using led-traction  batteries with tubular plates.    According to reports the Varta Perfect type battery with  electrolyte circulation and Varta Aquamatik is very energy  efficient and requires little maintenance. The charging time per  battery is reported to be five to six hours.    As Bitthin explains, the complete system including bus,  battery and exchange station has been studied as a pilot program  in Saxony and Mechelen/Belgium. He says that there has been wide  acceptance both among the bus service operators and the bus  drivers who actually had to exchange the battery.</p>

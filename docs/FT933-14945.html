			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Maverick MD steps in at crucial time MR HARRY MOULSON is the closest thing to a new broom sweeping through the corridors of British Gas's pipelines division. He joins a small group of maverick directors gathered round Mr Cedric Brown, who took over as chief executive a year ago with a mandate to change the company culture. Mr Moulson has been pitched into one of the highest-profile jobs in the gas business at a crucial time in its history. He could end up running his own company with assets of Pounds 15bn if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommends splitting pipelines from the rest of the business. Although the 49-year-old Mr Moulson is a qualified gas engineer - in the time-honoured tradition of British Gas managers - the bulk of his experience has been in the marketing side of the business. He has brought a new approach to the transport division. He is determined to refer to the company's competitors which send gas through its pipeline network as 'customers' rather than 'shippers'. A fresh approach is being welcomed by most shippers: 'I do detect a genuine desire to look at things another way,' said Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman of United Gas. But Mr Moulson inherits a department which is frustrated at being forced to give up market share to rivals in an effort to encourage competition, and may face an uphill struggle in convincing some of his colleagues to regard the shippers as worthy customers rather than an inconvenience. Also, some of the shippers feel they are being thwarted by pipeline operators eager to retain British Gas's upper hand. Mr Moulson believes his job is to sell space in British Gas's pipelines  - it does not matter whose gas fills that space. Although he does not have a place on the British Gas main board, his initiative has Mr Brown's full backing. Mr Moulson spent a year at Harvard Business School and worked in the US for the company's Global Gas division. The US business style is detectable in his direct approach - an attribute not common among British Gas's managers.</p>

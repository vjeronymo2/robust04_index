			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: Acis and Galatea - Queen Elizabeth Hall There is perhaps no form harder to bring off in performance today than the baroque pastoral. Handel's score for Acis and Galatea is among his most exquisite achievements, but the plot does not have the force or tension that hold an audience through his Xerxes, Julius Caesar or Semele. Listening to Handel's idea of Arcadian nymphs and shepherds is glorious, but how do you make that idea watchable? One way, of course, is to stage it in an approximation of the style of Handel's day: which is what the English Bach Festival attempted on Sunday night. But what a huge gap there is between theory and practice in reviving these baroque operas in period style. On one level it is so distracting to watch modern performers' efforts to recapture the exquisite refinements of an unrecapturable era that you can hardly attend to the music. On another level it is so interesting to be given a visible image of the idioms of that lost time that you are grateful to find new things to hear in the music. I find I spend half the time fending off the incidental details of the performance before me and trying to perceive the ideal that the revival is aiming at. The most important features of this English Bach Acis were in the music. With just four or five voices for the choral music and eight players in the orchestra, correspondences between song and accompaniment become keener. The closeness between oboe and tenor in 'Consider, fond shepherd' was a typical pleasure, and the intimate vigour of the great 'Wretched lovers' chorus was a highlight. The most striking feature of the stage action was its sheer amount of dance. Choruses and arias were often accompanied by a dance quartet (choreographed by Sarah Kremer), and I was glad to have the dance content of this music underlined. And yet I took little pleasure in the dancing itself. Decked out in airs, graces and smirks, it made Acis seem supercilious and bogus - Marie-Antoniette-ish. And weren't the women's dresses, revealing the ankles and more, anachronistic? The 1731 arrangement of Handel's 1718 score was being used, but in 1731 only the young ballerina Marie Camargo (in Paris) dared to shorten her skirts that far. As Polyphemus, Jonathan Best made the strongest impression. Made-up and costumed in nicely grotesque style, he looked and sounded the least inhibited person onstage. His attempt to acquire courtly refinement of gesture and gait during 'Would you gain the tender creature' was the freshest moment of the stage action, because it commented on the whole business of period style. Sally Harrison sang Galatea with sweet purity, and - for a singer  - showed a remarkable degree of understanding baroque stance, gesture and dance. It is hard not to make Acis a tender wimp, and that is all Richard Edgar-Wilson could manage. He looked stiff and gormless, though he sang with - yes  - sweet purity. (That's enough sweet purity. Ed.) (But it was that kind of a show. AM)</p>

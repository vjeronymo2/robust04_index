According to Shevardnadze,  the president of a great neighboring friendly state is coming to  independent Georgia, and anyone who thinks differently is  divorced from real politics and real life. "We will not allow  anyone to wreck this visit," the Georgian leader stressed.    The worried tone of Shevardnadze's statement is  understandable -- both the parliamentary and nonparliamentary  opposition are taking a negative view of the visit and of Russia  in general, primarily owing to Moscow's stance during the  Abkhazian war. However, most of Georgia's inhabitants do see  Russia as the sole guarantor of a stabilization of the extremely  grave economic and political situation within Georgia itself.    There is an extremely simple explanation for this rapid  metamorphosis in Georgian public thinking: The people have been  enraged by poverty and rampant banditry. Hopelessness and lack  of confidence in the future are making Joe Public look for a  miracle. And Boris Yeltsin must appear as a miracle worker to a  Georgian audience.    The reason for Yeltsin's visit to Georgia is to sign the  long-awaited treaty on friendship and cooperation between the  two countries. Georgia has already signed similar treaties with  all its closest neighbors. The delay in signing the  Russian-Georgian treaty is due primarily to the war in Abkhazia,  during which, in Tbilisi's opinion, Russia has espoused an  extremely equivocal position by generally backing the  separatists. But Shevardnadze and his immediate entourage  always tried to attribute this to the fact that a powerful war  party was at work within the Russian political establishment.  The reference being to the former Supreme Soviet and the former  vice president [Rutskoy], who once promised to muster aircraft  and bomb Tbilisi. Since they quit the political arena, people  here have begun to think that the situation is propitious for  Georgia.    A key question in the coming Russian-Georgian meeting will  undoubtedly be the settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. And  the Georgian side's main irreducible demand is for the refugees,  of whom there are over 200,000, to be brought back. In  accordance with the talks held in Geneva, the first group of  refugees is to return to Abkhazia 10 February. In the main they  are residents of the border Galskiy Rayon.    Abkhazian leaders have voiced their opinion of Yeltsin's  upcoming visit to Tbilisi. Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, one of  Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba's closest comrades in arms,  said that this visit means that Russia is giving Georgia carte  blanche for military revenge. Dzhindzholiya gave assurances  that the Russians have given the Georgian Army a large quantity  of military hardware, including modern ground-attack aircraft  and fighters. In the opinion of the Abkhazians, the delay in  deploying Russian Armed Forces under UN auspices in the conflict  zone is also an alarming factor. "Abkhazia has never trusted  the United Nations, and now Russia too is losing our trust,"  Dzhindzholiya stressed.    The question of Georgia's joining the ruble zone will  undoubtedly be broached during the talks in Tbilisi. At any  rate the official press and television have long been preparing  the public for this step. Strictly speaking, this propaganda  softening-up process is directed not so much at ordinary  mortals, who amid the soaring inflation of the local coupon have  long been prepared for their government to take these steps, but  at the political opposition, which sees this as a loss of  independence. "Understandably, if it joins the ruble zone  Georgia will be unable to implement its own finance and credit  policy and will be entirely dependent on the Russian Central  Bank. Also understandably, Russia can have no economic grounds  for allowing a country with such a ravaged economy as Georgia  into its currency zone. So, the idea is purely political and  pursues a single objective -- to restore the former empire in  one way or another," Revaz Shavishvili, chairman of the Georgian  monitoring agency [kontrolnaya palata], said.    The shadow of the broken Soviet Union is increasingly  alarming Georgian oppositionists. That is precisely the light  in which the opposition views the Georgian leader's moves toward  rapprochement.    The Georgian leader responds to the opposition's attacks  with  his customary confidence, but not without a dash of populism.  Shevardnadze feels fairly confident since former Georgian  president Zviad Gamsakhurdia quit the scene once and for all.  He is aware that he has the outward support of a population  exhausted by economic and political adversities for the policy  of close rapprochement with Russia. In response to the  countless accusations that he is promoting the revival of the  empire in a new form, Shevardnadze said that his policy of  rapprochement with Russia is designed to ensure that the empire  is never reborn. Only political aesthetes can assess the  novelty of these statements in Georgia today and, since they are  few and far between, Shevardnadze is simply taken on trust.    Meanwhile preparations are well and truly under way in the  Georgian capital to receive the eminent visitor. The "Green"  party has decided to clear the garbage that has accumulated over  several alarming months from the city's central streets. The  police are temporarily removing the concrete slabs along the  highway from the airport, and real Georgian wines and cognacs  are being taken to the state dacha where the Russian president  will be staying.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Pensions concern as coal sale bill published The government last night failed to quell concern about mineworkers' pensions when it published the bill to facilitate the privatisation of British Coal. After the 160-page bill was published Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said that British Coal was concerned about the extent of powers reserved for the industry secretary of state and believed the bill should fully reflect the government's commitments on pensions. He said further work was needed on pensions to ensure a proper balance between the government and pension scheme beneficiaries. The government said it would guarantee that pensions from pre-privatisation service with British Coal would be increased in line with the retail prices index. Beneficiaries would get further pensions increases out of their share of any surpluses, and pension entitlements from future service with private-sector successors to British Coal would be protected by law in industry-wide schemes. Two new pension schemes would be created for employees of British Coal and its subsidiaries who transfer to employment in successor companies. Pensions was one of the most contentious issues surrounding the bill to privatise British Rail in the last parliament. The government also made clear yesterday that it would safeguard existing entitlements to concessionary coal of past and present employees of British Coal. Yesterday's bill seeks to establish a coal authority to issue licences to private-sector companies. This will own and grant access to coal reserves but will not be able to mine coal itself. British Coal will continue to exist as a licensee of the authority for a transitional period after the reorganisation of the industry. It will be dissolved 'in due course'. The government is seeking views on proposals to establish a single regime for the exploitation of minerals including coal.</p>

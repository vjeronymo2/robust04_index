			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Kurds forced to free UK tourists KURDISH rebels kidnapped two British tourists from a bus in south-east Turkey but later abandoned them when they themselves came under fire from government troops yesterday, Reuter reports from Ankara. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) was still holding seven other tourists - three Swiss, one Italian, two Germans and a New Zealander - seized this month to draw attention to their separatist campaign in Turkey's south-east. A diplomat said the Britons, a man and woman, were seized at a rebel roadblock near the town of Kozluk in Batman province on Sunday evening. Their kidnappers forced them to walk into the mountains, where they were joined by two Turkish hostages. They spent the night in the rebels' hands but were turned loose in the morning when security forces fired on the area, making their way to the town of Batman. Security forces killed eight guerrillas in clashes with the kidnappers, the emergency rule governor's office said. The PKK has abducted a total of 27 foreign tourists since 1991 but has released all unharmed, except the seven. On August 10 the rebels freed four Frenchmen, a Briton and an Australian taken in two separate kidnappings in July.</p>

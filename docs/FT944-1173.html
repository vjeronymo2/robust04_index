			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Russia holds back from Grozny strike: Army meets stiff resistance in Chechnya but seizes villages The Russian army yesterday continued to pound Chechen positions to the north of the capital of Grozny but was meeting what the Russian interior ministry admitted was 'stiff resistance' and was holding back from an assault. Although protests at home and abroad are mounting, the Russian government continues to show a will to squeeze the breakaway republic's capital, if not yet to take it. A meeting of ministers, presidential aides and senior parliamentarians chaired by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, promised further 'decisive action' and noted that the army had come closer to Grozny from the north-east and north-west and was preparing to cut the minor roads to the south. A statement released after the meeting spoke of Chechen forces retreating to the hills, while those which remained used civilians as 'human shields'. The government information service built on these reports by maintaining that the 'city is in panic'. The reports are not wholly confirmed by journalists who remain in the Chechen capital. Reuters' reports say that a 'human chain' of many thousands of residents of Grozny and the surrounding villages stretched along the highway to the west in an attempt to end hostilities, while the hospitals continued to function and bread and other supplies were being sold in the market. But the overwhelming superiority of Russian armour, now being reinforced by marines and other troops, is beginning to tell. While a Russian helicopter was reported shot down by Chechen fire yesterday, the Russian troops claimed that two villages - Pravoberezhnaya and Chervlyonnaya, to the north - were taken in heavy fighting. Western military analysts in Moscow believe the seizure of Grozny is being delayed until it is emptied and until the surrounding forces have been weakened. While talks were still being urged yesterday - notably by the Chechen Mufti, Mukhammad-Hussein Alsabekov, who was speaking in Moscow - these are now thought all but impossible. If there is an inhibiting factor on Russia's actions, it is more likely to come from outside its border than from within. The parliament of Ukraine, the largest and most important of the former Soviet states neighbouring Russia, yesterday appealed to Moscow's leaders to stop the fighting, saying 'we call on you to do everything possible so that international human rights standards and freedoms are applied to the peoples of the Caucasus'. Only Moslem states - such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan - have protested over the intervention. They were warned off yesterday by a brusque statement from the Russian foreign ministry, which said such calls were an interference in Russia's internal policies. A very Bosnian plight, Page 12</p>

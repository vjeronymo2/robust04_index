			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Arts: Schubert and Janacek operas - The Edinburgh Festival This was a competition Janacek was always going to win. In the combative world of opera the festival's two main featured composers had opposite experiences: Schubert retired hurt aged 25 after a number of youthful failures, while Janacek went on to compose a series of great operas in his sixties, which rank as his most lasting achievement. No fully-staged operas by either of them feature this year in Edinburgh's programme (an important omission in Janacek's case). Instead, there was an intriguing evening, which presented two rarely-heard operas in concert - Schubert's Die Freunde von Salamanka and Janacek's Sarka. For opera-lovers this may have seemed a raw deal, but it is always worth taking a risk with rarely-heard operas in case they hold untold delights. Janacek thought Sarka was a good piece himself. He wrote it in his early thirties, which makes it one of his earliest works to survive, revised it, failed to get it performed, revised it again late in life, and finally saw it reach the stage as a 70th-birthday tribute. It only lasts an hour, but into that time an epic in miniature is compressed. The opera takes place way back in Czech mythological history. An army of warrior women is roaming the land in protest against male domination, beating the men at their own game and causing consternation in the male camp at the daring exploits of their boldest fighters. No, Janacek is not about to raise his voice in the cause of women's rights; his interest had been taken by the nationalist undercurrent of the plot, which can be read as a call to emulate the heroes of Czech mythology. No doubt that is why the music is so impassioned. The score proceeds in fits and starts, but its ideas are consistently strong, vivid, uplifting, because the composer wanted Sarka to make an impact. Among its best moments are a love duet built of disjointed musical motifs in the mature Janacek manner and a final act (all of 15 minutes long) which is a Wagnerian threnody for the fallen hero. The interest rarely slackened in this lively performance by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under David Robertson. It was also well sung. Sarka, the warrior maid who ambushes and murders the man whom she then decides she loved, looks potentially a beast of a character, but Helena Kaupova sang her music with calm and dignity. William Kendall brought some strength to the hapless Ctirad; the supporting roles were well taken by Christopher Ventris and Neal Davies. Next to this, the 18-year-old Schubert's Die Freunde von Salamanka (wisely performed first) is an apology for an opera. Nice people, an inoffensive story, no dramatic tension whatsoever and music which is so charmingly insubstantial that one puff of the Janacek blew it all away. Despite a decent cast of middle-ranking British singers, this concert performance showed that at 90 minutes, it is far too long. Wise young Schubert to give up opera and move on to better things.</p>

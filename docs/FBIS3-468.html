Commenting on Sunday's massacre in Bhambayi,  in which 11 people were killed, he said the ANC's recommendation  that the police Internal Stability Division [ISD] be withdrawn  was being "opposed at the highest level". "The government is  moving very slowly on this issue. That is because it is still a  white minority government which regards the lives of blacks as  cheap -- like that of flies, " the ANC president said.    Mr Mandela, who is on a three-day electioneering visit to  the  Northern Transvaal, was speaking to reporters soon after  arriving by helicopter at Sekororo in rural Lebowa. He said  killings such as that at Bhambayi should be expected because of  the government's failure to maintain law and order. "Until the  government decides to carry out our recommendations, the  violence will worsen. We are doing our best to address the  violence but we are not the government."    Mr Mandela said the ISD was regarded by township communities  as "carrying out war against the people." He said violence had  subsided in East Rand townships after the deployment of the  Army, but the conflict had now shifted to areas such as  Bekkersdal and Bhambayi.    The ANC leader said his movement would "be able to use the  capacity and resources of the state" to end violence and  maintain law and order after the April elections.    Later, addressing a peoples' forum at the Sekororo  showgrounds, about 50km south of Tzaneen, Mr Mandela vowed there  would never be an Afrikaner "volkstaat" in South Africa as long  as he lived. Mr Mandela heard several complaints from residents  of the rural settlement about untarred roads, a shortage of  classrooms, a lack of running water and unemployment. He said  an ANC government would build houses, provide schools, tar roads  and act decisively to end the exploitation of farm workers.    He accused the National Party of spreading lies by claiming  an ANC government would seize pensions. "Any government that  takes away pension benefits from old people is not fit to  govern. The ANC can never commit such cruelty."    Mr Mandela is to address another peoples' forum in Sekhopo  before flying on to Venda on Monday night.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate for  the PCN [National Conciliation Party], warned Salvadorans of a  possible Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) attack  on the electoral system. "I am definitely warning the Salvadoran  people because we cannot trust the left-wing," asserted the  presidential candidate.    At the same time, Escobar Garcia also denounced the  left-wing's pressures on the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE],  both internally and externally. He mentioned that the Electoral  Code was reformed because of those left-wing pressures to allow  them to enter Departmental and Municipal Electoral Boards in a  proportion that does not correspond to them. Furthermore,  because of those same left-wing pressures, other provisions and  mechanisms of the Electoral Code have been revised.    According to the candidate, that is a form of blocking and  disparaging the electoral process "with easily discernible  intentions." According to the politician, the TSE "prefers to  please the leftists in an effort to maintain the prestige of the  Salvadoran electoral process."    He advised, however, that as the left-wing begins to feel  defeated and realizes it has no support, it will attack the  electoral system for any reason, real or imagined. He added that  the pressures "are fabricated here and bolstered abroad. Later,  the conditions, specially from the United States and Europe,  come to El Salvador." He regretted this fact, and reiterated  that the left-wing immediately goes abroad to complain to the  U.S. Government or the Europeans about any little thing that  could be solved here. In this regard, Escobar Garcia asked the  left-wing to show "more loyalty for the electoral process, for  democracy, and for the Salvadoran people. This is no way to  collaborate with democracy, but it is a way to destroy it," he  said.    In spite of everything, he continued, "the people must not  be  skeptical or pessimistic because the Salvadoran right-wing  clearly understands the FMLN's strategy." Furthermore, he  asserted that "the PCN is willing to defend the system and fight  within the law so our rights and those of the citizens are  guaranteed."    Colonel Escobar Garcia stated this shortly after receiving  the general secretariat of the PCN from Hernan Contreras, whom  he said had done "an excellent job." He used the same general  terms to describe the work of the TSE, whose work has been  recognized nationally and abroad, and also "by Augusto Ramirez  Ocampo, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] himself."    He also said other organizations have claimed that the TSE  has a very reliable electoral process, something which other  countries that claim their democratic system is more advanced  wished they had.</p>

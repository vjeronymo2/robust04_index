Military sources in the Srpska republic say that this is a  realistic number based on testimonies given by captured  Albanians. A large number of Albanians were engaged by Muslim  units via the Raska region after calls issued by the Party of  Democratic Action in Novi Pazar and by its leader Sulejman  Ugljanin. According to Srpska military circles this operation  had two goals: to help their brothers in faith and to gain  experience for possible war in Kosovo. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BULGARIA REJECTS FORMER KING'S OFFER TO COME BACK FROM EXILE  </P> <P> The Communist government today rejected an offer by Bulgaria's former king to  return from exile and help rebuild the country, suggesting the monarch should  mind his own business.  </P> <P> "There is no room for the revival of monarchist ideas in Bulgaria's public  life," the government said in a statement carried by the Communist Party  newspaper Rabotnichesko Delo.  </P> <P> The statement rejected former King Simeon II's offer to use his international  business and political connections to help revitalize Bulgaria's economy.  </P> <P> It said the proposals are "strange and absolutely unacceptable, as are the  attempts to advise the Bulgarian people about the way they should manage their  affairs."  </P> <P> Simeon II, who as a child briefly served as Bulgaria's last monarch before  being exiled in 1946, made the proposals in an interview broadcast Sunday night  on state television.  </P> <P> The unprecedented television appearance from his home in Madrid gave many  Bulgarians their first glimpse of the 53-year-old former king, who was forced  to leave the country at age 9 when the Communists seized power.  </P></p>

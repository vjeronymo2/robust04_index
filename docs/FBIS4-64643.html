			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Briancon: "Clinton Tries To Justify </F> His Diplomatic Vacillation"]    [Text] The mystery of U.S. foreign policy under Clinton's  leadership deepens each time the President makes an appearance  to clear it up. In an attempt to respond to the criticisms and  to explain his foreign policy on Tuesday [3 May] evening during  a spectacular production by CNN broadcast "to 200  countries"--according to the network--the U.S. President for 90  minutes responded to the main criticisms leveled at him for  months over his management of all the hot issues at the moment  -- Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, and Somalia.    But at the end of this lengthy expose, the American and  international public had no answers to the main questions raised  by U.S. foreign policy since Clinton's election: Is he really a  new kind of president trying a new style of diplomacy in a  radically different world? Or do the very qualities which often  help him in domestic policy, such as his desire to build a  consensus at all costs and his caution, render him incapable in  the field of foreign policy?    The very fact that Clinton decided to devote a lengthy  evening to answering the questions of international journalists  -- in CNN's studios and on a link-up with several tense areas  throughout the world -- reflects his obsession with opinion  polls, according to his critics. It is a kind of delayed  reaction, and various stances adopted in recent days look more  like a desire to repair a falling poll rating than a real desire  to define a clear and, if possible, bold foreign policy. Only  40 percent of Americans now think that Clinton is doing "a good  job" in this sphere, and the President's political advisers  thought that a kind of crisis point had been reached.    Americans like their presidents to be direct and decisive in  foreign policy. Debate, public analysis of issues, and  vacillation can be accepted as proper democratic procedures in  the realm of domestic policy, but in the diplomatic sphere, the  public tends to like a "leader" rather than a university  professor well versed in the analysis of the pros and cons. On  Tuesday evening, Clinton continued to be the university  professor, while peppering his speech with remarks dictated by  the opinion polls rather than by a personal vision. With regard  to Haiti, he had already spoken out during the day, stating  that, with regard to the military junta, it was "time they  went." On CNN, he went so far as to say that the United States  could not "afford to rule out the possibility of a military  option" for restoring exiled President Aristide to his rightful  place.    The same firm message was delivered recently with regard to  North Korea. Clinton said on Tuesday that "nobody wants a  confrontation" with that country, which has probably built a  nuclear bomb, but he added that it was a "potentially dangerous  situation."    Attacked by domestic critics who accuse him of having passed  on the role of American "leadership" to collective and anonymous  bodies such as NATO or the United Nations and of systematically  trying to make decisions multilaterally which he ought to make  alone, Clinton admitted that he had "underestimated the problem  of building a coalition" of big international powers with regard  to Bosnia. "That took longer and was more frustrating that I  thought," he said. "But it is part of the reality of the  post-Cold War world." Clinton stressed several times that the  leaders of the world's major powers were facing situations for  which there are "no easy solutions," in which they "do not know  what will work." His diplomatic team, strongly criticized in  the United States, "is working on new ground," he stressed,  defending his aides.    Aside from the firmer language on some points, this  televised  desire to show all that he does not intend -- or no longer  intends --to leave foreign policy to his aides, Clinton  reiterated the two main guidelines which he has used to define  his foreign policy since he came to office: First, the fact  that "America cannot solve every problems and should not become  the world's policeman," but that it "will not hesitate to act  alone when (its) major interests are at stake," and, second, the  fact that his long-term strategy is "to encourage the success of  new democracies," a policy pursued under the name of "expansion"  (of the circle of market democracies -- LIBERATION editor's  note) by National Security Adviser Tony Lake. Following this  professorial lecture, the irritated Americans and the bemused  world are still awaiting a presidential foreign policy.</p>

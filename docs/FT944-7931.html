			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moving to right Jakarta's lop-sided stock market - The government wants to encourage local investment There is something lop-sided about Indonesia's fast-growing stock market. While local investors own most of the shares in listed companies, foreigners do most of the trading, accounting for as much as 80 per cent of turnover. The problem is not uncommon in Asia, but it is particularly acute in Indonesia, where the share-owning middle class remains relatively small and the richest individuals tend to hold a high proportion of their assets offshore. Indonesian officials acknowledge that, as in other countries of the region, they badly need to develop a broad domestic base of institutional investors if the capital market is to play a full role in financing the country's economic and infrastructure development. The authorities plan to introduce two changes which they hope will propel the market into the modern world. A new securities law, currently in the final stages of draft, should allow for tighter regulatory supervision when it takes effect next year. In a move which must make the London Stock Exchange blush over its Taurus fiasco - the planned paperless system abandoned last year - Jakarta is preparing to have fully-automated trading when it moves to new premises in early 1995. Though the two moves are not directly connected, the authorities hope both will enhance market liquidity and broaden the domestic investor base. The stock exchange reckons automated trading will enable it to handle up to 50,000 transactions a day compared with the current 3,800. Tighter regulation should improve market integrity and pave the way for greater institutional participation. Brokers agree that the market - already capitalised at more than Dollars 50bn - is set to grow exponentially. Daily trading volume has tripled to Dollars 47m in the last two years. 'We think that volume is going to grow ten-fold in the next four (years),' says Mr Anthony Davies of Baring Securities. But there remains scepticism about the direct impact of the new securities law. So far, only the outlines are known. Mr Bacelius Ruru, chairman of the capital markets supervisory agency in charge of the draft, says the law will reinforce existing bans on insider trading and share manipulation by giving his agency the power of subpoena and search. It will also tighten standards of disclosure, particularly of material change in a company's fortunes. Mr Ruru says he is determined to use the law to raise standards of integrity in the market, even if it makes him unpopular. 'Once the law is effective, we will have no other choice but to carry it out,' he says. Automated trading will also increase the transparency of the market, making it easier to detect abuse, he says. Brokers say it remains to be seen how much things change in practice in a country with a financial system still dominated by vested interests. Other Asian countries which have introduced similar improvements in regulation have witnessed only a slow reduction in share-price volatility. It is also unclear how far the law will go in forcing full disclosure of directors' dealings and in setting a minimum amount of shares which must be made available to the public in any flotation. In the view of many brokers, it is the lack of any ruling in the latter area that makes for the greatest barrier to liquidity. Says Mr Ruru: 'I appeal to issuers. Please, you have to float more shares, not just a token.' However, as in many markets at this early stage of development, such a suggestion is contentious with company owners worried about loss of control. Moreover, many would like the authorities to go further and drop the 49 per cent limit on the portion of a floated company which may be owned by foreigners. This further restricts liquidity, they argue. Though there are indications that the regulatory authority is sympathetic to such a move, it could only be decided at the highest political level. As evidence of their determination to increase liquidity, the authorities have, however, scrapped capital gains tax on securities transactions from next January, and plan to permit the launch of open-ended investment trusts under the new law. They are also talking about using the market automation to reduce the minimum lot. This is currently at 500 shares, which means the smallest transaction in the recent Indosat issue would be more than Dollars 3m. Mr Ruru hopes such measures will attract pension funds out of bank deposits and into equities, and that wealthy Chinese investors, traditionally the main players in the equity market, will repatriate funds from abroad. One way or another the interest of domestic investors has to be nurtured, given the huge supply of stock that looms over the next few years. The government has already announced three privatisations - the telecoms group Telkom, the PLN electricity company and the Jasa Marga toll road - to follow Indosat. Further down the road, large issues from the state airline Garuda and the oil company Pertamina are expected. At some point, the market will have reached the size where tighter regulation has to be enforced, if it has become sufficiently robust to absorb so much new paper. That point has not yet been reached, even among foreign investors who are sticklers for proper behaviour at home. Few foreigners complain about the current situation, where company results may be dribbled into the market as much as six weeks before any official announcement. 'They just gravitate to the brokers who are best informed,' says one smirking analyst.</p>

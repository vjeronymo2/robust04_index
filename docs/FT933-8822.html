			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: U2 at Wembley - Pop concert With pop music so obviously suffering a crisis of confidence it is comforting to find a band wholly committed to spectacle, drama, megalomania and pretension. Half way through his performance at Wembley Arena on Wednesday, Bono, the singer and driving force behind that principal prop of the Irish economy, U2, took time off to sort out Bosnia. His live screen link up with some cowed looking inhabitants of Sarajevo got prospects for peace no further than Lord Owen, but it showed where the man's heart is - so blatantly on his sleeve that it irritates beyond reason. Not that it perturbs Bono. If Bosnia cannot accept the mediation of U2, why not turn his attention to Salman Rushdie. He phones him up, but that is just a blind. Rushdie is actually back stage and for a hug from Bono exposes himself before 50,000 people, so great is the power of a superstar. On top of this canter through good causes U2 put on the most expensive and the most pleasurably stunning show that you are likely to see this side of the global recession. The stage is like some gigantic TV station, with vast screens to project images of everything from drumming Nazis to Martin Luther King. For no good reason three cars are suspended from the galleys, and there is a light show of such brilliance that sometimes the stage glows red like the Devil's kitchen, sometimes gleams white like the very portals of Heaven. As if this were not enough, there is a subsidiary stage linked by a catwalk where the band perform acoustic songs from the new album, a belly dancer wafts through 'She moves in mysterious ways', and a prone Bono is videoed by a young Argentinian girl who squats astride him for those vital close ups. With so much to divert the eye the music hardly needs attention. In fact U2 stick very close to their standard repertoire, and are at their best belting out hits like 'Streets have no name' as if they were any old rock and roll band. After all, they look like one; Bono dresses mainly in black leather and dark glasses, with a switch to Mephistophelean red, plus horns, for the finale, while guitarist, The Edge, seizes the one chance offered to the rest of the quartet and growls his way through his solo, 'Numb'. U2 are seriously mega because they have fine control over their worthy songs and the confidence to play straight, give or take a massive stage crew and special effects of De Mille-ian proportions. Apart from the dancer there are no extra musicians, no backing singers. This is the band. They even manage to retain street cred and a right-on image while sending up their fans rotten in a sequence of video confessions taped by extrovert members of the audience, and leading the life of multi-millionaires. The cracks must be there but they do not show. The ZOO TV tour is pop as drama, pop as sensation, but U2 also make sure that the music is not completely forgotten. See it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report on interview with Israeli Prime </F> Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: "Yitzhaq Rabin: `Russia and America  Should Help Us, Not Reach Agreement on Our Behalf'"]    [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin received  correspondents from IZVESTIYA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, and Radio Ekho  Moskvy at the government residence on Kosygin Street. Like most  politicians, the head of the Israeli Government basically  preferred to talk about what he thought was important, thus  avoiding giving answers to tough questions.    The premier acknowledged that in the short term the peace in  the Near East will be a peace between leaders rather than  peoples. "There is a big gap between peace in name only and the  peace that passes via the hearts of people," he said. Rabin  noted that Arab leaders agreed to talk with Israel only because  they realized they could achieve nothing by violence against the  Jewish state. "We are not cutting our military expenditure,  since our military might is a guarantee of security and a  guarantee that the talks will continue. It is a factor which  encourages the strengthening of trends toward a peaceful  political solution," the prime minister stated.    Yitzhaq Rabin addressed the topic of Islamic fundamentalism,  which is particularly alarming to the Israelis. In his opinion,  the danger is posed not so much by extremists from Hamas who are  directly threatening the lives of Israelis, but by the spread of  "Khomeyni-ism without Khomeyni," even in countries in the region  that are located a long way from Israel. "Fundamentalism is  undermining the stability of moderate Arab regimes as a whole,  and this is our problem too," Rabin believes.    The premier refused to say how he regarded the prospects of  his Labor Party, and his own prospects, in future parliamentary  elections in the wake of the Hebron massacre, which demonstrated  how far the opponents of peace among the Jews themselves are  prepared to go. However, he acknowledged that the popularity of  the peace process has declined throughout large sections of  Israeli society.    "Many people ask me," the premier continued, "why we need  peace when any fanatic can strap explosives around his waist and  destroy a passenger bus? How can we be certain that 'Arafat,  once he has assumed control of the Gaza sector with its 750,000  Palestinians, many of whom will remain terrorists until the end  of their days, will be able to ensure order there?"    "I belong to the category of politicians who are convinced  that the risk is great, but this risk also engenders hope, and  it should be given a chance," the head of the Israeli Government  stated. "Needless to say, this will be a big test for Yasir  'Arafat as well."    Diplomatic politeness obliged Yitzhaq Rabin to say only  agreeable things about Russia, despite the fact that a certain  strain was very evident in bilateral relations back in March.  At that time his cabinet, backed by Washington, was extremely  skeptical about Moscow's proposal to start preparing the second  stage of the Madrid peace conference. "I see no disagreements  between the cochairmen of the peace conference -- Russia and the  United States," the prime minister said. "Their task is to help  the two sides directly responsible for stopping the war; they  can also agree between themselves, but they should certainly not  conclude any agreements on the two sides' behalf."</p>

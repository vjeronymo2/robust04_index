			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Ministers consider insurance support over terrorist damage CABINET ministers are considering limited support for insurance companies to cover against terrorist damage on the British mainland. With insurance companies warning that existing policies covering against terrorism could be withdrawn from next month, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is discussing possible solutions with the Treasury and the prime minister. No decision has been taken, however, and the government is adamant that insurance companies must bear the brunt of the risks. Ministers are concerned about the propaganda advantage to the IRA if the government gave help and about the cost of its involvement. April's IRA bomb attack in the City caused an estimated Pounds 1bn damage. Mr Heseltine indicated on BBC Radio that he recognised the damage withdrawing cover might have on the property market. 'It is obviously a matter of urgency,' he said. He and Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, will hold further talks with insurance companies. A Whitehall official said: 'It is quite the most difficult problem that we have had to look at in this parliament.' One scheme being considered is a 5 per cent levy on industrial property insurance that would be pooled to provide cover for terrorist damage with any extra cost underwritten by the government. The scheme has been proposed by the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce, representing more than 300 UK companies. Mr Heseltine is unwilling to disclose his negotiating position, saying he wants to ensure market coverage 'to the greatest extent that is possible'. He appears to have vetoed a version of the Northern Ireland Office's compensation scheme for businesses in the province which pays for all terrorist damage. Last month the Association of British Insurers recommended its members withdraw terrorism cover from commercial insurance policies. The ABI, which has written to the prime minister, wants a similar scheme to that in Northern Ireland Yesterday the ABI said some members were considering cancelling policies that include terrorism cover. Insurers can cancel most commercial policies by giving policyholders 30 days' notice. Concern heightened this week after IRA bomb attacks in Manchester. Material damage is likely to amount to less than Pounds 4m but claims through loss of business could be much higher.</p>

This information was disclosed at a news conference by  Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who said the  offensive in question will be conducted by representatives from  the Foreign Ministry, the Presidential Commission for the  Coordination of Human Rights Affairs (Copredeh), and the  Guatemalan Government's Peace Commission.    Fajardo added that the plan has already been distributed to  six specific groups and that in his own case he will be abroad  for a week, during which he will visit the United States,  Canada, and certain South American countries.    The foreign minister explained that resources for the trips  will be taken from the regular budgets of the concerned  government institutions, although he added that diplomacy  requires some investment to fulfill its duties.    Fajardo Maldonado also announced that President De Leon  Carpio will visit Mexico in January to meet with his  counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, although this trip is  not connected to the recent armed events on the border between  the two countries.    Similar circumstances surround the president's trip to Costa  Rica, although this trip may be postponed until February, given  that elections will be held in that country soon.    Fajardo also confirmed his own and President De Leon's  attendance at the inauguration of Honduran President Carlos  Roberto Reina, to which both have been invited; the inauguration  has been scheduled for 27 January.    The foreign minister also used the occasion to refute  statements by Government Spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman to the  effect that Guatemala has not yet decided to support any of the  candidates to the OAS general secretaryship.    Alleging a slip of the tongue by Loarca, the top diplomat  said that Guatemala's position is clearly that it supports the  candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, which  is established in a pledge made from the time of the San  Salvador summit in 1991 and at subsequent summits, including the  last one, which was held in Guatemala.    Fajardo said that the president has full confidence in him  and that he will continue in his post, due to which he has  already called for specific foreign policy jobs, although he  explained that he has not directly discussed this issue with de  Leon Carpio.    To conclude, Fajardo said that it is up to the government to  grant approval to Belizean Ambassador Atly Morales, because  diplomatic approvals are to be included in a general policy that  will be established with the participation of all the social  sectors.</p>

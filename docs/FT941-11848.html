			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Global forum idea akin to revamped OECD plan Sir, Ideas for a new global forum put forward by Mr Peter Sutherland in Davos and reported in your issue of January 29 ('Sutherland urges new global forum') are not dissimilar to those discussed in September 1992 at a conferenceentitled 'Building a new democratic order', held at Airlie House, near Washington DC. It was then suggested that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development should be revamped around the nucleus of the existing member countries to bring in fast developing and less developed countries at different levels as previously proposed by the secretary-general, Mr Jean-Claude Paye. Thus the OECD would become the main forum for dialogue between the industrialised world and other groups such as the newly industrialising Asean countries and Latin American countries moving towards greater economic co-operation. TheOECD could also help relations between Europe, North America and Japan, as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Area and Asean dev-elop into more cohesive economic areas. As a first step, the revamped OECD would act as a think-tank or policy unit subordinate to the Group of Seven, but with its representatives, including those from the developing world, attending certain sessionsof the annual economic summit of the Group of Seven. Among the OECD's priorities would be unemployment among the advanced industrial countries. David Barton, Loafers, Bosham Lane, Old Bosham, West Sussex PO18 8HL</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Alba seeks sale of stake in Signet Banking CORPORACION ALBA, the Spanish holding company controlled by the powerful March family group, is seeking to sell its 15.5 per cent stake in Signet Banking Corporation, the US bank. The disposal of the conglomerate's financial arm in the US comes in the wake of its plans to raise as much as Pta50bn (Dollars 277m)from the sale of its electric utility interests in Spain. The move also underlines an apparent strategic shift by Alba aimed at realising as many of its assets as possible. The March group, run by brothers Juan and Carlos, has denied reports it is seeking to sell its retail banking network, Banco Urquijo. It is understood, however, to be seeking a partner for its investment banking subsidiary Banco de Progreso, both of which come under the Corporacion Alba umbrella. Alba's consolidated net profits last year fell to Pta10.4bn. The decline was blamed on the reduced income of its Aragonesas chemical group which owns the utilities that have been put on the market.</p>

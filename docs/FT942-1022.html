			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Press Review: An event of less than summit importance - Greece So thin was the Greek coverage of the Corfu summit that a reader flipping the pages of an Athens tabloid could have missed it completely, despite Greece's role as host. Even heavyweight newspapers were reluctant to let it overshadow the weekend's main preoccupations: an imminent reshuffle of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's cabinet after the governing Socialists' poor showing in the European elections; and a list issued by the Finance Ministry, naming for the first time Greece's 200 worst tax offenders. 'All's well on Corfu - except for the succession,' headlined Kathimerini, the heavyweight daily, adding that the European leaders' failure to agree on a new Commission president was 'a blow to the already low stature of the European Union'. To Vima, the other sober Greek newspaper, focused on what it called Friday night's 'political thriller' as Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's European affairs minister, attempted in the early hours to steer through the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. The UK veto on Mr Dehaene provoked little comment. Only Kathimerini gave it front-page coverage, saying that 'Britain torpedoed Mr Dehaene's election'. Avgi, the left-wing daily, concluded: 'The complications in electing a new Commission president indicate that the process of European unification will be slowed down, and there could be a period of stagnation in EU activities.' For the Greek tabloids, there was only one story from the summit: Mr Pangalos's refusal to greet Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, at the signing ceremony for the EU's pact with Russia. Ethnos, along with half a dozen other papers, gave a colourful account of the 'the vendetta between Pangalos and Berlusconi'. Eleftheros Typos described at length the efforts by Greek government officials to cover up an embarrassing moment between the Greek Socialist, who refused to greet the Italian right-winger, including the Foreign Ministry spokesman's assertion that 'nothing like that happened'. Several papers printed a picture, taken at the previous night's official dinner and produced later by the Italian government spokesman. It showed the burly Mr Pangalos gripping Mr Berlusconi's hand. Mr Pangalos's gesture in refusing to greet Mr Berlusconi won approval from most newspapers, which have given widespread coverage to the Greek minister's criticism of Italy's neo-fascists. But Eleftheros Typos's political column noted disapprovingly: 'Greece is traditionally a hospitable country and Mr Pangalos should have been aware of that. It's not a question of culture but of Greek social custom.' However, opinions were mixed on whether Greece's six-month EU presidency had proved successful. Kathimerini concluded that 'in general, Greece not only responded to the challenge of the presidency, but succeeded in changing the exceptionally negative image that prevailed at the start of this six months.' Concluding both the EU enlargement talks and the agreements with Russia and Ukraine 'gave a boost to Greece's role on the European and international scene at a time when the country was getting worryingly low ratings'. But Apogevmatini, the conservative evening newspaper, maintained that the summit 'revealed the nakedness of the Greek presidency, which was unprepared on everything and made no attempt to promote issues of broader Greek interest which are also of European interest. It has been a lost opportunity.' Kathimerini's opinion column added some advice for politicians and diplomats handling Greece's disputes with its Balkan neighbours and Turkey, based on watching the EU at work: 'Greece's foreign policy problems have to be presented to international organisations on the basis of study, specific plans and modern diplomacy. Our arguments must be realistic to presuade our allies. A disjointed presentation of unyielding positions leads to failure.' One achievement at the summit, hailed mainly on the econmic pages, was Greece's inclusion in three projects in the EU's plan for trans-European transport and energy networks. But several newspapers also ran gloomy commentaries on Greece's revised plan for economic convergence with the rest of the EU, announced just before the summit. Eleftheros Typos said: 'The tragedy of the convergence plan is not just that it won't lead us to Europe but that there will be four years of austerity in the meantime.'</p>

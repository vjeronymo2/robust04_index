			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Degoricija, president of the state </F> delegation for negotiations with the local Serbs, by Aleksa  Crnjakovic; place and date not given: "The Refugees Will Return  to Their Homes Within Six Months!"]    [Text] Although, by now, everything is known about the  cease-fire agreement signed early Wednesday morning, we asked  Slavko Degoricija, one of the negotiators on the Croatian side,  to tell us specifically if the refugees can now return to the  protected areas, who will organize their return, and when.    [Crnjakovic] Mr. Degoricija, can the people of Skabrnja  return to their village, and who should organize that?    [Degoricija] The agreement itself is so global that its  function is not only the ceasefire and putting a stop to further  hostilities, but it also opens the practical possibility of the  return of the refugees. At issue is a great area, stretching  over a thousand kilometers, and it will now be necessary to  determine specifically which villages the people can return to,  if there is an infrastructure there, if they can work, sleep,  eat there.  <H5>  The Entire Line Free </H5>   [Crnjakovic] Who will make all the preparations, and why  have they not been made yet? Namely, it would be logical that  these plans would be completed parallel to the negotiations.  Were they?    [Degoricija] Unfortunately, the state institution that would  organize the return of the refugees and their life in the  villages that have been empty for over two years does not exist  yet. At the time, there was the Ministry of Restoration, which  had gained very good experience in 1992, when people were  returning to Pakrac, Lipik, or Gorice. I really do not know who  will be doing that now. For instance, in the area of Jasenovac,  or Novska, refugees can return to three villages: Tanac,  Ustice, and Visnjica. In sector west, refugees can practically  return to the villages behind Lipik and Pakrac now that this  agreement on the cessation of hostilities has been signed.  Clearly, this can not be done in an unorganized way; these  people must have complete protection. Theoretically, refugees  can return to Skabrnja, Islam Grcki, Smokovici, and Kasic, since  that entire line is now free. The greatest value of this  agreement is precisely that -- the process of the refugees  returning to their homes beginning.    [Crnjakovic] Who is to say when this will happen?    [Degoricija] That is what I would like to know!    [Crnjakovic] Nothing has been organized in practical terms?    [Degoricija] These people need material help. We had  offices for return and restoration in municipalities, but I do  not know if such offices have been organized in counties.    [Crnjakovic] Why has that not been done yet?    [Degoricija] No substitute has been found for the former  Ministry of Restoration. The government will have to give  initiative to some other institution that would take care of all  this.    [Crnjakovic] You keep mentioning the protected areas. The  public is afraid that this is the final "cementing" of the  Cyprus syndrome.    [Degoricija] The Cyprus syndrome being created in Croatia is  out of the question. Croatia has been given all the  international guarantees that the normalization process must  have three stages, the first relating to ceasefire, which I  consider the most important one, and the last one regarding the  political solution.  <H5>  The Opening of the Highway </H5>   [Crnjakovic] How much time will there be between the first  and second stage?    [Degoricija] The actualization of the second stage will  follow within 10 days, or 14 at the longest. It is very  important, and it relates to the preparation of the negotiations  on economy and infrastructure. Specifically, that means that  all the railroads and roads will be open, the electric power  supply facilities repaired, and the water supply facilities open.    [Crnjakovic] Even the Knin railroad to Split?    [Degoricija] Of course! The Zagreb-Belgrade highway, and  the Karlovac-Korenica-Obrovac-Zadar road too. There will  probably be priorities in the process, as each side has its own,  mostly different, priorities. For instance, the Serb side  considers electricity important; for us it is the highway; for  UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] it is the  Zagreb-Knin-Split railroad; the Croatia's interest is to open  all the water sources, so that Zadar, Sibenik, and Biograd can  be supplied. Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia  are especially interested in the opening of the oil pipeline.  Therefore, in about two weeks, we will decide at the green  table on the process of the economic and traffic normalization.  When we do that, the third stage, relating to political  negotiations, will follow.    [Crnjakovic] In your opinion, of all the miracles you have  promised, which will happen first?    [Degoricija] They are no longer miracles; this is reality.  I believe that the highway will open first, and the opening of  the oil pipeline will follow, but I think that the water supply  will not be late either. It is quite certain that many local  roads will open immediately.    [Crnjakovic] Are you not afraid that the Serb rebels will  stop the passengers, or the workers at the water pumping sites?    [Degoricija] Now, the issue is no longer fear, because now  the guarantor is the international factor.   <H5>    Sanctions Against Offenders </H5>   [Crnjakovic] However, theoretically, the possibility that  someone will violate the agreement should be taken into  consideration. Have provisions been made for this case?    [Degoricija] The international factors will impose  sanctions.    [Crnjakovic] What kind of sanctions?    [Degoricija] We will see when the new Security Council  resolution is passed, which will happen very soon. At any rate,  Messrs. Redman and Galbraith said that the agreement should now  be operationalized, and they will not spend too much time on it  now that the agreements have been signed. Namely, we are in the  "sign it or leave it" stage.    [Crnjakovic] Who will have civilian authority in the  protected areas?    [Degoricija] In the first 14 days it will be UNPROFOR, along  the whole length of the separation line, but, at the same time,  200 policemen will be organized on both the Croatian and the  Serb sides. These policemen will bear the marks of the  international community, and they will be supposed to prevent  illegal actions; any crime, any unallowed action. They will act  at the invitation of UNPROFOR in the area within a kilometer on  each side of the demarcation line. No more than 50 policemen can  be in one zone.    [Crnjakovic] Who will select them?    [Degoricija] Each side will give their list to UNPROFOR.  UNPROFOR can erase a certain name or the entire list, or cross  somebody off later if they carry out impermissible actions.    [Crnjakovic] But that means that, for instance, Serb war  criminals can be on the list.    [Degoricija] No. UNPROFOR determines who will be entrusted  with the task.    [Crnjakovic] Where will our army be?    [Degoricija] The infantry forces will withdraw 1 km from the  frontline on each side. I have already explained the issue of  the heavy weapons to the representatives.    [Crnjakovic] You said that the third stage was the political  solution to the Serb issue in Croatia. Has that not been solved  by passing the Constitutional Law on Minority Rights? Is that  the most difficult part of the job?    [Degoricija] Everybody considers it to be the most difficult  problem, but I do not. I believe that the most difficult part  of the job was the stage of the preparations and the signing of  the cease-fire agreement. It was the precondition for sitting  down at the green table and discussing the political solution  without being burdened by the war option.  <H5>  The Six-Month Deadline </H5>   [Crnjakovic] When will the political solution be reached?    [Degoricija] I think that the deadline is six months, which  is how long the UNPROFOR mandate has been extended for. If we  do not reach it by then, the mandate will have to be extended  again, for which the world has neither the willingness or the  patience.    [Crnjakovic] The world does not, but do the local Serbs?  They have often counted on this stalling.    [Degoricija] This may have been the case earlier, but no  longer. If they had not been prepared for a political solution,  they would not have sat down at the table and signed the  cease-fire agreement. I think that they have the intention and  the willingness to achieve peace through political means. The  Serbs are prepared for a political solution.    [Crnjakovic] Without new conditions and blackmail?    [Degoricija] I think so, although I would not rule out the  possibility of small corrections being made.    [Crnjakovic] We will not talk of a historical agreement, but  I will ask you a very specific question: Will the refugees soon  return to Glina, Petrinja, Vukovar....?    [Degoricija] Absolutely!    [Crnjakovic] When?    [Degoricija] I firmly believe that it will happen within the  next six months.</p>

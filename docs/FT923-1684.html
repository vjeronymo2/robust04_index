			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Observer: Fruit standard David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, has a suggestion for Norman Lamont as he hammers out his new 'British' economic policy. The government's implacable opposition to granting independence to the Bank of England, combined with its continued desire to target the exchange rate, really leaves it with only one solution, the American economist argues. The pound should be pegged forthwith to the New Zealand dollar. Not only does he reckon the British might feel more comfortable aligning themselves to their kith and kin, but he also points out how the Kiwis happen to have on offer one of the world's most independent central banks.</p>

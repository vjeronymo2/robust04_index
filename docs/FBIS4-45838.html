			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: "State Combats IDDs"] </F>   [Text] The State yesterday kicked off a nationwide  campaign to combat iodine deficiency diseases (IDDs).    Citizens around the country got free advice about how to  identify fake from real iodized salt, which prevents the disease  when taken.    In Beijing, officials set up consulting centres downtown and  in rural districts where IDD is a threat.    And at the Beijing Children's Hospital, people crowded in to  get free information.    The China Salt Industrial Corporation provided samples of  fake and substandard iodized salt, while State Councillor Peng  Peiyun, State officials and UN representatives at the event  urged people to take iodized salt and called for a crackdown on  fake products.    Several companies donated 1 million yuan ($115,000) and  iodized foods to children in rural areas.    IDDs can cause mental retardation and birth defects. They  can also lead to miscarriages and are a cause of infant death.    Scientists say the intelligence quotient of children  affected  by IDDs is often 10 to 15 percentage points lower than their  peers.    Yet the diseases can easily be prevented by consuming a  small  amount of iodine, a common additive in salt.    IDDs are common in 1,762 counties, 62.2 per cent of the  country's total, according to a Ministry of Public Health report.    An estimated 400 million Chinese live in high-incidence  districts. The figure accounts for 40 percent of the world's  population threatened by IDDs.    In Beijing, IDDs affect 5 million people in 175 towns in 11  districts and counties.    Still, China has made enormous progress since the early  1950s. The number of patients has decreased from 35 million in  the 1950s to 8 million, thanks to a better supply of salt and  iodine pills.    But IDDs have made a comeback in recent years. Last year a  survey of 12,000 children aged seven to 14 in Miyun County  showed that goitre cases rose to 6 percent from 1.15 percent in  1988.    Medical experts attribute the jump to an increase in  uniodized salt on the market.    An investigation of 2,309 batches of iodized salt in Beijing  in 1992 showed that only 52 percent met State standards. A  third of people threatened by IDDs failed to consume enough  iodized salt. Many unknowingly had bought cheap--and  fake--imitations.    In the past four months, Beijing officials uncovered 29 salt  smuggling cases and confiscated 500 tons of the product.    China hopes to eradicate IDDs by the year 2000.    Yesterday's activities received support from five State  ministries and administrations.    Local public health departments in other parts of the  country  also sponsored educational activities.</p>

During an inspection of the provincial capital of Fuzhou and  Xiamen city from February 3 to 5, Zhu said the zone has made  great progress in infrastructure construction since 1992.    "This has laid a sound foundation for the zone's future  development and construction, as well as for Xiamen's further  development," he told local officials.    As a pioneer in opening to the outside world, Fujian  Province  has undergone great changes and scored tremendous achievements  in reforms and economic growth, he said.    While visiting the Taijiang farmers' market in Fuzhou, he  praised Fujian Province for paying heed to the farming sector  and vegetable production.    Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful supplies  of  non-staple food, especially vegetables, to the satisfaction of  consumers, he said.    "I think this will help create a relaxed environment for  reforms and economic expansion in Fujian this year," said Zhu,  who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau  of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.    As a result of the taxation reform begun this year, about 28  percent of state-owned businesses have shouldered a slightly  heavier tax burden, he told local government officials and  business executives.    He also expressed the hope that these businesses will  further  improve management, cut back on expenses and lower production  costs, rather than raise prices of their products.    While visiting the Haicang Investment Zone, the vice-premier  extended Spring Festival greetings to all workers at  construction sites.    Speaking of the zone's development in the next phase, he  called for faster construction of a power plant, a coal terminal  and other facilities and for efforts to further improve the  investment environment.</p>

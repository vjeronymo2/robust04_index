			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Not just bums on seats - Michael Arditti on why the audience's role is so crucial to both actor and playwright SHOULD YOU ever visit an actor after a performance, do not be surprised to find your compliments reciprocated. While at first this may seem theatrical gush - after all you have been sitting still while he's been sweating Shakespeare - if you turn up on a later, less successful night, you may better appreciate what he means. For the audience's role is crucial, as Oscar Wilde acknowledged when, on the first night of Lady Windermere's Fan, he congratulated the audience 'on the great success of your performance, which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do myself.' Such curtain speeches may be a thing of the past, but the old maxim that plays are not written but re-written holds true. And as many contemporary playwrights have found, from Simon Gray to Peter Shaffer, the audience is their final collaborator. So although we can hardly claim royalties, it is clear that we have a validating role over and above the routine dispensation of applause. Michael Frayn is another to have learned from this collective wisdom when the six-week run at the Lyric Hammersmith prompted the changes which ensured Noises Off a four-year life in the West End. Ironically, the reverse occured with its companion piece, Look Look, set across the footlights in an audience, when the actual audience stayed away in droves. Look Look's demise sent shock-waves through theatreland, but the subsequent spate of West End obituaries proved premature. For not even a playwright of Mr Frayn's distinction could be expected to mould the disparate characters who composed his typical audience - the family party, adulterous couple, elderly gay, middle-aged mother and daughter - into a cohesive whole. But if his attempt was an honourable failure, it is one most managers and directors fail even to make. It may be a fatal omission. So much of the energy of our post-war theatrical expansion has gone into redefining the bond between actor and audience: reshaping auditoria to replace the outmoded social and aesthetic relationships of the proscenium arch, that little has been left for the equally pressing task of establishing bonds within audiences themselves. When managements do consider audiences, it is generally in terms of attendances. Thus the arrival of the mega-musical becomes a cause for celebration, even though it raises the theatrical stakes at the expense of genuine engagement. Audiences become mere applause fodder. Increasingly, managements play the TV card. Everything is done to make audiences feel at home. The frisson of theatre is reduced to the reassurance of the small screen, as familiar faces are promoted, albeit in unfamiliar guise. This can have obvious benefits, as even the pioneering Bush theatre found when Kevin Whateley ('TV's Inspector Morse]') recently appeared there, but more often it can backfire as with the irate couple who loudly left The Entertainer, complaining that Peter Bowles was playing Archie Rice and not Richard de Vere. Of course it is vital to attract a new audience. Even the Haymarket had its stuffiness knocked out with the Dawn French fans in singlets and jeans rather than twinsets and pearls. And yet this can prove a mixed blessing. The increased chattering, bleeping and even mobile phone calls in the stalls attest to an audience not so much at home in the theatre as behaving as if it were still at home. Though so far we have been spared such sights as the Madonna fans who arrived halfway through her Broadway performance in Speed the Plow and at the end sat back and waited for it to begin again. Such a response negates both the power and purpose of theatre. It is a quintessentially communal experience where dramas are played out on the public stage. And unless managements respect this role rather than trying to lure audiences with the spectacle of the cinema or lull them with the familiarity of TV, its uniqueness will he lost. Similarly, if the audience is to play its role in the theatre and the theatre in society, it can no longer remain the province of the privileged few. For though it is heartening to recall that more people go to the theatre each week than to professional league football, it is still a predominantly white middle-class activity. This is a loss to all concerned - and even to those unconcerned; for the wider the audience, the richer will be its response. A disproportionate audience can grossly distort a performance, as anyone who watched a house full of yuppies turn Caryl Churchill's Serious Money at the Wyndhams from a critique of city practice into a celebration of its own excess, can confirm. The experience of seeing a play about racism in a predominantly white audience can be still more disquieting. When Ma Rainey's Black Bottom played at the Cottesloe to rows of white faces, the audience seemed to reinforce the segregated world of the play. Whereas in the very different racial mix of the Theatre Royal Stratford East, black people laughing at racist lines in Tunde Ikoli's Scrape off the Black liberated their white neighbours to confront their own prejudice and fear. But then the Theatre Royal consistently offers a model of successful audience engagement, as the citation for their recent Prudential award attests. 'Community theatre which should be a tautology, remains far too often an unrealised ideal; and yet, at Stratford, it infuses every aspect of their work. In this they uphold the tradition of their founder, Joan Littlewood, who on being questioned before a performance as to why she was scrubbing the foyer steps, tartly replied: 'I'm expecting company, aren't you?'' In most theatres, audiences are not company but simply customers, which in turn prevents them from fully engaging with either one another or the stage  -but, at Stratford, the diversity of the audience is matched by the strength of its response. And although I would be the last to encourage patrons at the National to shout 'Behind you]' to Hamlet as Claudius and Polonius hide in the arras, or 'Nice one, Lopakhin' as the new owner of the cherry orchard announces his prize, the highly vocal Stratford audience reveals an energy and enthusiasm far too often ignored. Audience engagement is by no means the same as audience participation. After all, actors do weeks of exercises to bind them together, while the crash course of a three-hour performance can leave an audience with a deep sense of distrust (I still have nightmares of a Bournemouth matinee where I was plucked protesting onto the stage to conga with a six-foot-four Carmen Miranda). Nevertheless, if the audience is truly to play its part, it is essential to harness that collective energy which remains the theatre's unique aspect and most precious resource.</p>

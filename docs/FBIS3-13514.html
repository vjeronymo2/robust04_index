			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Iran's Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati in  an interview with the Arabic weekly AL-WASAT and daily AL-SHARQ,  based in Qatar, released simultaneously yesterday, has once  again stressed Tehran's desire to resolve the misunderstanding  over the three Iranian islands in the Gulf.    This is not for the first time that the Islamic Republic of  Iran has spoken of its inclination for talks with the officials  of the UAE [United Arab Emirates], its neighbor in the south of  the Persian Gulf region. As the history of the case shows,  since the postponement of talks between Tehran and the UAE  concerning the dispute over Abu Musa island, which were  scheduled to be pursued last September simultaneous with the  Tehran visit of the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs,  Iran has welcomed any move that may remove the ambiguities  existing in this regard.    Therefore, in the opinion of political observers, the  Iranian  foreign minister's invitation to the UAE officials to travel to  Tehran and resumption of bilateral talks on the disputed matters  in fact is rated as the reiteration of Tehran's postures  vis-a-vis regional issues. The move is also viewed as Iran's  firm determination to preserve stability and to bolster security  in the region.    It is, however, indisputable that from the viewpoint of  Tehran, the rift over the disputed islands is resolvable through  direct contacts, and that acceptable results can be obtained  through holding bilateral talks. Despite this, it appears that  the subject of dispute between Iran and the UAE at certain  junctures has been affected by the infusion [as heard] and doubt  caused by Western political circles, thus being led to a  direction repugnant to the recognized international principles  and reciprocal good neighborliness among regional states. This  trend has not only failed to help resolve the matter in the  past, but with the assertion of controversial subject the  slowing of the pace of talks between these two countries and  finally their severance.    At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on the fact  that tension in the region is not in the interest of anyone, has  constantly sought that regional states, by duly discerning the  existing realities and conditions at greater depth, consider  ways for resolving their issues on a regional basis. In such  case the neighboring states are expected to amicably settle any  dispute that may exist between Iran and the UAE. In this  regard, Iran thinks the renewed visits by the officials of the  two countries and the resumption of bilateral talks as the most  logical solution for both sides. In particular, it appears at  present that in view of the general understanding which governs  Iran's cooperation with the Persian Gulf littoral states,  attainment of a peaceful solution to the dispute with the UAE is  not something problematic and remote from expectations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski: </F> "Polish East Policy; We Want Warmer Relations With Russia"]    [Text] We want to open a new chapter in Poland's  East policy. This requirement results from both the changes  that have taken place in the area of the former USSR and the  changes in our relations with the Russian Federation.    The main subject of the policy that has been carried out so  far was the rapid establishment of equal relations with the 15  newly independent states. The activity of Poland focused on:    --establishing diplomatic and treaty relations with them;    --creating foundations for regular political dialogue by  establishing contacts at various levels;    --taking steps aimed at the withdrawal of former Soviet  troops from Poland;    --concluding economic agreements;    --fostering processes of democratization and the building of  a market economy;    --explaining the responsibility of the repression apparatus  of the former USSR for crimes committed against Poles, and for  deportations;    --protecting the sites of the martyrdom of Poles and  monuments of Polish culture.    We have made considerable progress in these areas by  creating  the foundations for an East policy of the fully sovereign  Republic of Poland.    The tasks of the East policy.    We are currently facing new challenges and new  possibilities.  To measure up to them, we must focus our East policy on the  following three tasks:    First, we seek to develop comprehensive and good relations  with those states which are of particular importance from the  point of view of our political interests, as well as the  interests of security and economy. The necessity of making a  choice here also results from the fact that we have only limited  resources at our disposal. For obvious reasons, priorities  include, first of all, the neighboring states; the entire group  of states, in which we are particularly interested, consists of  the following: Russia, Belarus, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan,  and Moldova.    Russia and Ukraine occupy a special place due to their  economic potential, as well as their political and military  significance: the development of our relations with these states  will spell either the success or failure of our policy.    The second task is backing up political and military  stability in the region. Since the threats are of a regional  character, that is, they do not pertain exclusively to Poland,  our policy should be as synchronized as is possible with the  policies of our western, northern, and southern neighbors. As  much as possible, Poland should be the initiator and an active  participant in joint activities; it should take on the role of a  regional "stability exporter." It is authorized and obliged to  do this by the maturity--outstanding in the region--of  democratic establishments, economic dynamism, and respect for  civil rights.    Third, we aim to create new possibilities for taking  advantage of economic opportunities. This task must be  approached realistically, which means that we must see that the  changes which are taking place in the area of the former USSR  are resulting in new possibilities and opportunities for Poland;  however, dangers are still prevalent today. In addition, if we  want to be able to take advantage of the chances to make a  profit in the future, we must take certain steps and pay some  costs today.  <H5>  Bilateral Political Relations </H5>   Poland treats all of its neighbors to the east, as well as  other countries, as fully independent and sovereign states. It  is in our vital interest to see them strengthen their national  identity as well as their democratic and promarket  transformations. This does not mean, however, that we will be  against any close relations among those states, unless their  establishment is accompanied by violence, dictate, or the  violation of democratic procedures, we treat them as natural  processes which are in accordance with the international legal  order.    We want a substantially warmer climate in our relations with  Russia. We will intensify and extend the scope of diplomatic  consultations in bilateral and international issues, including  those concerning security and disarmament. We are ready for  intense contacts at the level of governments and parliaments; we  will also create possibilities for frequent regular  extragovernmental contacts. We seek to broaden the scope of the  exchange of information and experience, especially in the area  of local democracy and individual agriculture. We intend to  propose a joint international initiative which will aim at  coordinating the fight against organized crime. In the  international arena, we would like to be of assistance in  regulating the status of Russian minorities in line with  European standards. We will support the membership of Russia,  as well as other states of the former USSR, in the Council of  Europe after they accept the formal conditions. We hope that  the Russian Federation will participate in the "Partnership for  Peace" initiative. This will enable us to intensify our  dialogue on military issues and to take the initiative in  multilateral practice and training with the participation of  Russia, the states of the region, and NATO members.    The "lower" border of the policy of openness and  friendliness  in the relations with Russia is respect for the fundamental  strategic option of Polish foreign policy, which is  participation in three Western establishments: the European  Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU].    In our relations with Ukraine we will take similar steps as  in the case of Russia: steps aimed at extending the  comprehensive neighborly cooperation. Their special dimension  will be the establishment of Polish cultural agencies in Kiev  and Lvov, as well as the building of milieus friendly to Poland  around them.    However, the fundamental issue in our political relations is  obviously the issue of Ukraine's independence, which presents a  strategic dimension for Poland. The recently concluded  trilateral agreement among Ukraine, Russia, and the United  States is favorable for the consolidation of this independence.  On the one hand, we will encourage Ukraine to implement this  agreement fully; we will also want more vigorous political and  economic forms; on the other hand, we will take action to help  this state achieve a deserved position in international  politics, a position that would better correspond to its  potential. In particular, we would like one of the agencies of  the CSCE to be relocated to Kiev; we would like Ukraine to be  included to the projects that are implemented within the  framework of the Central European Initiative; we would also like  dialogue on some elements of the Kravchuk plan [not further  identified]. We also expect intensive military-political  cooperation in the "Partnership for Peace" with Ukraine.    We are especially alarmed by the statements concerning  "particular interests" and a "special role" for Russia in  Ukraine. We do not accept them and we believe deeply that  Ukraine's independence is in the long run favorable for the  development of democracy and economy in Russia as well.    In our political relations with the Baltic states, a special  position will be reserved for activities underscoring the  independent existence of these states in the international arena  and supporting the process of gradually including them in  European structures. We expect that very soon the  Polish-Lithuanian treaty will finally be concluded. It will  provide foundations for a rapid development of comprehensive  relations, especially in the area of economic ties. We will pay  special attention to the issue of national minorities, including  the issue of the Polish minority in Lithuania. It is worth  recalling that Poland supports the idea of civil integration of  ethnic minorities, where cultural and lingual autonomy would be  maintained. We do not support political-economic autonomy, but  we agree that the rights of minorities should be respected in  line with the standards of CSCE and the EU. Any act violating  these minimum standards will meet with our forceful response.  Similarly, demands going beyond these standards will not  receive our support or our friendly attitude.    In the development of good-neighborly relations with  Belarus,  we want to place emphasis on long-term activities--first of all  on economic and cultural activities. The example of the latter  is the opening of a diplomatic mission in Minsk. In the case of  Kazakhstan, diplomatic activities will be focused on creating a  positive image of Poland as a friendly state. The main subject  of the consular activities of the embassy, which is being set up  there, is obviously the large Polish community. Finally, in the  case of Moldova, where we are also opening a diplomatic post,  our political cooperation will chiefly be of a multilateral  dimension; our promising economic contacts will be extended.  <H5>  Activities for the Stability of the Region </H5>   The most important task that helps enhance stability in the  region is active contribution toward the building of  all-European security. Good relations with our neighbors to the  east are undoubtedly an important and joint contribution as well.    Poland definitely supports the progressive process of  combining East and West into one whole. This process, however,  does not include and cannot include liquidating the forms of  cooperation that have been present so far, departing from the  fully shaped and freely implemented methods of cooperation,  abandoning the ambition to take part in the ones which seem to  be particularly close.    This process does envision, however, the tightening of  cooperation among states and establishments, as well as  increasingly closer cooperation based on the principle of the  indivisibility of European security. In this process, there is  a role to be played by NATO, the EU, the WEU, the Council of  Europe, and the CSCE. An important place should also be  occupied by the CIS, if it opens up to cooperation with other  structures and, just like them, it is based on democratic  foundations and values.    We all want an efficient, all-European security system. But  it will not appear all of a sudden like some magical illusion.  It will be the result of common efforts and of an evolution  taking place in and among existing structures. We are watching  attentively the changes that are under way. The establishment  of NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council, as well as the  establishment of the WEU Consultative Forum, "Partnership for  Peace," and the prospect of widening these structures--these are  very important steps. They are not about forming new divisions  but about overcoming the old ones. Through our participation in  the "Partnership for Peace" we not only strive for membership in  NATO, but we also want to use this frameworks for cooperation  with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania for the sake of a  common strengthening of security.    Intensifying regional dialogue on security issues is also  desirable. Part of that dialogue is in the form of  consultations, not just within the framework of European and  Euro-Atlantic structures, but also within regional ones, such as  the Visegrad Group or the Council of Baltic States.  Possibilities are emerging for setting in motion a mechanism of  regular, multilateral consultations with the participation of  the states of East and Central Europe which are particularly  sensitive to issues of regional security (such is the intention  of, for example, the consultations among planners from eight  countries of the region which are currently taking place,  including, among others, representatives of Germany, Austria,  and Sweden). We are very thoroughly examining initiatives and  proposals relating to our region's security, including plans by  Balladur and Krawczuk.    Any constructive regional cooperation is a significant  factor  for strengthening security and stability. Cooperation among the  Visegrad Group countries is an example of this kind of  cooperation, in particular the free-trade zone (CEFTA) [Central  European Free Trade Association]. That cooperation, while being  a clear example of understanding and cooperation among countries  going through a period of transformations, is an example for  other countries to follow in terms of how to achieve European  integration.    Bilateral relations obviously contribute greatly to  increasing regional security and cooperation. The partnership  between Poland and Ukraine, which is still taking shape,  provides good evidence of that. The two countries have a  difficult history of mutual relations, but thanks to imagination  and political will, they managed to overcome the rankling  resentments and claims.  <H5>  Economic Cooperation </H5>   Eastern markets are oftentimes portrayed as untapped, mainly  because of a not very active foreign policy geared in only one  direction. While agreeing with the accusation of insufficient  activity, one should at the same time state very clearly, that a  systematic analysis leads to a conclusion that what prevails in  those markets today, is a risk of loss and not a possibility of  profit. One should also very clearly state that the political  and systemwide changes indeed created some big opportunities for  significant and permanent benefits, but they cannot be  implemented soon and without significant investments. One  should also state very clearly that Polish enterprises, both  private and state-owned, will not be able to use this potential  without significant assistance from the state.    The most important dangers linked to the systemwide  transformations and to the uncertain future of the countries of  the former Soviet Union, include: A possibility of using  economic cooperation and commercial exchange for political  goals; destabilization (intended or unintended) of supplies of  raw materials; unfair competition in Poland and in third  markets; systemwide incompatibility and instrumental treatment  of the law; disorganization and mafia activity; and the  destabilization of Polish financial institutions in case of over  involvement in transactions with the East. Perceiving Poland as  a country in an unstable region is also a special kind of  danger. That danger is not linked with Poland's bilateral  relations with the countries of the region, but it may be a  consequence of political and economic instability in the  individual countries, or of conflicts between them.    On the other hand, the most important opportunities which  have opened up at this time in front of Polish entrepreneurs,  include: establishment of foundations for a significant and  permanent capital-related position; achievement of a permanent  position in certain merchandise markets; potentially large  demand for transit services and for mediation in transactions  between Eastern and Western companies; signing of contracts for  significant supplies by state-owned partners; and, finally, the  possibility of importing services, merchandise, and technologies  at prices which are lower than on the world market.    The "Fundamentals of Pro-Export Policies," which were  recently adopted by the government, as well as the listing of  financial resources for that goal in the draft budget for 1994,  mean better possibilities of support by the state for Polish  economic activity in the East. The forms and extent of that  support are still too modest to efficiently enable use of  opportunities and counteraction of dangers. That is why I  intend to suggest to the government that it implement four  programs which will comprise urgently needed measures. We named  these programs: "Contact," "Associates," "Wokulski," and  "Transit."    "Contact" comprises measures supporting contact among  people at all levels and in all aspects, among others making  border crossings more efficient and enlarging them.  "Associates" is a program of measures aimed at establishing  mutual capital relations which would render economic cooperation  more permanent. "Wokulski" is a program of measures which will  support Polish exporters of merchandise and services. Finally,  the "Transit" program covers measures aimed at improving and  enlarging the infrastructure which would make it possible to  profit from Poland's geographical location. A fifth program,  which we would like to implement, is named "Market and  Democracy" and it will cover both governmental and  extragovernmental drafts supporting the development of market  and democracy in the countries covered by East policies.    Specific measures within these programs which have already  been identified, will be subjected to interministry  consultations followed by their presentation in front of the  Council of Ministers. Their implementation does not require  significant additional financial resources this year.  <H5>  Coordination of East Policies </H5>   Most of the tasks being planned within the framework of East  policies, will be performed by Polish diplomats. In particular,  we will submit several international proposals over the next few  months, such as an East European Commercial Initiative, a  Consultative Committee for Democratic Transformations and Market  Reforms, an Association for Prevention of Organized Crime, an  international data bank on investment possibilities, a draft for  a trilateral institute of Polish-Ukrainian-Belarusian culture,  and the establishment of an informal forum for regular meetings  among leaders and political elites of East and Central European  countries. We will also undertake many bilateral initiatives.  We are in the process of widening the network of our agencies  in the East. With regard to diplomats, both in the headquarters  and in their missions, we must prepare them better for the  implementation of tasks envisaged by the programs.    We must also coordinate our measures better and more  efficiently, both within the Foreign Affairs Ministry and in the  entire administration. With that goal in mind, I will establish  in the near future the post of plenipotentiary for East policies  within the Foreign Affairs Ministry; he will exercise  supervision over subsequent work on the programs and their  implementation. In terms of the state as a whole, to minimize  the syndrome of "ministry policies," which is unfortunately so  common in Poland, I will propose before the government the  establishment of an East Policy Council, the goal of which would  be: Consultation of proposals for resolving specific issues,  exercise of operative supervision over the implementation of  initiatives and programs, and consultation on ways of financing  programs while using the resources which are spread over various  institutions. Apart from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the  council should also include representatives of the President's  Office, the Office of the Council of Ministers, the Foreign  Economic Cooperation Ministry, and other institutions.  <H5>  Danger </H5>   I think that Poland's activity vis-a-vis its Eastern  neighbors defined and organized this way, will serve the  interests of Poland, its neighbors, and the entire region well  and efficiently. We want to implement the activity with  enthusiasm and openness. But for the policy to bring about the  desired results, we must encounter a similar enthusiasm and  openness on the part of our partners.    We have no reason to doubt their good intentions; we can  feel  they have a lot of cordiality and a will to undertake joint  measures. We all feel that, as my Russian colleague Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of  Poland's independence , right now we have an "historic chance to  build genuinely friendly relations, without anybody dictating,  without paternalism, without ideological patterns and false  embraces."    Nations which differ between them and which respect the  differences, are still friendly toward one another; if there  were no differences between them, then they would merge into  just one nation, and if they did not respect the differences,  then they would be enemies. Poles differ from their neighbors.  Our neighbors differ among themselves. We can see those  differences, we respect and appreciate them. Our culture and  identity have used them for ages. We are ready to become  friends.    This idea could be endangered by an intolerance by one of  the  countries. We can see signs of such intolerance in Russia. We  are afraid of intolerance. Right now, it is the biggest danger  to the development of friendly ties in our region.    The Russian Federation is today a superpower going through  transformations which is not capable of completely meeting or  efficiently protecting some global ambitions which had been  aroused in the past. That facilitates the emergence of the  "besieged fortress" syndrome, which is a result of the  reluctance of part of the political and military elites to  change traditional ways of thinking and acting, the reference  point of which is Russia as an empire. Consequently, the  concept of a strong superpower, which Russia is and will be,  becomes synonymous with the idea of neoimperialism. That is why  the neoimperial direction in Russian foreign policy must be  regarded as a real danger.    On the other hand, one would have to have bad faith not to  see the positive changes in Russia and the progress in that  country's hard but consistent path toward democracy, a market,  and the people's prosperity. We believe that, just like other  nations, Russians are aware that building a power and an empire  has high costs, and that it is taking place at the expense of  their personal poverty. They will not allow for politicians to  return permanently to past goals and slogans. They demonstrated  that during the most recent elections, in which only a minority  expressed support for the imperial slogans of nationalistic  groups.    It is that minority that we fear. But we are optimistic. We  believe in the majority: Our Russian friends, Russian democrats.</p>

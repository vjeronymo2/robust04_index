			<p>CSO     [Text] Geneva, March 4. India has cautioned the U.N. Human  Rights Commission [UNHRC] about the threats posed to sovereign  states by across-the-border sponsorship of terrorism and urged  the global community to take necessary steps to enhance  cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, reports PTI.    "The need is to take cognisance of the urgency before it is  too late. And to ensure that this recognition is made actionable  without any delay," the Indian delegation has told the session  of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.    Sharing with international community India's experience of  the phenomenon of terrorism "which today looms as a spectre over  the world and in its various forms and manifestations has come  to signify a pervasive and organised threat to human rights in  their widest form," Mr. Madhukar Gupta of the Indian delegation  told the commission that "terrorism is now getting support from  across international orders."    Mr. Gupta asked: "Is the international community going to  continue to look on as a mute spectator, even as human rights  slogans and fora are being used to cover the sponsorship and  practices of terrorism?"    He said terrorism as witnessed in India was also a direct  attempt to destroy the very structures and institutions of  democracy, which alone provides the surest basis and foundation  for civil society and the protection of human rights."    Mr. Gupta said "we have witnessed direct and targetted  attacks on a massive scale on politicians, the judiciary, the  press and government officials."    "These are the fundamental institutions of governance and  the  pillars of democracy. If these were to be destroyed, we could  only have a situation where the law of the jungle would replace  the rule of the law, where propaganda and disinformation on  which terrorism thrives, would replace legitimate expression by  the people through representative institutions and the media,  and mechanisms for grievance redressal would become dependent  upon the whims of those who promulgate dictats".    He said terrorism is also being used for the blatant spread  of fundamentalism and creation of social and religious cleavages  and divides in countries and societies. This has resulted in  examples of "ethnic cleansing" and large-scale displacement of  people in Jammu and Kashmir [J&amp;K].    "We have witnessed efforts to change the very demographic  profile of one particular part of the state -- Kashmir valley."    "Targetted and brutal attacks on members of minority  community there have forced a massive exodus of thousands of  people from their homes. All this has been accompanied by  blatant attempts to whip up religious emotions and frenzy and to  distort and radicalise religion, which has been resulted in the  destruction of hundreds of schools providing modern, secular  education, thus jeopardising the future of hundreds of thousands  of children," Mr. Gupta said.    Addressing the session, Dr. Shakti Bhan, a member of the  delegation of All-India Women's Conference, apprised the  international community of the plight of the minority community  in Jammu and Kashmir.    Dr. Bhan, a leader of the women's wing of Panun Kashmir,  said  "we are fighting a battle for freedom from terror, freedom from  religious bigotry and fundamentalism which Pakistan is seeking  to impose upon us, freedom from hatred and prejudice, and  freedom from the fear of the gun which Pakistan is seeking to  spread in our area."    She said "we want our thousands of years old culture of  human  unity and dignity back from the clutches of those who want to  enslave us and are trying to hold us in terror."    Dr. Bhan urged the international community to "help us in  this endeavour by pressurising Pakistan to stop proliferating  terrorism, for on this depends the return of peace to our  troubled paradise."    Meanwhile, some pro-Pakistan non-governmental organisations  (NGO) have stepped up India-baiting by raising the bogey of  rights violations in Kashmir, as it became clear today that  Islamabad may go ahead with its resolution on Jammu and Kashmir  at the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) session here.    Spearheading the tirade on Kashmir was the International  Educational Development (IED), a U.S. based NGO known for its  pro-Pakistan stance.    The IED delegation raised the question of right of  self-determination for the people of Kashmir.</p>

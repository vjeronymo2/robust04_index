			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 26, INA--French Foreign Ministry said an  official Iraqi delegation is currently in France for talks with  various French companies.    A Ministry spokesman admitted that this visit by the Iraqi  delegation, which is composed of petroleum experts, was not the  first to be made by an Iraqi group and noted that all nations  had legitimate right to do so.    The spokesman added that the delegation's visit came only  one  day after the meeting between Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special  Commission, and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    Ekeus' current visit to Paris falls within a tour of many  European capitals prior to the July Security Council discussions  of the UN resolutions on Iraq.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / HK government attacked HONG KONG'S government was yesterday attacked by local legislators for running a secretive administration and for failing to disclose details of its plans to build a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.18bn) international airport, which has become the subject of a diplomatic confrontation with China. During a long and tense debate on the project in the colony's Legislative Council, the government was accused of being 'draconian and irresponsible' and 'out of touch with people on the streets'. This marked a significant escalation in domestic terms of the issue, with the Hong Kong government becoming the butt of public criticism instead of Peking. The diplomatic confrontation has arisen because China wants to establish a measure of control over the project and over other issues before it regains sovereignty in Hong Kong in 1997. Talks initiated by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, during a visit to Peking failed last weekend. The Hong Kong government is now considering whether to try to reopen talks. Yesterday's debate was initiated by Mr Martin Lee, leader of the colony's main pro-democracy party, who arrives in London today to urge British politicians to stop Hong Kong giving way to China's demands for a measure of control.</p>

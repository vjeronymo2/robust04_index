			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: The Prince's plan to restore the spirit to our age - Architecture Who needs a new school of architecture? This must have been the unspoken question on the lips of all the guests at St. James's Palace last Thursday when the Prince of Wales moved from criticism to construction with his announcement of the establishment of his own new Institute of Architecture. The Prince, standing against the glowing damask walls of the palace, made a long, sometimes strange, and remarkable speech as much about his own deepest personal beliefs as about architecture. This kind of thinking affects different people in different ways. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects told me that he was very moved by it. In fact, he welcomed the idea of a new school as a way of healing some of the breaches that have grown up, not just between the public and the profession but also between the various branches of the building and planning business. Prince Charles is not shy when it comes to facing up to what he considers to be the arrogance of some professionals. He has long despised the separateness of professionals from the realities of life. How many architects have ever tasted life in one of their tower blocks? How many architects have enjoyed a journey in a urine stained lift to a flat that is running with condensation and has no opening windows? How far does this professional remoteness come about through the weaknesses in architectural education? It is surely a reflection of many of the beliefs that have been promulgated for the last 50 years in schools of architecture throughout the world:the belief that history does not count,the belief that functionalism is the most important aspect of architectural design, and the certainty that the architect is always right. The Prince of Wales would say that it is all symptomatic of the spiritual malaise of our times. As he said: 'We are told that our contemporary built environment must reflect the 'spirit of our age'. But what concerns me most of all is that we are succeeding in creating an 'age without spirit'.' He was brave enough to expose the fact that what he feels is missing from much modern architecture has nothing to do with style but much to do with content. Content, for the Prince and for many others, has to do with meaning. This is where we get on to sticky ground. Meaning in architecture does have to do with the shared values of society and these can as easily be material as spiritual. The problem with materialism is that it is a bit like Chinese food, it can fill you up and still leave you unsatisfied. I think this is what the Prince means. The architecture that we like does fulfil our appetites on more than just a functional level. As the Prince said, 'the kind of buildings that tend to appeal to the human heart, and which make us feel at home, are a very specific range of buildings; very particular in style and organisation and physical character. These are, in fact, the buildings which we have always loved. They include, of course, all the great traditional architectures of the past - enormously varied as these are. But they also include new forms of architecture, based on new materials, new ways of building, new forms of technology.' It is perhaps appropriate for princes to initiate widespread and general discussions - to act as a catalysts to bring together people of a wide range of disciplines to discover the common ground. This is the task that the Prince has now handed on to his own institute - and to a richly varied academic faculty. They will have quite a task and, according to the newly-appointed director of studies, Dr Brian Hanson, they are taking things relatively slowly. The first course to be launched at the Prince's institute, at its premises in London's Regent's Park, will be a one year foundation course in architecture and the building arts that starts in October. This will be an introduction to all aspects of building and architecture for students with A-levels who feel that they want to pursue a career concerned with building. It will be both a theoretical and practical course with an emphasis on crafts, hand skills and community projects. A considerable amount of the teaching of the foundation course will take place away from Regent's Park, either in architects' offices or on development sites. This is to bring students in to immediate contact with the realities of contemporary building. In 1993, the institute will be accepting students for postgraduate courses, which will lead to an equivalent qualification to the RIBA Part II examinations. In subsequent years, the institute will run the full range of undergraduate architectural courses to produce fully-fledged architects. But there is another side to the institute that has nothing to do with academic or practical training. This is the public role that is planned for it. The idea is that the London premises will hold exhibitions, lectures and conferences and in many ways fulfil the long-felt need that London has had for an architecture centre. In the long term there is a real chance that the institute will move into Somerset House, where it will be well placed to serve as a venue for the education and enlightenment of laymen concerned with architecture and the environment. I think that it is right for such a school and centre to be very responsive to the layman. In that way it will be very different from the new Architecture Foundation - a group principally composed of well known architects and developers - who will be lobbying Mr Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for the environment, on February 6 urging him to set up a rival architecture centre in London. The Prince has himself provided the answer to the question do we need another school of architecture when he referred in his inaugural speech to the damaging effects of materialistic dogma and his belief in a great tradition that should be cherished and handed on to future generations. These missing elements in much contemporary architecture can be taught and encouraged to flourish. To achieve this the Prince now has his school. Next he needs first rate support and, above all, first rate students.</p>

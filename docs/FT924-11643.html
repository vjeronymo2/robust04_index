			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Lebanese money-changers cash in on the 'last-hope premier' THE appointment on Thursday night of Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi billionaire, as the Lebanese premier was widely celebrated in Beirut and prompted an immediate 13 per cent rise in the value of the Lebanese pound, to LPounds 1900 to the dollar. So great was the optimism inspired by the appointment that banks and money-changers closed early yesterday when they ran out of notes to trade. Many Lebanese see Mr Hariri, a self-made banking and construction tycoon, as the last hope for an economy plagued by 100 per cent inflation, 30 per cent unemployment and damage from the 1975-90 civil war estimated at more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn). Mr Hariri, 48 and a Sunni Moslem, wants to replace the traditional leaders who have dominated post-war cabinets with more qualified and dynamic technocrats. Unlike the majority of Lebanese politicians, he played no part in the war. But he financed the 1989 peace conference in Taif, Saudi Arabia, which ended the conflict. Aides say he contributes Dollars 87m to Lebanese charities annually. Since 1989 Mr Hariri has bankrolled the Lebanese presidency and the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR). The CDR has restored basic services to the capital and promoted a controversial Dollars 2.65bn renovation plan for the ruins of downtown Beirut. Mr Hariri has a personal fortune estimated at Dollars 3bn and is listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the 100 richest men in the world. His Mediterranee Investment Group holds 35 per cent of the new Banque Francaise de l'Orient, formed by this week's merger of the Indosuez group, Mediterranee, Al Saudi and Libano-Francaise banks. He has substantial real estate holdings in France and the US. For Lebanese locked into a rigid social hierarchy, Mr Hariri's rise from a modest Sidon farming family to vast wealth and the country's premiership is nothing short of astounding. After studying business administration at Beirut's Arab University he emigrated to Saudi Arabia in 1965 where he worked first as a mathematics teacher, then as an accountant. In 1976 he won the favour of the Saudi royal family by building the Taif Intercontinental Hotel in just six months, in time for the Islamic summit. Mr Hariri was at that time a sub-contractor for the French company OGER, which he later purchased. He proceeded to build palaces, hospitals and conference centres throughout Saudi Arabia and recently completed a complex for President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. The new premier maintains good relations with Damascus; his friendship with Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, responsible for Syrian policy in Lebanon, will prove useful in coming weeks as the government negotiates the withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon. Both King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Assad met Mr Hariri shortly before his appointment. His association with the Saudi royal family may attract badly needed investment from the Gulf, but it could prove a source of friction with Iranian-backed Shia Moslem fundamentalists in Lebanon. Twelve Lebanese fundamentalist deputies were among the few parliamentarians who opposed his nomination.</p>

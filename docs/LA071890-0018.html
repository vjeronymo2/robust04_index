			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DOUBLE SHOOTING INVOLVING OFFICER REMAINS MYSTERY  </P> <P> San Diego police had no new information Tuesday about what caused the shooting  of an off-duty rookie officer and another man because both are still  hospitalized and unable to talk.  </P> <P> Officer David Mitchell, 36, was in serious but stable condition with wounds in  the chest and both arms.  </P> <P> A San Diego man, Stanley Vance, 31, who also goes by the name Stanley Wheeler,  is under guard at UCSD Medical Center in serious condition with a gunshot wound  in the chest. Both lungs were pierced by the bullet.  </P> <P> Wheeler is being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, said a  spokeswoman at the County Jail. Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo said Vance also is  wanted on an outstanding warrant.  </P> <P> The incident began at about 7:50 p.m. Monday in a parking lot at Euclid and  Olvera avenues in Southeast San Diego, witnesses told police. According to the  witnesses, Mitchell got out of his brown Dodge Colt and approached a green  Chevy pickup parked nearby, said Ybarrondo.  </P> <P> There was an exchange of shots and Mitchell staggered about 50 feet, then  collapsed in front of the Imperial Fish Market while calling for help.  </P> <P> The pickup started north, made a U-turn and then went south on Euclid Avenue  before crashing into a concrete wall about six blocks away and going into a  yard on Euclid Avenue and Norfolk Street in National City, Ybarrondo said.  Officers discovered Vance in the pickup when they arrived.  </P> <P> Ybarrondo said Mitchell had a 9-millimeter, semiautomatic pistol with him.  Mitchell, who graduated from the police academy in April, was recently assigned  as a patrol officer downtown.  </P></p>

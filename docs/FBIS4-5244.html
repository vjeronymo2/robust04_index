			<p>BFN     [Text] HANOI, April 7 (AFP) -- Swedish Prime Minister Carl  Bildt accused Hanoi Thursday of being "unduly slow" in improving  its human rights situation, following what he indicated were  difficult talks on the issue with Vietnamese officials.    "We have to use that phrase `a frank and open discussion' on  this matter," Bildt told a press conference here using the  diplomatic euphemism for a strong disagreement.    Bildt said he had told Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet that  "dialogue with Vietnam on human rights was making unduly slow  progress" and urged him to look again at a number of cases  raised by Sweden.    "He said he would do this, but it remains to be seen if it  has any effects," Bildt said, adding that Sweden would "stand  firm on the issue".    Bildt is the first Swedish premier to visit Vietnam despite  close links between the two countries, which established  diplomatic relations in 1969, long before most Western nations  did so.    His visit has focused on "broadening a relationship based on  aid" and moving it towards trade and investment, he said.    Sweden -- which has given a total of 1.2 billion US dollars  in aid to Vietnam -- would no longer hand over large sums of  money and then decide how it was to be used, but would instead  target areas that would help the country's economic reforms, he  said.    Mistakes had been made in Sweden's aid policies in Vietnam,  Bildt said. The Swedish-funded Bai Bang paper mill northwest of  Hanoi has become a development white elephant, draining away 450  million dollars and only running at a fraction of its capacity.    "Some of the countries around the world that have received  the most economic assistance have faired the worst," Bildt said,  while many countries that had received no aid "had achieved  spectacular economic and social results".    "There is no reason whatsoever why Vietnam, given the right  policies, should not be able to achieve what other nations in  the region have managed to achieve," the fervently  free-marketeer premier said.    Bildt said he believed he was witnessing "what might come to  be called the start of the real Vietamese revolution."    Dismissing a suggestion that Vietnam might be disappointed  by  his stand after years of almost unconditional support from the  Scandanavian nation, Bildt said he wanted to build ties based on  business and economic cooperation.    "There was a time when countries signed communiques and  pledged eternal friendship but it doesn't work that way in the  modern world," he said.    Sweden has been slow to capitalise on its position here,  ranking 17th among international investors, with projects worth  60 million US dollars. Trade has been minimal, reaching only 10  million US dollars last year.    Bildt, who visited Ho Chi Minh City before arriving in  Hanoi,  held talks with several other officials including President Le  Duc Anh and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.    He is to leave for Hong Kong Friday on the last stop of an  Asian tour that has taken in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

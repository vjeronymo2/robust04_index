			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Synyakova under the "Election Marathon" </F> rubric: "Failure is the Mother of Success"]    [Text]    In its desire to unite representatives of various  political forces, even if during a round table discussion, the  VECHERNIY KYYIV editorial board, unfortunately, has not achieved  full gratification. Certain leaders did not come, having used  the struggle for deputy seats as an excuse. However, they have  promised to send their representatives. Aides of certain  leaders have also promised to come. But, as is usual with us,  we have to wait for the blue moon to see them coming.    Did election battles really drain all strength from  political organizations up to the last man in the ranks? Or,  perhaps, is the very idea of unity of Ukrainian brothers  becoming unrealistic during the harsh competition in the  electoral districts? Or, perhaps, do atamans' ambitions prevent  them from meeting at peace talks?    Whatever the reason, one should not lose sight of that  undeniable fact that Ukraine approaches the loss of its  independence.    Wise people learn from others' mistakes. Smart people  -- from their own. Who are we: the wise? the smart? Or, have  we learnt nothing at all?    Maybe, a multiparty system is to blame?    This supposition was expressed by Vitaliy Karpenko  [VECHERNIY  KYYIV editor in chief] for starters. In his opinion, Ukraine  has always been ruined by animosity and treachery. It was  animosity that did not allow the Supreme Council to  legislatively consolidate independence by outlawing all those  encroaching upon it.    Maybe, were there only Rukh, the question would have been  settled? However, according to Levko Lukyanenko [leader of the  "Ukrayina" election bloc], the emergence of numerous political  organizations is a normal phenomenon. It is enough to remember  the compulsory unanimity that holds our entire society in a  tight grip. Even in 1988, when the Communist Party officially  announced democratization, very few attended the Ukrainian  Culture Club [Ukrayinskyy Kulturolohichnyy Klyub]. Later on, as  the number of clubs increased, there were still very few who  dared to join the Helsinki Committee, because the participants  in it were persecuted by the authorities. At the same time,  joining the Association of Ukrainian Language did not pose any  difficulties.    However, there existed a unity at that time. Rukh was born  of that unity. The unity was declared by the delegates of  Rukh's Constituent Congress. If it has been lost, then what is  the reason for that? Are ambitions to blame?    However, according to Levko Lukyanenko, the 1991  presidential  elections were affected not by ambitions, but by serious program  differences. The Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] was for a  unitary Ukraine, while Vyacheslav Chornovil -- for a federative  one; the URP supported one official language, while Vyacheslav  Chornovil was not opposed to two.    As a result, both Lukyanenko and Chornovil have lost. The  majority of electors voted for Kravchuk who, by the way, was not  backed by any party at that time. He was backed only by his  real power.    Is it a surprise then that splits and discords have become  our common characteristics? As the ancients would say: divide  et impera.    In the meantime, on the turn of 1991-92, democrats were able  to pressure the party in power and force quick reforms.  However, they did not press.    What was the mistake?    Yuriy Hnatkevich believes that one mistake is to be afraid  of  not the large number of parties, but of their fighting one  another. "We are united by three ideas -- independence,  democracy, and market reforms, whereas the splits have been  caused by accents."    "Accents," in his opinions, have been laid in the fact that  Larysa Skoryk [of National Rukh of Ukraine] staked on "them,"  believing the nomenklatura to be the most organized force  capable of building the state. At the same time, Vyacheslav  Chornovil believed it necessary to form an opposition to "them."  Life has tested Chornovil's correctness.    Today, it seems, there are no disagreements on this issue.  Mr. Losiv from the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is  even prone to think that there should be no dealings with  Communists at all, because it is they who allow party activities  on Ukrainian territory, which openly admit that their purpose is  to destroy independence.    However, this does not relieve democrats of their guilt,  either.    "Democrats have made many concessions," pointed out Levko  Lukyanenko, "and have gotten a peace of stagnation, which  threatens Ukraine's independence."    The price for this peace was evaluated by Kostyantyn Morozov  [former defense minister]. He specified the concessions which  should be withdrawn by the most patriotic authorities provided  that they win the elections: nonnuclear status, transfer of  Black Sea Fleet structures to the Defense Ministry of the  Russian Federation, Crimean autonomy, the dragging of Ukraine  into the so-called economic union and the single ruble zone,  transparent borders, two official languages, the loss of  Ukraine's own political face on the international arena,  censorship and control over the freedom of speech, the lack of  unity...    A high price. And it was paid not by political divergencies  among national democratic forces [as published], but by the  situation, in which, after the declaration of Ukraine's  independence, the building of statehood was entrusted to the  Supreme Council completed in the elections that were organized  by the Communist Party of Ukraine. The Communist Party -- in a  manner becoming the ruling party -- took care of its worthy  representation in the highest legislative body. The party  carefully selected its Supreme Council cadres which were apt to  defend the state ownership and a single Union as well. After  August 1991, these people were given the right to work on the  creation of a market economy and to form the Armed Forces of the  independent state as well as its military policy. "We know how  they have done it," Kostyantyn Morozov stated. "All the  governments were working in this channel."    Will the elections be a cold shower?    The idea of unity seems so simple and evident that ordinary  readers, not very familiar with party developments, ask us: Are  they going to unite themselves, or not?    Therefore, one can agree with Mr. Pawlyuk who stated: "The  idea of unity is not dead yet."    Ihor Nayda from the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine,  who sees the situation from the inside due to being an  authorized representative of a candidate in one of the Kiev  constituencies, does not share the opinion that such a unity is  possible just now. But "in principle" -- why not?    All the democrats have much in common in their programs and  election platforms. These common matters can become a basis for  convening a unity congress which would put forward only one  presidential candidate representing all national democratic  forces.    Thus far, such a proposal has not raised anyone's  objections.    Indeed, the legislative elections may become a cold shower,  in which certain party atamans are lacking so badly. Then they  could be prompted to a realistic evaluation of themselves and  their political abilities.    However, for the time being, events are following their own  course. The head of the Kiev Regional Organization of the  Ukrainian Republican Party, Volodymyr Kuziv, who participated in  listing the approved candidates for Kiev city and oblast,  acknowledges: "We have already lost a fifth of the votes  without even entering the election campaign. Unity is  necessary. However, how can one unite something that cannot be  united?" It is, perhaps, not incidental that Levko Lukyanenko  also emphasized that the democratic bloc "Ukrayina" will not  firmly cling to certain candidacies that proved to be very  low-level, and to make corrections to avoid failures.    Personal ambitions are being abandoned by those who  understand the following: If the elections in the majority of  Ukraine's constituencies do not choose people's deputies, the  party in power will easily introduce a dictatorship. This will  be the time to validate the saying by one Ukrainian politician:  "Our democrats will be united -- five minutes before the  execution."</p>

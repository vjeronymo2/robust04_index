He admitted,  however, that some "irresponsible people" have invited the Armed  Forces to do just that. The Guatemalan Armed Forces "cannot  accept" a coup, Otzoy told the press.    He participated in an event to hand out prostheses to people  mutilated in the Central American war. The event was held in  Santa Ana, 66 km from San Salvador, today.    Last week, the media reported rumors of coup preparations in  Guatemala to remove President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who is  facing growing political opposition and labor protests.    Although Otzoy ruled out the Army's involvement in these  plans, he said that "irresponsible people," who he declined to  identify, have "knocked on the barracks' doors" with political  motives. He added that if any officers are involved, they will  be handed over to the administration of justice because "our  laws clearly indicate that no military personnel can participate  in politics."    "We have already experienced the consequences of a coup,"  the  deputy minister said. He said a coup would hurt the Guatemalan  people, cause chaos, and prove "inconceivable" under the present  circumstances.    Guatemala's most recent institutional crisis took place last  year on the occasion of then President Jorge Serrano's aborted  self-inflicted coup. Serrano was later overthrown by the  military.</p>

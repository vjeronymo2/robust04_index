			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Wellcome and SB open fire in herpes drug war WELLCOME and SmithKline Beecham, the UK pharmaceuticals groups, yesterday played their opening gambits in the battle for the world's rapidly growing herpes and shingles treatment market. The groups revealed data about successor drugs to Wellcome's best-selling product Zovirax, which generated sales last year of Pounds 586m. Wellcome published details of the first clinical trial on Valtrex, also known as valaciclovir. The study showed the drug was more effective than Zovirax in shortening long-term pain in shingles sufferers. Valtrex also required less frequent dosing than its predecessor, according to data which was presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in New Orleans. Wellcome said Valtrex would be submitted to the regulatory authorities in the spring, earlier than had been expected. Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham also presented data at the conference on its drug famciclovir. The study demonstrated it was more effective than Zovirax in reducing long-term pain in shingles patients. The studies presented yesterday could not be compared because each started measuring the reduction in post-shingles pain at different time-points. Details, Page 27</p>

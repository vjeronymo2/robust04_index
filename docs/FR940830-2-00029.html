			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> III. Least-Cost Concepts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The term ``least-cost'' is open to various interpretations. Depending on how the term is defined, a wide variety of energy strategies might be categorized as meeting a least-cost criterion. It is our intent to explore strategies consistent with a variety of ``least-cost'' concepts reflecting alternative treatments of issues including, but not limited to, private versus social cost minimization, environmental impacts, and the role of non-modeled attributes and institutional factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Private and Social Cost Minimization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> It is widely accepted that private and social costs may fail to coincide unless all markets are perfectly competitive. Energy-related markets provide many instances where the assumption of competition may be called into question. For example, pricing in electricity markets, which are generally subject to economic regulation at the state level, are based on average, not marginal, costs. Least-cost decisions based on the prices actually paid by electricity users may differ from least-cost decisions based on marginal costs. Capital markets provide another example of possible departures from perfect competition. Capital costs may differ significantly from the social opportunity cost of investment, and vary widely across and within groups of decisionmakers. Projects that minimize costs using social discount rates may fail to do so at discount rates reflecting the opportunity cost of capital faced by decisionmakers in the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE plans to consider a wide range of cases that reflect the differences between social and private cost minimization, and consider how each affects least-cost choices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Environmental Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Environmental impacts can also enter into the definition of a ``least cost'' energy strategy. For example, in a case where two technologies that differ widely in energy efficiency can be used to provide the same energy service, purchasers will often ignore the social costs of environmental impacts that may be associated with higher levels of energy use. Theory and regulatory practice in some states suggests that this issue can be addressed by incorporating a ``shadow price'' for environmental impacts in the least-cost objective function. The least-cost strategy will consider alternative approaches to addressing the impact of recognizing environmental costs on least-cost choices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Role of Non-Modeled Attributes and Institutional Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> No model can adequately capture the full detail of all influences on energy-related decisions. For example, decisions regarding personal transportation technologies may involve issues such as safety, performance, and room, as well as tradeoffs between acquisition cost and fuel cost. Institutional factors, such as the divorce between ownership and tenancy in many commercial buildings, can also have an important influence on energy-related decisions. Ignoring the range of attributes that enter into consumer decisions or institutional factors could lead to ``apples to oranges'' cost comparisons that do not compare alternative approaches to providing the same service. On the other hand, adoption of a pure ``revealed preference'' approach, in which the fact that a particular technology is used in the market is prima facie evidence of its least-cost nature, is both tautological and inconsistent with the spirit of the least-cost strategy exercise. Given the unsuitability of the two extremes, we intend to explore a range of intermediate cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public is invited to comment on these issues, as well as others that may bear on the interpretation or definition of the ``least-cost'' concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Least-Cost Modeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The methods selected for developing the least cost energy plan include use of the optimization model known as MARKAL&hyph;MACRO described in ``MARKAL&hyph;MACRO: A linked model for energy-economy analysis,'' BNL&hyph;47161, Brookhaven National Laboratory, February 1992. Copies of this report are available by request from the Office of Economic Analysis and Competition (202) 586&hyph;4767.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARKAL&hyph;MACRO links the MARKAL model that is used to determine least-cost provision of fixed end-use energy service demands with the substitution opportunities between energy services and other productive inputs in MACRO. MARKAL is an optimization model that minimizes the cost of providing its target level of energy services drawing on the available set technology and resources. Information from the energy resource and technology inventory is directly reflected in the MARKAL data structure, so that changes in the parameters for technologies already represented or the inclusion of new technologies may significantly influence the modeling results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In MACRO the inputs of capital, labor and energy services are substitutes for each other under an assumption of diminishing marginal returns. With the link between MARKAL and MACRO, rising energy costs can change the composition of energy supply, of energy technologies and of energy investments (through MARKAL), and may also change the balance among energy services, labor and capital input decisions, and affect future output levels (via the MACRO link).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

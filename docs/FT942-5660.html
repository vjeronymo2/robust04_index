			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Pimlott's Murder in the Pit a mere facade It is a truth too seldom acknowledged that TS Eliot, among the most haunting of 20th-century poets, was a lousy playwright. But Eliot's finest poems are so much nearer drama than his plays. In his finest poetry you can feel the conflict of separate voices and the tension of different ideas. In his plays, however, he can rarely characterise successfully; and he develops his few dramatic ideas at a woefully cumbersome rate. Eliot can always lull an audience with his sheer quality of sound, but this counts for too much. Beneath this siren surface the quality of meaning is all too slow, and sometimes nebulous. Eliot's plays usually bring out the worst in English actors: you can see them calculating their most showy and superficial effects. And Steven Pimlott's RSC production of Murder in the Cathedral is utterly sunk by the central performance of Michael Feast as Thomas Becket. It is easy to see that Feast is in some ways wrong for Becket. (In his skull-like visage and glassy facial expressions it is impossible to find any trace of the former bon viveur.) Also his reading is in other ways controversial. He seems to be trying to reveal some of the stranger facets of the psychopathology of religion - the suppressed hysteria of the would-be martyr, the manic fervour of the bigot, even a not-quite-sublimated homosexuality. But these aspects would not matter if Feast led us into the contemplative stillness of Becket's thought. Instead, however, he applies his considerable intelligence and technique into an ever-changing array of artificial gestures, over-bright facial expressions and contrasts of vocal dynamics. The overall impact is busy and contrived. He is worse when pretending, with constant artfulness, to be most spontaneous - in his prose Christmas sermon. As it is, the play snaps into some kind of dramatic vigour only once: in the clever, specious, modern apologias spoken by the four knights after the murder. Jonathan Philips (third knight) has done nothing with the RSC better than this witty piece of bluffing. The play's truest poetry is for its female chorus. Just sometimes Eliot comes close to catching the mysterious incantations of the choruses of Greek drama. Pimlott paces and divides these well. Sarah Woodward and Kate Duchene make only mild effect. Look at them after watching the older Cherry Morris and Sheila Ballantyne, so excellent in speech and stance. Morris, in particular, is so calm and focused - very reminiscent of Peggy Ashcroft in intonation - that she raises the play to a higher level with her every contribution. She even persuades us that such lines as 'I have smelt . . . incense in the latrines' mean more than they do. Pimlott, his designer Ashley Martin-Davies, his lighting designer Brian Harris, and Feast himself have reaccentuated many features of the production in transferring it from Stratford's Swan to the Barbican's Pit. This, alas, is merely to adjust the facade of what is only a facade anyway. The more you shift the visual aspects of Eliot's play, the more you expose how static is its dramatic core.

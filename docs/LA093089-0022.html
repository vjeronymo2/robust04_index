			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTERVELT, BLACKWELL CUT LOOSE IN HART ROUT  </P> <P> It seemed to hurt Mike Herrington more than it did Dick Flaherty.  </P> <P> Herrington, Hart High's first-year coach, was almost apologetic after his team  trounced Flaherty's Saugus Centurions, 56-14, in a nonleague game Friday night  at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> "It's very uncomfortable to win this way," Herrington said. "Especially against  someone I respect as much as Dick Flaherty. But even when we were up, we didn't  want to stop and have a letdown."  </P> <P> Flaherty, however, was understandably bruised by the beating. "We were pretty  much embarrassed," he said. "They dominated every phase of the game. They got  their speed loose right away."  </P> <P> Flaherty knew that in order for Saugus (2-2) to win, he would have to devise a  plan to stop senior quarterback Rob Westervelt and contain multithreat tailback  Howard Blackwell.  </P> <P> He probably would have had more luck trying to sell Zsa Zsa Gabor a pair of  tickets to the Policemen's Ball.  </P> <P> Hart (3-1) bolted to a 42-0 second-quarter lead on the strength of four  touchdown passes by Westervelt and two touchdowns by the defense.  </P> <P> Westervelt completed five of 10 passes for 205 yards. There was no need for  more. Leading, 42-6, at halftime, Hart did not attempt a pass in the second  half and Westervelt spent the entire fourth quarter on the bench.  </P> <P> "I expected 48-0," Westervelt said. "We knew they were going to try and blitz  and we picked it up real well."  </P> <P> Blackwell scored Hart's first three touchdowns on receptions of 50, 58 and 80  yards. Hart marched 60 yards in 11 plays on its first possession of the third  quarter. Blackwell, who rushed for a game-high 81 yards in 12 carries, carried  10 times on the drive, including the final four yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Blackwell, who also spent the final quarter on the bench, finished with three  receptions for 188 yards.  </P> <P> "When we were sophomores, playing for the Herringtons, we always won big,"  Blackwell said. "It doesn't affect us."  </P> <P> Said Westervelt: "I'm glad everyone got to play."  </P> <P> Hart produced 202 yards rushing -- 186 in the second half. Six reserve running  backs -- including junior Scott Blanchard, who rushed 92 yards in the third  quarter for the Indians' final touchdown -- accounted for 127 yards.  </P> <P> Saugus scored its first touchdown on a 38-yard pass from junior quarterback  Jeff Hickman to wide receiver Pat Henry in the final minute of the first half.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Hickman again connected with Henry for a 26-yard  touchdown.  </P> <P> Hickman completed seven of 23 passes for 160 yards but was sacked five times  for minus-31 yards.  </P> <P> He also threw two interceptions, one of which was returned 43 yards for a  touchdown by Adam Barlow with two minutes left in the first half. Hart's Andy  Collins returned a fumble 15 yards for a touchdown one minute earlier.  </P> <P> Westervelt and Blackwell teamed to give Hart a 21-0 lead before the game was  nine minutes old.  </P></p>

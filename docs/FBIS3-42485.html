Morozov: "The Black Sea Fleet and the New Russian Military  Doctrine"]    [Text] The present stage of transformations in the  Armed Forces and the Navy requires a new approach to evaluating  the role and place of the Black Sea Fleet in the life of Russia  and other CIS states.    Historical experience shows that the Navy played far from  the  last role in determining Russia's fate. The fleet's significance  rose especially under Peter I, when his forces attained the  Baltic and Azov seas. It was then that Russia became a naval  power.    Today, despite easing of the world situation and the  agreements with the United States and countries of the European  community on armed forces reductions, it is obviously premature  to totally exclude the possibility of military actions directed  against the Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole and  against any of its members in particular. Centers of tension  still exist in the world--in the Near and Middle East, in  Central America [sic; Asia?]. Some regions in Africa, in the  Balkans and in other areas are restless. And in general, for  that matter, there's a sense of anxiety in the world community.  States are regrouping, policies of certain states are being  reoriented, and formation of new blocs, commonwealths and so on  can be discerned. All of this is generating instability in the  world situation, and harbors explosions and conflicts.    It is difficult to overstate the place and role of the Azov  and Black seas in Russia's life on the modern road of historical  development. We are astonished in this connection with the  position taken by the leadership of the Russian Federation and  Ukraine in relation to the fate of the Black Sea Fleet--a  position that is leading to its disintegration and gradual  liquidation. The lines of communication in the Black Sea that  must be defended are something Russia and the CIS need in order  to enter the world economy, and to develop multilateral ties  with the world community in the southern sector.    Having lost over 20 major ports owing to the collapse of the  USSR, Russia is now experiencing difficulties in marine shipping  in this region. The objective necessity for increasing marine  cargo traffic will force its government to expand existing port  facilities and build new major ports and terminals in the  vicinity of the Kiziltashskiy Estuary and rayons adjacent to it.  In addition the coastline from Taganrog to Adler is around 1,000  km long. It would be impossible to defend all of this from  invasion, seizure and attacks from the sea without a modern  fleet. And as reality shows, now that the fighting capability of  the armed forces has decreased somewhat due to ill-conceived  reform, Russia's neighbors have immediately started making  territorial claims upon it, covertly in some instances and  openly in others, while in certain of its marine economic zones  resources are literally being plundered without any  countermeasures.    The situation in the Black Sea is changing as well. A  certain  decrease in the potential of the Black Sea Fleet is making it  possible for Turkey to become the real boss of the Black Sea,  upon which it is making claims at various forums being conducted  in this region. A certain "interest" in the Black Sea has also  arisen on the part of the command of the U.S. Navy and NATO.  Despite assurances that the United States and Russia are not  adversaries, the Pentagon is nonetheless finishing its work of  drafting political agreements on stationing ship formations  (groups) in Bulgaria and Romania. Given the existing range of  Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships against naval targets--500  km, and against objectives on land--2,000 km, U.S. and NATO  ships will be able to hit targets in Ukraine, Moldova, the  Transcaucasus, in the south of Russia and Belarus from the  vicinity of Burgas and Constanta. Consequently one need not be a  great strategist to understand the damage caused by loss of the  Black Sea Fleet to Russia and other CIS states.    On acquainting ourselves with the basic provisions of the  Russian Federation's military doctrine, we are confronted by  many puzzling questions regarding discrepancies between the  doctrine's provisions and reality. Thus, "build-up of troop  groupings (forces) by the borders of the Russian Federation to  levels disturbing the existing correlation of forces" is named  among the factors promoting escalation of the military danger  into a direct military threat to the Russian Federation.  However, for practical purposes the collapse of the Black Sea  Fleet has already altered the correlation of forces with the  Turkish Navy that had existed on the Black Sea prior to 1991  from 2:1 in favor of Russia to 1:1 in late 1993. And this  correlation continues to change in Turkey's favor.    The doctrine goes on to say that in order to deter a  potential aggressor "the combat potential of peacetime  general-purpose troop (force) groupings is being maintained at a  level ensuring repulsion of aggression of a local (regional)  scale." Juxtaposing this postulate with reality, we can say once  again that what is being done in relation to the Black Sea Fleet  is hardly supported by the basic provisions of the doctrine.    It is written in the doctrine that the armed forces accept  the responsibility "for providing for action by the UN Security  Council and other international organizations to support or  restore international peace and security at the earliest  possible stage of development of a threatening situation or  conflict." But for practical purposes no real measures are being  undertaken to preserve the potential of the Black Sea Fleet. On  the contrary this potential is gradually decreasing. What kind  of forces would be needed to carry out the missions foreseen by  the doctrine in the most explosive contiguous regions of the  Near East, North Africa and the Balkans? We've forgotten the  wise counsel of our predecessors regarding the need for  maintaining a strong fleet in the Black Sea. Experience shows  that in these uncertain times the Black Sea Fleet has already  carried out peacekeeping missions in Abkhazia and in the  vicinity of Poti. The Black Sea Fleet is a necessity not only to  Russia but also to all CIS states.    "The main goal of developing the armed forces written in the  doctrine is to create and develop troops (forces) capable of  providing for the defense of the country's independence,  sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the safety of  citizens and other vitally important interests of society and  the state, corresponding to the military, political and  strategic situation in the world...with regard for the country's  geopolitical and geostrategic position." We need to dwell on  this premise in greater detail.    The collapse of the former Union gives Turkey a chance to  resurrect its past might, which is obviously something its  government is striving to do. Its political actions and demarche  in Azerbaijan, Nakhichevan and the Central Asian republics and  rearmament of its army and navy can be examples of this.  Statements are being made that the Caspian Sea is a Muslim sea.  And certain historians are even prophesying domination by  Turkic-language nations in the next century. Exercises of  Turkey's 3d Field Army by the southern borders of the CIS and an  increase in frequency of visits to the Black Sea by NATO ships  also raise red flags.    Having become independent, our former union republics are  now  gravitating more and more toward rapprochement with Russia.  Thus, Azerbaijan and Georgia recently joined the Commonwealth.  Steps are being taken toward integrating measures to ensure  collective security. We are coming to understand the  indisputable fact that on its own, not one of the former  republics of the Union is able to maintain armed forces  corresponding to the proclaimed principle of reasonable  sufficiency of forces for defense. And this pertains first of  all to ship building. Modern ship building, development of the  infrastructure and maintenance of the fleet require superlarge  economic expenditures, which not a single CIS state will be able  to make on its own under current conditions.    The optimum solution is for the CIS to have a unified fleet  in the Black Sea, which up until this time has been a guarantee  of stability in this region. The Black Sea Fleet will carry out  missions in the interests of all states of the Commonwealth:  protecting their shores from invasion and attacks from the sea,  covering administrative and industrial centers and troops in  coastal regions, providing for the freedom and safety of  navigation and the productive activity of vessels of civilian  departments in the southern sector and fishing grounds, and  participating in peacekeeping missions in the Black and  Mediterranean seas, and in the Near and Middle East.    Considering the missions and the defensive orientation of  military doctrine, the Black Sea Fleet must be founded upon  highly maneuverable forces, shore-based missile systems, and  naval attack aviation capable of decisively parrying the blows  of an adversary. In order to defend shipping interests in the  Mediterranean Sea and in fishing grounds, the fleet must contain  formations of large and midsized surface ships capable of  fulfilling their mission.    But if Russia is serious about participating in United  Nations peacekeeping missions, as the doctrine says, then the  fleet must contain amphibious forces consisting of fast  amphibious warfare ships and marine infantry.    Threatening no one, and existing under Russian jurisdiction,  the Black Sea Fleet will have to maintain parity on the southern  flank of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and provide  protection to the considerable economic traffic linking them to  all continents.    The majority of politicians in Russia and other CIS states  are now beginning to understand the obvious truth that neither  the West nor states of the NATO bloc need a strong Russia, or  any of the individual states of the Commonwealth. This is why  all of the West's promises of aid and assurances of friendship  give way to practical actions sharply contrasting with its prior  mealy-mouthed assurances. And it would be naive to expect that  the United States and its allies, who have the power, will  concede there interests in Grenada or Panama, in the Persian  Gulf or the Baltic, in the Black Sea or in the Near East, or in  the World Ocean as a whole.    If Russia and the CIS generally want to be a power to reckon  with, they cannot allow sharp reduction of the fighting  capability of the armed forces as a whole and of the Black Sea  Fleet in particular, which are a powerful tool in resolving  political issues in the southern sector. If we fail to preserve  and improve the Black Sea Fleet and its infrastructure through  combined effort today, in the future we will have to overstress  the economy and impose a severe burden upon the peoples of the  Commonwealth to restore the former might of the fleet, and a  breach will appear in the collective defensive system of the CIS  in the southern sector, into which interested western and  southern neighbors will immediately try to drive a wedge.</p>

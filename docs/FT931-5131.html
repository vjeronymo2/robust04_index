			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / 53,000 council jobs 'lost last year' ABOUT 53,000 local government jobs were lost last year, statistics prepared by the Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch show. However, pay-cuts-for-jobs deals could slow the shedding of staff next year. Agreements to save jobs, such as that between unions and Sheffield City Council in which unions traded a pay cut for jobs, are likely to be limited this year because most councils have set their budgets and made their plans for 1993-94. But the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said yesterday that more councils and unions might move in that direction in 1993-94. In Sheffield nearly 20,000 employees voted to take a pay cut in exchange for shorter working hours to stop the city council making 1,400 of them redundant. According to the staffing watch statistics local authorities lost more than 31,000 jobs in 1991. Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the AMA, said that last year's job losses confirmed his worst fears. 'We believe that up to 100,000 more local government jobs will be lost in the next 18 months,' he said. The Local Government Management Board, the employers' organisation, said it did not believe that Sheffield would set a precedent. 'There were unique circumstances in Sheffield,' it said. It is understood that a majority of councils have had informal talks with unions over pay freezes, but no agreements have been reached. According to the Local Government Chronicle the government's desired 1.5 per cent pay limit for public-sector workers is forcing councils to renegotiate contracts with employees who have index-linked pay.</p>

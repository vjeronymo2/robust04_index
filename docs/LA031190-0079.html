			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER SIMON: JACKSON BOWS OUT, BUT HE NEVER BOWED IN  </P> <P> Jesse Jackson walked slowly into the church basement accompanied by 57  ministers and community leaders. They arrayed themselves around him in two long  lines as Jackson delivered his consent decree.  </P> <P> Jackson had called this little gathering to announce that although he had never  said he was going to run for mayor of Washington, he would stop running for  mayor in the future. Though not many residents of Washington shed any tears  over this announcement, there was a great gnashing of teeth in the media.  </P> <P> For nearly a year, commentator after commentator had urged Jackson to run. They  had their reasons ready:  </P> <P> * It would get Jackson out of the 1992 Democratic presidential race and thereby  help heal the party. (Which Jackson cared nothing about.)  </P> <P> * It would help Jackson by proving he could win elective office. (Though his  lack of elective experience, Jackson recognizes, is often an excuse people use  to disguise far uglier reasons for not wanting him in the White House.)  </P> <P> * It would save Jackson the embarrassment of another loss in 1992. (Though  Jackson happens to believe he might win the nomination in 1992 or at least get  the vice presidential spot.)  </P> <P> But in the end, Jackson pulled out. He did so only a few weeks after a  different kind of article began circulating in the press: These showed that  although the national media might think it just swell to have Jackson as mayor,  Washington residents did not.  </P> <P> Residents of Washington? Oh, yeah, them. Seems a lot of people forgot about  them. But they had something to say. And it was that, while they viewed Jackson  as a national figure and an inspirational figure and even an historic figure,  they didn't think he cared much about filling potholes. Or towing abandoned  cars.  </P> <P> So Jackson bowed out without ever having officially bowed in. And I thought he  looked relieved when he did it. He no longer had to worry about actually  running a city. Instead, he could do what he liked to do best: He could  champion a cause, launch a crusade.  </P> <P> His becoming mayor of Washington would never have made history. (Which was one  of the six reasons that I listed a year ago why Jackson would never run for  mayor.) But making Washington the 51st state, now that would be historic. Which  is what Jackson now wants.  </P> <P> Jackson announced it would be a titanic struggle, a struggle worthy of him. He  compared it to no less a battle than those faced by blacks in South Africa.  "Just as Mandela is out of jail, but not free," Jackson said, "by democratic  standards, the citizens of Washington are out of jail, but not free."  </P> <P> Then Jackson hinted at "direct action" to achieve statehood, saying that  "marching" and "going to jail" might be necessary to "free" the District of  Columbia.  </P> <P> And because all battles must have a first shot, Jackson fired his at a  slow-moving target: Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland. The day before,  Schaefer, in response to a question, had said that, if "their statehood is not  feasible," he would "have no problem with D.C. becoming a part of Maryland."  </P> <P> Schaefer figured the district might actually want it. After all, this would  give Jackson what he said he wanted: representation for the people.  </P> <P> Jackson went ballistic when I asked him about Schaefer's statement.  "Washington, D.C., has its distinction and its tradition," Jackson said. "And  really what he's proposing is a kind of Bantustan concept. And as we end  Bantustans in South Africa, we're not going to transfer them to Washington."  </P> <P> Bantustans are the phony black "homelands" created by the government of South  Africa, where blacks would be allowed to live in poverty and without any civil  rights. To accuse Schaefer of wanting this for Washington was a considerable  insult.  </P> <P> But, actually, there was a certain logic to Schaefer's position: Maryland had  given up the land that now forms Washington. George Washington himself  bamboozled Maryland property owners out of their land in 1790 for $66 an acre.  (George must have had a silver tongue to go along with those wooden teeth.)  </P> <P> So if statehood does not get approved by Congress (and I don't know anybody who  believes it will), wouldn't rejoining Maryland give the district the senators  and governor and voting representatives it says it wants?  </P> <P> But in suggesting this, Schaefer accidentally pulled back the curtain on the  dirty little secret of statehood. It is not, as Jackson and others claim, about  representation for the citizens of the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> It is about representation for the district that the power brokers behind it  personally desire. If the issue were merely about representation in Congress,  then supporters would be glad to get Maryland's senators representing them.  </P> <P> But the supporters of statehood have different plans. They want to pick their  own senators -- and one may be named Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> I am not saying this is wrong. But let's not dress up the question of statehood  with Revolutionary War phrases like taxation without representation or even  compare it to the genuine struggle for human and civil rights in South Africa.  </P> <P> Statehood is not about freedom for the people. It is about jobs for the few.  </P></p>

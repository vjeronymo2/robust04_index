			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> W.VA. GOVERNOR TO WED CONDUCTOR OF SYMPHONY  </P> <P> Gov. Gaston Caperton, whose messy divorce from his wife of 23 years made  headlines last year, today announced his engagement to Wheeling Symphony  conductor Rachael Worby.  </P> <P> "This is a really special day for us," Caperton said at a news conference at  Oglebay Park Amphitheater, where the orchestra appears during the summer.  </P> <P> The announcement comes less than a year after the first-term Democratic  governor and his wife, Dee, divorced and she sued him for fraud.  </P> <P> After the divorce, Dee Caperton, a former House of Delegates member, ran for  the Democratic nomination for state treasurer, saying she would be able to work  cooperatively with her ex-husband. She was defeated in Tuesday's primary.  </P> <P> Speculation that Caperton, 50, and Orby, 41, were romantically involved sprang  up when they attended many public functions together, including a visit to the  White House.  </P></p>

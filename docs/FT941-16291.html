			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Observer: Waiting game When is The Rank Organisation going to find a replacement for Sir Patrick Meaney who died over 18 months ago? Sir Leslie Fletcher has been standing in as chairman but he's well over 70 and can't be expected to hang on much longer. One possibility is for Michael Gifford, chief executive for over a decade, to step up to the plate. But this wouldn't go down too well with the institutions, especially if he wanted to combine the two jobs. The name of Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, had been mentioned. He has been tipped to pick up the chairmanships of one or two top companies ever since he gave up as chief executive of the merchant bank in October 1991. But Sir Leslie is still there and Sir David is still available. Perhaps Sir David has his eye on an even bigger prize - the chairmanship of GEC. After all, Lord Prior has been doing it for the past decade and Lord Weinstock, the managing director, turns 70 this year.</p>

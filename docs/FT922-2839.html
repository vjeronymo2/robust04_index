			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: IRI sets price for share 'packets' in STET sale IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has set a price of L2,020,000 (Dollars 1,692) for each of the 'packets' of shares and warrants in the latest dilution of its stake in the STET telecommunications group. Investors have been keenly awaiting the price for the placement, which, including warrants, will match last year's rights issue by Generali as the biggest capital raising made by an Italian company. STET is the IRI-owned holding company which controls Italy's state-owned telecommunications activities, notably SIP, the main operating utility. Net profits last year were L1,413bn on sales of L22,946bn. Investors will be offered packets containing 1,000 ordinary STET shares, 50 warrants convertible into a further 500 ordinary shares, and 100 warrants convertible into 1,000 savings shares. IRI said the first group of warrants will be convertible into ordinary shares at L2,100 a share, while the price for the savings shares linked to the second tranche of warrants will be L2,000 a share. Based on the closing price for STET's ordinary shares in Milan on Friday, the packets represent a discount of around 5.7 per cent, against their hypothetical market value of L2,143,000 each. After all the warrants are exercised IRI's stake in STET will fall to 53 per cent of the ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of the savings stock. IRI currently owns around 69 per cent of the ordinary stock and 30 per cent of the savings shares, if all outstanding warrants are exercised. The European Commission remains concerned by new Italian legislation governing stock market reform. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, said in Milan: 'We are very concerned about this and have indicated that' to the Italian authorities. The Commission's objections focus on the law introducing Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM), Italy's new stockbroking and fund management hybrid. Several countries have objected that the SIMs law discriminates against financial institutions from outside Italy. 'We have had complaints from more than one country,' said Sir Leon. The objections 'seem to have considerable substance. It is difficult to reconcile this legislation with the rules of the European Community as they stand.'</p>

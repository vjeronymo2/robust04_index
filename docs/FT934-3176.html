			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Trans-Euro networks move up the agenda: EU ambitions Until 'trans-European networks' appeared in the European Commission's white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment published this week, the European Union's new infrastructure policy had tended to go unnoticed by politicians and citizens. The networks are the building blocks of a united Europe. They are huge infrastructure projects in roads, rail, energy, and telecommunications the purpose of which is to move people, goods and information more easily around the single European market and forge closer links with eastern Europe. The white paper calls for 'joint, massive and sustained effort on the part of the authorities at all levels and of private operators' to establish this infrastructure across the EU. But it is the white paper's estimate that Ecu400bn (Pounds 304.8bn) of direct public and private investment could be 'mobilised' for such networks by 1999 which has guaranteed that Union leaders, flanked by budget-conscious finance ministers, will take a close look at what this spending could involve when they discuss the issue at their summit today. Last Sunday the Commission provoked an uproar by presenting European finance ministers with plans for EU spending of around Ecu124bn on the projects over the next six years, including a scheme for the Commission to borrow on the international capital markets. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, complained that the plans had been slipped into Mr Jacques Delors' white paper without proper scrutiny by finance ministers. In effect tying the hands of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, before today's EU summit in Brussels, Mr Clarke declared: 'The governments of Europe will not conceivably expect to agree new arrangements for borrowing between Ecu20bn a year without so much as a sheet of paper on the table.' Mr Clarke chose to ignore that most of the money for trans-European networks has already been earmarked in the seven-year 'Delors II' budget agreed a year ago, while the principle of subsidised lending for big infrastructure projects is incorporated in the Maastricht treaty itself. The real source of controversy lies in the Commission's plan to use its Triple-A credit rating to raise money at cheap rates for lending on to governments to fund trans-European networks. Supporters argue that Brussels has in the past raised money to help governments such as Italy and Greece with balance of payments difficulties; but other Commission officials admit that raising money for public works programmes risks duplication with the European Investment Bank, the principal funding agency for infrastructure projects. On the other hand, the Commission claims that about Ecu20bn will be needed to fund trans-European networks. According to official calculations, Ecu5.3bn is already earmarked in the budget, with the EIB expected to lend a further Ecu6.7bn a year. This leaves a financing gap of Ecu8bn to be plugged with the so-called 'Brussels bonds'. Mr Delors insists that trans-European networks are not a job creation scheme, but more a medium-term project for strengthening European competitiveness. He argues that raising Ecu8bn a year will send only a ripple across the international bond markets and not affect interest rates. 'If a German minister is against, then I may remind you that to fund German unification they did not need 8bn a year, but 40bn to 50bn.' Even if financing is agreed, the ideal of trans-European networks has already run up against several problems. First, there is a problem with co-ordination. Trans-European networks - unlike the Commission's visionary single market project - are not the responsibility of a single commissioner. Ministerial votes on individual projects are split between at least four councils - transport, telecoms, energy and internal market - with research ministers controlling the separate R&amp;D budget. Those councils have already started to chip away at the wider vision of unified networks serving a European 'information society'. On Monday, for example, research ministers decided to cut the proportion of the 1994-1998 research and development budget which will be spent on information and communications technologies from 36 per cent to 28 per cent. On Tuesday, to the irritation of Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, telecoms ministers rejected a proposal for an electronic network linking national administrations on the grounds that the Commission had not done enough homework on the real need for such a network. Some of the projects also depend on the success of controversial liberalisation of protected utilities. Proposals to link up electricity and gas networks across borders, for example, look fine on paper but such links will be relatively unused unless the Commission's controversial plans to liberalise the EU energy market are also agreed. The willingness of the private sector to fund large infrastructure projects also varies. In the telecoms sector, for example, large companies are eager to help set up networks, but constructions groups require more effective guarantees before attempting large road or bridge projects. The risk, as the Commission is aware, is that the combination of a row about public money, a reluctance to liberalise, and a lack of private-sector finance might undermine the employment benefits of the project and leave Europe with an unhappy patchwork of half-finished networks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel Viktor Kostenyuk: "Turkey Bids Farewell </F> to Infantry Brigades"]    [Text] In the new international situation Turkey has ended  up in a zone of prolonged military-political instability, ethnic  and national tension, border conflicts and aggressive terrorist  activity. Under these conditions, increasing the Turkish Armed  Forces' importance in securing NATO's southern flank and  strengthening their role as a guarantor of their country's  security required the Turkish leadership to revise a number of  provisions of military doctrine and fundamentally reorganize its  Army (see diagram for prospective structure).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-002C-35A>           Flow Chart </FIG>  &lt;/graphic&gt;     Turkey presently has the second largest Armed Forces in  NATO,  numbering up to 600,000 persons. They are armed with 3,600  tanks, around 3,000 armored combat vehicles, 5,000 artillery  systems, 300 army aviation helicopters, 815 combat aircraft, and  136 ships of the main types. The Turkish command believes that  this quantity of troops and combat equipment is sufficient to be  ready to conduct defensive and offensive operations on two  separate strategic axes, the Balkan and the Caucasian, in  accordance with NATO requirements.    With this they can perform missions of defending national  territory, holding the strategically important Black Sea  straits, and conducting military operations to keep enemy troop  from moving into Central Europe. The Turkish Armed Forces also  support strategic movements of NATO reaction forces  (particularly U.S. troops) to areas of armed conflicts in the  Near and Middle East.    The new military doctrine has now made concrete functions of  the Armed Forces for ensuring the country's territorial  integrity and suppressing separatist actions, and has broadened  the concept of defending Turkish interests outside of national  territory. The possibility of giving military assistance to  Muslim states of the former USSR and to other countries of the  region has been incorporated conceptually. Turkish troops also  can be used to participate in peacekeeping actions.    Performance of these and other missions requires bringing  Turkish troops up to NATO standards and substantially increasing  their mobility, striking power and firepower. They were inferior  to leading European armies in many parameters until recently.  The presence of a considerable number of obsolete arms and an  acute shortage of modern combat equipment is the weakest point  of the Turkish Armed Forces. Thus, over 30 percent of these arms  entered the troops 30-40 years ago and around half of the field  artillery pieces and naval ships were made in the 1940's.    Therefore, the Turkish leadership planned a broad set of  organizational and military-technical measures for a fundamental  restructuring of their Armed Forces for the next decade.    First of all, the troops' organizational structure is being  upgraded, which presumes standardization of formation and unit  table of organization structures, a transition from  division-regimental to a more flexible brigade-battalion basis,  and formation primarily of mechanized and armored brigades. The  increase in the number of formations of these types to 70  percent of the Army combat force level by the year 2000 will  increase its striking power and offensive capabilities  significantly. It is planned to strengthen the troop grouping  stationed in the eastern part of the country (2nd and 3rd field  armies) and targeted against the Transcaucasus.    The number of airmobile commando brigades with Army aviation  battalions in their makeup is being increased to ensure a prompt  reaction to threats that arise suddenly. Formation of  specialized heavy motor transport regiments for moving one  centrally subordinate armored brigade and four tank battalions  (one in each field army) will contribute to a substantial  increase in troop mobility. In addition, it is planned to  establish one or two airmobile battalions in each field army as  assault transport helicopters are delivered to the troops.    The military organizational development plan envisages  reoutfitting all branches of the Armed Forces through arms and  military equipment deliveries from the United States and Central  European countries, modernizing obsolete models and producing  new arms under license. Deliveries to the Army of over 1,100  tanks, around 2,700 armored combat vehicles, over 500  self-propelled artillery systems, and 200 combat helicopters  will be completed before the year 2000. Up to 270  fighter-bombers, 50 attack aircraft, and 80 medium and light  military transport aircraft will enter the Air Force inventory  in this same period. The Navy modernization program envisages  having up to 40 new ships of basic types in the Navy order of  battle by the end of the millennium.    Reform of the Turkish Armed Forces presumes improved manning  of formations and units with a reduction in the overall number  of personnel. The number of servicemen in the Air Force and Navy  will remain essentially unchanged, while the Army makeup will be  reduced by almost a third. Terms of service for privates and  NCO's will be reduced from 15 to 12 months beginning in 1995.  The proportion of volunteers performing duty on a contractual  basis will increase along with this. Counting regular officers,  the overall number of professional servicemen may reach 40  percent in the Army and over 80 percent in the Air Force and  Navy in ten years.    An improved mobilization system called upon to support  formation and unit deployment in shorter time periods is being  introduced within the scope of military reform. Along with the  fully deployed units, training and cadre units are being  preserved and will serve as a base for mobilizing a considerable  number of new formations. The presence of so-called green units  and subunits will permit establishing territorial self-defense  forces on their basis in wartime, deploying troops to reinforce  the Army, and bringing the number of personnel in combat units  up to wartime strength levels. Armed Forces overall numerical  strength can be more than doubled in a month with that  mobilization deployment procedure.    Finally, Armed Forces restructuring envisages increased  effectiveness and stability of command and control by  reorganizing staffs at all levels, making comprehensive use of  automated command and control systems, adopting modern  jam-protected communications equipment, and improving the staff  operational training system.    Western experts believe that full implementation of the plan  for restructuring and modernizing the Turkish Armed Forces will  increase their design combat potential by one and one-half to  two times. But the shortage of funds, constant dependence on  foreign military aid and weapon deliveries, and poor capacities  of national military industry may threaten fulfillment of a  number of very important military-technical programs. The  planned volume of new arms production and procurements for the  next decade exceeds $15 billion, while Turkey's real financial  capabilities are considerably lower.</p>

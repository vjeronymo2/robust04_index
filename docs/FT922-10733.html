			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Quinton departure confusion - Barclays chairman forced to go early says non-executive director SIR JOHN Quinton, chairman of Barclays, yesterday said the decision to appoint his successor from within the bank was evidence that his departure was not forced by anyone disappointed with the bank's performance. However, his remarks were made as a senior non-executive director said the chairman had been pushed to go 'a bit earlier' than planned because there was a need to tackle Barclay's problems with a fresh team as soon as possible. Mr Andrew Buxton, deputy chairman, is to replace Sir John as chief executive from the beginning of next month and as chairman from the end of the year. Talk of a boardroom coup within the last few weeks was strongly denied by Sir John, who said that he had always planned to give up the chairmanship at the end of the year. Asked whether he had hoped to hang on to his executive duties for a little longer he replied: 'No, not really. There will not be a great deal of difference since I will still be working five days a week for Barclays.' However, a non-executive director said the board had felt that changes had to be put in place sooner than envisaged by Sir John in order to address the problems facing Barclays, including escalating costs. The non-executive added: 'It is not as easy to look forward when you are approaching 63'. The bank's non-executive directors include Sir Martin Jacomb, the bank's deputy chairman and a Bank of England director, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of the property company Slough Estates, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, and Sir James Spooner, chairman of the Morgan Crucible conglomerate. It also emerged yesterday that the non-executive directors had forced the pace of management change in Barclays in order to ensure Mr Buxton's succession. Some non-executives felt that Mr Buxton may have left the group if his position had not been clarified this month. Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman, said: 'It was absolutely key that Andrew (Buxton) stayed on since we needed someone who understood the business. Although I never heard Andrew suggesting that he might go.' Mr Buxton said he was keen to develop Barclay's international role which he compared favourably with what he called Lloyds' 'retrenchment in the UK'. He added: 'I want us to become a major European bank with interests across the world.' Sir John said he doubted whether Mr Buxton would change the bank's strategy. 'I have been developing my strategy with my colleagues. 'It would be somewhat strange if we then set off on an immediate different strategy.' In order to rebuff criticism that one man should not be both chief executive and chairman Mr Buxton said that he planned to dilute the two senior jobs by sharing many of his duties with Sir Peter, who is to become responsible for the service business division as well as Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Alastair Robinson, who will continue to head the banking division, will also become a vice chairman of the group. Observer, Page 23</p>

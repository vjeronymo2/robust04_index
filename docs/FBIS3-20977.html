While two  years ago they needed only one common display booth, there are  now already 15 exhibitors in Munich.    "It required a great effort to gain a foothold on the  market" explains marketing manager Ingo Reichel. A little luck  played its role too: In 1991, just during the confusion in the  aftermath of the turning-point events, the West European  manufacturer of GaAs single crystals Wacker closed shop.    This did not help the people in Saxony much at first, their  enterprise still being held in trust. "Had we been so far  advanced then as we are today, we certainly would have been able  to take over the customers by following target-oriented  marketing procedures" assesses Reichel. As it was, however, the  competition in Southeast Asia snatched the customers away from  us with lightning speed. "Today we must spare no effort to win  these customers back."    At the PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition the Elektonikwerkstoffe  (Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg displays single-crystal  silicon blocks and slices for photovoltaic cells and electronic  devices, also GaAs slices for microwave components and for  low-power components. This enterprise has developed and made  specialty materials for over the past 35 years. As always, in  keeping up with developments in electronics, these materials  today are silicon and gallium arsenide.    Also Lothar Spaeth of Jenoptik Ltd is now in Munich.  Evolving  from the former Carl Zeiss combine in Jena, this company could  have afforded to send a representative to the previous 1991  PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition already. Spaeth wants to enter not only  the European market but also the U.S.A. and Southeast Asia. With  a staff of 1,250 highly qualified employees, the enterprise is  active in many business areas: microelectronics, sensors,  heavy-duty optics, and precision mechanics.    One strength of Jenoptik is development and production of  equipment for the semiconductor industry: electron-beam lighting  apparatus, wafer steppers, fine-structure forming apparatus for  printed-circuit boards and handling systems, also for measuring  and inspection devices.    The Jena people are exhibiting in Munich three innovative  developments. The DirectPrint 40 is a laser-type direct-lighting  apparatus for printed-circuit boards. It facilitates formation  of fine structures having an only 40 m track width on a  printed-circuit board. A minifacility for fabrication under  Class 1 clean-room conditions is hidden behind the SMIF Lean  Robot SLR 150 AF exhibit. The third novelty is the DefectFinder  2000, a wafer inspecting device with which slicing processes can  be automatically monitored.    Now, for the first time, the FHR Anlagenbau (Equipment  Construction) enterprise, in existence since 1991, represented  in the very traditional Apparatus Construction Post Dresden.  This enterprise evolved from the Elektromat enterprise. The  staff brought with it many years of experience in development  and construction of equipment for vacuum and film deposition  processes. With this asset, it should be possible to increase  the net output from 1.2 million DM in 1992 to 2 million DM in  this year already.    The enterprise does not only develop equipment and devices  but also takes over services from and handles products of  prominent European manufactures. Its current principal area of  activity is environment-friendly treatment, modification, and  cleaning of surfaces by plasma and vacuum processes. A  large-surface sputtering apparatus makes it possible to coat  most diverse target surfaces of all materials currently in use.  A whole selection will be shown in Munich.    The Feutron Ltd in Greiz (Vogtland in Thuringia), for over  50  years a specialist in refrigeration, climate, and environment  simulation engineering, has already installed about 15,000  climatic test chambers all over Europe. It holds 50 relevant  patents. This company will demonstrate in Munich how it reacted  to the collapse of ancestral eastern markets by modernizing and  shaping up its product line so that now its specialties are:  custom-built high-tech equipment for simulation of  characteristics of the environment, complete transportable  climatic test laboratories, and outdoor measuring stations.</p>

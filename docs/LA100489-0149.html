			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSE ACTS ON PROTESTS BY ELDERLY, VOTES REPEAL OF CATASTROPHIC HEALTH  INSURANCE  </P> <P> The House, responding to a firestorm of protest from elderly Americans against  having to pay for expanded Medicare benefits, voted 360 to 66 today to repeal  the catastrophic health insurance program.  </P> <P> It then turned to consideration of a proposal to salvage a small piece of the  year-old Medicare expansion.  </P> <P> However, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), chairman of the House Ways and Means  Committee's health subcommittee, said the outright repeal is likely to stand.  </P> <P> Stark was one of the main authors of the catastrophic program, signed into law  last summer with great fanfare by then-President Ronald Reagan and hailed as  the most significant expansion of Medicare in its two decades of existence.  </P> <P> Today's vote to repeal it was a startling reversal of last year's 328-72 vote  to pass the original measure.  </P> <P> Despite the repeal vote, however, the final judgment on catastrophic health  insurance is far from over.  </P> <P> The action shifts to the Senate, where repeal sentiment is also strong but  where Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) is looking for ways to  save the framework of the program.  </P> <P> Complicating the final decision was the fact that both the House and Senate  wove the catastrophic health issue in with a massive deficit-reduction bill  containing a number of other controversial topics -- including a capital gains  tax reduction, child care and taxes on ozone-depleting chemicals.  </P> <P> In the end, the massive compromise measure will return as one big package to  both chambers for a single up or down vote.  </P> <P> The feature in last year's legislation that prompted the cries for repeal  stemmed from a bipartisan agreement that the cost of the expanded benefits must  be borne fully by the 33 million elderly and disabled people covered by  Medicare.  </P> <P> Congress structured the increased fees so those in higher income brackets would  pay a larger share in proportion to their tax liability -- up to a maximum of  $800 this year.  </P> <P> But that financing feature generated a firestorm of protest and overshadowed  the big expansion in benefits for hospitalization, doctor bills and other  costs.  </P> <P> The cry for repeal came mainly from three quarters:  </P> <P>  -- Retirees who complained that their former employers were already giving  them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase from Medicare.  </P> <P>  -- Upper-income retirees who objected to having to pay a disproportionate  share of the costs to make up for the modest $4-a-month assessment on the  estimated 56% of Medicare beneficiaries who do not have enough money to owe any  income taxes.  </P> <P>  -- Those who complained that the program did not address the main need of  elderly Americans: insurance for nursing homes and other long-term care.  </P> <P> With repeal or a massive rollback a virtual certainty, congressional health  policy leaders said they anticipate even greater difficulty in the future in  winning support for expanded health programs for the elderly.  </P></p>

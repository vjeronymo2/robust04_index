			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Shu Rong (5289 1369) and Wen Xiang (2429 </F> 4382): "Introducing Intellectual Resources Is an Important  Strategy for Stepping Up China's Economic Development--Interview  With Ma Junru, Director of State Bureau of Foreign Experts  Affairs"]    [Text] Shanghai, 20 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--"In the  course of establishing the socialist market economy, inviting  foreign experts to give advice to all trades and industries in  China, or sending Chinese managerial personnel abroad to receive  training, will bring great benefit to China's construction and  development. Introducing intellectual resources to promote  development is China's strategic policy."    Ma Junru, director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts  Affairs, said this in a recent interview with ZHONGGUO XINWEN  SHE.    Reportedly, last year, some 50,000 foreign experts were  invited to work in China. At the same time, China also  dispatched some 30,000 technical and managerial personnel abroad  to receive training. Such "two-way personnel exchanges" across  the national boundaries produced great effects.  <H5>  Conceptual Revolution </H5>   Last November, on his return from a training course in  Germany, a district magistrate in Beijing Municipality discussed  with his subordinates the issue of establishing an institution  to manage state-owned assets. Thanks to his efforts, the  institution was set up quickly and began to function  effectively. However, two months before that, the district  magistrate did not have any interest in this matter and he put  an `X' on the report submitted by his subordinates on the  establishment of the state assets management institution.    The district magistrate and tens of thousands of  decisionmaking officials in China are gradually becoming experts  from laymen in the rising tide of the market economy, gradually  becoming enthusiastic advocators and performers instead of  onlookers. The conceptual revolution, which is going on  quietly, has greatly benefited from the enhanced insight of the  decisionmaking managers and administrators who received training  abroad in recent years.    Ma Junru told this story with deep feelings. The State  Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs, which also takes charge of  these affairs, has boldly advanced the work of dispatching  managerial personnel abroad to receive training in recent years.    According to the traditional practice, only factory  directors  and business company managers can be sent abroad to receive  training and policymaking officials at the higher levels would  have no such opportunities. If they could make any foreign  inspection tours, they would just be able to scratch the surface  rather than learn something profound. Beginning in 1992, the  convention in this field was broken and policymaking  administrators could also step out of the country in the  capacity of students to study the advanced management skills in  foreign countries.    Ma Junru said: Policymaking cadres and senior managerial  personnel are urgently required to have a good knowledge of the  market economy. In the practice of building the socialist  market economy, China should not do everything from the very  beginning; instead, it should take over the existing successful  and advanced methods and skills developed by other people.  Thus, China can avoid undergoing many twists and turns, can  lower the costs, and can quicken the pace of reform.    Last year, when more and more people had a strong interest  in  futures, the State Economic and Trade Commission organized a  number of responsible officials to take a training course about  futures at Illinois University in the United States and  practiced in Chicago's large futures market. As a result, the  trainees acquired a much deeper understanding of the U.S.  futures market and also had some new ideas about China's futures  market. Then, they submitted a report about the development of  the futures market to the central authorities and the report  aroused the close attention of the central leaders.  <H5>  Considerable Results </H5>   Ma Junru, 59, was engaged in microelectronics research for a  long time. In the past he has been successively director of the  Basic Research and High Technology Department of the State  Science and Technology Commission and responsible person of the  Technological Section of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He  took up his current post in August 1991. His work experience  brought about a rigorous work style. In order to explain the  urgency of introducing intellectual resources in China, he cited  a string of figures and used "eating a meal" as a figure of  speech.    Several years ago, the State Bureau of Foreign Experts  Affairs invited Japanese rice expert Masaichi Hara to spread the  advanced rice cultivation techniques in China. As a result,  good harvests of rice were reaped in large areas of northeast  China. The advanced techniques were then further spread to  Hebei, Xinjiang, and Gansu. Director Ma said: "We have 480  million mu of paddy fields. If the advanced techniques are  adopted for all these fields, great results will be achieved"    Therefore, the old Japanese expert was given a letter of  commendation signed by Premier Li Peng. When visiting China,  the Japanese Emperor also received him at the Diaoyutai National  Guest House.    In the field of manufacturing industry, Shanghai's Dazhong-  Santana succeeded in producing the cars wholly in China by  adopting imported technology; Beijing Piano Plant recovered from  the recession and sold its highly popular products at home and  abroad; Shenyang Beer also won an award by freeing itself from  its predicament; and Changsha Air Blowers succeeded in exporting  its products to overseas markets. All such successes were  inseparable from the wisdom and hard work of foreign experts.  <H5>  Long-Term Strategy </H5>   "Taking in and sending out" is not China's creation, still  less is it a stop-gap measure only for the time being, said Ma  Junru. In the world, such countries and regions as Japan,  Singapore, the ROK, and even China's Taiwan and Hong Kong have  all adopted similar measures. This played a great role in the  economic take-off and recovery of these countries and regions.  In general, they gained greater benefits than the developed  countries did.    As for the import and export of intellectual resources, some  less developed Third World countries are often "exporters." For  example, some 100,000 university graduates and well-educated  professionals from China are now working in the United States;  but only several thousand American experts come and work in  China every year. Therefore, China has to make unremitting  efforts over a long time in order to import intellectual  resources.    According to Director Ma, at present, the foreign experts  invited by China are mainly engaged in educational and technical  work, or are working with some large projects and foreign-funded  enterprises. They are making greater contributions to China's  reform, opening, and economic development. The authorities  concerned are considering the plan for introducing intellectual  resources on a larger scale during the Ninth Five-Year Plan so  that the work in this aspect will better serve the adoption of  the state's major reform measures, the transformation of  management mechanisms in large and medium-sized enterprises, the  decisions on launching major projects, and the improvement of  the management of township and town enterprises.</p>

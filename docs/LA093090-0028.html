			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES 'REMODELS' ITS SOUTHLAND HOME PRICE GUIDE  </P> <P> We're remodeling around here -- who isn't these days? -- and we want to tell  you about some major improvements you'll find, starting today, in our Southland  Home Prices feature.  </P> <P> First, we're now reporting separate sales prices for single-family houses and  condominiums. Previously, the prices for both had been combined in a single  figure. Now you'll be able to track price changes and sales activity in both  houses and condos in your community.  </P> <P> Second, we're publishing the median sales price, rather than an adjusted  average price. The median price means that half the homes sold for more and  half the homes sold for less, and is considered a more accurate gauge of home  prices.  </P> <P> We report prices for seven Southland counties on a five-week cycle, and we  start today with Los Angeles County. Next week will feature Orange County, then  San Diego, then Riverside and San Bernardino counties, then Ventura and Santa  Barbara counties, and back to Los Angeles, with a new batch of updated sales  figures.  </P> <P> With that introduction, turn to K21, and you'll see how easy it is to use our  more precise reporting format to check the condo and single-family home market  in your part of town and your neighborhood or -- and this can be useful -- your  dream neighborhood.  </P> <P> Let's say, for example, that you live in a condo in Culver City, in ZIP Code  90230, or that you'd like to.  </P> <P> Check the chart and map layout on K21 for Zone 12, which includes Culver City,  Santa Monica, Venice, Rancho Park and Palms.  </P> <P> You'll see that the median-price existing single-family homes in the area in  August was $370,000, down 2.6% from a year ago August, and that 166 houses were  sold in the reporting month. The median price of existing condos was $263,000,  down .7%, and a total of 75 were sold.  </P> <P> Sales of newly built homes and condos, light in some areas and heavy in others,  is reported as a combined figure on the third line. In Zone 12, 21 new units  were built and sold for a median price of $249,000. Because they are new, there  is no comparison to last year.  </P> <P> Now turn to K20 to check prices in ZIP Code 90230. There you'll see that median  house prices, at $289,000, have dropped 7%, and condo prices, at $175,000, have  risen 17%, and that total sales are less than half what they were in the same  month a year ago. (For all counties besides Los Angeles, you'll find zone and  ZIP data combined on one chart.)  </P> <P> Our new home price information is provided by Dataquick, a San Diego-based real  estate information service company, which gathers its data on California's 11  million pieces of real estate from public records in each of the state's 52  counties.  </P> <P> Among Dataquick's 5,000 customers are government agencies, lending and  financial institutions, title companies and other commercial users, and  increasingly, consumers.  </P> <P> By calling Dataquick and paying a fee, home buyers, home sellers or simply  interested homeowners can tap into the company's storehouse of real estate  information for:  </P> <P>  -- Checking "comps," or what homes of comparable size and condition have sold  for recently in the neighborhood, a useful tool for prospective buyers or  sellers.  </P> <P>  -- Checking the sales history of a house under consideration for purchase.  </P> <P>  -- Checking the general price level of a neighborhood for purposes of  refinancing or taking out a home equity loan.  </P> <P> "Until now, this information has really only been available to the people on  the other side of the desk when you want to buy, sell or borrow," said  Dataquick president Donald Cohn.  </P> <P> "The more knowledge you have when you're negotiating, the better off you are,"  he said. "Access to good information empowers the consumer."  </P> <P> Just as any successful "remodel" requires high-quality craftsmen, our make over  of Southland Home Prices couldn't have been accomplished without the help of  Times' graphics editor Michael Chaplin, computer systems architect Victor  Pulver and copy editor David Van Houten, and Dataquick's vice president of  technical services, Larry Denning, and product development manager Chris Smith.  </P> <P> For more information on this home-price data, or any of the other consumer  services offered by Dataquick, call (800) 553-9997.  </P></p>

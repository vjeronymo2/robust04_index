			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $3.5-BILLION EXTRA-SPENDING BILL PASSED  </P> <P> The House on Friday sent to President Bush a $3.5-billion emergency spending  bill for veterans, education, refugee assistance and other programs requiring a  cash infusion this year.  </P> <P> The fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill, approved by the Senate on  Thursday night, was passed by the House, 318 to 6, two days after the chamber  rejected a version that would have sparked a veto fight with the President.  </P> <P> Bush was expected to sign the revised bill, which was stripped of $821 million  that House Democrats had earmarked for anti-drug programs. The White House  contends that federal agencies already have all the money they can spend this  year.  </P> <P> The new version adds $75 million in anti-drug funds by deferring spending on  two other programs.  </P></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Finnish banks' debt THE CRISIS in Finnish banking prompted Moody's, the US rating agency, to downgrade the debt of five Finnish banks yesterday. The move affects Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Union Bank of Finland, Okobank, Skopbank and Finnish Real Estate Bank (a Skopbank subsidiary), with a total of Dollars 14.4bn in outstanding debt. KOP's senior debt was downgraded to A3 from A2 and its subordinated debt to Baa1 from A3. UBF's senior debt was lowered to A3 from A1 and its subordinated debt to Baa1 from A2. Okobank's senior debt dropped to A2 from Aa3 and subordinated debt to A3 from A1. KOP and UBF had their commercial paper ratings cut to Prime-2 from Prime-1. Moody's said its main concern for the three was the increasing level of non-performing loans and credit write-offs. With Skopbank and the Finnish Real Estate Bank, Moody's said its main worry was 'weakening fundamentals,' given the continuing fall in asset values. Skopbank saw its senior debt downgraded to A2 from Aa3, while the Finnish Real Estate Bank's senior debt was lowered to A1 from Aa2.</p>

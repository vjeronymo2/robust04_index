			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Airfix flies back from US duty Flotillas and squadrons of UK and US military might have been recalled from a lengthy tour of duty on the other side of the Atlantic. Already new plans and strategies have been discussed and morale is rising. The ships and aircraft, being miniature and plastic, are safe from defence cuts. Airfix - a name familiar to boys of all ages - leads the task force. It is part of Humbrol, a Pounds 20m hobby paint products company which also includes Heller, the French model kits maker. Humbrol, which is also the UK's largest supplier of coffin varnish, this week came under the command of Allen McGuire, a Dublin investment partnership. Allen McGuire bought Humbrol from Borden, the US foods group which has agreed to merge with buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Borden bought Humbrol's models, paints and DIY business in the 1980s - Airfix's life as a independent UK company ended in receivership in 1981  - and lodged it briefly alongside resins in its chemicals arm. Humbrol was later moved into the international foods division - the logic being that it made consumer products - where it languished until Borden started slimming down to its core businesses. Mr Mike Ganley, Humbrol's managing director since the beginning of this year, will stay on as chief of staff. He said Allen McGuire had spotted a rare opportunity. Indeed the current top 10 table at Hamleys, the London store, shows traditional toys such as teddy bears, Barbie and Lego eclipsing electronic games. 'Airfix has an exceptionally large mould bank going back 40 years, with about 200 moulds never used,' Mr Ganley said. He is keen to grasp 'whatever hot licensing opportunities come up', and move beyond the military core, though this year's D-Day observances boosted sales and next year's end-of-war anniversary should too. He also wants to build up the DIY side. But kits remain the palace guard. Britain's Institute of Plastic Modellers has about 8,000 members, Mr Ganley noted, 'probably more than in the Institute of Directors'.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Franco Zeffirelli said Thursday that he hopes to "reconquer a lost paradise"  when he directs Mel Gibson in a new screen version of William Shakespeare's  "Hamlet." "It's very seldom that (Shakespearean) plays are done in a way that  kids can identify with . . . and I think I've found a way to accomplish that,"  said Zeffirelli, who achieved success with his movie version of "Romeo and  Juliet" in 1970. Gibson, who once starred in "Romeo and Juliet" on the  Australian stage, said he has always been "excited, exhilarated and  half-frightened by the possibility of having to some day play (Hamlet)." The  actor added that he believes Shakespeare's "soap opera of the day" remains  contemporary in that it deals with human emotions and conflicts, but merely  sets them to beautiful poetry. Production on "Hamlet," which will be produced  by Dyson Lovell ("Lonesome Dove," "The Champ"), is scheduled to begin next  spring. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

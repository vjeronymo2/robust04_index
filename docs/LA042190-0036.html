			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ANOTHER BATCH OF 'TALES FROM THE CRYPT' ON HBO  </P> <P> As perhaps the first television series ever to have every one of its episodes  based on a comic book, HBO's "Tales From the Crypt" has its built-in  limitations. The lessons in the old comics' horrific morality tales weren't  especially sophisticated ones -- mostly limited to be careful what you wish  for, you just might get it, or he who lives by the pickax dies by the pickax  and that sort of thing -- and a modern audience virtually weaned on clever  twists can see the O. Henry-style denouements coming a mile away.  </P> <P> That established, the series does leave ample room to have stylistic fun with  the creaky, campy material, when the directors -- usually established Hollywood  names happily slumming in cable land -- are willing and able. The second batch  of original episodes gets kicked off tonight at 9:30 with a new trilogy of  "Tales," all of which are indisputably of theatrical quality, if not  necessarily good repute.  </P> <P> First up is director Howard Deutch's "Dead Right," which gives Demi Moore a  plum role as a waitress who happens upon a fortune teller with dead-accurate  advice. The fun here is not so much in the tale, which has Moore marrying a  grotesque slob predicted to inherit a fortune, as in the telling --  specifically Moore's sharp, funny characterization of a working girl who works  mostly at developing a premature-yup attitude.  </P> <P> Sandwiched in the middle is the weakest link, "The Switch," in which, in his  directorial debut, Arnold Schwarzenegger (!) tells a competent tale but fails  to coax much of a performance out of Rick Rossovich, Kelly Preston or even  William Hickey. Speaking of O. Henry, the plot, which has elderly Hickey  spending his vast fortune to buy up new body parts in order to win a young  woman, may remind you more than a little of "Gift of the Magi." Passable, it  could've used a helmsman better equipped to directorially pump (clap) it up.  </P> <P> Last -- and best, at least for students of the auteur school -- is "Cutting  Cards," in which director and co-writer Walter Hill ("48 HRS," "Southern  Comfort") reaches the possible apotheosis of his modern-machismo-in-decline  themes. Two obsessive gamblers converge in a town they conclude ain't big  enough for the both of 'em; a series of wagers escalates to squeamish extremes.  Once more, but in more comic fashion, Hill both celebrates and condemns this  ridiculously unbending ethic.  </P> <P> Again, the animatronic Crypt Keeper's introductory admonitions to "kiddies" are  strictly rhetorical. None of this tongue-in-skull material is at all scary, but  the violence and language are unflinchingly R-rated, and the series' penchant  for setting scenes in topless-dancer bars is bare-facedly exploitative.

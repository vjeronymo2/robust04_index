			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries Another generous dividend increase from BAT Industries makes the current valuation of the shares difficult to fathom. Even after the recovery of the last few weeks, BAT stands close to its highest yield relative to the stock market since the early 1980s. The shares also command a substantial yield premium to the composite insurance sector, as they have done since early in 1993. That only makes sense if BAT's insurance operations are expected to fare much worse than the competition, or if the tobacco side of the business will be a brake on dividend growth. Yesterday's half-year figures suggest that neither is the case. Eagle Star is still suffering from the legacy of mortgage indemnity, but is performing in line with its peers in other respects. Allied Dunbar seems to be coping well enough with the regulatory squeeze in life insurance. In tobacco, cigarette volumes rose by 4 per cent after a period of stagnation. The US market appears to have returned to equilibrium following Philip Morris's decision last year to chase market share. Of course there could be shocks in tobacco to come. While the proposed US excise tax now looks likely to be far less onerous than the Dollars 1 per pack suggested last year, the hawkish Food &amp; Drug Administration is hovering. On balance, though, a slow tightening of the regulatory grip looks more likely than a sudden blow. In the meantime cash flow from tobacco makes BAT's promise of real dividend growth look more credible than most.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERGERS EXPECTED TO BE SMALLER IN 1990S  </P> <P> Say farewell to megadeals such as last year's record-setting $25-billion buyout  of RJR Nabisco.  </P> <P> For the next few years, experts say, mergers will be smaller, strategically  motivated and done almost solely by companies with strong balance sheets.  </P> <P> "The merger movement is not dead; it's just hunkering down," said Samuel Hayes,  professor of investment banking at the Harvard Business School.  </P> <P> The value of U.S. mergers plunged to $185.9 billion in the first 10 months of  1990 from $373.4 billion in the same period of 1989, IDD Information Services  says.  </P> <P> While some large deals are being discussed, those actually announced this year  have tended to be small, especially when compared to some of the big 1980s  takeovers.  </P></p>

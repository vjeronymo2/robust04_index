			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAILY BRIEFINGS ON SERIAL KILLINGS HALTED  </P> <P> San Diego police have decided to suspend daily press briefings in connection  with the serial killing of five women in Clairemont and University City, Capt.  Dick Toneck announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> At a briefing outside police headquarters, Toneck said investigators are  pursuing more than 1,700 tips but that not enough new information has surfaced  to warrant regular meetings with the media.  </P> <P> "We're optimistic, we have a lot of leads to work on and we're working them  daily," Toneck said. "We still want more. We're still asking the public to come  forward."  </P> <P> Toneck said he did "not have exact numbers," but said the number of  investigators working the case has declined from last week's peak of 27  detectives and seven senior officers.  </P> <P> He said the large volume of leads has been helpful in solidifying the composite  of the suspect, who is said to be a black male of unknown nationality, 5-foot-7  to 5-foot-10, with a medium build and dark, close-cropped hair.  </P> <P> Without elaborating, Toneck said, "There's a good possibility this person may  have been a Peeping Tom, has been involved with indecent exposure in the past  and may or may not have a criminal record."  </P> <P> He said no outside law enforcement officials have been brought into the case,  but reiterated that the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., was primarily responsible  for putting together a psychological profile of the killer.  </P> <P> "This person is probably a loner," Toneck said. "He does not like authority and  probably handles menial jobs, if he has a job. He's not great at interpersonal  relationships and probably has a high school education at best."  </P> <P> The suspect is wanted in connection with these killings:  </P> <P> * Tiffany Paige Schultz, a 20-year-old San Diego State University student,  found stabbed to death in her Clairemont apartment in the 3100 block of Cowley  Way on Jan. 12.  </P> <P> * Janene Marie Weinhold, a 21-year-old UC San Diego student, found stabbed to  death in her apartment in the 3300 block of Clairemont Drive, two blocks from  where Schultz lived, on Feb. 16.  </P> <P> * Holly Suzanne Tarr, an 18-year-old high school senior from Okemos, Mich.,  found stabbed to death in her brother's Clairemont apartment in the 3400 block  of Cowley Way on April 3.  </P> <P> * Pamela Gail Clark, 42, and daughter Amber, 18, a Mesa College student, found  stabbed to death in their home in the 5800 block of Honors Drive in University  City on Sept. 13.  </P></p>

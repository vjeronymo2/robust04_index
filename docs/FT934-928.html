			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / People: EMAP's chair Stockbroker Graham Ross Russell, 60, who has been associated with media group EMAP since the early 1960s, is to hand over the chairmanship to Burton's chairman Sir John Hoskyns, 66, at the start of EMAP's financial year next April. It is over a year since Ross Russell, who has been chairman since 1990, announced that he was looking for a successor. 'My real love is medium and small companies,' says Ross Russell, who joined the board of Emap when it was making profits of just Pounds 150,000. He has not said whether he will retire from the EMAP board but indicates that he does not think it is a good idea for ex-chairmen to remain, especially when they had been on the board for 23 years. Ross Russell says Sir John has been picked partly for his knowledge of large companies, which he acquired during his stint as director general of the Institute of Directors, and for his City connections. He is a director of Clerical Medical &amp; General Life Assurance. Although Sir John is reasonably old to be taking on another non-executive chairmanship, Ross Russell says he 'does not act or appear his age'. Sir John will be expected to spend 'one or two days' a week on EMAP business.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Management: Whizz kids slow down - The City is confused by Hanson's new strategy Hanson, Britain's best known conglomerate, is undergoing one of its biggest changes since Lords Hanson and White started out in business in 1963. According to its new generation of management, Hanson is no longer a trader in assets, but an industrial group dedicated to building and managing its core businesses. The very concept of a core business used to be anathema to Hanson, as any of its parts could be up for sale at any time. The management believed that to label a business as 'core' sent out the wrong message, implying that Hanson would not sell it. Lords Hanson and White would consider buying a cigarette business one year, a gold mine the next, and then think about adding an electricity generator. The 'last of the swashbuckling whizz kids' (as Lord White once described the two of them) executed their policy with breathtaking speed. The 'swashbuckling' aspect of the group started to look outdated last year when Hanson decided to take a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI turned the tables on Hanson, attacking its management to great effect. Earlier this year David Clarke and Bob Raos were appointed chief executive and chief operating officer respectively of Hanson Industries, the group's North American arm, and Mr Derek Bonham was appointed chief executive of the PLC based in London. The new team want to continue to build on Hanson's traditional skills at buying and selling assets. The difference is that they no longer want to be defined by those skills. In the nineties they believe Hanson's central role should be managing and expanding core businesses - natural resources such as coal and timber and tobacco. As Mr Bonham put it: 'There are a number of businesses, such as Cavenham Forests (in the US), where increasingly you want to be number two or three in the industry as opposed to number six or seven.' Acquisitions, therefore, will have to fit into the core businesses or be so big that they can stand alone as a separate core business. A lot of the smaller businesses which cannot be built into the new framework, valued at around Pounds 700m, are likely to be sold. Hanson's strategy has confused some analysts. They have pointed to conflicting statements coming out of the company. While Clarke talks of the sale of portfolio companies, Martin Taylor, vice chairman, denies that there are any plans for immediate disposals; Bonham talks about degearing the balance sheet as Lord White talks about creating a new property business. Mr Mike Smith, conglomerates analysts at Robert Fleming Securities, says: 'The signals from Hanson are very confusing; the City wants to know what the new management is looking to do and whether the old management is in full agreement.' Lord Hanson angrily denies suggestions of disagreements, and says the issue is about emphasis. He accepts the Clarke/Bonham thesis on core businesses but suggests it is nothing new. 'We are not breakers of businesses. We have got to emphasise our tremendously capable managers who are building those businesses.' He confirms that some of Hanson's smaller businesses will go at the right time. But this should not, he adds, be interpreted as meaning that all of them will be sold. At the very least this is a significant repositioning of the group's strategy. Lord Hanson may have known all along that Hanson would develop into an industrial materials company but it is new to most commentators following his company. As Jeremy Marshall, a former senior Hanson operations executive and now head of the bank note printer De La Rue, once put it: 'Hanson was best known not for the organic growth of companies but for buying groups and selling them on.' Could it be that the new management believes Hanson has to evolve into an industrial materials company because there are no longer any opportunities to do mega deals? Supporters of Hanson's new management say there is a more compelling reason for the new strategy. The ratio of Hanson's share price to the market average fell by almost 10 per cent last year when the group was under fire from ICI. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which took the lead in London in attacking Hanson on behalf of ICI, recently published a buy note in the US, arguing that the new strategy would improve the shares' rating. As the group's strategy changed so has the role of the centre at Hanson. Mr Bonham says: 'The responsibility of the centre is to motivate the management. We have spent a lot of time devising appropriate programmes for key managers and making sure we get the right people into the right slots.' Lord Hanson is equally forthright. 'We are an industrial mangement company; we have a portfolio of industrial companies and sometimes it's necessary to dispose of part of the portfolio.' The problem for Hanson is the City does not quite believe it. It senses that the new management is intent on changing the strategy but it is unsure of how far Lord Hanson supports the changes. Lord Hanson believes it is just a question of time. As more of the decisions go out in the name of the new management there will be less opportunity to talk of splits and disagreements. The group's strategy will be executed by the new management which will have soon consumed 'more and more' of Lord White and Hanson's jobs. 'You never know when I've retired because I will be gone and nobody will notice it', says Hanson. 'People in the building will laugh. But the fact of the matter is that will happen.'</p>

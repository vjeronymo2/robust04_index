			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERKELEY MAYORAL ELECTION MAY HANG ON COURT RULING  </P> <P> A judge will decide if "better late than never" holds true in the runoff  election for mayor of Berkeley, where a smattering of last-minute absentee  ballots may determine the political orientation of the city.  </P> <P> Although incumbent Mayor Loni Hancock appeared Wednesday to lead challenger  Fred Weekes, her margin of victory was narrow enough that the outcome could  hang on absentee ballots that are the focus of a court fight.  </P> <P> The runoff was forced when Hancock, a leader of the city's liberal Berkeley  Citizens Action Party, got 49.9% of the vote Nov. 6, narrowly missing the  50%-plus-one requirement. The liberal Democratic coalition has dominated city  politics for a decade.  </P> <P> The outcome could be determined by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Howard  Schwartz, who will hear arguments Friday on whether absentee ballots that  arrived after the polls closed on Tuesday should be counted.  </P> <P> The election code says that absentee ballots can be counted only if received by  Election Day. But opponents of Hancock say that as many as 3,000 of 8,000  requested ballots weren't mailed out until last week, reaching voters as late  as Monday.  </P> <P> "We won't know the number of ballots involved for a while," City Clerk Marie  McKetchnie said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Hancock led Weekes, a city councilman, by only 590 votes in unofficial results  of Tuesday's election. But Weekes, a moderate Democrat who wants to eliminate  "ideological practices" from City Hall, asked the judge to allow the counting  of mail-in ballots postmarked before the polls closed but not received until  after Election Day.  </P> <P> "There are a large number of uncounted ballots out there," Weekes said. "I  don't know how large, but it could change the outcome."  </P> <P> With all 116 precincts reporting, Weekes trailed Hancock 16,682 to 16,092 but  led 2,403 to 1,624 among early absentee ballots, which usually favor more  conservative candidates. Depending on the judge's decision, remaining absentee  ballots could change the outcome.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Hancock, who during the campaign promised to continue  Berkeley's liberal tradition, was confident that the mayor would remain in  office given her edge.  </P> <P> "If the absentee ballots split in the same ratio as the earlier absentee  ballots, there is no way Mr. Weekes can win the election," said Malcom  Bernstein, treasurer of the Hancock campaign.  </P> <P> Hancock, 52, is the most prominent member of the Berkeley Citizens Action  Party, which was born in the fervor of the 1960s anti-Vietnam War, youth and  civil rights movements.  </P> <P> The coalition lost control of the council and the rent board in the November  election. Hancock's defeat could mean the end of the group's dominance.  </P></p>

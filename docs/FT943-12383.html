			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Bombing death toll in Argentina reaches 96 Rescue workers in Buenos Aires yesterday pulled 27 more bodies from the wreckage of Argentina's main Jewish centre and said there were 11 more still in the rubble, bringing the confirmed toll from last week's bombing to 96, Reuter reports. Jewish groups, which have collected lists of those missing after the blast, say the final death toll may be around 100. General Meir Livne, who heads an Israeli army rescue team, confirmed theories of a car bomb driven by a suicide driver. 'The crater in the road and the sidewalk, and the engine we found inside the building point to a car bomb,' he said. 'We think it may have been activated by the driver.' The blast was the second such attack against Jews in Buenos Aires in two years, 30 people having been killed by a car bomb at the Israeli embassy in 1992. Mr Uzi Baram, Israeli tourism minister, was to meet Argentine President Carlos Menem yesterday to ask the government to do its utmost to catch the bombers. Mr Peter Tarnoff, US State Department under-secretary, also arrived in Argentina for talks with Mr Menem, the US embassy said.</p>

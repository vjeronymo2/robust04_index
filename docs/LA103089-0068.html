			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> AFGHANISTAN;  </P> <P> REBELS RAIN MORE ROCKETS ON KABUL  </P> <P> Thirteen more rebel rockets slammed into Kabul, killing four people and  wounding 14, in a continuation of a weekend attack that diplomats called one of  the biggest assaults since Soviet troops pulled out in February. At least 22  missiles slammed into the capital Saturday, killing 12 people. Outside the  city, moujahedeen rebels kept up their blockade of the vital Salang highway in  an effort to starve the Afghan capital of food and fuel. The threat of ambush  has stalled a convoy of more than 1,000 trucks from moving toward Kabul.  </P></p>

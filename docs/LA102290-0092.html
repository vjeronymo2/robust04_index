			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ART AFFORDS INSIGHT INTO ALZHEIMER'S  </P> <P> Gertrude Frazier had never picked up a paintbrush before this year. Now, at 85,  her watercolor "Through These Fields to School" will tour the county as part of  "Memories in the Making," a show of artworks by patients with Alzheimer's  disease.  </P> <P> "We think it's fantastic," said Phyllis Garrett, Frazier's daughter. "This has  just thrilled her to death. She still understands that something special is  happening."  </P> <P> The second annual "Memories" show, which opened at the Guggenheim Gallery of  Chapman College last week, features works by 26 Alzheimer's patients from three  Orange County adult care centers.  </P> <P> Beginning later this month and continuing through Dec. 11, the 33 paintings and  pastel and pencil drawings will tour 16 Home Savings of America branches  throughout the county. The show was curated by the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange  County.  </P> <P> Alzheimer's, an incurable, degenerative disease that attacks the brain,  afflicts about 40,000 people in Orange County and 4 million nationwide.  </P> <P> Selly Jenny, the show's organizer, said painting gives the patients a hard-won  sense of accomplishment.  </P> <P> "For years and years, they may have been struggling with inner humiliation and  embarrassment because they carry this consciousness that they are losing it,"  Jenny said. "But the art world is a totally non-threatening world. You can't  make a mistake when you're doing a picture."  </P> <P> The show is also a public information tool, Jenny said, and provides a rare  positive profile of Alzheimer's patients.  </P> <P> The artworks, figurative and impressionistic, childlike and sophisticated, were  created without assistance, Jenny said.  </P> <P> Dr. Carl Cotman, director of the UCI Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Center,  believes that the works have the "signature" of Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> "If you ask a person with a migraine headache to do a painting, it looks like a  migraine headache," Cotman explained. "Alzheimer's paintings are humanistic,  colorful and refreshing. They're telling you that's what's in there . . . a  certain youthful vigor and enthusiasm."  </P> <P> The art may offer a key to understanding a patient's capacity for memory and  comprehension, he said.  </P> <P> "To be able to say what's there and what's not will tell us a lot about what  people are, really," Cotman said.  </P> <P> The art may also provide a "conceptual breakthrough" in the way the public and  medical experts look at Alzheimer's patients in the future, he said, adding  that he plans to study the condition of several artists in the show.  </P> <P> "You've got a glimmer that something is doable, positive and uplifting," Cotman  said, "and that's what we need to work with."  </P> <P> For more information on Alzheimer's disease, contact the Alzheimer's Assn. of  Orange County at (714) 631-0245.

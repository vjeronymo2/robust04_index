			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- A four-day national  meeting on promotion of overseas investment ended here today.  Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with all the participants and  Premier Li Peng delivered a speech at the meeting.    Since China began implementing the policies of reform and  opening to the outside world 15 years ago, more and more foreign  investment has poured into the country, especially in the past  two years.    The contracted foreign investment volume in 1992 exceeded  the  total for the 13 years before while that of 1993 doubled 1992's.    Officials in charge of the foreign investment promotion work  in the State Council, provinces and municipalities attended the  meeting.    In the meeting with the participants, President Jiang  affirmed the accomplishments in using overseas investment in the  past 15 years and encouraged the participants to do a better job  in the use of overseas capital.    Jiang noted that the overseas investment has played a  positive role in China's economic development.    To attract more foreign investment, Li Peng pointed out in  his speech that China should better the investment environment,  establish a comprehensive legal system, perfect the market  mechanism, improve the work efficiency of the government and  enhance the professional quality of the personnel.    China not only has cheap labor and many technicians but also  a market with large potential, Li said, adding that these  advantages could attract more foreign investment and enable  investors to obtain legal profits.    However, Li stressed, China will not attract foreign  investment at the expense of its socialist culture and morals.    Li said that China would pay more attention to its  cooperation with international financial consortiums and large  transnational enterprises.    Chinese enterprises and foreign investors should both  benefit  from cooperation, Li said, adding that China should not only  concentrate on introducing foreign investment, but also protect  the interests of overseas investors and strengthen its  administration over foreign-funded enterprises according to law.    Li said that China will draft comprehensive industrial  policies to guide the distribution of foreign investment and  avoid blind or redundant investments.    China can also introduce foreign capital to transform old  state-run enterprises, Li said. But the assessment of  state-owned properties should be strengthened to avoid the  drain-off of state-owned properties.    As for China's ability to pay foreign debts, Li said the  country should do its best to ensure its ability to repay the  principal and interest. He added that as long as the economic  efficiency of the enterprises is good, there will be no problem  in repayment.    The premier also stressed the necessity to protect the legal  interests of Chinese workers in foreign-funded enterprises.    Chinese vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing also  attended  the meeting.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Belgium cuts rates AFTER Tuesday's cuts in German and Dutch money market rates, Belgium lowered its key interest rates sharply yesterday, taking advantage of the strength of its currency, writes Conner Middelmann. It reduced its central rate to 8.30 per cent from 9.40 per cent and its discount rate to 5.50 per cent from 6.00 per cent. This followed a government agreement on a programme of austerity measures designed to stem the growing deficit in the social security budget, address unemployment and boost companies' competitiveness. The recent rash of European rate cuts spurred talk that France will be the next to ease, with some dealers calling for a reduction in the 6.45 per cent intervention rate at today's round of securities repurchase agreements. The December PIBOR futures contract rose 10 basis points to 93.67. However, many expect France to continue taking its time over rate reductions. 'The Bank of France will let the overnight rate slide along with the German repo rate, and will first try to reduce the gap between the intervention rate and the overnight rate,' said Mr Dominique Barbet, econ-omist with Paribas Capital Markets in Paris. The overnight rate traded around 6 13/16 per cent yesterday and he said it could slip to 6 3/4 per cent today. 'The French economy needs lower rates, but as long as the authorities want the franc to stay firm, they will have to maintain a certain spread in French short-term rates over Germany's,' he added. The French intervention rate is 70 basis points above Germany's discount rate. The Bundesbank's central bank council meets today, but according to a Reuters poll, 18 out of 20 European economists surveyed did not expect the German central bank to cut rates today. In the UK money market, the short sterling contract jumped on lower than expected retail sales and inflation data which fuelled speculation of significant base rate cuts in, or around the time of, the November 30 Budget. 'Many people are now looking for a total one-point base rate cut before the end of the year,' said a senior money dealer. The short sterling future rose 0.16 point to 94.63. After announcing an initial shortage of Pounds 1bn, the Bank purchased a total of Pounds 293m in its market operations and provided late assistance of around Pounds 350m.</p>

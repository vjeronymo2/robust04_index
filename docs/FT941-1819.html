			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (7): What the European Union aims to achieve According to the Commission's policy outline, the principal areas where the European Union is creating a more favourable environment for the drug industry are: The European Medicines Evaluation Agency - due to come into operation from 1995 in its London base, and providing rapid access to the single market through new product authorisation procedures: A centralised procedure, leading to a single authorisation for the whole of the EU reserved for certain new medicinal products and mandatory for those derived from biotechnology. A decentralised procedure, designed for most medicinal products, based on mutual recognition of national marketing authorisations (with disputes to be settled by binding EU arbitration). The proceedure should provide faster authorisations (300 days instead of several years), and keep down cost increases in authorisation processing. It should also enhance consumer confidence and improve public health protection. It will help in due course to reduce the diversity from market to market in information about therapeutic indications, side effects, presentation and package size. Recent legislation includes: A directive on wholesale distribution of medicines will facilitate and stimulate intra-Community trade whilst ensuring the integrity of transactions, regulating recall of defective products, and deterring counterfeit products. Directives on medicines advertising, labelling and leaflets will improve information for patients, limit waste, and impose requirements on promotion to health professionals. Patent protection: A new regulation ensures intellectual property protection of up to 15 years from the date of first marketing of a medicine in the EU. A common position was adopted in February on the revised draft directive on legal protection of biotechnological inventions, opening the way for definite adoption during 1994. A stable and safe environment for new biotechnology projects: Co-operation between the EU and member-states should improve in order to avoid duplication of research and development projects. It will be necessary to bring greater attention to ethical questions associated with certain applications of biotechnology and to enhance public understanding. A review of the regulatory framework in the light of advances in scientific knowledge. Programmes better suited to pharmaceutical research and development: Encourage multi-disciplinary research and industry/university inter-action. Promote integration and co-operation between pre-normative research and R&amp;D  -as in the project Fourth Framework Programme 1994-1998, now in the final stages of discussion. Evolve research priorities in pharmaceutical research, via pilot projects.</p>

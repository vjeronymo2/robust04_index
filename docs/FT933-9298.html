			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: BOC hit on profit warning THE MARKET'S enthusiasm for BOC shares, which has taken the price up from a mid-July level of 640p to 703p, evaporated yesterday as the company accompanied its third quarter results with a warning that full-year results will not match those of last year. The profits warning, which came at the end of the official company results bulletin, was a bolt from the blue for the market. Dealers at first queried the profits warning news and then proceeded to demolish the BOC share price. The stock price opened tentatively at 686p but quickly retreated to what proved to be the day's low of 651p, a net fall of 63p. Turnover in BOC accelerated to 9.9m shares, the heaviest single day's business since 1986. Analysts were shocked by the profits warning. One said: 'The figures were around the bottom range of estimates but were okay. But the real worry around the market was that the company offered no real reason for the warning at the post-figures meeting. And you have to remember that most of the big broking firms have been bulls of the shares in recent months. To say the least, there is a lot of investor dissatisfaction around the market.' Dealers said there was every chance the shares would come under further pressure this morning. Profits forecast for the current year, previously in the region of Pounds 365m, have now been reduced to just below the Pounds 341m the company achieved last year.</p>

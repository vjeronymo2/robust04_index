			<p>BFN     [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Russia must unilaterally  halt its participation in implementing the international  sanctions imposed against the Republic of Yugoslavia. This is  stated in a law that deputies passed in its first reading today.    In the opinion of one of those who drew up the draft law,  Deputy Vladimir Isakov, this document is important from the  internal political viewpoint, as well as from the international  viewpoint.    [Begin Isakov recording] This is the first time that we have  moved into the sphere of foreign policy, although, according to  the Constitution, we do have this right, precisely in the form  of adopting a law. This was a very difficult step for the Duma,  too. It is possible that there will be reaction not only to the  content of the law, but also to the Duma's display of  independence on this question. You know that the president  reacts very painfully to any display of independence by other  state bodies. [end recording]    [Announcer] It must be said that the law has yet to undergo  its second reading and also to receive approval from the  Federation Council and the president. If this approval is not  received, the State Duma can adopt the law by a constitutional  majority, that is by two-thirds of the votes.    Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs  Committee, told our radio station about the possible  consequences if this law is approved.    [Begin Lukin recording] It is an extremely incompetent,  declarative, and demagogic law. Moreover, it is also  anti-Serbian. If this law is adopted it will mean the unilateral  lifting of sanctions on our part. Naturally, no one will join  in with us. On the other hand, it will also mean the automatic  lifting of the embargo on the delivery of weapons to Bosnia.  This will, naturally, mean massive economic, military, and all  sorts of other aid--a sharp increase by the Western side. Well,  if you compare our economic potential with the West's economic  potential, then you will understand whom this law will benefit.  [end recording]</p>

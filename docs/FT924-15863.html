			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Tale of strict rules, poor enforcement and greed IN THE narrow lane outside the Bombay stock exchange, brokers spread piles of application forms on car bonnets and urge passers-by to apply for the latest offering of shares. The slightest breeze whisks sheaves of paper into the air and sends brokers scurrying to retrieve them. Street vendors do brisk business selling lunch on the pavement to hundreds of men, young and old, milling around and arguing over share prices. This is Dalal Street, the financial centre of India. Despite the decrepit telephone network and streets clogged with traffic, Bombay throbs with commercial activity. Inevitably, regulators find it hard to keep pace with practitioners. The contrast between fast growth and slow-footed supervision is at the heart of the Rs35bn (Pounds 717m) financial scandal which has rocked India this year. The authorities promoted expansion of India's financial markets as a key ingredient in the country's economic reform programme, but failed to modernise supervisory systems at the same pace. India's scandal is an object lesson for other developing countries. The affair is being investigated by the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank), the government's Central Bureau of Investigation, and a joint parliamentary committee. Banks and brokers are so busy supplying information to these agencies that they have time for little else. The committee alone has demanded 50 copies of every relevant document. The inquiries have revealed that the centre of abuse was an informal market for the trading of securities between banks, in which stockbrokers acted as middlemen. Standard Chartered Bank, the British-owned institution which has been operating in India for more than 130 years, has suffered the largest loss, currently put at Rs8.9bn, though it hopes to recover some of its money through legal action. Other hard-hit banks include State Bank of India, largest of the government-owned banks which dominate Indian banking, National Housing Bank, a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank, and two small banks which have collapsed - the Bank of Karad and the Metropolitan Co-operative Bank. The affair erupted in April at the tail-end of a boom on the Bombay stock market which saw prices rise three-fold in less than a year. The central bank had been growing suspicious about how investors were securing funds since loans for speculative investment are banned. A brief strike by stockbrokers then disturbed settlement payments and revealed discrepancies in accounts. The authorities started a probe into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, a 39-year-old self-made broker who earned the nickname Big Bull for his part in driving up share prices. Mr Mehta never discussed the source of his funds, but investigators alleged the money was illegally diverted from banks and charged Big Bull with fraud. He was arrested in June and freed on bail in September. As panic spread in the financial community in early May, dealings in the stock market came to a standstill and banks re-examined their books. To their horror, Standard Chartered, the State Bank of India and others discovered evidence of heavy losses. The official investigations widened. The criminal probes have focused on two targets - Mr Mehta, who was charged with using forged documents to defraud banks, including the State Bank of India; and a group of brokers and bankers centred upon Mr Bhupen Dalal, doyen of Bombay's financiers and head of the country's largest brokerage, who have been accused of defrauding Standard Chartered. Mr Mehta, Mr Dalal and their co-accused deny the allegations, saying their extensive dealings with the banks came from legitimate securities transactions. The scandal's origin lay in India's tight banking regulations. Banks are required to lodge 30 per cent (before April, 38 per cent) of their deposits with the Reserve Bank in low-yielding government securities to help fund the government's budget deficit. Another central bank rule sets an artificially low ceiling on the maximum rates paid on deposits. In order to maximise profits on their assets, banks started trading the securities among themselves in short-term re-purchase agreements or 'repos', which in India are called 'ready forwards'. To attract funds, particularly from large corporations, banks established 'portfolio management schemes' on which they paid much higher rates of interest. These funds were mostly invested in the inter-bank securities market in order to maximise returns. The central bank estimates fully 26 per cent of inter-bank trading was on behalf of investment clients. The expansion of Indian banking markets, with the onset of financial deregulation, stimulated 'repo' trading. Moreover, banks ignored central bank rules and diversified the market from the legally sanctioned trade in government bonds to paper issued by public corporations. Foreign banks were particularly active, attracting top dealers with promises of high pay and big bonuses. The Reserve Bank estimates that the four top foreign banks - Citibank and Bank of America of the US, Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays of Australia - accounted for 50 per cent of inter-bank securities trading. The champion was Citibank, which pioneered computer-managed trading and, according to central bank figures, captured 56 per cent of the lucrative portfolio management-related trade. A Reserve Bank report published in August said banks including Citibank and Bank of America violated its guidelines in a number of ways, in effect using portfolio management schemes as deposit substitutes. Both banks denied wrongdoing. While trading changed out of all recognition through rapid growth, settlement procedures did not. The rules require securities transactions to be painstakingly entered by hand in a central bank ledger. But the system is so cumbersome that banks frequently stopped transferring the underlying securities and instead issued receipts to each other via the brokers. When a repurchased agreement ended, these bankers' receipts could be returned or simply thrown away. Traders had to think fast in a rapidly moving market. Stocks were rising quickly in the year before the scandal but bond prices were falling, forced down by successive interest rate increases. This created three pressures on banks and brokers. First some were tempted to sell bonds forward - to sell securities they did not yet own in the hope of buying them back later at a cheaper price. Second, banks were tempted to slip funds surreptitiously through brokers into the stock market, in contravention of central bank rules. Third, some influential brokers, who were dubbed the 'bear cartel' because they did not believe in the strength of the equity boom, ran short of stock. They suffered heavy losses, which banks - again by breaking rules - helped to finance. The lack of an efficient settlement system allowed such transactions to be disguised. Forgeries and photocopies circulated. Deals were done at artificial prices to cover up losses or disguise transfers of funds to brokers. The central bank warned banks in a circular as early as July last year to stop fictitious deals. But to no avail. One foreign banker says: 'I can't think of any institution that didn't do this.' In such turmoil, it was imperative for banks (and brokers) to have first-class internal controls. However, no large Indian bank had computers in its treasury, and nor did Standard Chartered. It is no coincidence that the three other foreign banks all apparently escaped without serious financial losses and all had computerised control of treasuries. Aside from the investigations into Mr Mehta and the alleged fraud at Standard Chartered the Indian authorities have set their sights on other targets: The joint parliamentary committee is seeking to establish the extent to which the reserve bank tolerated abuses. The committee has found that though the central bank had issued specific warnings to banks in July 1991 it was aware that the rules on securities trading were still being flouted afterwards. The committee is gunning for foreign banks, an easy prey in nationalistic India. Citibank is a favourite target, as it was a pioneer in the market. Appearing before the committee this week, Citibank executives denied being involved in any frauds. But they admitted violating a central bank ban on accepting portfolio management funds from state-owned enterprises. They also admitted using Vijay Bank, a small Indian bank, as an agent to gather funds from state-owned enterprises. These are important concessions, as Citibank had previously denied claims levelled by the central bank that it had violated guidelines. The Indian press is keen to unearth links between the scandal and public figures. So far, only two national figures have had to resign, both over financial links with brokers involved in the affair. They are Mr P Chidambaram, the commerce minister and a keen advocate of economic reform, and Mr V Krishnamurthy, a former leading public sector industrialist and technocrat. Amid all the detail, Indians retain a keen sense of the ambitions which fuelled the affair. As Mr R Janakiraman, deputy reserve bank governor, says: 'Ultimately, this is about the greed of men for making money. It comes down to that.'</p>

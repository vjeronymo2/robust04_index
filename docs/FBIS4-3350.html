			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Tai (1728 3141) and Zong Yuanyuan (1350 0337 </F> 0337): "Experts Analyze and Forecast China's Economic  Development Trend"]    [Text] Not long ago, "China's Macroeconomic Analysis  System" conducted its sixth survey of the economic situation.  Questionnaires were sent to 200 relevant experts and 158 were  collected, the return rate being 79 percent.  <H5>  I. Assessment of the Economic Development Trend in 1993 </H5>   The survey findings indicate that the experts affirmed and  felt satisfied with the measures taken by the central government  to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. They also  pointed out the problems in economic development. The  prevailing opinions are as follows: 1) Among the experts, 75.9  percent consider that economic development maintained the  momentum of a fairly high growth, but its speed tended to be too  fast, exceeding the sustaining power of the infrastructure and  the basic industries; 2) 74.6 percent think the measures of  macroeconomic regulation and control were rational and that the  force with which the measures were implemented was appropriate.  As a result, positive results were attained, promoting  improvement in the relationship between supply and demand; and  3) 53 percent think money supply was still too great and there  was no clear evidence to show that the trend of soaring prices  had been reined in. The experts are deeply worried about high  price levels and consider this the chief factor that might  affect the smooth introduction of the reform measures this year  and the healthy development of the national economy.    The experts expressed their opinions on those more  conspicuous problems in economic life in 1993:    --Judgment on the causes of the chaotic economic order that  occurred in the first half of 1993. Over half the experts hold  that economic disorder mainly manifested itself in the monetary  disorder. Among the experts, 35.4 percent blame the  ineffectiveness of the macroeconomic regulation and control  measures by the central bank, 21.5 percent blame the  nonstandardized conduct of the banks and other monetary  institutions, 20.3 percent blame the overemphasis on economic  growth, 11.4 percent blame overinvestment in real estate and in  marketable securities, and 3.8 percent blame the fact that the  planned management structure was weakened.    --Analysis of the shortage of funds of state-owned  enterprises in the latter half of 1993. Comparatively speaking,  the experts focus more attention on the problems of state-owned  enterprises themselves. The main causes accounting for the  shortage of funds of state-owned enterprises are listed  according to the number of experts who selected them: Low  benefits of state-owned enterprises (22.8 percent), irrational  orientation of funds investment (21.5 percent), irrational  product mix (12.7 percent), high economic growth (10.1 percent),  lagging reform of the investment system (10.1 percent), and  irrational behavior by banks (8.9 percent).    --Analysis of the phenomenon that the pace of economic  growth  decreased month by month while the retail price index remained  high in the latter half of 1993, and especially the price hike  at the end of last year. There were nine choices in the survey  for the experts to choose from. Here is the list of the main  causes which more experts selected: First, as the price index  is an indicator which lags behind, the rapid economic growth and  the excessive scale of investment in the first half of the year  was inevitably reflected in the price index in the latter half  of the year (39.2 percent); second, the big price hike in daily  necessities correspondingly brought about a rather strong chain  effect (24.1 percent); third, the year 1993 was a crucial year  for pushing the reform in various fields comprehensively.  However, people expected high inflation and there were signs of  unstable customer mentality owing to certain deviations in the  guidance of public opinion and the lack of explanation (17.7  percent); fourth, given that the economy grew at a high speed,  while the supply and demand relationship tended to be strained,  the increase in costs drove up prices more quickly (10.1  percent).  <H5>  II. Predictions of the Economic Situation in 1994 </H5>   1. The questionnaire included a comprehensive set of  questions about the development of the national economy in 1994.  The experts generally agree that the national economy will  maintain the momentum of a fairly quick development.    --On GNP growth rate, 40.5 percent of the specialists think  it will stand at 9 to 11 percent, while 38 percent think it will  be 11 to 13 percent and 19 percent think it will be 13 to 15  percent. No one thinks that the growth rate will be lower than  9 percent. This shows that the experts generally consider that  the economic growth rate this year will remain high.    --On the industrial growth rate, 49.4 percent of the experts  think it will stand at 17 to 20 percent, while 24.1 percent  think it will be at 20 to 25 percent and 17.7 percent think it  will be at 15 to 17 percent.    --The growth of the consumer goods market is considered on  the whole to be just the same as last year. Among the experts,  44.3 percent predict the growth rate of volume of retail sales  will stand at 16 to 20 percent, while 32.9 percent think it will  be at 20 to 24 percent and 17.7 percent think it will be at 12  to 16 percent.    --On the growth rate of the fixed-asset investment scale,  29.1 percent of the experts consider the growth rate will be 35  to 40 percent, 25.3 percent consider it will be over 40 percent,  and 19 percent consider it will be 30 to 35 percent.    --On the financial situation, 43 percent of the experts  hold that the financial deficit will on the whole remain the  same as last year, 38 percent hold that it will be higher than  last year and 17.7 percent hold that it will be lower than in  1993.    --On the banking situatuon, 41.8 percent of the experts  think  that money supply (M2) will increase by 25 to 30 percent, 22.8  percent think it will increase by 30 to 35 percent and 16.5  percent think it will increase by 20 to 25 percent.    --On the increase in the general level of retail prices 32.9  percent of the experts think the increase will be 10 to 12  percent, 29.1 percent think it will be 8 to 10 percent and 22.8  percent think it will be 12 to 14 percent.    2. The experts attach great importance to the inadequate  supply capacity of infrastructure and basic industry. They make  predictions of the supply and demand trend in railroad  transportation, energy and raw materials. They consider that  railroad transportation is the strongest restraint on economic  development, while energy comes next and raw materials supply  after that.    On railroads: 1) 48.1 percent of the experts hold that the  gap between supply and demand will further increase; 2) 45.6  percent hold that it will remain at the same level as in 1993;  3) 3.8 percent hold that there will be a basic balance between  supply and demand; and 4) 2.5 percent hold that supply will  exceed demand.    On energy: 1) 35.4 percent hold that the gap between supply  and demand will further increase; 2) 59.5 percent hold that it  will remain at the same level as in 1993; 3) 2.6 percent hold  that there will be a basic balance between supply and demand; 4)  2.5 percent hold that supply will exceed demand.    On raw materials: 1) 22.8 percent hold that the gap between  supply and demand will further increase; 2) 50.6 percent hold  that it will remain at the same level as in 1993; 3) 22.8  percent hold that there will be a basic balance between supply  and demand; 4) 3.8 percent hold that supply will exceed demand.  III. Suggestions Concerning the Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control and Economic Restructuring in 1994 [subhead]    1. Suggestions about the macroeconomic regulation and  control.    --The experts point out that it is necessary to further  improve the macroeconomic regulation and control to create a  good external environment for the introduction of various reform  measures. On the question of the force of its implementation,  55.7 percent of the experts think it should be kept the same as  in 1993, while 25.7 percent think it should be relaxed and 16.5  percent think it should be strengthened.    --On the question of interest rate policy, 62 percent of the  experts think it should be maintained at the level of 1993 while  32.9 percent think it should be properly raised.    --On the question of the exchange rate policy, 45.6 percent  of the experts suggest keeping the renminbi exchange rate at the  present level, i.e. 8.7 yuan to $1, 36.7 percent suggest that it  should be devalued to the proper extent, while 13.9 percent  suggest that it should be revalued. The combination of the  exchange rates of the renminbi and its exchange under control is  approved by 83.5 percent. They consider the timing appropriate.    2. Suggestions about economic restructuring.    a. The experts point out that the most urgent task at  present  is to establish the socialist market economy system. They  suggest that the current major tasks be arranged in the  following order: Establish a modern enterprise system (38  percent); quicken the reform of macroeconomic regulation and  control measures such as the tax, banking, and investment  systems (24.1 percent); establish and perfect an open,  competitive and orderly market system (17.8 percent); and  quicken the establishment of a social security system (15.2  percent).    The experts hold that it is highly necessary to quicken the  reform of the tax, banking, and investment systems. Practicing  the tax-sharing system is supported by 84 percent of the  experts; 82 percent are for raising the proportion of the  central finance in the total financial revenue; 60 percent are  for the establishment of policy-oriented banks, separating  policy-oriented business from commercial business; and most  experts consider that growth in the investment in fixed assets  has a lot to do with the investment system and 91 percent of  them are for the reform of the investment system.    b. The experts pay special attention to the improvement of  the enterprise environment for external development. The  problems of the environment for development in state-owned  enterprises are listed in the order of their importance: No  well-defined line on property rights of enterprises (34.2  percent); lagging conversion of government function,  nonstandardized behavior and too much interference in production  and operation activities of enterprises (29.2 percent); heavy  social burdens of enterprises (19 percent); failure in actual  implementation of the "Regulations" (12.7 percent).    c. The experts also emphasize that great attention should be  paid to handling the relationship between reform and development  so as to avoid continuously widening the differences in economic  and social development between regions. Among the experts, 86.1  percent hold that the central government should shoulder the  responsibility for formulating a policy that is favorable to  accelerated economic development in the middle and western parts  of the country; 6.3 percent hold that reducing the differences  should mainly rely on the efforts of the localities; while 7.6  percent hold that the strategy favoring development in the  coastal areas should be continued and that it will be readjusted  when the productive forces develop further.</p>

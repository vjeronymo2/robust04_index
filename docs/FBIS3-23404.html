Prominent Lebanese religious leader, Allamah Sayyid Hasan  Fadlallah, commenting on the incident, said here today that the  massacre of the innocent people and students could not be  justified under any excuse, political or religious. Lashing out  at the international organizations and the United States for  their deadly silence towards the latest Zionist crime, he said  the U.S. and Europe which claim to be vanguards and advocates of  human rights, did not even utter a word in condemnation of the  savage shelling of al-Nabatiyah.    Several innocent students were killed and wounded in the  shelling of the Israeli Army. `This silence only proves that  the U.S. is an accomplice in the killing of the people of South  Lebanon,' he said.    The secretary general of Hizballah, Sayyid Husayn Nasrallah  also strongly criticized Washington's policies towards the  Zionist regime's crimes, and said: `Washington's silence once  again proved that the rights of the nations and human values in  general are of the least importance for the U.S. and other  arrogant powers, and that they only care for the Zionists and  their children.'    The Hizballah secretary general called on the Lebanese  people  to get united in the fight against the Israeli aggressions and  reiterated his party's all-out support for the anti-Zionist  struggle.    Leader of the Islamic Amal Movement, Husayn al-Musawi called  the U.S. `the gang leader of the world's terrorists' and said  Washington was the enemy of the nations and universal peace.  `The brand of peace that the United States is trying to impose  on the countries of the region, is only a cover-up to serve its  own illegitimate interests,' he added.    Al-Musawi also strongly criticized the United Nations  Security Council and said the organization was an executive of  Washington's terroristic policies.    Meanwhile, the association of Lebanese Muslim ulama in a  statement issued here today, termed the U.S. `the great satan'  and a government without any humanitarian intentions.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: Fiat offshoot in Russian 'Arctic' deal IVECO, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, has reached a co-operation agreement with Russia's Uralaz trucks producer to make heavy-duty vehicles for use in Arctic conditions, Haig Simonian reports from Milan. No details about the value or production volumes of the deal have been revealed. But it is believed to be the first agreement of its kind between a Russian and western company in the heavy-vehicles sector, and could lead to close co-operation between the two groups. Iveco will supply Uralaz, based in the Urals city of Miass, with technology to assemble a new range of trucks designed to operate in temperatures down to -55 degrees Celsius. The new models will complement the existing vehicles made by Uralaz. which currently makes about 30,000 trucks a year. The accord also calls for extending the collaboration in production of non-Arctic models.</p>

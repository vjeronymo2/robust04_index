			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MEASURE PROPOSED  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council tentatively decided Monday to require businesses  to prove that they are handling hazardous materials safely.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance is designed to help the city prevent accidents connected  with the manufacture, storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals, officials  said.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure everyone is operating safely," said Jocelyn Reed, deputy  director of the city's Department of Environmental Services. "We're making sure  nothing slips through the cracks."  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, all businesses would be required to obtain "tenancy  certificates" from the city, Reed said. To obtain a certificate, business  operators would have to provide information about the types of materials  manufactured and stored on their premises.  </P> <P> If those materials are considered hazardous, operators would be required to  prove they are in compliance with all local and state safety regulations, Reed  said.  </P> <P> Existing businesses that violate safety regulations or fail to provide the  necessary information would be subject to fines and other penalties.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to give final approval to the ordinance in the  next few weeks.

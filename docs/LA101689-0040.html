			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW WHAT, AFTER DRUG SCANDAL AND BIG BUST?;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: RETRENCHMENT IS THE WATCHWORD ON ONE FRONT OF THE LOS  ANGELES-AREA DRUG WARS, BUT FEDERAL ASSET-SEIZURE LAWS PROVIDE INCENTIVE FOR  CONTINUED POLICE COOPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TRAFFICKERS.  </P> <P> With a record bust and growing scandal, it has hardly been a routine time on  the front lines of the Los Angeles drug wars.  </P> <P> The discovery of 21 tons of cocaine in Sylmar and suspension of 18 sheriff's  investigators have focused very different sorts of attention on the police  units that match wits with major drug traffickers, prompting a re-evaluation by  some, gloating by others and -- inevitably in the society of cops -- some  humor.  </P> <P> In Brea, officials have reigned in their roving four-officer drug squad, one of  the glitzy units that popped up in recent years to take advantage of  asset-seizure laws. The problem? They spent much of their time backing up a  Sheriff's Department team that now is suspected of skimming off cocaine cash.  </P> <P> "We're back to doing pretty much local stuff," said Brea Capt. Jim Oman. "We're  kind of catching our breath and seeing what's going on."  </P> <P> But retrenchment is hardly the mood at the Quad City Task Force, made up of  officers from four police departments in southeast Los Angeles County. After  long doing the anonymous grunt work of investigations, task force members  pulled off the World's Largest Drug Bust.  </P> <P> So, "Now that we're kind of on the map," as Sgt. Ralph Freeze put it, they've  given themselves a new job -- they want to rename their unit.  </P> <P> Brea police were among the first in Southern California to recognize the  potential of the 1984 federal law that enabled local police to claim as much as  90% of the cash and other assets they confiscate in criminal investigations.  </P> <P> That year, they formed a "special enforcement division" and one of the officers  began using a seized red Corvette to help him infiltrate drug rings throughout  the region.  </P> <P> Although Brea is in Orange County, the unit often worked with a Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department drug squad based in Whittier. It was a type of  cooperative effort that grew common as narcotics trafficking in the area  broadened, with suspects stashing their drugs and money in several communities  and frequently moving around.  </P> <P> "We had a couple of big cases (alone), but 90% of the stuff we were doing was  backup," Capt. Oman said.  </P> <P> His officers helped on tedious stakeouts and followed suspects, whether they  headed for the San Fernando Valley or Las Vegas. "They got on the road and  never knew where they were going," Oman said.  </P> <P> The efforts paid off. The city now is waiting for its share of $4 million the  unit helped seize.  </P> <P> But when Sheriff Sherman Block announced Sept. 1 that his drug squad was being  disbanded, after a "sting" in which deputies were said to have been videotaped  diverting cash, the news had added impact in Brea. The Brea crew had been  backing up Block's squad at the raid at the Valley Hilton in Sherman Oaks that  turned out to be a setup by federal authorities.  </P> <P> Oman said he and Police Chief Donald L. Forkus questioned their officers and  were satisfied they had been isolated from any wrongdoing. But "most of our  people were very shook up how this could have happened literally under their  nose," he said. They decided to scale back.  </P> <P> Brea Mayor Gene Leyton said the decision was made by police alone. He added:  "As a city, we're not trying to become the narcotics enforcement agency for  Southern California. . . . We don't want them working in San Diego or Santa  Barbara unless it has some relativity to us."  </P> <P> Oman sees it as necessary, but unfortunate in a way.  </P> <P> "The trend on these cases, they seem to be getting bigger and bigger quantities  of the drugs and it takes some cooperation," he said.  </P> <P> "Something like this, suspicions of theft . . . this sets the whole thing  back."  </P> <P> When police from Maywood, Bell-Cudahy and Huntington Park formed a joint drug  squad last year, they named it the Tri Cities Task Force. South Gate joined in  this year, and they changed the name to Quad Cities.  </P> <P> But when four leaders of the team gathered late last week at the Huntington  Park Police Station, Sgt. Andy Key of South Gate argued that they now needed a  new name "without a numerical." That way, it would stick even if one city drops  out, or another joins the force.  </P> <P> "SEANET," he proposed. "The Southeast Area Narcotics Enforcement Team."  </P> <P> Detective Bill Huffman of Huntington Park wasn't sure. "It's going to be hard  to break the habit," he said.  </P> <P> The cities originally formed the squad for a couple of reasons. Their police  departments are relatively small -- Maywood has only 25 sworn officers -- and  the few officers each assigned to drug enforcement found it impossible to dent  even the local problems working alone. In addition, they couldn't help but  notice how other departments, such as Brea's, were adding small fortunes to  their coffers by going after "major violators."  </P> <P> The 10 officers eventually assembled in the Quad Cities Task Force still had to  handle "street dope" cases, periodically arresting pushers at the corner parks  or raiding rock houses. But they also agreed to help U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agents who were investigating trucks suspected of carrying  drugs. The Southeast Los Angeles area was a natural focal point with its  freeways, industrial areas and truck stops.  </P> <P> Soon the detectives found themselves on six-day stakeouts, sitting in cars  eating junk food and reading the same newspaper over and over. Freeze, who is  from Bell, celebrated his birthday in a parking lot.  </P> <P> One stakeout helped Orange County authorities seize 300 kilograms of cocaine,  and another 249 kilogram seizure followed. The results all went "on the board,"  a blackboard where they tallied arrests, money and drug seizures.  </P> <P> Relations were good with the DEA agents, all agreed. "At no point did they say,  'OK, we'll work it alone from here,' " Huffman said.  </P> <P> But there was some conflict with Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates after  one of their surveillance operations, prompted by a tip to a federal agent, led  to the discovery of $12.2 million in cash and truckloads of cocaine in the  Sylmar warehouse on Sept. 28. Police chiefs from the four cities grew furious  when they perceived the glory going to Gates and his officers, who were called  in to assist only at the last moment.  </P> <P> By the time of their meeting in Huntington Park, however, the task force  members were no longer worried about "the little guy" being overlooked.  </P> <P> Freeze announced that a local elementary school was honoring his officers that  afternoon. And plans were being made for all the cities to throw a big party  for task force members and their spouses.  </P> <P> "You know," mused Key, "there could have been no money at that warehouse."  </P> <P> "And no one would have heard of it," said Freeze.  </P> <P> A belt beeper went off. The DEA was summoning. Huffman left to phone, then  returned with the news.  </P> <P> "Anyone want to go to El Paso on Monday?" he asked.  </P> <P> In few places is there as much sympathy for what the Sheriff's Department is  going through as at the Los Angeles offices of the DEA. Last year, three former  agents were indicted for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and heroin. A  $3-million bank account belonging to one of them recently was seized by  authorities in Luxembourg.  </P> <P> When the sheriff's suspensions were announced, the special agent in charge of  the DEA office, John M. Zienter, called Block to commiserate. "They went bad,  the agency didn't," he said.  </P> <P> "Last year it was our turn at bat," said one agent. "Now the sheriff is at bat.  Next year it will be someone else."  </P> <P> Despite such somber reflection, there is room for a bit of humor, even about  such matters.  </P> <P> Maywood Police Chief Ted Heidke recalled how he rushed to the Sylmar warehouse  in the middle of the night after the Quad Cities crew called him about the raid  there, then found himself "standing in the corner, where there's all this  money. Bundle after bundle of $100 bills.  </P> <P> "I was looking at one of the guys next to me and I said, 'Check me out a  million and a half,' and I picked up one of the bundles. And he said, 'No, no.  That one's mine.' "  </P> <P> On the other hand, two sheriff's deputies joked quite differently last week  about their roles on a task force in which they work beside DEA agents and  other Los Angeles-area narcotics detectives.  </P> <P> "We don't touch the money," said Deputy Randy Petee, holding up his hands.  </P> <P> "We see money," added Deputy Larry Swanson, "and we run."  </P></p>

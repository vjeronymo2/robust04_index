			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina </F> Presidency, by Zdravka Soldic; place and date not given: "The  Croats Are at Home in Bosnia"]    [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, is probably the most media-exposed  Bosnia-Herzegovina government official, always prepared to make  statements and give interviews. Many say he is Alija  Izetbegovic's right hand. However, circles close to the  authorities report that he is close to Izetbegovic primarily due  to the fact that he is best acquainted with military  technological potential and its possible applications. They say:  "Izetbegovic needs Ganic, but Izetbegovic is afraid Ganic will  seize power. Ganic makes many decisions on his own, without  consulting with anyone."    The inhabitants of Sarajevo have different opinions about  Ganic. Some think he is capable and necessary, especially at a  time like this, and that he must be given more authority and  competence. Others recall his Sandzak origin and ekavian dialect  [dialect spoken in Serbia proper], the fact that he entered the  presidency as the representative of the Yugoslavs, and that he  does not observe strict fasting during Ramadan.    We could notice he does not fast during Ramadan when he  received us in the building of the Presidency. He had coffee  and juice with us at the time of the day when that is forbidden  by the Koran.    Ganic is a skillful diplomat. He tries to forget to give the  answer to every sensitive question.    Since, in the past couple of days, the most topical issue  was  the agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Croats and  the Muslims and the negotiations in Washington on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, we began this interview by  talking about that.  <H6>  * * * </H6> <H5>  I Barely Managed To Stay Alive </H5>   [Soldic] Mr. Ganic, this is the 14th or the 15th agreement  on the cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the  Muslims. What do you think are the prospects of this agreement?    [Ganic] Its prospects are good. We took all political and  military steps for its implementation. We are creating a  climate on the ground for this agreement to be respected. A  couple of minutes ago, I talked to commanding officers on the  phone. They confirmed that results are excellent on the ground.    [Soldic] Who took the initiative to sign the agreement?    [Ganic] You see, the climate has been created by all sides.  We have held many talks, made many agreements. We have always  wanted to stop fighting. It was not logical to fight against  the Croats. But we also knew we were not fighting the entire  Croatian nation, but merely a faction of the Croats. The  inhabitants of Dubrovnik, people in Dalmatia, Istria, Zagreb,  Slavonia have always advocated Bosnia. Unfortunately, we could  not establish a proper dialogue with the Herzegovinians. I am  the first politician from Bosnia-Herzegovina who visited the  Croat village of Ravno, near Trebinje, when it was destroyed,  and not a single Herzegovinian politician set foot in the  village for days.    [Soldic] Since you mentioned Ravno, the president of the  Presidency has often been reproached for not having reacted  properly at the time when the village was attacked.    [Ganic] I went to visit the village the day it was attacked.  No one in the Croatian press will mention that. They recorded  it with television cameras as well as the statement I gave in  Ravno. I said: "This is terrible." The village was completely  destroyed. I was stunned. I barely managed to stay alive.    [Soldic] But for some three or four days, President  Izetbegovic did not make any statement and a part of his  territory was attacked.    [Ganic] I went there and made a statement.    [Soldic] Who proposed the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Croats and the Muslims?    [Ganic] We proposed the federation several months ago in  Zagreb, during the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  I presided over. Do you remember the session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency in Zagreb? We kept making that  proposal. And then the United States and Germany said: "That  proposal is not bad at all." It was planned, first of all, to  reach an agreement between the Croats and the Muslims. If the  Serbs do not agree to the confederation, then we will see what  they want. They cannot just take away a part of the territory.  If they want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, then that opens a  series of other problems.    [Soldic] If the Bosnia-Herzegovina borders should change,  will you demand the annexation of Sandzak?    [Ganic] If the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina should change,  there would be another 150 countries demanding the same. And  that is why Europe never allowed changing borders. If borders  should nevertheless be changed, we would demand the integrity of  the country. Why should we not enter the belly of the Serbs, if  they are doing the same to us. However, it will not come to  that. Sandzak will get the same kind of autonomy as the Serbs in  Knin.    [Soldic] Do you think it is realistic to expect a federation  with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is it possible to impose  that on Milosevic and Karadzic? On the other hand, I do not see  a political party in Serbia that could seize power and change  the relation toward Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Ganic] Milosevic and Karadzic are, first of all, people who  have tens of millions of dollars. You must be aware of that.  On the other hand, when Milosevic feels the pressure, Karadzic  is gone for a couple of hours. If the international community  should simultaneously adhere to the principle which persecutes  criminals of war, then Karadzic would automatically be put on  trial. The Serbs can obey perfectly when they have to.  <H5>  The Serbs Must Be Stretched Out </H5>   [Soldic] How do you interpret the change of political course  of the international community toward Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] Great Britain has supported the Serbs from the  start. To some extent, the French have supported Great Britain  in that, so as to hinder the growing influence of Germany in  this region. Actually, that is a very primitive concept:  Slobodan Milosevic was found to create a chaos here, so that  this part of Europe would not merge with Asia and so that  Germany would not dominate over it. However, tolerating a  fascist like Milosevic, with the project of greater Serbia,  resulted in another fascist with the project of greater Russia.  That made the French change their politics. This is a global  aberration. Serbia has crossed the Drina. The Drina River has  always been a border. The United States suggested Great Britain  should support the change of concept toward Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I expect to see better days for Bosnia.    [Soldic] Lately, one often hears that, in addition to  political support of the United States, Bosnia also gets  substantial financial aid.    [Ganic] I do not want to comment on that. After all, the  United States defends the consistency of its policies in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In my opinion, they have made a good  political move. They first left it up to Europe to solve the  problem of Bosnia. As is now obvious, the Europeans can not or  will not do that, so the United States decided to get more  actively involved. You can see that from the Sarajevo ultimatum  and from the support to the proposal about Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation.    [Soldic] Does Bosnia-Herzegovina, apart from political  support, get any financial support from Islamic countries?    [Ganic] We get significant financial aid.    [Soldic] The NATO ultimatum about Sarajevo did not prove to  be determined enough, it seems. The Serbs have not withdrawn  their weapons, not everything has been put under the control of  the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], and there were  no air strikes after all.    [Ganic] This is nevertheless the biggest move since the  beginning of the war. I am sure they will be more decisive in  future, as we could see this time.    [Soldic] The inhabitants of Sarajevo say the UNPROFOR is to  blame for the fact that the NATO plan has not been implemented  to the full. And you made a statement on Bosnia-Herzegovina  Television after the ultimatum expired that you were not  satisfied with the work of the UNPROFOR.    [Ganic] They are to blame for having tolerated the Serbs,  who did not do anything for eight days. And when they did get  around to doing it, they could not manage to complete it in two  days. The UNPROFOR always supports the stronger side. And they  always have the same excuse -- that they do not have enough  soldiers. They did not need Russian soldiers who proved in  Croatia that they are not neutral. But we gave a clear message  to Russian soldiers. They should think twice before they do  anything next time.    [Soldic] The Sarajevo model of disarming the warring  factions is soon to be applied in Tuzla, Mostar, and Vitez. Can  the same model be applied to those other areas as well? How  "soon" will that be?    [Ganic] It can be applied in some towns. However, it is not  such a good solution for others. Resolution No. 836, which was  adopted before, is better. It includes the withdrawal of heavy  artillery and the withdrawal of the Serbian army. But they get  panicky even when they must only withdraw their heavy artillery.  This war of Serbia is actually the war of artillery against  civilians. In Sarajevo they say: "You are safest at the front  line with soldiers." And that is the weakness of that regime.  That is why we must not yield to the Serbs, for no such army  has ever won a war. And that is why I have always said that the  Serbs must be stretched out. But the Presidency is a collective  body and we must coordinate our views.  <H5>  We Are Opening Roads in Central Bosnia </H5>   [Soldic] The Croatian media broadcast your statement which  announced that you would clean central Bosnia.    [Ganic] With regard to central Bosnia, your media often  broadcast things that were not said. I said we would open roads  in central Bosnia and seize key positions which will enable our  army to function. We managed to do that. We connected Bugojno  to Travnik, Travnik to Zenica. We were fighting for Vitez. In  a way, it was a battle for communications. Why do we control  Fojnica? Because we go to Zenica from Fojnica via Konjic. From  Zenica, we go to Tuzla via Vares. We had to have that  communication route.    [Soldic] How come that, in a couple of months, you conquered  several towns controlled by the HVO?    [Ganic] Vares was besieged to the extent that it was  impossible to defend it.    [Soldic] Did you make any agreements with the HVO to  withdraw?    [Ganic] No, believe me. There were no agreements. Vares  was completely surrounded. We had the 2d Corps, the forces of  the 1st and 3d Corps. It was impossible to defend Vares. They  managed to get out, but they were wrong in dragging the people  along. We demanded that UNPROFOR enter Vares as soon as  possible. We asked Monsignor Puljic to go to Vares and stop  people from getting out. We kept fighting against ethnic  cleansing. Boban had very little feeling for the Croats from  central Bosnia.    [Soldic] Why did you attack Vares?    [Ganic] The Chetniks were coming into town from the hills.  They came to do their shopping, and we had to pay for passage  from Zenica to Tuzla.    [Soldic] Fojnica?    [Ganic] We had to liberate Fojnica. There was a problem  regarding communications.    [Soldic] Bugojno? Who began first?    [Ganic] In the beginning, we fought together against the  Chetniks. The Army was better organized and the HVO withdrew  after a couple of days of fighting.    [Soldic] Konjic, Travnik?    [Ganic] We had the 17th Krajina brigade there, which is very  strong. They liberated Travnik from the HVO in a flash. And  commands were very strange too. Some units fought to the end  and some simply withdrew. But the Croats also had the dilemma  as to why they were fighting. The HVO has never had a clear  program regarding their goals in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Boban  wanted a state for himself.    [Soldic] Was Vitez attacked because of the territory or  because of the explosives factory controlled by the HVO?  Military experts who are well acquainted with military  technology of that factory (both the one before the war as well  as today's) say that those explosives cannot be used for  weapons, that those explosives can only be used in civil  engineering. Can they also be used for military purposes?    [Ganic] Before the war, I returned from the United States  and took over the development of UNIS. UNIS was the largest  manufacturer of weapons and military equipment in former  Yugoslavia. I founded military and technological institute. The  production has been going on for years and documentation was  kept in Belgrade. I was chosen to buy technology for the  factory in Vitez. I know exactly what they have.    [Soldic] Then tell me, can the explosives in Vitez be used  for military purposes? Can they be used for making mortars?    [Ganic] There are two factories there: "Vitezit" and the  "SPS." There are two possibilities. The HVO exaggerated the  importance of that factory. The factory should not be destroyed  for other reasons. Because there are certain standards. The  story that it cannot be destroyed is a fairy tale. The way they  think, they could not destroy it. [paragraph as published]  <H5>  Boban Made a Deal With Karadzic </H5>   [Soldic] Why was there fighting in central Bosnia?    [Ganic] There was fighting in central Bosnia because Boban  made an agreement with Karadzic to tie our forces so as to  prevent us from advancing toward the Chetniks. But, on the  other hand, also because he wanted to create a state within a  state. He wanted to separate a part of Bosnia. Both our and  Croatian forces were involved at the wrong place. And the Serbs  took advantage of that. They say that Croat-Muslim conflicts are  the "sweet part of the news." That is a strategic mistake, but  it is never too late. The Croats desire to return to Bosanska  Posavina, central Bosnia -- all who went away are welcome back.  The Croats have two countries: Croatia and Bosnia. But Bosnia  does not only belong to the Croats, but also to the Bosniaks,  the Muslims, and the Serbs. But it is senseless to risk the  existence of both countries. If you divide Bosnia, it would be  difficult to convince the Serbs in Knin not to demand the same.  Realizing the concept of the federation of the Muslims and the  Croats, which would include Posavina and the Drina basin, would  leave the Serbs from Knin without arguments.    [Soldic] In Croatia, they say that Komsic and Kljuic are  just puppets in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, that they  make no decisions, and only serve Izetbegovic to show to the  world that his presidency is organized on the principle of  national parity. However, I have read some statements by both  Komsic and Kljuic, released a couple of months ago, and they  said there was no discussion nor voting about the offensive  against Vares, or about the transformation of the HVO in  Sarajevo.    [Ganic] You see, when he became a member of the Presidency,  Komsic started working very hard. Kljuic was a member of the  Presidency, then he resigned, and then got back to the  Presidency in a different way. They participate in making  decisions, although I must admit that in the beginning, when the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was being created, most important  decisions were indeed made by President Izetbegovic and myself.  Those who work are influential in the Presidency. Those who do  not do any work, do not get to make any decisions. Today, I had  to commit myself on the arrival of more Russian soldiers to  Sarajevo. I said 400 was more than enough. I took that  political risk and am responsible for that.    [Soldic] Stjepan Siber is no longer deputy commander of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Did he resign or was he replaced?    [Ganic] His wife became ill. He went to Switzerland for  treatment. He asked to accompany her. He now works for our  diplomatic service.    [Soldic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army mobilizes the Sarajevo  Croats to fight against the Croats in central Bosnia. I think  that the Army and the Presidency ought to show some  consideration for this very sensitive situation.    [Ganic] I can safely claim that those units that surrounded  Vitez had an insignificant percentage of the Croats. The Croats  were mostly sent toward the north to Tuzla. But, believe me,  some Croats advocate Bosnia, and they are first of all Bosnians  and then Croats. Eighty heroes, young Croats, gave their lives  for Sarajevo. That will never be forgotten. The Croats have  made a significant contribution in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.  <H5>  Zelic Should Be Put on Public Trial </H5>   [Soldic] During a couple of days I stayed in Sarajevo, I  heard many Croats say they feel like second-rate citizens. Do  they fear for their physical and existential survival?    [Ganic] It is possible there were some isolated incidents,  but as far as global politics is concerned, the Croats are at  home here. They enjoy the same rights as other nations. Bishop  Puljic is here from the beginning of the war. We must respect  that. The Croats did much for development and culture both  before and during the war. One should not make statistics on the  basis of isolated incidents. We made an analysis of theft and  murders in Sarajevo. The Muslims were killed in 90 percent of  the cases.    [Soldic] Why is Slavko Zelic in prison?    [Ganic] They say he was doing what was forbidden. Kljuic  visited him in prison. I would like his to be a public trial.  Come and inform your public why Slavko Zelic is put on trial.  Among other things, he wanted to act in Sarajevo following  instructions from Mate Boban of Grude.    [Soldic] In conclusion, can we say that you think Bosnia is  not a state which is disappearing, but a state in the making?    [Ganic] Bosnia is a state which is recovering.</p>

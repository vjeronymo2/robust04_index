			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast; Aleksandr Shkirando report </F> over video; correspondent identified by caption]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin completed his visit  to Amur Oblast today, and he and his entourage have left for the  Tuva Republic. Just a few hours ago Aleksandr Shkirando, our  special correspondent, sent us a report from Blagoveshchensk on  Boris Yeltsin's working trip to Amur oblast.    [Begin recording] [Shkirando, over video showing Yeltsin in  a  workshop talking to staff; Blagoveshchensk identified by  caption] The itinerary of the Russian president's working visit  to Blagoveshchensk is extremely full. In the morning Boris  Nikolayevich visited the shipyard and met its workers.    [Yeltsin, surrounded by a crowd in workshop, addresses  unidentified woman in the crowd] How much is your pension?    [Woman] Seventy-three. [not further identified]    [Yeltsin] Seventy-three. That is not much.    [Woman] Yes, that is a small amount.    [Yeltsin] Perhaps we need to raise pensions this year, in  two  or three months. I understand that your wages amount to about  200,000, 25000 or 300,000. Am I right? Three hundred thousand  is enough to live on, is it not? Without luxuries but enough,  especially considering that both food and consumer goods shops  are full. Those things of the past just do not exist any  longer. One no longer has to suffer the humiliation of waiting  in lines. One can buy everything. But...of course, things are  expensive. That is without doubt.    [Shkirando] The president also talked about the problem of  taxes, which is a dire problem for all Russian citizens.    [Yeltsin] All production taxes, according to the 15 economic  decrees I signed, will be cut by about 10-20 percent this year.  It will vary from industry to industry.    [Unidentified man] Production taxes?    [Yeltsin] Yes, production taxes. As to the income tax, there  will be several levels to it. We have rich people who earn 5  million a month. Their earnings must of course be properly  chopped, while those who receive 300,000-400,000 or up to  500,000 should be taxed proportionately and in a balanced way.    [Shkirando] To help the president address the whole range of  issues, high ranking leaders and government officials, including  Shokhin, Zaveryukha, and Shafrannik, arrived with him in  Blagoveshchensk. Local authorities have expressed the hope that  at long last a number of dire problems affecting all of the Far  East will be addressed. [end recording]</p>

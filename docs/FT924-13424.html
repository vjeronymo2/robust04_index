			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola surges ahead to Dollars 540m COCA-COLA, the US soft drinks company, yesterday followed the example set by PepsiCo, its main US rival, with a strong third-quarter earnings gain. The Atlanta-based group posted an 18.5 per cent rise in after-tax profits, to Dollars 540.6m, and a 20.6 per cent improvement in earnings per share, at 41 cents. Sales were 10.6 per cent higher at Dollars 3.51bn. Coca-Cola said the rise in third-quarter marketing expenditure was in line with the growth in gross profit, but that margins had improved. In the US, unit volume sales to retail bottle/can and fountain customers grew by over 2 per cent, while gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups increased by 1 per cent during the third quarter. In north-east Europe and Africa, the figures were 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively; in the European Community, 6 per cent and 2 per cent; in the Pacific region, 1 per cent and a fall of 6 per cent in gallon shipments; and in Latin America, flat unit case volumes and a 1 per cent decline in gallon shipments. For the first nine months of the year, after-tax profits were Dollars 1.5bn, a 19.5 per cent improvement on the Dollars 1.26bn seen in the same period of 1991. Sales for the first three quarters were up by 13.1 per cent at Dollars 9.83bn.</p>

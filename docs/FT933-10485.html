			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / AEEU merger talks with Ucatt stoke union rivalry THE EXECUTIVE council of the AEEU engineering and electrical union agreed yesterday to seek merger talks with the ailing Ucatt construction union. The move will intensify inter-union rivalry in the construction industry because two other unions - the TGWU general union and the MSF white-collar union - are also trying to interest Ucatt in an amalgamation. Although the 200,000 member Ucatt has severe financial problems and a dwindling membership in an industry where non-unionism is widespread and unemployment acute, it is regarded by other unions as a strategic asset as they fight a rearguard action for members and influence. Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said yesterday: 'A merger between our two unions would create a formidable force in the construction industry.' Ucatt's executive has agreed to meet the AEEU to discuss a possible merger but in a statement yesterday it pointed out the difficulties of such a development. The AEEU contains a construction and building trades section which includes some members that the construction union says were poached from it by the EETPU electricians' union before its amalgamation with the AEU last year. The Ucatt executive said yesterday that the 'continued existence of the construction and building section remained a formidable obstacle to productive discussions'. The Ucatt leadership is embroiled in a serious row with the AEEU over the issue. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, said last night that the AEEU continued to persist in its poaching activities in the building and civil engineering industries. He added that this issue remained a 'barrier to the AEEU electricians' section's reaffiliation to the TUC (Trades Union Congress)'. The electricians were expelled from the TUC in 1989 for breaching its rules on poaching of members, but delicate diplomacy is being tried to smooth their peaceful return to the TUC at next month's congress. Mr Brumwell warned yesterday that the TUC conciliators had not resolved the problems of the reaffiliation of the AEEU's electricians' section in a way which would be acceptable to other TUC unions.</p>

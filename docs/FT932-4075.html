			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Lamont faces barrage of invective: Major refers to 'a little local difficulty' as senior Tories hit back in his defence MR NORMAN Lamont yesterday faced an unprecedented barrage of invective from his erstwhile colleagues as Mr John Major's government struggled to regain its balance in the wake of this week's onslaught by the former chancellor. The attacks raised the possibility that the dangerous rift between the prime minister and Mr Lamont might be prolonged. There were suggestions at Westminster last night that intermediaries had told Mr Major's office that the former chancellor was ready to respond in kind to any attempts to discredit him. In a further explosion of bitterness following Mr Lamont's dismissal two weeks ago, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, accused him of 'thrashing around' in a 'nasty' and 'ludicrous' way to protect his own reputation. Others among his former cabinet colleagues said that Wednesday's assault on the prime minister's leadership would be a 'nine-day wonder' as ministers and senior backbench MPs launched a damage-limitation exercise to defend Mr Major. Mr Lamont was described as 'third-rate' by one minister who only two weeks ago had sat with him around the cabinet table. Conservative officials said a decision by the party last year to help the then chancellor meet personal legal bills had created a backlash among Tory supporters, costing it hundreds of thousands of pounds in potential donations. In the House of Commons, Mr Major made light of Mr Lamont's accusations that his government acted as if it was 'in office but not in power'. Evoking the phrase used by Mr Harold MacMillan when sacking Mr Peter Thorneycroft as chancellor in 1958, Mr Major said the events represented a 'little local difficulty'. Brushing aside calls from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for an early general election, Mr Major said he had no intention of commenting further on Mr Lamont's statement. But the prime minister will use a speech today to the Welsh Conservative party to rebut Mr Lamont's claims that his government is preoccupied with the short-term political effect of policy decisions. He intends to stress his long-running commitment to keeping Britain at the centre of debate on Europe's future and to beating inflation. But the growing perception among its own supporters that the government is consistently accident-prone was reinforced last night by the leak of proposals by Mr Peter Lilley for large cuts in invalidity benefit. Mr Major's more relaxed performance in the Commons was followed by a carefully-crafted statement issued by the executive of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. The statement, agreed unanimously, offered the prime minister '100 per cent support'. Speaking after the weekly meeting of Conservative MPs, Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the committee, said that the statement had won a 'rapturous reception' from the 150 or so backbenchers present. Sir Marcus said all the contributions in the 15-minute meeting had supported the prime minister, and had come from all shades of opinion within the party. 'John Major is our prime minister, and will remain our prime minister for a long time to come,' he said. But the atmosphere of nervous calm did little to disguise concern among ministers and backbench MPs that Mr Major's leadership remains in question. Groups of rightwing MPs opposed to the Maastricht treaty were said to be giving 'active consideration' to the possibility of a challenge to the prime minister if the Conservatives lose the forthcoming Christchurch by-election. Sir Marcus appeared to acknowledge the threat to Mr Major by calling for a 'change of style' by the government and suggesting that some of his advisers might be replaced. There were also the fears that Mr Lamont might react to any further attacks by launching another assault on Mr Major, although he has told friends he has no immediate plans to add to Mr Major's difficulties with a statement in the near future or by enlarging on the themes in his speech on Wednesday. He was relaxed about the impact of his comments, even though they had raised questions about Mr Major's survival.

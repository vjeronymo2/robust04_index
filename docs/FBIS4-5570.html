			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- Spring tree-planting  is in full swing throughout the country.    According to data available at the Forestry Management  Department of the General Bureau of the Land Administration,  nearly 200 million trees were planted across the country in  recent 20 days.    Many counties of South Hwanghae Province and Kaesong and  Nampo municipalities have already fulfilled their plans for  spring tree-planting.    Korea has set the target to create 200,000 hectares of  respective forests of oil-bearing trees and industrial trees in  a few years and channelled big efforts to the work.    April, a good season for tree planting, was set as a  tree-planting month and trees are planted through a social  movement.    The nation's forests have been assigned to organs,  enterprises and organizations and protected and managed by them  with much care.    Afforestation in cities is being pushed ahead.    In recent years alone, thousands of hectares of forests have  been created and a number of parks and recreation grounds built  in major industrial and residential quarters.    In Pyongyang, more than 250,000 trees have already been  planted in streets, residential quarters, parks and recreation  grounds this year.</p>

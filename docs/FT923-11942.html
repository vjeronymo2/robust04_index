			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Australian bank to acquire BNZ NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB), a leading Australian bank, yesterday bid for Bank of New Zealand. Its offer of NZ80 cents a share values BNZ at NZDollars 1.48bn (USDollars 813m). BNZ's main shareholders - the New Zealand government (with 57 per cent) and Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank (with 27 per cent) - have accepted the offer. Ms Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's finance minister, welcomed the deal, saying the government did not consider itself a long-term shareholder in BNZ, New Zealand's biggest bank. BNZ has been weighed down by bad debt problems. Under a programme to recapitalise the bank in 1990, the government set up Adbro, a separate company to hold bad debts totalling NZDollars 1.4bn. The government will receive NZDollars 850m for BNZ. It will also receive 'full value' for its investment in Adbro, which NAB will wind up so that the government receives its initial investment of NZDollars 420m plus a return of 15 per cent over the next three years. Ms Richardson said that, if the government and Fay, Richwhite had not agreed to accept risks associated with Adbro, NAB would have heavily discounted its offer. The agreement covering risks over litigation, tax and assets of Adbro would run for seven years. NAB sought these assurances in line with 'normal commercial practices', but was not requiring ordinary BNZ shareholders to accept the risk. BNZ shares traded at 80 cents on the New Zealand Stock Exchange yesterday morning, but closed after the announcement at 76 cents. Fay, Richwhite is also being offered 95 cents for its holding of specified preference shares. Mr Don Argus, an NAB general manager, said BNZ would keep a strong local identity and its name. The bank, which reported net profits of NZDollars 171.1m for the year to March, had made very good progress in restructuring over the past two years. Asked about possible management changes, Mr Argus said BNZ would not be 'inundated with Australians'. NAB's management style was not to lay off thousands of workers. 'We'll be the invisible owner.' NAB would probably merge its 35 New Zealand branches - which last year lost ADollars 9m (USDollars 6.7m) - into BNZ. Mr Lindsay Pyne, the BNZ chief executive credited with turning around the bank, said the sale would be 'very good' for the bank. He cited the difficulties in a bank being government owned. The BNZ purchase will give NAB total assets of ADollars 109.77bn and increase shareholders' equity to ADollars 8.74bn from ADollars 8bn.</p>

Each will be given an interview - or viva voce in the language of the media branch of the Oxford University mafia - by a committee composed of troubleshooter-extraordinary Sir John Harvey-Jones, Cadbury Schweppes's Dominic Cadbury, and Frank Barlow, chief operating officer of Pearson, owners of the Financial Times. The procedure will be straightforward. Starting promptly at 9am and in alphabetical order, the nine will have half an hour apiece to state their claims.

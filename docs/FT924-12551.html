			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Metsa-Serla reduces deficit 53% to FM169m METSA-SERLA, the Finnish forestry group, reported a FM169m (Dollars 36.26m) loss (after financial items) for the first eight months of the year. This was a 53.6 per cent improvement on the FM364m deficit in the same period of 1991. Net sales improved by 2.2 per cent to FM5.03bn from FM4.92bn, while its operating loss was FM514m, compared with FM529 for the same period of last year. There was a loss of FM21.75 a share compared with a FM41.30 loss for the January-August period of 1991. The operating margin was FM686m, 13.6 per cent of net sales, which was an improvement on the FM495m operating margin and 10.1 per cent of net sales for the first eight months of last year. It added that an estimated FM1.74bn of the consolidated balance sheet was at risk as a result of the floating of the markka on September 8 and estimated the increase in Finnish markka equivalents of foreign currency net income would offset the increase in net liabilities within about six months.</p>

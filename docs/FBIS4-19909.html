			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 20 (AFP) -- France said Wednesday [20  April] it welcomed an agreement among South African leaders  ending fears of a Zulu nationalist boycott of the country's  first multiracial elections.    The agreement was reached Tuesday in Pretoria between South  African President Frederik de Klerk, African National Congress  leader Nelson Mandela and the Inkatha Freedom Party's leader,  Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said France  "hails the good will and the spirit of compromise shown by all  parties to reach this accord."    He described the agreement as a major step forward "in  building a democratic, non-racial South Africa".</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Chez Gerard gets Pounds 21m valuation Chez Gerard, the London restaurant group, finalised its flotation yesterday, pricing the shares at 112.5p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds 21m. After the flotation there will be 18.67m shares in issue of which 70 per cent are being placed with institutions. It will raise Pounds 4m of new money, of which Pounds 1m will be used to clear the company overdraft, leaving Pounds 3m for further acquisitions. The company forecasts in the prospectus a 69 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.62m for the year ending June 26. Groupe Chez Gerard owns Bertorelli's in Covent Garden, Cafe Fish off Haymarket, Soho Soho in Frith Street and three Chez Gerard restaurants. It also operates and has a 25.5 per cent stake in Chutney Mary in Chelsea. Mr Neville Abraham, chairman and chief executive, said the company would be investing up to Pounds 5m in further restaurants over the next two to three years. For the foreseeable future they would be sited in central London. 'That's our patch, and we have demonstrated our success.' Mr Abraham and Mr Laurence Isaacson, deputy chairman, entered the restaurant business in 1980, converting a banana warehouse next door to the Royal Opera House into Cafe des Amis du Vin, which they sold in 1984 for Pounds 2.2m. The two men and their management team will retain 30 per cent of the enlarged share capital.</p>

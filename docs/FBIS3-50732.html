			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Agricultural Minister Alfredo Jordan; place </F> and date not given -- first paragraph is BOHEMIA introduction]    [Text] Minister of Agriculture Alfredo Jordan is little  inclined to interviews: "The best advertising will be to put the  food on the plates," he says. Despite that honorable stance,  during a recent tour of La Habana Province with a group of  newsmen covering the sector, he agreed to dispel doubts and even  to think aloud about issues yet to be defined.    [BOHEMIA] Mr. Minister, in the midst of so many shortages,  is  it logical to claim that the UBPC will increase production?    [Jordan] We all have high hopes. I recognize the need for  resources in order to achieve high crop yields. The "microjet"  banana, for example, requires fuel for irrigation and the  application of potassium, neither of which we currently have.  However, if you take constant care of this crop, if you trim the  shoots and remove the leaves, make sure the sprinkler gets the  plant properly wet, prune the plants at the proper time and get  rid of the weeds, you will increase production. That is what we  are after in trying to bring man closer to the land that he  works.    The new system of farming increases the feeling of  ownership,  economy, and the optimum use of resources. To the extent that we  work efficiently in these units--and we are already observing  great motivation--with weeded crops, the right population on  plantations, and everyone interested in results, you will see  success in production despite material limitations.    [BOHEMIA] In the UBPC, how many men will be behind desks and  how many closely linked to the land?    [Jordan] In these cooperatives, all workers are directly  involved in production. Depending on the day's activities, the  president will also work in the fields because that is where the  economy, the yearly plan, is truly designed and also because,  like the rest of his community, he is committed to producing.    At the present time, three or four persons make up the UBPC  administrative staff. The number of reports has been cut  substantially.    [BOHEMIA] Do you think the enterprises will decline in  importance?    [Jordan] No. I would say they have more work. What is  interesting is the change in their duties. The enterprise no  longer administers, but by virtue of its role as the  government's representative, it is the organ that draws up the  annual plan together with the UBPC, provides technical and  material support, buys production, helps supervise and oversee  how crops are doing, and observes whether technical requirements  and scientific guidelines are being met.    [BOHEMIA] In what areas of agriculture will there be no  UBPC?    [Jordan] They do not all have to have a UBPC. Certain state  enterprises such as Isla de Turiguano in Ciego de Avila, for  example, do not have to be included in cooperatives. There they  have 11,000 head of cattle on 700 caballerias of land. La Cuba  in the same province has a plan to reach 140 caballerias of  microjet bananas and may continue as it is. It even suits us  that they have decided to remain as state entities because we  shall be able to make comparisons with the UBPC.    Our analyses have shown that certain aspects such as  genetics, the fattening of livestock, and special plans to raise  mules, horses, buffaloes, and so on, should not change. With  respect to citrus fruits, there are places where changes are not  possible because they do not have such important infrastructures  as housing. In poultry and hog raising, the conditions for  change do not exist either because there is not enough feed.    [BOHEMIA] In other words, different forms of agricultural  production will exist.    [Jordan] We shall have the UBPC, the state farms that cannot  go into cooperatives because they do not present the right  conditions, the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative], CCS  [expansion not given], and the once fallow land that has now  begun to produce in the hands of collectives made up of our  comrades. In addition, you have areas allocated for the  production of tobacco and the half hectares given to those who  set up a kind of family garden as part of the action of the  People's Council.    [BOHEMIA] What about collection?    [Jordan] The organization of the system of collection has  been harshly criticized. There are flaws. Products do not arrive  on time, there are losses and diversion and so on.    Reorganization is a complex task because we must take three  different situations into account: the capital, the provincial  capitals, and the rest of the country.    I do not think there will be any problem with allowing  producers to take their harvested crops to sell in the town  squares of the municipalities and small towns. However, the case  of the provincial capitals and large cities is different because  many municipalities tax products. That is where collection  mechanisms must be carefully worked out.    The most difficult situation is in the capital because as  many as 1,200 sales outlets must be in the rural areas. We are  currently discussing proposals based on a detailed analysis.    [BOHEMIA] Will mobilizations of support diminish with the  changes in agriculture?    [Jordan] We want cooperatives to have the labor force they  need. Some may try to reduce wage costs by cutting personnel, a  phenomenon that we must follow closely because it could affect  how well crops are cared for.    This is why I do not think the development of agriculture  can  be based on mobilizations, but rather, on the proper use of  specialized labor. However, we have to be realistic. Solutions  are not just around the corner and mobilizations will still be  needed, particularly for peak harvest times, even though I think  we shall now be more rational in terms of their number and use.    [BOHEMIA] What will be done with production surpluses?    [Jordan] It is difficult to speak of surpluses when we have  not even managed to raise production to a level that meets the  basic needs of the population. I wish our problem tomorrow would  be to decide what to do with surpluses! Nevertheless, let us not  get ahead of ourselves. I think that when that happens, we shall  analyze it as one element that will further stimulate and  unleash productive reserves.</p>

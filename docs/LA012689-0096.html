			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOES, BACKERS SEEK TO PROTECT INVESTMENTS;  </P> <P> HEARING ON APARTMENT PLAN DRAWS 150  </P> <P> Advocates and opponents of a plan to limit apartment construction expressed the  same goal this week at a three-hour public hearing -- preserving their  investments.  </P> <P> Those who favor the plan testified that they wanted to preserve their  investment in a single-family home and keep Whittier's charming residential  neighborhoods from being overrun by apartments.  </P> <P> "What about those of us who have taken a good deal of money to invest in  single-family homes?" asked homeowner Leonard Smith. "Our property values are  going to go down if we are surrounded by two, four, six apartments."  </P> <P> Those who want to retain existing higher-density zoning said the plan  threatened financial investments made on the basis of the zoning, which has  been in place since 1955.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change in Capacity  </P> <P> For Betty Perlman, who planned on building an apartment in back of her house  for retirement income, the proposed zoning would change the capacity of her lot  from two living units to one.  </P> <P> "People on fixed incomes have a hard enough row to hoe without having their  plans for the future blown," she said.  </P> <P> The hearing before the Planning Commission drew more than 150 people. The 77  people who testified split about 2 to 1 in favor of limiting growth, the issue  that has galvanized the city since the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake.  </P> <P> The hearing was called to receive testimony on a proposal from a city-hired  consultant to limit the number of apartments to be built in Whittier's oldest  neighborhoods north of the Uptown business district. The study by consultant  Laura Hudson of Michael Brandman Associates said Whittier's aging sewer and  water systems and narrow streets cannot support the number of apartments  permitted under current zoning.  </P> <P> Hudson has recommended that the city change the zoning, which limits how many  apartments can be built on a lot, to conform with the city's General Plan, the  overall blueprint for development. The General Plan calls for lower density  than the zoning laws in most areas north of Hadley Street.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Crowd  </P> <P> The crowd was the largest since development of the Puente Hills was debated  about six years ago, said Planning Director Elvin Porter. The Planning  Commission listened to nearly three hours of testimony Monday night and is  scheduled to vote on the proposal Feb. 6. Any zoning change must also be  approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> Several residents said they feared that a proliferation of apartments would  turn the Uptown district, already the city's highest crime area, into a slum.  Joe Holliday, who bought his Uptown area home several years ago because of its  quiet neighborhood, complained that nearby apartment residents have started  parking in front of his house.  </P> <P> "Recently, an ill wind has been blowing," he said. "The traffic problem is very  severe."  </P> <P> There were also emotional appeals from residents who said Whittier's charming  older neighborhoods -- the city's most distinctive trait -- are being  threatened by city officials who give in to the demands of developers.  </P> <P> "The community is what we're fighting for, not the individual," said Jeanette  McKenna. "We're fighting what short-term decisions mean to the long-term value  of our community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Absentee Landlords  </P> <P> Residents who had purchased their lots planning to convert houses to apartments  complained they are being blamed for the sins of absentee landlords.  </P> <P> Yvonne Sanchez said her mother's home on Painter Avenue was demolished after  sustaining severe damage in the earthquake, and plans for replacing the home  with apartments have been stalled for nearly a year while city officials  debated zoning issues.  </P> <P> "Not everyone that comes before you is a big, bad investor," she said.  </P></p>

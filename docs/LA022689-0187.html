			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE SHOOTS DOWN COLD UC IRVINE  </P> <P> Bill Mulligan, UC Irvine's basketball coach, had borrowed from Georgetown's  Charles Smith this week when he said a team must bring its defense to every  game so it can win when the jumper isn't there.  </P> <P> The trouble is, Irvine doesn't have that much defense, and when the shots  aren't falling, the Anteaters are. For the second time in three days, Irvine's  perimeter game fizzled, and even an inspired defense wasn't enough to overcome  New Mexico State Saturday night before 2,855 in the Bren Center.  </P> <P> With all its starters shooting 50% or better from the field, New Mexico State  defeated UC Irvine, 72-69, in a Big West Conference game.  </P> <P> The Aggies, 18-8 overall and 11-5 in the Big West, played as if they were home,  shooting 60% from the field. The Anteaters (11-14, 8-8) shot 43%.  </P> <P> Irvine was fine when it penetrated the Aggies' aggressive matchup zone. Power  forward Ricky Butler, who had a team-high 19 points, and center Mike Doktorczyk  (17) were a combined 14 of 20 from the floor.  </P> <P> But the Anteaters' outside shooters mostly misfired. Irvine sophomore Jeff  Herdman, who had the country's best three-point field-goal percentage entering  the week, missed all seven of his three-point shots and was one for 11 overall.  Senior guard Kevin Floyd was two of 12 from the field and reserve guard Justin  Anderson missed all four of his shots.  </P> <P> Irvine, ranked sixth in the country in team three-point field-goal percentage,  made only four of 21 Saturday.  </P> <P> Irvine entered the season-ending four-game home stand with a chance to clinch  second place in the Big West with a sweep. Instead, the Anteaters lost two in a  row and are fighting for one of the top six spots in the standings, which would  result in bye on the first day of the conference postseason tournament.  </P> <P> "We were so high after winning five of six," Floyd said. "I wanted to get the  broom out and sweep us into the tourney. Now, we're just fighting for  survival."  </P> <P> New Mexico State is headed in the other direction. The Aggies became New Mexico  State's only team to have a winning conference record on the road -- 5-4 -- and  are in sole possession of second place in the Big West after having won nine of  11.  </P> <P> "Our defense was really good tonight and we made the plays we had to make to  win," Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy said. "The game was played at a very high level  of intensity."  </P> <P> Still, the Anteaters had a chance to win. They trailed by one, 67-66, on  Doktorczyk's two free throws with 50 seconds left. But the Aggies easily  handled Irvine's fullcourt press. Willie Joseph scored on a flying slam and  then Johnny Roberson made a layin to put New Mexico up, 71-66, with :25 left.  </P></p>

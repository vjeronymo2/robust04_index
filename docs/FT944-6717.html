			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Schulmann, Bonn's EMS planner: Obituary Mr Horst Schulmann, a director of the Bundesbank and president of the regional central bank of the state of Hesse, who died last week aged 61 after a long illness, was one of the most internationally experienced people on the German banking and financial scene. He was closely involved in the creation of the European Monetary System. As a senior economic adviser to the German government when Mr Helmut Schmidt was chancellor, he played an important role in smoothing the way for the start of the EMS in 1978. Mr Schulmann also helped prepare the ground for western economic summit conferences between 1978 and 1982. Before his time with Mr Schmidt's Social Democratic government, he had spent four years as a senior executive at the World Bank in the early 1970s, after which he worked as a senior economic official for the European Community.</p>

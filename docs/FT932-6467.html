			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Opinion divided over former chancellor's City job prospects IT MIGHT seem that the obvious future for an ex-chancellor, particularly one with a merchant banking background, would be back in the City. But opinion was divided yesterday among top headhunters about Mr Norman Lamont's immediate job prospects. Mr Lamont's performance at Rothschilds in the 1970s was not generally considered to have been outstanding and some headhunters are pointing to his more recently apparent shortcomings in handling pressure. More importantly, consultants including Mr Nigel Humphreys, managing director of Tyzack Accord, referred delicately to Mr Lamont's current 'credibility problem' on economic matters. Mr Humphreys believes the former chancellor should move out of the limelight and stay away from 'the greenhouse of business', rather than follow in the footsteps of some of his predecessors. Lord Barber, for example, when his time as chancellor ended in 1974, became chairman of Standard Chartered Bank. Lord Lawson, who resigned as chancellor in 1989, became a director of Barclays Bank and the troubled GPA group. Sir John Nott, a Treasury minister in the 1970s, became chairman and chief executive of Lazard Brothers. Mr Lamont's long-term interests might be best served by going for a top job in the World Bank or the World Health Organisation, Mr Humphreys said. Playing an ambassadorial role for a while would be 'a great credibility builder,' he said. Alternatively, a job away from home, possibly with a multinational headquartered in continental Europe, could be a possibility. Such an organisation might consider it a coup 'to hook a foreign chancellor of the exchequer,' he added. Mr Paul Buchanan-Barrow, partner with headhunters Korn/Ferry, took the opposite view of Mr Lamont's prospects. 'I can think of a number of chairmen who would be self-confident enough to take him on,' he said. That would include chairmen of banks as well as large corporations. A separate source named Hambros as a possibility. Mr Stephen Bampfylde, managing director of headhunters Saxton Bampfylde, said he 'looked forward to sitting down with Mr Lamont to discuss the matter'. The former chancellor's range of experience would make him an 'attractive individual for many clients'. Mr Bampfylde said it was no longer a 'business of selling contacts - that's regarded as vulgar. It's more being able to say 'this is how Brussels would react', or 'this is how the World Bank would see things'.'</p>

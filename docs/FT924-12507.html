			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Colombia assesses quake damage STRONG aftershocks rattled Colombia yesterday after two big earthquakes and an eruption of fire, steam and boiling mud from a volcanic mound killed at least five people, AP reports. Reports of injuries and structural damage still trickled in from isolated villages cut off by Sunday's earthquake of 7.2 on the Richter scale and Saturday's tremble of 6.6. The worst of the disaster fell on a rural area in north-west Colombia where a crater exploded in a huge ball of fire on Sunday. The explosion caused a three-metre-high wall of mud. The afflicted region, San Pedro de Uraba, is in a mountainous, coffee growing area of northern Colombia, about 200km north of Medelln.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said today that  he expects President al-Asad to tell President Clinton that he  intends to establish full peace with Israel. If Syria is  willing to establish full diplomatic relations and open borders,  Israel is willing to withdraw on the Golan -- not from the Golan  -- following the formula that the depth of withdrawal equals the  depth of peace.    Speaking to our correspondent, Deputy Minister Beilin said  that an agreement has been reached with the Palestinians that  the entire West Bank will be demilitarized with no Palestinian  army or guns, and that Israel will militarily supervise the  entire West Bank. At the same time, whether an Israeli military  presence at every location in the West Bank is necessary still  needs to be discussed.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Call for Revamping Beef Inspection: The U.S. government must fundamentally  reform its beef inspection system to protect consumers from a growing incidence  of food-borne disease, the National Academy of Sciences said.  </P> <P> The academy's Institute of Medicine said the Agriculture Department should  implement a controversial inspection system, with modifications. The department  has tested the SIS system, which transfers some inspection duties to the  meatpacking industry, at five U.S. plants. The idea behind the plan is to make  the industry assume responsibility for meat quality, while the government  concentrates on food safety.  </P></p>

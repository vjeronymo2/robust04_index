			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Carlton opens the box With Mr Peter Brooke still fumbling to load the starting gun for the ITV takeover race, Carlton Communications has leapt out of the blocks by making a Pounds 624m conditional offer for Central. If the bid proceeds, Carlton will emerge as the dominant force in UK commercial television, commanding 30 per cent of ITV advertising revenue and with further shareholdings in ITN, GMTV and Meridian. But Carlton is paying a fat price for the privilege, forking out the equivalent of 25 times Central's forecast earnings for the shares it does not already own. The talk of resultant cost savings is also worryingly vague. Central is leanly run and has recently reduced its staff from 2,050 to 840. But it is probably fair to take Mr Michael Green's assurances about non-dilution on trust, given his ability to leaf freely through Central's management accounts as a non-executive director. Carlton can certainly channel more production through Central's loss-making Nottingham studios and rationalise some overheads. Moreover, Carlton's balance sheet will not be unduly strained by the move. Indeed, with post-acquisition gearing of just 30 per cent, Carlton will remain strongly placed for further expansion if the ITV rules are again relaxed. That would further improve the quality of Carlton's earnings, supporting the case for a stock market re-rating. There remains a slim threat that either parliament, the MMC or a rich foreign bidder could stymie Carlton's plans. The serious longer-term worry is whether the combined group's management will prove volatile, given both companies' strongly independent cultures. But such traditions could also hinder the emergence of a powerful rival, creating resistance to any suit by Granada for LWT. The sector's first hostile bid may yet result.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Elf investment cut as profits tumble 36.7% ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil group, is scaling back investment this year as 'policy of prudence,' after announcing a 36.7 per cent fall in net profit last year to FFr6.2bn (Dollars 1.16bn) from FFr9.8bn in 1991. Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, president, said capital expenditure would be cut to between FFr26bn and FFr27bn this year from FFr29bn in 1992 and oil and gas exploration outlays would be reduced to FFr4.2bn from FFr4.7bn over the same period. But he stressed this would not hit any big projects. 'Whatever the economic cycle, we must do better than in 1992,' he said. 'I have taken measures to ensure that.' Last year, the group generated a cash-flow of FFr23.5bn, compared with FFr26.4bn in 1991. The drop in net profits which Elf had clearly signalled last month, was the result of 'a rare combination of unfortunate developments and sharp deterioration of margins' in a number of sectors, the Elf president said. In their belief in an imminent economic upturn, European refiners have brought some plants back into operation and have halved their refining margin to an average of less than Dollars 3 a barrel. Petrochemical investments planned in the late 1980s came on stream last year, while French farmers, in the uncertainties caused by EC farm reform and the Gatt trade negotiations, by the end of 1992 had bought half the amount of fertiliser they had purchased a year earlier. However, Elf's speciality chemicals had done well, especially in the US, Mr Le Floch-Prigent said. He said he had built the group's 1993 budget around an assumed oil price of FFr105 (Dollars 19) a barrel. But he would not exclude a drop to Dollars 13 to Dollars 14 a barrel, because Opec counties were over-producing. The slowdown in investments reflected not only Elf's 'prudence' but also the desires of some of its partners who were experiencing similar difficulties, Mr Le Floch-Prigent said.</p>

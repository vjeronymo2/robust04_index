			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe doubts A strong initial rise in British Aerospace was checked by sharp profits downgrades as the market looked towards the near-term prospects for the group. The shares were up 35 at best but ended the day 9 ahead at 549p after hefty trading of 7.6m. BAe reported losses sharply reduced at Pounds 237m, a near 20 per cent jump in the dividend, favourable cash flow and a lack of surprise write-offs. However, the analysts' meeting with the company dispersed the euphoria as it became clear that big losses at the group's commercial aircraft division were set to continue. BAe also indicated that defence profits were likely to soften over the next two years. Long-term bull Strauss Turnbull reduced it current-year forecast by Pounds 35m to Pounds 215m and Paribas cut by Pounds 60m to Pounds 190m. Mr Paul Compton of Credit Lyonnais Laing came in at the bottom of the range with a Pounds 165m estimate but remained guardedly optimistic. 'The financial implications of the recent Rover deal are so significant as to outweigh trading disappointment,' he argued.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Mozambique parties moveto end 16-year civil war THE Mozambique government and right-wing Renamo rebels took a big step towards ending their 16-year civil war by signing an agreement on electoral procedures yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome. 'It is a big issue in the peace process,' Mr Jaime Goncalves, the Archbishop of Beira, told reporters as the two sides clinked champagne glasses in celebration. The war in Mozambique has claimed over 1m lives since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Yesterday's protocol was the third to be signed since the latest round of direct negotiations began in Rome nearly two years ago, with Italy and the Roman Catholic church mediating. But while mediators were cautiously hopeful an overall peace settlement could be reached by the end of the year, they stressed the two sides were still far apart on the remaining issues of drawing up a constitution and arranging a ceasefire. Negotiators plan to return to Mozambique this week and resume their talks in Rome next month. The agreement provides for elections to be called one year after any overall ceasefire pact is agreed. It guarantees freedom of the press and provides for the safe return of the 1.5m war refugees.</p>

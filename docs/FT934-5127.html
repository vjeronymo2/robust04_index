			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Invalidity benefit scrapped Invalidity benefit is to disappear and be replaced by a more tightly controlled incapacity benefit aimed strictly at those genuinely incapable of work. Alterations to invalidity benefit in the Budget had been widely expected. It had become one of the fastest growing social security benefits - over the past 10 years numbers of people claiming it have risen from 700,000 to 1.5m, with expenditure doubling in real terms to Pounds 6bn a year. This was set to reach Pounds 8bn by 1995-96. Ministers have increasingly expressed the view, repeated by Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday, that the benefit was being claimed by 'many people who are not genuine invalids'. The new benefit, to be introduced in April 1995, will replace both invalidity benefit and sickness benefit. Incapacity benefit, unlike invalidity benefit, will be taxed, bringing it into line with other income replacement benefits such as retirement pensions. Mr Clarke said the new benefit will be subject to a 'tighter and more objective medical test'. This may bring the government into conflict with the medical profession. The British Medical Association conference this year angrily rejected government suggestions that an over-lenient approach by GPs was fuelling the rapid growth in invalidity benefit.</p>

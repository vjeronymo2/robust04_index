			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Millicom plans Dollars 70m private placing MILLICOM International Cellular (MIC), a cellular phone operator based in Luxembourg, is launching a private placement in the UK and US prior to listing on the Luxembourg stock exchange. The company aims to raise Dollars 70m through the placement which is expected to increase shareholders' equity to Dollars 165m from about Dollars 50m. The funds will go mainly towards strengthening its capital base. It is eyeing a number of important licences which are expected to be granted over the next few years. MIC is a joint venture formed in 1990 between Kinnevik, a Swedish industrial holding company with interests in telecommunications, broadcasting and timber, and Millicom of the US, a New York-based telecommunications group which was a minority shareholder in Vodafone before being bought out by Racal. Kinnevik owns 48 per cent and Millicom has a 50 per cent holding while the management control the rest. The placing, at between Dollars 9 and Dollars 11 per share, will be for 14 per cent of the company's shares, or about 7m shares, reducing the holdings of Kinnevik to just under 43 per cent and of Millicom to approximately 41 per cent, with the remainder to be retained by the management.</p>

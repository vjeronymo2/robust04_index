			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going out to dinner / Tokyo Going out to dinner is a very different affair in Japan than it is in Europe or the US and is definitely not the occasion for serious dressing up. In Japan, people do not have to worry much about what to wear to a private dinner party since they are unlikely ever to be invited to one, especially if they live in a city. This is not unfriendliness but most Japanese homes are simply not built to accommodate such gatherings. Casual dinners at a close friend's home are, however, common. Everyone, including children, gathers to enjoy a sukiyaki pot. One slightly more formal occasion would be the new year's visit to pay respects to a company superior or business associate. On these visits, which often involve eating, drinking and being merry, women might dress in traditional kimonos or wrap themselves in a silk dress and fur coat. The more adventurous men might opt for kimono and wooden clogs. A formal evening dress, tuxedo or tails would turn heads in any restaurant since such attire is normally reserved for weddings, or in the case of tails, funerals. Men, would, more often than not, be found in their familiar suits and ties, if not a more casual button down shirt and jacket. Three-piece suits are a rarity while bow ties, sadly, are for the most part only seen on so-called 'talents' who keep the action rolling on late night TV shows or on sleazy characters pushing cheap thrills in the back streets of Shinjuku. Among the trendier crowd, fashions for dining can be more diverse and daring. Designer labels such as Ingeborg, Melrose and Bigi, internationally acclaimed styles from Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier or Sonia Rykiel, all sit in stylish restaurants.</p>

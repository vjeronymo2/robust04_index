			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (46): A valuable aid for marketing strategies - Retailing trends in nursery equipment IF you want to know how many babies are 'Pampered,' or are chauffeured on 'Silver Cross' wheels, FSA is the company to ask. It provides a continuous consumer measurement of nursery equipment and baby carriages, writes Claire Gooding. The information is sold to manufacturers and retailers of baby products who pay anything from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 60,000 a year to track the effects of advertising and promotions, and help plan their future marketing strategy, as well as to suppliers in a market worth Pounds 1,000m annually. FSA wanted to provide a flexible and instant analysis of its data as it is working in one of the few buoyant markets in the UK, currently benefiting from an increased birthrate and changing trends in parenthood. 'The market is so complicated that we needed something like Quanvert for analysis' comments Glenn Flackett, managing director of FSA. 'The problem was one of too much data, too many factors, and the production of an infinite number of tables. Most of our clients wanted similar information but slightly different, putting a personal perspective on it.' Ease-of-use was the key factor in the choice of a package: 'I'm not a computer person, I've never even used a PC before, says Mr Flackett. Nevertheless he had a clear idea of the flexibility he required - 'the key thing is that it allows the people to ask the questions themselves.' No other software package gave the flexibility the company sought, and Quantime was approached to implement and tailor the package to FSA's specification. Now the clients can analyse the data and pick their own criteria such as the baby's weight, age, the shop of purchase, to create their own tables. 'The benefits are that the database is more valuable, and the clients are getting more out of it. For marketing people, it has become established as part of the corporate toolbox,' he says.</p>

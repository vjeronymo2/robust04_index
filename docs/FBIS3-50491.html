			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast; all figures as heard] </F>   [Text] Quito -- The country's 1994 budget amounts to 6.2  trillion sucres, the pertinent document was signed today.    Effective today, the Ecuadoran State will have a new 1994  general budget: 5.985588 trillion sucres is the money that the  state will have available next year. Members of the Congress  Budget Committee and Finance Minister Cesar Robalino signed the  pertinent document.    [Begin Budget Committee Chairman Jorge Marun recording] We  completed the presentation of a draft fiscal budget for 1994  which is totally financed. It is a budget that will allow the  Executive Branch to carry out its [word indistinct] program.  This is great satisfaction for the National Congress and the  Budget Committee and we honestly think that we fulfilled our  duty to the Ecuadoran fatherland. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Robalino described 1993 as an economic success.    The 1994 budget, based on an average of $13 per barrel of  oil, mainly includes plans to help the social sector. Thirty  percent of the budget will be spent on education. Other sectors  are also included in it, such as health, public projects, and  social welfare, areas that did not have a budget before, this is  the opinion of Eduardo Villaquiran, a member of the Budget  Committee:    [Begin Villaquiran recording] The country has a budget that  is fully financed, and financed without taxes. It was financed  at a lower figure than that which the Executive Branch sent to  us. This is very important. Every year the draft budget is  sent to Congress and it is usually approved with its financing,  but with higher figures. This time, it was a lower figure and  this is due to a lack of revenues caused by the drop in the  price of a barrel of oil. [end recording]    In addition, each deputy will get 600 million sucres to  carry  out projects in their provinces.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: GOIN' SOUTH  </P> <P> Sitcom mega-producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner ("The Cosby Show," "A  Different World," "Roseanne") are developing a miniseries for NBC that may well  go down as TV's answer to "Mississippi Burning."  </P> <P> Quietly in the works for two years, "Selma, Lord, Selma" is based on the 1980  book of the same title by Sheyann Webb and Rachel Nelson, as well as the  award-winning "Eyes on the Prize" documentary series aired on PBS in 1987,  which viewed the civil rights struggle primarily through the eyes of black  participants. Henry Hampton, who produced the PBS series, is co-executive  producer/consultant; Michael and Alice Arlen wrote the script.  </P> <P> Hampton, who is black, told us that he hopes "Selma" will help debunk what he  considers false aspects of "Mississippi Burning," which has been criticized for  relegating blacks to minor roles in its depiction of the civil rights battle.  </P> <P> "I traveled around the country, talking to young people during Black History  Month," Hampton said, "and I must say, I found their lack of critical response  to the film very disturbing."  </P> <P> "Selma" will be filmed on location in the title city, where officials have been  "very cooperative so far," Hampton added.

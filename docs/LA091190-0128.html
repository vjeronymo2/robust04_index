			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP: ASIA;  </P> <P> THE TALK OF MANILA: WILL THE ARMY STAY IN BARRACKS?;  </P> <P> THE NEWSPAPERS TRUMPET SPECULATION THAT CORAZON AQUINO'S DAYS AS PHILIPPINE  PRESIDENT ARE NUMBERED. HER BIGGEST FOE SEEMS TO BE A NEW GROUP OF DISGRUNTLED  JUNIOR ARMY OFFICERS.  </P> <P> His troops were on alert, his vacation plans ruined, and the strain of nightly  false alarms showed on his face. But the brigadier general laughed as he put  down his phone.  </P> <P> "That was my third newspaper call today," he told his visitor. "Everyone wants  to know if the coup has started."  </P> <P> Manila's latest round of coup rumors have rattled this weary city, not least  because daily headlines have trumpeted 21 "terror" bombings, insisted that  long-loyal military leaders plotted a "palace coup," and repeatedly speculated  that President Corazon Aquino would resign, be assassinated or impose martial  law.  </P> <P> The explosions caused no serious damage or injuries, and none of the rumors  proved true. But the fear they generated has focused attention on a  little-known, fast-growing faction of disgruntled junior officers in the  Philippine military called the Young Officers Union, or YOU.  </P> <P> By most accounts, the YOU is the latest -- and perhaps greatest -- threat to  Aquino.  </P> <P> Top military officials who long denied the group's existence now blame it for  the August bombing spree, as well as for a sophisticated disinformation  campaign that spread false reports via phone and fax. Officials also concede  that the impatient young officers played a key role in last December's  attempted coup and may well lead the next.  </P> <P> "They are the wave of the future," said Jose T. Almonte, a retired general and  counterintelligence chief with close links to the rebel movement. "And time is  on their side."  </P> <P> In some ways, they appear to be a new breed of rebel in the Philippines.  Although the group is an offshoot of the rightist Reform the Armed Forces  Movement, or RAM, its young officers call themselves the non-Communist Left.  </P> <P> In interviews and manifestoes, they espouse an often-contradictory ideology  that calls for a "national revolution" to free the country of feudalism,  poverty and foreign domination. They especially stress "Filipinism," a  nationalist movement popular in the 1930s, when the nation was an American  colony.  </P> <P> Vague promises of land reform and social justice sound like those of the  outlawed Communist New Peoples' Army. Indeed, the YOU has offered to join  forces with the NPA if the latter renounces communism. While that's unlikely,  analysts say the YOU is the first military faction to reach out for mass  appeal.  </P> <P> "They're more likely to compete for the same ground than to collaborate," said  Francisco Nemenzo, a University of the Philippines chancellor who has studied  both groups.  </P> <P> Still, the YOU has adopted Communist-style jargon and organization. It builds  "cells," coordinates "plenums," and holds "self-criticism sessions." It seeks  civilian fronts, recruiting among students, labor and other groups. And it  claims 198 "collectives" with three to seven members each.  </P> <P> Military officials scoff, saying they've identified only 40 core members in an  officer corps of nearly 15,000. "But we really don't know exactly how big it  is," says Rafael Ileto, head of the National Security Council. "It's one of  those nebulous things. It's more a movement than an organization."  </P> <P> One senior officer said the group has a strong appeal, however. "How can we  fight nationalism?" he asked. "How can we fight Filipinism? It is very  difficult. . . . The majority of my men are probably sympathizers."  </P> <P> By its own account, the YOU was secretly launched in August, 1988, by six  captains and lieutenants disillusioned with the fugitive colonels and generals  leading RAM. The so-called Ramboys helped bring Aquino to power in 1986 but  then tried and failed six times to overthrow her.  </P> <P> In the most recent attempt, rebel junior officers of the Scout Ranger Regiment,  an elite army commando unit, took over Manila's Makati financial district as  the coup was collapsing, trapping thousands of terrified tourists and residents  for five days.  </P> <P> Intelligence officials now say the leaders of that siege, particularly Maj.  Abraham Purugganan, acted without consulting senior officers in RAM who had  organized the coup. Purugganan is now a leader of YOU. He is also a fugitive  who carries a telephone beeper on his belt and a $40,000 price on his head.  </P> <P> The group finally went public in April this year, claiming credit after 15  hooded commandos carrying cases of beer for the wardens raided the city jail  and freed Lt. Col. Billy Bibit, a key coup plotter. Military officials suspect  that Bibit, now in the underground, has directed the Manila bombing campaign.  </P> <P> Until recently, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos denounced the YOU as either a  phantom organization or a RAM-controlled political front designed to revive  RAM's sagging credibility. If so, the YOU has consciously rejected much of  RAM's style.  </P> <P> Unlike RAM's well-known and flamboyant fugitive leader, Gregorio (Gringo)  Honasan, all YOU spokesmen and leaders use the same anonymous nom de guerre:  "Capt. Carlos Maglalang." In a May meeting with Philippine reporters, all six  ostensible rebels identified themselves as Carlos Maglalang.  </P> <P> "They want to avoid a cult of personality," said one local reporter who  attended the session.  </P> <P> And unlike RAM, the YOU warns it will "conduct military actions" to force the  United States to close military bases in the Philippines. Some diplomats  suspect they were responsible for grenade attacks earlier this year on a U.S.  Embassy residential compound and a U.S. Information Service library, both in  Manila. Damage was slight and there were no injuries.  </P> <P> Officials say the YOU has mostly recruited 1978 to 1988 graduates of the  Philippine Military Academy, which is modeled after West Point. They are under  age 35 and mostly below the rank of major. That makes them too young to be  tainted, as RAM leaders are, for having enforced Draconian martial-law decrees  for former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a generation gap," said Nemenzo. "I think there is a process  of alienation from RAM. But their links are still strong."  </P> <P> At least one YOU recruiting session was held in the officers club at Camp  Aguinaldo, headquarters of the Defense Department, according to testimony  before a presidential commission studying last December's failed coup.  </P> <P> Maj. Erasto L. Sanchez, commander of a paramilitary police station south of  Manila, told the panel that a fellow PMA graduate tried to recruit him at his  house last October. He said officers were targeted "if they think . . . you  are, shall we say, subversive minded."  </P> <P> While Sanchez said he did not join, a young Scout Ranger patrolling recently on  a provincial road north of Manila clearly had. He had penned his sympathies in  large letters on the canvas top of his boots: "Makati Warrior."  </P> <P> Asked where he was during the December siege, he replied, "I was a sniper in  the Twin Towers," a plush condominium complex. Asked about his current plans,  he grinned under his dark Ray-Bans and fingered the grenades on his belt.  </P> <P> "I'm waiting for the next one," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Report claims Heseltine in breach of duty: Coalfields may take fight to court COALFIELD communities threatened by pit closures are likely to widen their campaign against the UK government by taking legal action against Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The first steps towards the courts were taken yesterday when Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, in the report of an inquiry into pit closures he has been conducting for Nottinghamshire County Council, argued that both Mr Heseltine and Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had been in breach of their statutory duty under the Electricity Act 1989. He also suggested that action could be taken in the European Court against Mr Heseltine under Articles 90 and 92 of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Community. These articles relate to distortion of competition by publicly-owned enterprises. Mr Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the council, said: 'We will hope to get our partners together to seek legal redress.' The partners to which he referred are the local authorities which are members of the Coalfield Communities Campaign. Both public and private-sector organisations in Nottinghamshire, fearful of seven colliery closures with direct and indirect job losses of 14,000, have been vocal in their protests. The Scrivener report, which includes two volumes of evidence, was yesterday submitted to Mr Heseltine, in connection with his promised white paper on energy policy, and to the Commons select committee on trade and industry. Mr Scrivener contended both that 'there is unequivocal evidence of a rigged market' in electricity and that, under the terms of the Electricity Act, the secretary of state, in this case Mr Heseltine, has a duty to promote competition. 'If the evidence is such that competition is being distorted, as claimed, then not only has he the power to act but he has a duty to do so and in the final resort interested parties have a right, enforceable in the courts, to require him to perform his duty,' Mr Scrivener said. He also considered that the legality of a levy on fossil fuels and the provision of a subsidy to support nuclear power 'must be questionable' under the Treaty of Rome. He suggested that 'proceedings could be taken . . . without getting involved in the more controversial question of governments in the EC providing subsidies - which is a political 'hot potato'.' Mr Scrivener concluded from evidence presented to the three-day enquiry he conducted in Nottingham last month that 'Europe's largest coal resource can be turned off because of distortions in a non-competitive market.' There should be, instead, a national energy policy which includes 'securing and maintaining an indigenous supply of coal.' He also suggested that there should be a moratorium on electricity supplies from France, the decommissioning of older nuclear power stations, no building of new gas power stations and 15-year contracts for British Coal from the power generators - the same as gas contracts.</p>

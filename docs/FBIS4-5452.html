			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty the King yesterday urged Thais living  in Laos to view the Friendship Bridge as a symbol to mark the  start of a new era of relations and friendship between Thailand  and Laos and their people. He warned that relations between the  two countries would deteriorate as in the past if his advice was  not heeded.    "I visited Laos this time through the Friendship Bridge. I  would like the bridge to be the start of a new era of your  performance and the new era of relations between Thailand and  Laos," His Majesty told 200 Thais who were granted an audience  before he left for Bangkok at the end of his two-day visit to  Laos, his first foreign visit in almost 30 years.    On their performance, His Majesty referred to the duty of  all  Thais to do their best to carry out their work as  representatives of Thailand. This was his first remark on the  bridge since he jointly presided over its formal opening with  Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan on Friday. Most of the 200  Thais granted an audience by His Majesty were businessmen and  industrialists.    He told them their performance, which impresses Laotian  officials and people, would enhance peace and security between  the two countries. "If you do as suggested, you will be  regarded as fulfilling your duty as a Thai," he said.    "A detrimental performance will jeopardise peace and  friendship between the two countries and will finally lead to a  situation that you are unable to stay in this country," the King  stressed.    Good relations between the two peoples would pave the way  for  more Thais to visit Laos, he said.    "Everybody here, regardless of your differences in  background  and objectives, must bear in mind a duty to promote friendship,  to perform to impress Laotian officials and people and help Laos  wherever needed," he said and cited his royally-sponsored  projects which aim to improve the livelihood of Laotian people.    "He called on Thai people in Laos to show to the world an  example of living harmoniously and peacefully by the way they  treat their Laotian counterparts. It will be an example to  other regions which will be admired and which will bring about  peace," he said.    His Majesty ended his visit to Laos yesterday with the  traditional Baisi well-wishing ceremony at Hokham, the  presidential palace. Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal  Highness Princess Maha Chakkri Sirinthon and the Laotian  president as well as Mrs. Bounma also attended the ceremony.  The royal family later proceeded to Wattai Airport for their  journey back to Bangkok.    Earlier in the day, Their Majesties the King and Queen and  the Princess visited Wat That Luang for a religious ceremony.  They proceeded to a Royal orphanage sponsored by the Princess  to donate sports equipment and educational materials. The  royally sponsored orphanage is 67 kilometers north of Vientiane.  It houses children orphaned by the war in Laos and also  children from poor families.    Princess Sirinthon sponsored this project since she first  visited Laos in March 1990. She built a new dormitory with  donations and used her own personal funds, about 350,000 baht,  to build another dormitory, named Sirinthon Building.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (1): Centre of gravity moves to the east - Embattled western suppliers risk more restructuring if they fail to win the new business generated by Asia's expanding economies As growth in demand in the world market for electricity generating equipment shifts inexorably eastwards, western suppliers are warily eyeing each others' efforts to benefit from growth opportunities. Declining demand in western markets has left the industry with surplus capacity. In the new markets of Asia, they are faced with increasing demands to share contracts and technology with local partners. The top suppliers, whose wares are on show at this week's Power-Gen '94 exhibition in Cologne, have yet to demonstrate whether they can meet this challenge. A review just of April's events in the industry shows where the big new deals are being struck. On the same day, Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri announced a contract worth about Dollars 1bn to build a turnkey 1,300MW gas-fired combined cycle plant in Malaysia, while Siemens said its KWU power generation business had clinched an order worth nearly DM1bn to equip a 2,364MW combined cycle station in Taiwan. Also in April, GE of the US announced a Dollars 170m order to supply a turnkey power plant for a 440MW independent power project in Malaysia, one of the first such stations planned by the south-east Asian country. And Westinghouse Electric, also of the US, picked up an order worth more than Dollars 100m from Korea Electric Power for the supply of turbines, generators and related equipment. Much of the demand is being met through joint ventures and similar arrangements. Two deals are particularly striking. ABB is forming a majority-owned joint venture in Vietnam with CTBT, a local transformer manufacturer. The European company said the venture was the biggest in the electrotechnical industry to be undertaken in Vietnam by a foreign company. In the UK, meanwhile, Babcock International has announced a partnership agreement with Wuhan Boiler Works, China's fourth biggest boiler maker, which is designed to help Babcock expand its presence in the Asian market. Significantly, the first order following the agreement will see Babcock supplying design expertise while Wuhan will be doing the manufacturing. The UK company is recognising that to win orders in Asia, western suppliers cannot expect to produce everything themselves. As ABB's figures show, (see chart), there is enormous variation between different regions, which explains why suppliers are having to turn themselves into global players. And the upward line in the forecast is due mainly to growth in China and Asian countries. 'Suppliers have historically been in markets that last year were shrinking - Europe, the US and Japan,' says Mr Goran Lundberg, an ABB executive vice-president and head of its power plants business. 'Global growth is coming out of the internal growth of China. So everyone is tense and nervous, as competition is hardening.' Mr Lundberg believes that the power equipment industry is facing some 'quite dramatic' changes, as it continues over the next five to 10 years to become more global. The ambitions of equipment suppliers in China and Korea will make it important for western suppliers to recognise the need for new alliances and combinations, he says. Also, he says, large equipment suppliers will have to continue investing heavily to ensure they have a broad range of products for customers with widely differing financial and technical priorities, and will have to raise ing productivity in their traditional manufacturing plants. Suppliers should only manufacture in high-cost countries when it is competitive to do so, he says. ABB's assessment of future growth for the industry broadly coincides with those of its rivals. Westinghouse, for example, says that the global market for new capacity additions is about 60,000MW a year, and says demand is expected to grow to about 100,000MW annually in the next 10 years. Even so, the total market will only then have recovered to levels reached in the late 1970s, and its geographic and competitive profile will have been transformed. Mr Lundberg believes, therefore, that the industry will see further restructuring, and that small and medium-sized European players will find it difficult to cope with the challenges ahead. 'They may need to get into a larger structure so they can draw on the resources of the larger company with its volume,' he says. In spite of the heavy restructuring that has already taken place in the industry, Mr Lundberg says it has not gone as far as in other 'oligopolic' industries, through exchanges of products, for example. Meanwhile, although Asia is clearly at centre stage, there is still activity in the wings. In spite of the gloom of recession in many European countries, the power equipment market there looks to be very promising, says Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems  - Europe. He foresees annual growth in the installed power capacity base of 2 per cent, which may not sound too exciting, but equates to an overall 172,000MW growth in the market between 1994 and 2002 (including Russia and Central Europe). There are a variety of dynamics driving the market, he says, including economics and the environment. 'There is an awful lot of the installed base that is old, relatively inefficient, and is not burning the cleanest of fuels,' he says. No country can afford to let its industrial sector pay more than the world rate for power, so this creates a powerful argument for installing replacement equipment. Privatisation and the development of independent power projects is seen by Mr Pressman as the third big issue in Europe. The UK, where both GE and its business associates have supplied independent power producers, still provides the best model, but Mr Pressman is not alone among power equipment executives in predicting the continued spread of privatisation on the continent. Signs of recovery in Germany, which could have a knock-on effect across the continent, also point to increased demand for power. But Mr Pressman is also optimistic about developments in central Europe and particularly Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland which, he says, are 'leading the pack'. Last month, GE scored a notable coup by clinching a 10-year co-operation agreement with the much-wooed Skoda of the Czech Republic. This was the US company's first power equipment-related joint venture in eastern Europe and was negotiated under the nose of Siemens, which has been talking intermittently to Skoda for more than two years. Russia has also received considerable attention from suppliers in recent months, as much in words as in deeds. Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's president, was one of the first western businessmen to criticise the low level of funds being made available to the countries of the former Soviet Union to upgrade their power stations and bring the more modern nuclear stations up to western safety standards - and close the rest. Earlier this year, Mr Barnevik said the west had missed an opportunity to help Russia and his comments were echoed last month by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Siemens, who said Western companies and countries should work together to help Russia improve safety standards at its nuclear power stations. On the technical side, the major suppliers continue their quest for ever higher thermal efficiency from combined cycle power. Developments in the past year included the announcement by ABB of a new range of gas turbines for which it is claiming efficiencies of 58-58.5 per cent in combined cycle. Thermal efficiency remains one of the key advantages of gas-fired combined cycle, and Dr Hans Bohm, a member of the executive management group at Siemens KWU, says the next step is to reach 60 per cent thermal efficiency in combined cycle. 'It will not need more than two or three years before such a machine is sold,' he says. This month, he says, Siemens is due to begin testing in Berlin of a new gas turbine which will achieve 60 per cent thermal efficiency in combined cycle. Dr Bohm thinks the natural limit will occur somewhere between 60 and 62 per cent, because of the high research and development costs required even to raise temperatures by a small amount.  ---------------------------------              EUROPE  --------------------------------- Forecast 1994-2002 (gigawatts)  --------------------------------- CIS/Russia                   37 Central Europe               29 Germany                      19 Italy                        14 United Kingdom               13 Turkey                       13 Scandinavia                  12 Spain                         9 Benelux                       9 Ukraine                       6 Baltics                       1 Other                        10 TOTAL                       172  --------------------------------- Source: General Electric  ---------------------------------</p>

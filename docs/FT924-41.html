			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / AMB sale of BfG Bank approved by shareholders SHAREHOLDERS of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, one of Germany's largest insurers, yesterday voted overwhelmingly to approve the sale of a 25 per cent stake in the BfG Bank, to Credit Lyonnais, giving the French bank control of Germany's sixth largest bank. The shareholders also agreed - by more than nine to one - to register a 25 per cent stake in AMB by Assurances Generales de France, the French state-controlled insurer which helped engineer the bank deal. AGF, now AMB's biggest single shareholder, is expected to exercise increasing influence over the German group's direction. Shareholders approved by 96.24 per cent of the vote for AMB to give up its BfG stake and by 92.96 per cent to back registration of AGF's shares. The votes represented a defeat of efforts by Fondiaria, the Italian insurer that owns 20 per cent of AMB, to block the sale. Fondiaria was stopped from voting at the meeting because its shares had not been registered in time. The Fondiaria shares had been considered the largest interest block against the proposals. Yesterday's vote follows an agreement reached in July whereby AGF promised to work to get its ally, Credit Lyonnais, to take a majority stake in the troubled BfG. The French bank plans to inject DM1.2bn (Pounds 491m) into the acquisition. The deal throws doubt on the development of co-operation between AMB, Fondiaria and Royal Insurance who agreed to develop jointly their European businesses in 1991.</p>

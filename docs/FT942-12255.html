			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: C&amp;G takeover threatens diversity and mutuality Sir, How far should the ideal of mutuality be protected? This is the critical question in the proposed takeover by Lloyds Bank of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Your report ('Lloyds' High Court hurdle', April 26) of the legal obstacles in the way of the takeover draws attention to the commission's view that payments to existing members can only be made to those persons who have been members for at least two years. One of the aims of the two-year qualification period is to strengthen the position of a mutual society. In such an organisation, the assets of the society are owned by the members themselves. On a takeover, there is a one-off opportunity to release the value of those assets. The ideal of mutuality requires that only those who have been members for a period of time should share in this release. If the take-over of the C&amp;G by Lloyds succeeds, this ideal will have been damaged. Ultimately, do we want diversity in the institutions which provide borrowing facilities to the general public? If so, the mutuals have a vital part to play. They bring a different perspective to the market and a wide degree of choice. The government is currently reviewing the position of building society mergers and acquisitions. One reason why building societies are vulnerable to being taken over is the limits that are imposed on their ability to raise funds in the wholesale market. Part of the review should cover the question of whether these limits should be revised or removed. If the playing field between banks and building societies were levelled, many more societies would be in a stronger position to resist the pressures for take-over and the ideal of mutuality could be preserved. Without a successful review, the ideal of mutuality will be lost and competition sacrificed. Elizabeth Mayer, Fox Williams, solicitors, City Gate House, 39-43 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1UU.</p>

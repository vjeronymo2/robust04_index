			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Akins Development Co., a smaller Orange County home builder, said it is making  its first move into San Bernardino and Riverside counties with $50 million  worth of new homes in San Bernardino's Rancho Cucamonga.  </P> <P> Akins said it will build 145 homes with prices set to start in the low $300,000  range. The smaller builder is doing the project as a joint venture with the  massive William Lyon Co.  </P> <P> Akins has already built extensively in Orange County but, like other local home  builders, has been drawn to the cheaper land and livelier housing markets of  the two inland counties.  </P></p>

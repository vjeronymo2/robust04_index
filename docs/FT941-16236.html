			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Arco in Dollars 450m charge to cover reorganisation Atlantic Richfield (Arco) is to take a charge of Dollars 450m after tax to cover the costs of shrinking its US oil and gas businesses outside Alaska, writes Richard Waters in New York. The charge, announced yesterday and to be included in fourth-quarter figures for 1993, follows Arco's announcement in October that it would incur a 'substantial' charge to reshape the bulk of its US operations. It covers severance costs from shedding 1,300 jobs, as well as the write-down of some oil and gas properties which the company plans to sell.</p>

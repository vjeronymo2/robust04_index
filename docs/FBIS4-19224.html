			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Thaw in Trade With Iran"] </F>   [Text] On Tuesday [12 April], during Iranian Foreign  Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's visit to Austria, the interest of  the media focused on human rights and the Rushdie case.  However, during Velayati's talk with Economics Minister  Schuessel, the focus was on the revival of Austrian-Iranian  trade: In 1993 Austria's exports to Iran decreased by 20  percent and imports even by 29 percent. The reason was Iranian  payment difficulties and, as a result, nonliability by the  Austrian Control Bank. In mid-March at least the obstacle of  financing and liability was overcome: In bilateral negotiations  in mid-March, Austria rescheduled Iranian debts amounting to 5  million schillings.</p>

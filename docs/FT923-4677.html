			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Italy suspends further aid flights to Sarajevo THE ITALIAN government yesterday announced the suspension of further humanitarian flights to Sarajevo as evidence mounted that the aircraft which crashed killing its four-man crew near the Bosnian capital on Thursday had been hit by a missile. Mr Salvo Ando, Italian defence minister, said yesterday, after a cabinet meeting: 'The most probable thesis is that the aircraft was shot down.' At the time of the incident, the G-222 military transport, without armed escort, was easily identifiable at 10,000 feet on a route normally used for humanitarian flights. It was carrying blankets to some 380,000 people trapped by a five-month Serb siege of Sarajevo. Mr Ando said this suggested that, if the aircraft had been the object of an attack, a missile was the most likely weapon. Three of the bodies were recovered by UN rescue teams on Thursday evening; the fourth was recovered yesterday. From Belgrade, there were reports that two eye-witnesses had said the aeroplane was hit before it crashed into mountains controlled by Moslem and Croat forces some 20 miles west of Sarajevo. A local commander of the Croatian Defence Council yesterday admitted it had shot at US search and rescue helicopters investigating the wreckage. Mr Ando said Italian humanitarian flights would not be resumed 'until we have found out what happened and, above all, who was responsible'. UN humanitarian flights into Sarajevo have also been suspended until the cause of the Italian crash is clear. In Belgrade, Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the internationally unrecognised Yugoslavia, won a no-confidence motion in the federal parliament by 66 votes to 33. In the debate, MPs had accused the outspoken prime minister of having betrayed Serbian interests at the London peace conference last week. In his lively defence, Mr Panic told the Socialist-dominated parliament that the London talks had been a turning-point for the unrecognised Yugoslavia. The no-confidence motion was proposed by members of the Socialist Party and the Serbian Radical Party, which is headed by Mr Vojislav Seselj, an ultra-nationalist. He is also commander of a paramilitary wing and is known as Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's favourite politician. However, Mr Milosevic has been increasingly isolated after the failure of an earlier bid to oust the prime minister. Meanwhile, in Geneva, the UN launched an urgent appeal for an additional Dollars 434m (Pounds 218m) 'to avert a looming humanitarian disaster' in the former Yugoslavia this winter. However, the appeal covers less than half the Dollars 1bn-plus a UN team of experts has said is needed up to March. UN officials say that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk from hunger, cold and disease in the Balkan winter. More than 600,000 refugees in Croatia have no adequate shelter and more than 2m people in Bosnia are living in war-torn areas, many without water, heating or even window covers. After the first snows, many mountain roads will be impassable for relief convoys. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who presented the appeal in Geneva, said the international community had to act now: 'Time is short and thousands of lives are at stake.' The UN call for funds covers 'life-threatening priority needs' for the 2.7m people directly affected by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Half of these are children and the rest mostly women, elderly and disabled. Almost 2m have fled their homes and others remain trapped in cities under siege.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pharmaceuticals drive Zurich to new peak BOURSES were mixed as, market by market, investors looked at different sectors, individual companies and other characteristics, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH broke through the SMI 2,200 level, the index ending 20.0 higher at an all time high of 2,205.2, led by another strong performance in the pharmaceuticals sector. Ms Susan Haylock, of NatWest Securities in London, said that investors were realising that their worst fears about the potential impact of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform in the US were unlikely to be realised. Ciba-Geigy registered shares were the day's most active issue, rising SFr8 to SFr634. Roche certificates added SFr70 to SFr4,590. Against the trend, Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers shed SFr5 to SFr520 as the group said that losses at its holding company would prevent it from paying a dividend on its 1993 results. PARIS fell back with many investors unwilling to take positions ahead of the long weekend - the bourse will be closed on Thursday and Friday. The CAC-40 index slipped 16.02 to 1,835.72 in moderate turnover of FFr2.2bn. There was speculative interest in BNP, a privatisation candidate, after it announced that it was to nominate as chairman the present head of CCF, who oversaw that group's privatisation in 1987. BNP CI's rose FFr17 to FFr548 while CCF dropped FFr2.50 to FFr230. BSN shed FFr15 to FFr874 ahead of today's first quarter sales figures which, some analysts forecast, could show a 6-7 per cent drop over the same 1992 period. AMSTERDAM saw a heavy fall in Heineken which some analysts attributed to disappointing results from UK brewers, and reaction to Spanish devaluation given its exposure to that market. The shares lost Fl 4.20 to Fl 179.60. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.0 to 106.5. KLM fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 25.60 on weekend press reports that the airline might report sharply lower earnings when it publishes its figures for the year to end-March next month. MILAN made a mixed start to the June account although privatisation candidates put in a strong showing as the market gave a broad welcome to the appointment of Mr Romano Prodi as the chairman of Iri, the state holding company. The Comit index rose 0.56 to 539.55. Hopes of a quick sale helped Credito Italiano L79 higher to L2,927, as the share traded ex rights worth L85 a share. Fiat was steady at the start, adding L1 to fix at L6,551 before sliding 3 per cent to L6,350 after hours. Olivetti fell L34 to fix at L1,350 ex-rights, before subsiding further to L1,315 on the kerb. Analysts said that the share price had taken the L903bn rights issue in its stride, and that weekend news that Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the chairman, had admitted that the company paid bribes to political parties had had little effect. FRANKFURT went through the motions, trading narrowly in a thin market as the DAX index eased 6.63 to 1,627.88. Turnover fell from DM6.3bn to DM4.7bn. Deutsche Bank was the active stock among DAX constituents, rising DM3.80 to DM698.50 ahead of Wednesday's dividend payment and following a recommendation from brokers James Capel. The laggard in banks was Dresdner, ex a DM12 dividend and down a net DM5.30 to DM374.20 after the Capel sell recommendation in last week's quarterly review of the German market. Capel liked banks in general, as interest rate beneficiaries, along with insurances and high yielders. MADRID saw profit-taking after last week's devaluation, and some caution ahead of today's Maastricht vote in Denmark. The general index closed 0.93 lower at 252.96. Banks, strong last week on interest rate sensitivity, mostly fell, BBV losing Pta95 to Pta3,070 and Santander Pta130 to Pta5,490. Utilities were mixed after last week's belated response, but Sevillana dropped Pta22 at Pta428. BRUSSELS edged lower in quiet conditions ahead of today's Danish referendum and the Bel-20 index slipped 2.58 to 1,212.45. Against the trend, Petrofina added BFr190 or 2.3 per cent to BFr8,420 on optimism for the 1993 earnings outlook after Friday's annual shareholders' meeting. HELSINKI fell on the threat of labour conflict in the country's export sector starting on Wednesday, the HEX index closing 14.15, or 1.2 per cent lower at 1,150.71 after an earlier fall of about 2 per cent. Turnover was lower than usual at FM70.1m. ISTANBUL edged lower as profits were again taken after last Thursday's record close. The 75-share index eased 46.1 to 8,229.91 with Sunday's election of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel as president already discounted by the market. WARSAW's WIG index eased by 22.0 to 2,541.6 in record turnover of 353.3bn zloty, up from 302bn on Friday. The WIG has previously risen by a phenomenal 96 per cent in just over a month, from 1,310.7 on April 8 to 2,563.6 on May 13. Turnover has also shown a marked increase over the period, from between 30bn zloty and 70bn zloty in the first week of April.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 17                                               THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open        10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1147.08      1147.78     1147.66    1146.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1213.93      1215.29     1214.52    1213.49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00        14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1145.97      1145.65     1145.77    1146.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1214.27      1213.69     1213.55    1214.06  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 14    May 13    May 12    May 11    May 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.21   1155.16   1148.06   1140.44   1142.74 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1212.97   1219.59   1215.04   1206.03   1203.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1148.38; 200 - 1215.86 Low/day: 100 - 1144.83 200 - 1212.57  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Rise in basic pensions ruled out: Concern grows over compensation scheme for fuel bill tax THE government yesterday appeared to rule out an increase in basic pensions to compensate for the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel bills. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, pointed out that many pensioners were not on low incomes. To provide them with special help would 'miss the target'. Mr Dorrell's comments are likely to increase concern among some Conservative backbenchers over the controversial measure to levy VAT at 8 per cent on domestic fuel from April 1994 and at 17.5 per cent the following year. As MPs prepared to vote on the Budget resolutions tonight, Labour stepped up its attack on the government over the issue, accusing ministers of having 'torn up' the commitments made last Thursday about extra help with fuel bills. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday called the Budget 'a bonfire of John Major's election promises and Conservative party election pledges'. Labour will target Tory MPs who serve on the committee to discuss the finance bill, contrasting their own election pledges with last week's announcement. Interviewed on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, confined himself to offering help to 'poorer' pensioners and families, likely to total about 10m people. He explicitly ruled out doing so by exempting people in need from paying VAT on fuel bills, saying that such a course would be expensive, inappropriate and an 'administrative nightmare'. Although Mr Andrew Bowden, the Tory chairman of the all-party pensioners' group of MPs, last week urged extra help for pensioners who just fail to qualify for income-related benefits, Mr Dorrell appeared to rule out doing so through the basic state pension. 'If we want to help people on low incomes, and the government has made it clear that in the context of this VAT change we do want to help people on low incomes, then to take pensioners as a category would be to miss the target,' he said on BBC radio. Mr Lamont refused to give a figure for the amount of extra help that would be provided in compensation. He added, however: 'This measure in the Budget is designed to raise revenue. I want to help those in adverse circumstances, but I do not want to give it all back.' Tory MPs are certain to press the chancellor to give a definitive statement of the government's plans when he winds up the budget debate tonight.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F> Federation Government Apparatus and Federal Minister, by unnamed  correspondent; date and place of interview not stated: "The  State and Its Apparatus"]    [Text] At a recent government Presidium session, Viktor  Chernomyrdin, speaking of ways of reducing the expenditure part  of the budget, noted that the state management apparatus has  become unjustifiably swollen. Where has the state apparatus  become "swollen?" What today is the position of state  employees? Can the struggle for sectorial and departmental  interests be shifted into the channel of civilized lobbying? At  a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent's request Federal Minister  Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government  apparatus, considers these questions.    As for the reorganization of the Government apparatus, its  reduction, the merging of departments, and the creation of new  ones, it is still early to speak of the results of this work.  Work is in full swing. If we are speaking of the state  management apparatus, which has indeed over recent years come  close to the million mark, then such an enormous increase  occurred through the increase in the regions -- in Russia's  krays, oblasts, and rayons. After all, there are about 350,000  officials at rayon management level alone, as was mentioned by  government head Viktor Chernomyrdin. And the federal organs'  apparatus has not grown for several years and numbers about  35,000.    Thus the state apparatus has been "swollen" because of the  regions, which under the Federation Treaty are independent in  their decisions. The federal organs exercise less and less  control over them and it remains for us only to "collate the  statistics."    It s known that the main task of the government apparatus is  to prepare its decisions and the second, no less important, is  to monitor the fulfillment of these decisions. But naturally it  is impossible to monitor all government instructions. After all  last year alone there were nearly 48,000 of them. But the most  important, on which the state of affairs in the national economy  and other spheres depends, are monitored, and quite toughly.    As for lobbying, perhaps I shall say something almost  criminal, but I myself have been lobbied. But... in a civilized  manner. For our country the concept of lobbying and lobbying  itself is something new. Lobbying is only emerging and has not  yet assumed the form of legislative acts. perhaps it is for  that reason that Russian lobbying is of an uncivilized nature.  On the other hand, for instance, a deputy elected from some  region to the State Duma has undoubtedly been lobbied. And that  is understandable, even in purely human terms. Why was he  elected if he not only will not represent his region's interest  but will not "promote" them?    But when it is a case of "promoting" some document to the  government to make it make an important decision and the  document itself is raw and unfinished as they say, then that  kind of lobbying is blatantly uncivilized and is based mainly on  amicable relations with someone from the government leadership.    And in this connection we can dwell on work with ministries  and departments. Demands on the preparation of documents  submitted for the government's examination have now been made  sufficiently tough. Incidentally, according to existing norms  all documents which are to be examined by the government are  unfailingly agreed on in advance with the ministry and  department. Actually, under the existing situation, only an  agreed document is examined in the government, and the role and  task of the government apparatus is merely to legalize it and  report it. But unfortunately a situation often takes shape in  which an attempt is made by hook or by crook to "promote" an  unfinished or, as we say, a "raw" document. At that moment  people do not think of the problems which will unfailingly arise  and could have various and sometimes grave consequences.    That is why the apparatus has now considerably toughened  demands on documents of this nature. Unfinished documents are  simply sent back, which of itself is already a serious warning.    Now about state employees. It is no secret that there is  always a problem with good and well qualified cadres, especially  now when there is a temptation to get more money by working in  commercial structures. But the president has signed the edict  on introducing the statute on state service and the necessary  normative documents are being elaborated to implement this  statute. These are the fundamental legal documents giving a  state employee certain guarantees for the entire period of his  work in state service. And when they begin to operate the  attitude toward the state employee will change fundamentally.    Has the government apparatus work style changed? Undoubtedly  it has, for life does not stand still, everything is changing  rapidly. Of course, work in the apparatus is complex and takes  up almost all one's time. But if you succeed then you feel  great satisfaction. Probably this can be said by anyone of his  work to which a man actually devotes almost all his life.</p>

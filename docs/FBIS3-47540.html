Touching on the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Spero  stated: "No progress has been noted in the talks on different  sectors. It seems that there are situations in which Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be asked to handle issues on the  basis of his political responsibility."    In this way, Spero disclosed her expectation that Prime  Minister Hosokawa would make political decisions on the final  settlement of various issues in such priority sectors as  automobiles and auto parts, government procurement, and  insurance, over which the two countries are currently locked in  tough negotiations.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / UN to appraise role in Georgia Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, yesterday announced that talks would begin this week in Geneva to see whether UN peacekeepers or observers could complement Russian efforts to make peace between Georgia and its breakaway Abkhazia region, writes Leyla Boulton. The UN chief, in Moscow for talks with the Russian leaders, had earlier witnessed the signing of an agreement by Georgia and Abkhazia on the return of refugees displaced by the recent conflict. They also signed a joint appeal for the UN to deploy a peacekeeping force in the region, partly so as to counter Russian control over the situation. Mr Boutros Ghali told a news conference that the UN would have to decide whether to send a multinational force to operate in parallel with Russian troops already there, or simply to send observers. But, dashing Russian hopes for UN cash to finance its existing operations there, he said Russian troops already on the ground could not be given a full UN mandate because they were not under UN command.</p>

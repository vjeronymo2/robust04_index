			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: A POWER PLAY THE RAIDERS CANNOT LOSE  </P> <P> Just about a year ago, the Dallas Cowboys were sold to oil tycoon Jerry Jones  for $146 million. It was the highest figure ever paid for a professional sports  team. In exchange for his dollars, tycoon Jones got America's Team plus the  65,000-seat Texas Stadium plus the training camp.  </P> <P> There was, as always, debate over such a price. It was said that no football  team would pencil out at $146 million. It was suggested that Jones' psychic  reward from owning the team must be very great because the financial rewards  were likely to be meager.  </P> <P> I mention the Cowboys deal and that debate because it now serves as a contrast  -- or maybe a benchmark -- to the bidding frenzy surrounding the so-called Los  Angeles Raiders. The bidders come from three California cities, and two of them  have put offers on the table that dwarf the Cowboys deal.  </P> <P> What's intriguing about the frenzy is that none of the bidders are trying to  buy the Raiders. This flood of dollars is aimed simply at getting Al Davis and  his team to show up in a particular town and call it home. Never has so much  been offered for so little, to wit:  </P> <P> In Sacramento, developer Gregg Lukenbill and his group have promised, for  starters, to build the team a $100-million stadium. The group would guarantee  the Raiders $90 million from ticket sales over the first five years, and $105  million from luxury boxes and other ancillaries over 20 years. Just to meet  these payments, Lukenbill would have to see sellouts at virtually every Raider  game for the next two decades.  </P> <P> But that's not all. The Raiders would get a cut from any other event held at  the stadium, including 22.5% of any future baseball revenues. And finally, the  city and county of Sacramento would hand over a $50-million, up-front  "franchise fee" to Davis for being so good as to take the rest of the money.  </P> <P> The city of Oakland, long bereft of its former team, has offered the fanaticism  of real Raiders fans plus some sweeteners. Namely, $65 million to build luxury  boxes at the Oakland Coliseum, $22 million in guaranteed tickets sales and a  $32-million franchise fee.  </P> <P> Los Angeles once seemed content to lose the Raiders to now-humiliated  Irwindale. But last week the L.A. Coliseum managers apparently decided what the  hell, they could give away money as fast as Oakland and Sacramento. They  offered to tear down the Coliseum, build a new one for $125 million and give  Davis $60 million over 10 years if he'll say he loves L.A. As if that wasn't  enough, they reportedly raised the bid this week to $140 million for the  stadium and $76 million in cash.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, the L.A. bid falls into a slightly different category from the  others. Davis is being offered those millions not to move the team, but to keep  it exactly where it is now. In other words, nothing is being asked of the  Raiders except to say yes.  </P> <P> When the final deal is made, Davis will still own the Raiders, and the winning  city, along with its entrepreneurs, will get to take all the financial risks.  The situation is so skewed in favor of the Raiders' owner, so close to the  outrageous, that Davis-bashing on a serious scale has already begun.  </P> <P> Let me suggest that forces other than Davis' dark machinations may also be at  work here. There are reasons, I think, why California just happens to be the  spot where this phenomenon has boiled over, and why we may see more of this in  the future, not less.  </P> <P> It has to do, in part, with the boom here in California, and with a state in  flux. We have grown rich in ways that other regions of the country have not.  Sometimes you have to leave California to see the contrast. There's big money  now not only in L.A. and Orange County but in once-sleepy towns like  Sacramento.  </P> <P> And when new money comes of age, it needs to make itself felt. New money likes  to take things from old money. Notice that the biggest, fattest offer of all  comes from Sacramento. In part that's because Lukenbill and his crowd stand to  make millions from the development of nearby real estate if the Raiders go  there. It is also because the issue is more sharply felt in Sacramento, which  has long resented its position as the stepchild of the Bay Area and now  believes that its day is coming.  </P> <P> So, in part, Davis has been the beneficiary of a change taking place in  California. Some cities are in the ascendant while others decline, and the  movement of sports teams, to some degree, reflects that change.  </P> <P> As for the future, it is likely to bring more reshuffling. The San Francisco  Giants, the San Diego Padres, the Los Angeles Clippers all are itchy to move,  all looking for money from the richest suitors. Where they land will help show  us the new map of power in California.  </P></p>

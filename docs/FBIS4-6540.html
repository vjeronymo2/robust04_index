			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article, from the "Building of the New SDF </F> Following the End of the Cold War" series; part three entitled  "Lineup of 100 `P-3C' No Longer Justified"]    [Text] "I do not think today's Russia can invade Japan. We  do not want to sacrifice our town for a war that will never  occur." Seiho Kina (age 68) of Motobu, Okinawa, sighed in front  of the construction site of a Maritime Self-Defense Force [MSDF]  communications facility for "P-3C" antisubmarine patrol planes.  The Motobu communications facility is planned as a hookup  station between P-3C's in operation and the antisubmarine  warfare operation center (ASWOC) on the MSDF base in Naha. The  Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau [DFAB] has already  secured 96 percent of the construction site.    ASWOC's have been built in Hachinohe, Atsugi, Iwakuni, and  Kaya; however, the last one in Okinawa is facing strong  resistance from local citizens. Kina is the leader of the  Motobu residents who oppose the communication facility. About  10 local people stay in a watch-house every day so as not to  allow DFAB officials access to the construction site.    Nevertheless, a high-ranking MSDF officer stressed that  construction plans for the Motobu communications facility will  not be dropped, saying: "Okinawa's ASWOC cannot perform even  half of its functions if the Motobu communications facility is  not available." He added that antisubmarine warfare (ASW) by  P-3C's is the lifeline of the MSDF.    The MSDF is planning to procure 100 P-3C's (it currently has  94). When the MSDF obtains its goal, Japan will have the world's  second-largest lineup of P-3C's after the United States; this  will be even larger than the total of all NATO member nations,  except the United States. As a matter of fact, the heavily  equipped lineup is intended for coping with the military power  of the former Soviet Union.    Explaining the lineup of 100 planes, a senior member of the  MSDF Staff Office said: "We need 20 P-3C's to patrol deep seas,  60 for coastal sea areas, and 20 for sea lanes. The lineup of  100 planes is the minimum strength for covering all patrol areas  once a day."    The main concepts of Japan's sea lane defense are to secure  the nation's maritime traffic and protect U.S. fleets from  (former) Soviet submarines in southwestern and southeastern sea  lanes in case of emergency. In connection with the second  concept, the above-mentioned MSDF officer noted: "If we cannot  have Okinawa's ASWOC, we cannot cover the southern sea lanes,  and this will ruin Japan's entire ASW network."    However, Russian naval forces have become less active since  the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some believe submarines of  the Russian Pacific Fleet, including nuclear-powered submarines  equipped with ballistic missiles, have already been reduced to  around 40, or 50 percent less than the lineup in the Soviet era.  The MSDF Staff Office member said "we still have to exercise  precaution," but acknowledged the changes in Russia's posture,  saying: "We probably need other reasons to justify the lineup  of 100 P-3C's."    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's advisory "Defense Issues  Council" held its fourth meeting on 30 March. At the meeting,  members noted "excessive equipment has been observed" in the Air  Self-Defense Force [ASDF] and the MSDF. They said heavily  equipped ASW by P-3C is included among the questionable fields.    The council is currently reviewing the National Defense  Program Outline of 1976, focusing on reducing Ground  Self-Defense Force [GSDF] troops. The "threats" surrounding  Japan have been downgraded to "uncertainties," and the ASDF and  MSDF are also expected to be involved in discussions regarding  Japan's arms reduction. At the 30 March meeting, the Defense  Issues Council referred to ASDF and MSDF arms reduction for the  first time.    In Motobu, the Naha DFAB will shortly begin construction of  the communications facility. Kina looked up from the  watch-house at a P-3C and said: "I will stop the construction  work at the risk of my life."</p>

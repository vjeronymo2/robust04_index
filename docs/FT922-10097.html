			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: With time on your side - Screen WATCHING ON video recently Errol Morris's new film based on Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time (Palace), I noticed that - no, no, wait, let me first explain the Andrews Theory of Time. The first principle of this is that there are only so many hours in a day. The second is that time is curved, so you can meet yourself watching A Brief History Of Time before or after you thought you had finished watching it. Let me explain. Firstly, I had seen much of Errol Morris's film before, in a film about the making of Errol Morris's film. The project was set up by Steven Spielberg who does not skimp on pre-publicity. Secondly I glanced at the Radio Times and discovered that what I thought was an exclusive video premiere (rara avis]) is on Channel Four for all to see this Sunday at 8.30. pm. So I shall not pre-empt your enjoyment beyond commending Morris's skilful interweaving of the biographical and scientific-philosophical in expounding Hawking's life and ideas. However, these thoughts about Time have stayed with me. Over recent days I have laid the scientific basis for a new understanding of Subjective and Objective Time. Take an everyday household example. Have you noticed that when you drop a boiled egg on the floor time simultaneously contracts and expands? Your whole life appears to flash before you, in only a few seconds, as you see your breakfast destroyed by a chance accident. In video-watching this Subjective Time - extending or shrinking according to the intensity of the viewing experience offered - can be enhanced or negated by a volitional use of Objective Time. For instance: my favourite video releases this month are Cecil B DeMille's biblical epic Samson And Delilah (CIC), Jean Renoir's great tragicomedy of manners La Regle Du Jeu (Connoisseur), Jocelyn Moorhouse's teasing tale of a blind photographer Proof (Artificial Eye) and Spike Lee's edgy race-war comedy Jungle Fever. The minutes seem to fly by in these films, even though the viewer's hand will frequently arrest time to replay a favourite sequence. What is more, time can be made to move backwards. In Samson And Delilah I replayed Victor Mature's destruction of the Temple of Dagon in reverse. Ever since I was a child I wanted to do this: to see the million-dollar Paramount pillars rise again from the rubble. And in Moorhouse's brilliant Australian fable about the blind leading the sighted - the unseeing young hero fools the spiteful girl helper who tries to trip up his daily life - I could retrace the subtle suspense steps by which the director herself leads us on. The opposite is also true. However much you fast-forward through insomnia cures like this month's The Rookie (Warners), a dud Clint Eastwood cop opera, or Millennium (Warners), a certifiable sci-fi romp, or The Package (Virgin), in which Gene Hackman tries to win the Cold War before anyone can tell him it is over, time does not travel any faster. Indeed time appears to become slower while the viewer's own activity rate, vis-a-vis the remote control module, accelerates. These videos are known as Black Holes and should be avoided. Concentrate instead on the fact that we live in an expanding universe, as Stephen Hawking demonstrates, and the video market obeys the cosmic rules. Many films that used to be a certain length on the large screen are now, yes, longer on the small. Take Aliens: The Special Edition (Fox). Available in this form for only three months, James Cameron's monster movie starring Sigourney Weaver now contains 17 extra minutes of ravening, jaw-dripping, thoroughly enjoyable horror. This principle of longer video versions for home viewing is borrowed not from Einstein or Hawking, I believe, but from Washing Machine Theory. If you go to a launderette (equivalent of a cinema), you expect to have your clothes washed and dried in 90 minutes max. But at home - what is the hurry and where are you going? - your machine can take three hours to cleanse the same load. As I pointed out recently on another page, we live in a new age. Different movies for different viewing modes; and with video, uniquely, you can be your own editor, programmer and projectionist.</p>

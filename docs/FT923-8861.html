			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Motoring: Chrysler rides again - Jeep will lead the latest invasion WHAT DOES the name Chrysler mean to you? If a pensioner, you might recall the schoolboy excitement of spotting that stylish 1930s' streamliner, the Chrysler Airflow. If middle-aged, you might have owned an Avenger, which was born a Hillman and re-badged after Chrysler took over the old Rootes Group late in the 1960s. If younger, you could have bought a Chrysler 180 or Alpine in the 1970s. Chrysler, which also had acquired Simca in France, pulled out of Europe a few years later. To most of us, it then became a remote, all-American manufacturer, from time to time in danger of going belly-up. But it survived. And, a few days ago, it surprised observers of America's troubled car industry by reporting a Pounds 93m second-quarter profit against a Pounds 111m loss for the same period in 1991. Quite a few Chrysler cars are being sold on mainland Europe. They are mostly Voyager mini-vans (actually, large multi-purpose vehicles in the Renault Espace and Toyota Previa mould) and Jeeps. Chrysler took over Jeep when Renault, then owner of American Motors Corporation (which included Jeep) baled out of the US late in the 1980s. Chrysler is now about to return to Britain. Right-hand drive Jeeps will be introduced at the Birmingham International motor show in mid-October. In January, they will appear in the showrooms of 80 British Jeep dealers at prices that will bring no pleasure to 4 x 4 makers and importers like Daihatsu, Isuzu, Land Rover, Mitsubishi and Toyota. Jeeps are no longer the rough, open-to-the-elements pneumonia wagons of the Second World War. They are still just as tough and long-suffering, although the Cherokee station wagons have every mod con. Even the basic Wrangler has power steering. Chrysler Jeep Imports UK, of Dover, Kent, says the Cherokee Limited which is to spearhead the attack on Britain's healthy 4 x 4 market in January will cost between Pounds 18,000 and Pounds 20,000. That puts it at the Discovery, Trooper and Shogun price level. But the four-litre Cherokee will come, in the jargon of the trade, fully loaded. The price will include automatic transmission, ABS brakes, cruise control, air-conditioning, leather upholstery, power-operated seats and windows, central locking, alloy wheels and six-speaker stereo. It will have a three-year mechanical and six-year corrosion warranty. It is a great performer. On the road in rear-wheel drive, it went as quietly and smoothly as a normal estate car. Off-road in four-wheel drive, it clambered up and down steep, slippery hills and ploughed through deep mud as capably as, but more comfortably than, many a class rival. Few buyers will, of course, ever take one off-road seriously. It will be a Volvo estate car alternative, a role it will fill admirably. This time next year, the four-door Cherokee should be a familiar sight at horsey events as well as favoured transport for trendy town and suburban families. Britain also will get right-hand drive Wranglers with hardtops and five-speed gearboxes in January. A 2.5-litre version of this basic Jeep will be a working or fun vehicle; the Limited, with its four-litre engine, leather seats and alloy wheels, must have Chelsea farmer appeal. Prices will be in the Pounds 13,000-15,000 brackets. Next spring, the Jeep range will be broadened to include a 2.5-litre base model Cherokee - still well-equipped and with automatic transmission - and two-pedal Wranglers. By early 1994, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and a turbo-diesel Cherokee (using the same VM 2.5-litre engine as the Range Rover) will arrive. Grand Cherokee is Jeep's latest. Bigger than the standard Cherokee, although not in the least bloated, it combines typical American ride, comfort and silence with exceptionally good handling. Around a twisty circuit, it was just as fast as a Chrysler saloon - yet this civilised machine is also a formidable off-roader. It must compete strongly with Range Rover, particularly as it will cost far less. Chrysler's Voyager multi-purpose vehicle will not come to Britain for some time. Its sliding passenger door is on the right-hand side, which is fine for mainland Europe (where it sells well) but not for Britain; people would step out into the traffic. We shall have to wait for the next generation Voyager, due in about three years, to leave the assembly line with right-hand drive. Long before that, though, a small number of Vipers will have arrived. The Viper is Chrysler's most startling product. Hand-built at the rate of two a day, it has an eight-litre V10 engine putting out more than 400 horsepower. It has plastic panels, uses some suspension parts from a Chrysler-made Dodge pick-up truck, and leaves the start line like a bullet from a gun. There is a hood of sorts but it is meant to be driven open. Heaven knows what it would be like on a public road but, in the privacy of the proving ground, it was sensational - a cross between a Ferrari and a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1. This muscular go-kart for wealthy extroverts will cost around Pounds 50,000 when it arrives some time next year.</p>

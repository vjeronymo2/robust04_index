			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCI WILL SPEND $1 BILLION TO GO ALL-DIGITAL  </P> <P> MCI Communications Corp. said Tuesday that it would invest about $1.1 billion  to transform its telephone network into a fully digital system to improve  efficiency and profit, leading to a writeoff of $500 million to $550 million.  </P> <P> MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance telephone company, said the  charge could occur in the current quarter. It expects the new network to be in  place by the end of 1991.  </P> <P> The announcement sparked a selloff in the company's stock. MCI fell $1.125 to  $33.625 a share on the over-the-counter market, where it was the most active  issue.  </P> <P> The Washington-based telecommunications company said its plan includes sharing  telephone networks with Williams Telecommunications Group, a unit of Tulsa,  Okla.-based Williams Cos. Each company will have access to the other's network.  Terms of that agreement were not disclosed.  </P> <P> MCI also said it would integrate 3,000 miles of optical fiber network acquired  in its recent merger with Telecom U.S.A. and an investment of about $1.1  billion next year to modernize its network.  </P> <P> As part of its modernization plan, MCI said it was "considering a writedown of  antiquated" analog equipment.  </P> <P> Digital technology permits clearer and faster voice and data transmissions. It  is based on a stream of pulsed codes that are regenerated at the receiving end.  Unlike analog transmissions, digital signals do not get weaker as they get  farther from the originating point.  </P> <P> MCI's plan follows its acquisition of rival Telecom for $1.25 billion, which  will increase its long-distance market share to about 15% from 12.9%.  </P> <P> The company has been steadily chipping away at American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co.'s commanding 68.7% share of the market since the giant's monopoly  was broken in 1984. MCI was founded in 1968, but it did not become profitable  until 1988.  </P> <P> Analysts said the company's plans to modernize its network could result in a  third-quarter loss, but they expect the new system to eventually improve  efficiency and profit.  </P> <P> "MCI's planned improvements imply the need to make some upgrades to respond to  the competitive pressures of the business," said New Japan Securities analyst  David Boczar.  </P> <P> "The move will be positive over the long term, allowing MCI to control costs  more efficiently and offer new services," Boczar said.  </P> <P> Several industry analysts said they were cutting their third-quarter and  full-year earnings estimates for MCI.  </P> <P> Greg Sawers, an analyst with C. Bernstein, said the writeoff will result in a  third-quarter loss of about 50 cents a share. But he said he still expects the  company to earn 75 cents a share in operating earnings in the quarter.  </P> <P> MCI earned 62 cents a share in the year-ago third quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] The Military Council of the 14th Russian Army  yesterday adopted and published a toughly worded statement in  which the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic  are warned that decisive retaliatory measures will be taken,  including the use of arms, if the denigration and attacks on the  personnel and military objectives of the Russian Federation's  Army continue.    Likewise, the statement calls on the president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, and the leader  of the Supreme Soviet, Grigore Maracuta, to investigate in a  principled manner the illegal actions committed against soldiers  of the Russian Army and inform the 14th Army Command of the  steps taken.    This quasi-ultimatum attitude is the result of the  increasing  tension in Tiraspol, where, for some time, the Dniester leaders,  on the one hand, and General Lebed and Colonel Mihailov Bergman,  on the other, have been engaged in a real duel of mutual  accusations.    After General Lebed's recent meeting with directors of  schools and presidents of the trade union committees of these  institutions, to whom he suggested civic disobedience, and at  which meeting the Tiraspol leadership was harshly criticized,  the Russian officer was accused of plotting the overthrow of the  government. University Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, leader of a  group of civic organizations, described the general as an agent  of the Moldovan Republic. Regarding the general's participation  in a meeting convened by the Tiraspol Town Educational  Directorate, the same Yakovlev accused General Lebed of being an  accomplice in the Romanization of education in the Dniester  region by recognizing the right of Moldovan children to study in  Romanian in Latin script.    Likewise, in a statement adopted recently, the aktiv of the  Interior Ministry expressed its determination to defend the  statehood of the so-called Dniester Republic, no matter from  where the threats may come. Deputy Interior Minister Nicolay  Medveev called for the two Russian officers to be declared  persona non grata and expelled from the Dniester region. All  this has increased tension in Tiraspol alarmingly. As the local  correspondent of the National Radio Network of the Republic of  Moldova reported, in a way, a certain duality of power has been  established in the town. Both sides have sufficient and  well-equipped military and paramilitary forces.    Yesterday, General Aleksandr Lebed, writing in IZVESTIYA,  proposed a solution, quote: to eliminate all odious elements --  certainly he was referring to the Tiraspol leaders -- organize  new elections, and put certain credible persons in power.</p>

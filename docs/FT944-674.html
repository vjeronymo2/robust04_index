			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: Standa puts Euromercato hypermarket chain on sale Standa, the retail group controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest, yesterday said it was seeking to sell Euromercato, its hypermarket chain, Reuter reports from Milan. It said it had already received concrete offers. On sale will be the assets of Euromercato but not the company name. Industry sources said Standa could not sell the full company for tax reasons as it is written in its accounts at well below book value. The company said its chairman, Mr Giancarlo Foscale, had been authorised to handle the sale, fixing a price and conditions. Company sources have valued Euromercato at around L1,000bn (Dollars 608m). Six serious bidders were believed to be in the market for the group, including Benetton, the sportswear maker. Euromercato runs seven hypermarkets in northern Italy, with expected turnover this year of L1,300bn and net profits of L40bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Conference of President's </F> Representatives. President's Deputies Will Each Get a Chamber"]    [Text] Presidential representatives in the federation  components, who seem to have become wearied with longing for the  attention of journalists who are currently more interested in  the doings of local governors and speakers, have decided to  issue a reminder that they are there. During a conference of  the president's representatives in the regions of Siberia and  the Urals that ended late in the evening in Kurgan on Tuesday,  the "sovereign's men" decided to take into their own hands the  implementation of the Treaty on Social Accord in the regions.    As their rivals in the shape of local bodies of power are  growing stronger, the struggle of the president's  representatives to contain the inferiority complex that they are  developing takes on paramount importance. Therefore the idea  born in the depths of the president's staff to organize public  chambers was taken up with considerable enthusiasm. This  involves setting up regional analogues of the Public Chamber  under the president of Russia, where the main regional political  forces would be uniting under the warm wings of the presidential  deputies.    Assessing the creation of such public chambers as a correct  step which also makes it possible to implement in the regions  the provisions of the Treaty on Social Accord, the presidential  representatives from 11 krays and oblasts elaborated their own  proposals regarding the functioning of the public chambers. In  the first place, they think, the chambers should not be put  there by order, one can only recommend that they be created. To  have some weight, members of the chambers ought to have the  right to speak in regional legislative bodies, and to  participate in agreeing on presidential edicts before they have  become signed. Nor did the president's representatives forget  about the material problems of public chambers, asking Boris  Yeltsin to arrange for financing them.    However, the optimistic statements from the conference  podium  slightly diverged from the skeptical utterances in the lobby.  Some of its participants think that any positive effect from  creating the chambers is rather doubtful because they would be  joined mainly by minority parties with no serious power base.  Besides, the very existence of presidential representatives in  the regions has not been formalized by law, hence the public  chambers to be created under them would have no secure legal  status.</p>

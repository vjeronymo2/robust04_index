			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Split-Capital Trusts (6): An investment pick 'n' mix - But only for those who know what they're doing, warns Bethan Hutton Split-capital investment trusts frighten off many investors with their complexity. This is a shame, because, used properly, they can fulfil some very common financial planning needs. Split-capital trusts, like any other investment trust, are limited companies which invest in other companies to provide a return to their shareholders. The difference with split-capital trusts is that, rather than issuing just one class of ordinary share, and distributing the fund's income and capital growth equally between them, they issue two or more types of share, which lay claim to different parts of the trusts assets and dividends. Common classes of share are: Zero-dividend preference shares, which offer a predictable annual return in the form of capital growth, but receive no dividends along the way; Capital shares, which take all the capital gains after the zeros have had their entitlement; and Income shares, which receive the lion's share of the dividends, but are at the back of the queue for capital gains. Occasionally, income shares are designed to act like annuities, paying out both income and your original capital, and ending up worth little or nothing. Some trusts also have such hybrids as stepped preference shares - which have an entitlement to income and/or capital gains growing a fixed amount every year - and ordinary income shares, which mainly pay out the trust's dividend income, but have more of a claim on the trust's assets than standard income shares. Every trust is different in its structure. The attraction of this division of functions is that investors can pick the type of share which fits their requirements exactly. If, for example, you need income, and are not worried about capital growth, you can buy income shares that will pay you a fixed amount each year, and return your capital along the way or at the end. Or, if you are working and do not need income from your investment, but are looking for steady capital growth, zeros could be just the thing. The wind-up date for split capital trusts is fixed from the outset. As people know both the redemption price of zero-dividend shares and the price today, they can easily calculate the annualised gross redemption yield - the final profit in terms of growth each year. The different winding-up dates can be useful. For example, for school-fees planning: you could buy a series of zeros from trusts with wind-up dates one year apart, so that a lump of capital arrives at the beginning of each school year. Split-capital shares are generally only for those who are very sure of what they are doing, or who have taken expert advice. This is illustrated by horror stories of misguided people reinvesting dividends in high-yielding income shares with a minimal redemption value - they are a shrinking asset, so reinvesting dividends is like throwing money into a black hole. If you are in any doubt, consult an independent financial adviser or stockbroker. Any type of split-capital share can be held in a Pep, so that income and capital growth are free of tax. For many people, it is only worth putting income-generating shares into a Pep, as only a minority use up their Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains allowance, whereas most people pay income tax. You could probably hold quite a large number of zero-dividend preference shares or capital shares for several years without paying any tax on the proceeds. However, the longer you hold such shares, the greater the gains should be, and so the more worthwhile a Pep becomes. If, for example, you are using a Pep as part of your long-term retirement planning, zeros or capital shares could be useful. There are few packaged split-capital Peps on the market, and tying yourself to one investment management group's Pep will limit your choice of shares. A more usual approach is to take out a self-select Pep, and pick the holdings yourself, or get your adviser or stockbroker to do the work. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, recommends the Killik self-select Pep as a shelter for split-capital shares, because of its low cost - it has no initial or annual charges, just a 1.65 per cent dealing charge, minimum Pounds 40, and a Pounds 7.50 fee for each dividend collected. The choice of shares depends on the state of the market when you buy. 'There is a limited number of income shares that will not show a substantial loss by redemption,' Boyton says. Of those few, he recommends at the moment River Plate and Scottish National, which are yielding 10.2 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. They both have a modest negative 'hurdle rate' to redemption. The hurdle rate is the rate at which the fund's assets need to grow for the shares to be repaid at the promised level. A negative hurdle rate means that the fund can shrink from its present level and still meet the repayment. Whitechurch Securities, the Bristol-based financial adviser, is offering an Aggressive Growth Pep, which invests in capital shares. Capital shares are highly geared, doing extremely well when the market is on the up, but feeling the bad times more severely than other types of share when the market falls. If the market crashes the week before they mature, all the gains built up could be wiped out. Whitechurch is aiming to minimise the risk by selling shares before the wind-up date, and reinvesting the proceeds in other shares with a more distant wind-up date. Kean Seager, managing director of Whitechurch, says the Pep is intended as a long-term investment, and is not for the faint-hearted. Charges on the Whitechurch Pep are rather high, at 6 per cent initially, 2.25 per cent annually, and Pounds 10 for dealing. Seager says this is because each Pep is managed individually, and investment strategy can be altered to suit individual investors if their needs change.</p>

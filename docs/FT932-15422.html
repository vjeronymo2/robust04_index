			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Oil storage tank for BP A joint venture between COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING and TAYLOR WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded a Pounds 50m contract for the design, construction and installation of a gravity oil storage tank for BP Exploration's Forth Field development. The 70,000 ton concrete tank will be built in a dry dock at Hunterston before being floated out and installed on the seabed in the North Sea, 220 miles north-east of Aberdeen. The T-shaped tank for BP is designed to fulfil three functions. It will act as a storage tank for the Forth Field, capable of holding 500,000 barrels of crude oil, it will form the base for a heavy-duty tripod jack-up production platform and its topside facilities, and it will also serve as a drilling template through which 24 wells can be drilled from the platform into the oil reservoir. Construction will start in the Autumn, with completion followed by tow-out and installation scheduled for June 1995. The gravity base tank will measure 115 metres by 120 metres, comprising 80 roofed interconnecting slip-formed cells 19 metres in height. The jack-up will be founded on three circular slip-formed towers, each 19 metres in diameter and 13 metres in height, constructed on the cellular base. Buoyancy tanks for the float-out from the dry dock will later be used as ballast boxes prior to installation, to ensure stability even under the worst North Sea storm conditions. The contract includes all mechanical and electrical work required for the ballasting and oil management systems within the gravity base tank.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ROSA;  </P> <P> ACCUSED KILLER'S VISITOR ARRESTED  </P> <P> Barbara Pater got more than she bargained for when she went to the Sonoma  County Jail to visit accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido over the weekend.  Pater, 28, who visits Salcido regularly, ended up as an inmate when she was  arrested on a warrant issued for a misdemeanor hit-and-run offense. Sheriff's  Sgt. Norman Hardin said Pater was booked after the warrant was served in the  lobby of the jail in Santa Rosa. She was later released on $1,000 bail. Pater,  who has said she wants to marry Salcido, has a record of fraud convictions and  was involved in a minor traffic accident in mid-August when she was driving the  1979 sedan Salcido used in his alleged April 14 murder rampage. Salcido is  accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law, her two  daughters and a co-worker.  </P></p>

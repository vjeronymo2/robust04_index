			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> NEW PARKINSON'S DRUG HAILED  </P> <P> Researchers said today that a new drug dramatically slows the progression of  Parkinson's disease and should be used in all patients with early stages of the  debilitating nerve illness.  </P> <P> Based on preliminary results of a large-scale study, the researchers said the  drug deprenyl delays the onset of advanced symptoms of Parkinson's by at least  one year and is remarkably safe.  </P> <P> Parkinson's is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that mostly strikes  people over 40. About 500,000 Americans suffer from it.  </P> <P> "I strongly recommend that all patients with early Parkinson's be considered  for this therapy," said Ira Shulson, a neurologist at the University of  Rochester in Rochester, N.Y., and the study's principal investigator.  </P></p>

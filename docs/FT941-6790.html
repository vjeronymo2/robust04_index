			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: AGF warns of lower earnings Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of the largest French insurance groups, has warned that 1993 net profits were lower than in 1992 because of the problems at some of its French and Spanish interests. AGF, scheduled for sale as part of the Balladur government's privatisation drive, was badly affected last year by the difficulties of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the troubled French finance company, and La Union y El Fenix, the loss-making Spanish insurer. The group took a leading role in the rescue of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs and last week said that after protracted negotiations with the Bank of Spain it was taking majority control of El Fenix by buying a stake from Banesto, the beleaguered Spanish bank. The cost of the rescue operations hit AGF's performance last year. The company, which had previously announced static net interim profits of FFr1.41bn (Dollars 243m) for the first half of 1993, says profits for the full year will be lower than in 1992, when it made net profits of FFr1.5bn on consolidated sales of FFr59bn. AGF, like other French insurers, has been hurt by the recession. However, the company, which in 1992 secured an important foothold in the German insurance market through a significant minority shareholding in the AMB group, was until last year's difficulties regarded as one of the more resilient members of the French insurance industry.</p>

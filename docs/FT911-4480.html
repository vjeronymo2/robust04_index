			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Technology: Chip with a flash of inspiration - The semiconductor that could replace both hard and floppy discs Surfers search for the perfect wave, fishermen live for the big one that doesn't get away, and semiconductor makers dream of a non-volatile, sector-eraseable chip with limitless write cycles. A chip, in other words, which could replace both hard and floppy discs. The chip will have to perform the same functions as discs do. It will have to be non-volatile, or capable of retaining information when the power is switched off. It will have to be capable of performing large numbers of write cycles, or store new information frequently without wearing out. It will also have to be sector-eraseable, so that some of the information on it can be deleted while the rest is retained. Above all, it will have to be cheap. A chip called the 'flash E-Prom' meets some of these requirements and its champions believe it will eventually satisfy all of them. Supporters of the chip say that because it is small, physically durable and uses little power it is ideal for portable computers. Peter Norman, UK managing director of Psion, the British-based computer maker, believes that flash E-Prom is 'the technology of the 1990s'. E-Prom stands for eraseable programmable read-only memory. E-Prom chips retain memory when the power is switched off, unlike dynamic random access memories (D-Rams) and static random access memories (S-Rams). The problem with standard E-Proms is that they are difficult to erase and re-program. To delete the information on them, the chips have to be exposed to ultra-violet light for 20 minutes or more. There are E-Proms which can be erased electrically. These are called electrically eraseable programmable read only memories, or EE-Proms, but their drawback is that the erasure process takes about two minutes. Flash E-Proms, by contrast, can be erased by a flash of electricity that takes less than a second. Because the chips do not have any moving parts they are also less likely to fail than discs. Norman, whose company uses flash chips in its portable and hand-held computers, says that computer discs are an anomaly which will eventually disappear. 'There's something bizarre about these wonderful digital computers with this rather horrid mechanical device for data storage,' he says. Byron Harding of Dataquest, a high technology consultancy, says that makers of flash E-Proms will have to overcome several problems before the chips can be considered a replacement for discs. The first, he says, is that there is a limit to the number of times the information on flash E-Proms can be erased and replaced with new data. When flash chips are re-programmed some electrons remain trapped within the memory cell. Eventually, this accumulation of electrons makes it impossible to re-program the chip. Harding likens the process to filling a bucket with wet cement and then emptying it. A residue of cement will remain each time this is done. Eventually the bucket will be full of hardened cement. Russell Clayton, a flash specialist with Intel of the US, the world's leading manufacturer of the chip, says that the re-programming problem has been exaggerated. Intel guarantees that its flash chips can be re-programmed at least 10,000 times. A typical Intel flash chip can be re-programmed 100,000 times, he says. If the chip was re-programmed 10 times a day it would last for nearly 30 years. Another drawback to flash E-Proms is that it is not possible to erase only part of the chip. All the data on the chip have to be deleted. On discs, it is possible to delete some information while retaining the rest. Clayton says there are no technical reasons why flash chips cannot be made partially eraseable. EE-Proms are already partially eraseable. The problem, he says, is one of cost. A 1 Mbit EE-Prom costs five or six times as much as the equivalent flash E-Prom. Although flash chips cost less than EE-Proms, many in the industry believe that they are still not cheap enough to replace discs. It is the cost of flash chips rather than any technical problems which could ensure that discs remain the preferred method of data storage in computers and other electronic devices. A hard disc in a small portable computer might have 20 Mbytes of memory. A typical flash chip will have 1 Mbit of memory, or an eighth of a megabyte. Replacing the hard disc with an equal amount of memory would require 160 flash chips at about Dollars 12 (Pounds 7) each, producing a total cost of Dollars 1,920. The equivalent hard disc would less than a tenth of that, Harding says. Psion's Norman, however, believes that high cost will not stop flash from taking off. As the volume of manufacture increases, the price of the chips will fall. The price of discs might fall too, but the greater reliability, portability and lower power consumption of flash E-Proms will give them the edge. The growth of the portable and hand-held computer market will aid that process, he says.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> HURRICANE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL STORM  </P> <P> Hurricane Nana lost its punch, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center  in Miami expected it to slowly continue losing strength as it remained nearly  stationary in the Caribbean. Nana, which is now designated as a tropical storm,  had top winds of 70 m.p.h., but it still posed a threat to Bermuda. Nana, the  eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, moved north-northeast at  nearly 5 m.p.h. and was expected to turn toward the northeast today.  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Yeltsin stands firm as new demand made for Russian government to go MR RUSLAN KHASBULATOV, the increasingly powerful chairman of the Russian parliament, was yesterday unrepentant about his demands for the resignation of the Russian government despite a withering riposte from Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. Mr Yeltsin, speaking before flying to the city of Bryansk to face more consumers angered by price rises, declared: 'You cannot throw away governments like old socks. . . It is easier to pass laws than to implement them.' Responding to Mr Khasbulatov's call on Monday for him to distance himself from the government, Mr Yeltsin said curtly: 'Any leader can have an emotional outburst.' But Mr Khasbulatov, who is the main spokesman for parliament's anxiety over the huge price rises, was categoric: 'My remarks yesterday were not merely improvised. I was careful in what I said. I hear everyone calling for a change in the present economic reform process: many deputies, including democrats, and non-democrats, specialists, heads of plants and enterprises both state-owned and not state-owned. We are fed up with experiments: we have had enough of them.' Mr Khasbulatov, speaking in his high-ceiling chamber in the Russian 'White House', told the FT he was prepared to use parliamentary authority to hobble Mr Yeltsin, who was voted sweeping powers last year to push through his emergency programme. Though insisting he was a close supporter and adviser of the president, Mr Khasbulatov said he was determined that parliament should be equal to the presidency, even if that meant the removal of the present government headed by Mr Yeltsin. His main target - though not by name  - is Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform. Mr Gaidar, and his team of foreign advisers - who include Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard and Professor Richard Layard of London School of Economics - are now under unremitting fire from within the Russian power structure. Their attackers include Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian Central Bank, who in a separate interview yesterday said they were 'all saying different things at different times.' Of his own recent trip to the provincial city of Ryazan, Mr Khasbulatov said: 'It was terrible, but I was not surprised. The realities confirmed my gloomiest expectations. People are really worried: they are still silent yet, but it is the silence before the storm. 'The government has left completely on the side all the problems of privatisation. Ninety per cent of our economy is state owned. Price rises will change nothing if the process of privatising and selling-off of state property is not set in motion.' He again called for Mr Yeltsin to resign as head of the cabinet of ministers. 'We must protect the institution of the presidency. I said it at the beginning, and I say it again now: it was a great mistake for Yeltsin to head the government. We (the parliament) made a big mistake by accepting that we should contradict the constitution, and when we granted (last October) the right to the president to nominate the government. Now we are going to change that law so that the government and its structure must be discussed and approved by parliament.' Mr Khasbulatov added that he was 'not in the least worried that a change of government would have an adverse reaction on world opinion. Italy has had 40 governments in 40 years, and nothing bad has happened there. 'There are in fact only two stabilising factors in the country - the President and the parliament. And we should very carefully guard the institute of the presidency so that he does not get involved in these government matters.</p>

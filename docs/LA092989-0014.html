			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY WINS ON LAST PLAY  </P> <P> Watching his team score nine points in the final 17 seconds left Kennedy High  Coach Bob Francola in an understandably effusive mood. About the only comment  Francola could manage was a slightly rhetorical question.  </P> <P> "Was that worth the price of admission or what?" he shouted.  </P> <P> Kicker Jason Rosen nailed a 35-yard field goal with no time left to give  Kennedy a 39-36 win over Crenshaw in a nonconference game Thursday night at  Kennedy High.  </P> <P> Trailing, 36-30, Kennedy (1-2) took possession with 4:08 to play. Sparked by  tailback Ontiwaun Carter -- who gained 267 yards in 40 carries and scored four  touchdowns -- the Golden Cougars drove to the Crenshaw 25-yard line.  </P> <P> With 17 seconds left, Kennedy quarterback Tony Vazquez lobbed a touchdown pass  to Rosen, who beat a pair of Crenshaw defenders on the play. Rosen had lined up  on the wrong side of the field prior to the snap and was waved over to the  right side of the formation by Vazquez.  </P> <P> Rosen's extra-point attempt, however, was blocked. Francola elected to try an  onside kick on the ensuing kickoff rather than squib the ball downfield.  </P> <P> "Hell, yes, we used the onside kick," Francola said. "We played to win, not  tie, this game."  </P> <P> Frank Conley recovered Rosen's onside kick at the Crenshaw 48. Crenshaw Coach  Robert Garrett was flagged for two consecutive unsportsmanlike conduct  penalties, which moved the ball to the Crenshaw 18 and set the stage for  Rosen's kick. Garrett argued that Crenshaw had recovered the onside kick and  that Conley had taken it away after the whistle blew.  </P> <P> Carter and Kennedy were nearly upstaged by Crenshaw running back Kevin Hicks,  who gained 229 yards in 22 carries and scored on runs of 47 and three yards.  </P> <P> And it was Hicks' lone mistake of the game that almost won it for Crenshaw  (2-1). On a first-and-10 play at the Crenshaw 49, Hicks fumbled, but the ball  was picked up on the dead run by fullback Charles Brown, who raced 51 yards  down the right sideline to give Crenshaw a 36-30 lead with 4:11 left.  Quarterback Derrick Williams fumbled the snap on Crenshaw's two-point  conversion attempt.  </P> <P> Crenshaw led, 30-22, at the end of the third quarter, but Kennedy tied the  score with 11:16 to play on a nine-yard run up the middle by Carter and a  two-point conversion run by Carter.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, Carter looked like he was going to single-handedly put  the game out of reach. The junior tailback gained 102 yards in 14 carries and  scored on runs of nine and 14 yards.  </P> <P> A power outage in the second quarter might have cost Carter the school  single-game rushing record of 279 yards, held by Edwin Jones. Carter scored on  a 22-yard run with 9:23 left in the first half, but the field lights went out  after Carter broke through the line. The run was disallowed.  </P></p>

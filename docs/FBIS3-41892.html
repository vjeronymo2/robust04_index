			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin ``Reportage for This Issue'': ```First </F> Aid' for Missiles''--first three paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Hundreds of ballistic missiles ``held'' by the  Strategic Missile Forces are on alert duty in Russia. Russian  missilemen also have a headache over the launchers stationed in  Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. They have plenty of trouble  with this whole ``nuclear missile business.''    Missiles, which are packed full of electronics and fuel and  have nuclear warheads, require constant surveillance and care,  particularly in the event of the aging and the malfunctions  which are making themselves felt increasingly clearly today,  given the meager funding, depleted spare parts, tools, and  accessories kits, the destroyed collaboration within the former  Union, the customs obstacles....    In these conditions specialists locally and at the  operational-technical control center of the Strategic Missile  Forces, which our correspondent visited, are operating a ``first  aid'' system.    Operational-technical control centers appeared in the  Strategic Missile Forces High Command and in missile large  strategic formations and combined units several years ago. They  proved their viability in auspicious times, and in the present  times -- with universal shortages -- they have proved simply  essential.    ``Such a center in the Strategic Missile Forces High  Command,'' Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander  in chief, believes, ``is the eyes and ears of the forces'  leadership. Here measures are taken to rectify the simplest  fault in missile hardware and, if necessary, major technical  decisions are worked out.''    The center itself is housed in small, well-equipped  premises.  Nothing here is superfluous. Showing me round his facility, Lt.  Colonel Mikhail Poludnitsyn, the center's chief, drew attention  to the alert-duty personnel's posts and the collective  electronic panel. The latter highlights information on the  faults which have arisen, down to each individual launcher,  gives their characteristics, and shows the time of reinstatement  of ``indisposed'' missiles and protection systems. All this is  conveyed via a computer link to the display units of chiefs of  directorates and services.    The alert-duty personnel are headed by Col. Yuriy Surnin,  who  is assisted by two Alekseys -- Captain Kotlyarevskiy and Senior  Lt. Klychnikov. Col. Vladimir Bezgreshnov, preparing to take  Surnin's place, unhurriedly bones up on the situation.  Engineers are on duty round the clock, being operationally  subordinate to the Strategic Missile Forces Central Command Post.    I asked Surnin to assess the condition of the missile  armament and hardware over the past 24 hours.    ``Twenty launchers (more than half of them outside Russia)  required prompt [operativnyy] intervention,'' he said. ``On  one, for example, an instrument has failed.'' On this score he  reported: Measures have been taken, and the instrument is being  delivered to the launcher by courier from a store in one of the  divisions. The alert-duty personnel knew the train's number and  were monitoring the officer's time of arrival in the unit and  the hardware's readiness to receive him.    ``We strive for stability, operational efficiency, secrecy,  and continuity in the center's activity,'' Lt. Col. Poludnitsyn  emphasized.    This is achieved not only by constant alert duty but also by  means of the planning meetings conducted on a daily basis by Lt.  Gen. Anatoliy Perminov, chief of the Main Directorate for the  Operation of Missile Armament, and on Saturdays by Lt. Gen.  Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, directly at the  operational-technical control center    Invited to the meetings are leading specialists of main  directorates and officers of the state technical supervision,  communications, the motor vehicle service.... Such  representation has entirely justified itself. This staff of  professionals resolves all problems. It is only when these fall  outside the competence of the deputy commander in chief that  direct application is made to the commander in chief of the  Strategic Missile Forces himself.    The Saturday conference at the center was held in a calm  working regime, but you could sense the anxiety and inner  tension of the people gathered there. There are quite a few  problems in Russia, so it turned out, and things are still more  difficult in the event of equipment malfunctions in Ukraine.  There are more malfunctions in just two missile divisions there  than in all the Missile Forces. Technical decisions on them  have been worked out in good time, and the Ukrainian side has  not rejected them; but it cannot implement them. There are not  the material and financial means or even the fuel to enable the  routine inspection and maintenance crews to travel to the  launchers.    Problems also arise in the divisions in Kazakhstan. For  example, instruments intended for the automated systems for the  protection of nuclear weapons are not allowed through customs.  Whether they like it or not, the ``technical personnel'' are  also required to be diplomats and prepare requests to the Main  Customs Administration.    On visiting the operational-technical control center I saw  for myself that an unwritten law exists among the missilemen:  Don't leave a missile until a malfunction has been rectified.  Those on duty in the control center and those who work with a  wrench directly in a combat position really are like ``first  aid'' for nuclear missile weapons.</p>

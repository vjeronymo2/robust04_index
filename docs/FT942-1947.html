			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Argentina cruise to first victory Gabriel Batistuta scored a hat-trick and Diego Maradona got another as Argentina thrashed Greece 4-0 in their opening Group D game in Boston last night. Greece had a disastrous start to their first-ever World Cup finals match going a goal behind after some slack marking in the second minute. Maradona's goal on the hour recaptured his great days of 1986, when he led Argentina to its last title. In the final minute, Greek defender Stratos Apostolakis handled just inside the penalty area and Batistuta hit his third goal from the spot kick.</p>

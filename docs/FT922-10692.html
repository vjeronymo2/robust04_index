			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Berliners air pros and cons BERLINERS were yesterday divided about the public sector dispute as post and telephone services became the latest target of the strikers in Germany's largest city. Mr Peter Heyer said business in the furnishings shop where he worked could be seriously affected if mail deliveries were halted for long. But, 'as an ordinary citizen I agree with the strikers. We in the west are not being told the truth by our politicians about the costs we still face in financing unification'. Greengrocer Horst Nordmann said the strikes were 'perfectly legitimate' as the government had rejected the pay claim. Mr Werner Ascher, a lecturer at Berlin's Technical University, disagreed. 'Public service employees could have set an example for others by dispensing with wage rises this time in order to help east Germany recover.' Mr Jan Trautmann, a student at the university, was highly critical of the strikers. Their actions were 'very irresponsible' as the wage claims were far beyond what the economy could absorb. Most west Berliners said they were only marginally affected by the selective strike by Bundespost and Telekom workers. Civil servants took over the work at the main postal distribution centre and three Telekom repair units. A one-day strike which halted all public transport in west Berlin earlier in the week was overcome by commuters switching to cars and cycles. The strikes thus far failed to impress the Italian waiters at the Amico restaurant in Charlottenburg district. They commented that, like almost everything else in Germany, the strikes, planned long in advance and carried out to the letter, were predictably dull.</p>

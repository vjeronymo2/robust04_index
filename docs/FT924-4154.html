			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading PROFIT-TAKING saw Footsie futures surrender most of the gains acquired over the last four sessions as turnover fell back to more modest levels, Joel Kibazo. The opening trade in the December futures contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,792. The contract then traded in a narrow range of 2,790 and 2,799 for the next few hours occasionally breaching the 2,800 level, though trading volumes were very light. The fall in gilt prices following the gilt auction, along with early falls on Wall Street took their toll in mid-afternoon and the contract retreated sharply, falling to a day's low of 2,773 and pulling the underlying cash market lower. December finished at 2,777, a decline of 30 on the previous session and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover was just under 6,000 contracts. Volumes in traded options continued to decline and reached a meagre 22,310 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was a poor 6,058 contracts. Rolls-Royce was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of 2,642 lots, with the March 160 calls and the December 100 puts equally busy. This was followed by HSBC, in which 1,402 contracts were traded. NatWest Stockbrokers announced it had pulled out of the traded options market after a strategic review.</p>

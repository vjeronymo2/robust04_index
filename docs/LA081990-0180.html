			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: AMERICAN JOURNALS BY ALBERT CAMUS TRANSLATED BY HUGH LEVICK  (PARAGON HOUSE: $9.95)  </P> <P> The notebooks that Albert Camus kept on his lecture tours of the United States  in 1946 and South America in 1949 contain some fascinating impressions from one  of the most significant novelists of the postwar era.  </P> <P> Camus saw America as a country where "everything is done to prove that life  isn't tragic," where people are generous and hospitable "without affection" and  where "everyone looks like they've stepped out of a B-film." His descriptions  of the miasmal heat and the juxtaposition of luxury and squalor in Brazil would  be integrated into his later works, especially "The Plague." Hugh Levick's  translations capture the author's spare, incisive style.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Management: Visionary with a wooden raincoat - Lucy Kellaway meets Stuart Lipton at the village pump / My Office If you visit the fifth floor of Landsdowne House in London's Berkeley Square you are in for a very special experience. The headquarters of Stanhope Properties is more than just another lavish office, fitted out in those far off days three years ago when money was no object. Contrary to appearances, it is not an office at all. It is a village. Stuart Lipton, the head of the company and visionary of London's property market, explains that the corridor stretching from the reception area is actually a street. The place where you sit on stylish leather chairs, surveying the design magazines on the minimalist glass table, is no simple waiting area. 'Our reception represents the heart of our little village. It is a soft place where visitors could talk to each other', he says. The significance of every last detail has been thought out. What might seem a fussy mixture of glass, tiles, steel, light wood, dark wood, stone and plaster is yet another concept: of building itself, with all main materials represented. To those who think of their places of work in terms of desks, chairs and secretaries, Lipton's chatter about warm feelings of offices may be difficult to understand. Yet Lipton thinks he 'helps people to demistify buildings'. He has done that with many acclaimed new developments, including Broadgate in the City of London. His battle cry is about good design, about the need 'to produce a building with a friendly disposition. The culture of the building should be such that people want to brush against each other'. In Stanhope's offices - almost empty on the afternoon I was there - this can either be done in the 'street' or in the post room, which Lipton describes as a 'very social area in which there are no formalities'. The room, in which a couple of secretaries were chatting, also contains the coffee 'station', which he says is 'like the village centre'. Unlike most villages, the Stanhope offices are crammed with works of art. Lipton makes much of this: he is on the board of the Royal Academy, is a trustee of various modern art galleries and was involved in building the Sainsbury wing of the National Gallery. 'Life is about art and architecture,' he says. The most striking piece in his own office (or 'private realm' as he calls it) is a life-size raincoat and umbrella carved out of wood, hanging on one wall. 'Ninety per cent of the people who come in here go for the timber. It's because it's meaningful. We all like soft issues.' A large Miro print hangs above his desk, and on the wall next door is a brown modern canvas, the details of which he has forgotten. Everyone in the company has a piece of art or objet in their offices, which they have selected from a collection chosen by Lipton. 'I don't think art is a democratic business', he says. 'It should be searching and demanding.' Thus Lipton has chosen a large collection of abstract canvases, carpets to be hung on the wall, wooden bowls, and small model snooker tables. The art, he says, is an antidote for the computer screen. Lipton is such a believer in the computer that he has dispensed with paper in his office. There is no clutter among his objets; his stylish glass in-tray is almost empty. His oval conference table has nothing on its grey marble surface save an ethnic copper bowl. The more comfortable area with swish leather chairs and sofas is equally bare of paper, save a few design periodicals. On every surface in the room is a telephone. This is another detail designed to make the visitor comfortable: 'A lot of visitors get calls here, and they don't want the formality of talking at a chap's desk.' On the whole, Lipton is pleased with the general effect of the Stanhope offices, although he is a little sheepish about the size of his own (the 300 sq ft, he estimates, is on the conservative side). Indeed, both the space and the heady rent paid strike an odd note with Lipton's emphasis on squeezing full value out of every square foot. 'The office is a bit dated,' he admits, surveying the stark modernity. 'If I was doing it again the room would be smaller, the meeting area would be in a different room, it would be more open plan.' Indeed, on his view of the future, he would be lucky to have an office at all. His new concept is that of an hotel, full of facilities and with employees checking in and out. Each worker would have an electronic card, which as they enter the building would assign to them a desk and a telephone number. At Stanhope, they would doubtless also be allocated for the day their own timber sculpture.</p>

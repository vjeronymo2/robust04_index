			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Adas is given tougher targets Adas, the government-owned farm advisory and research service which has been earmarked for privatisation, is to be given a sharper customer focus and tougher financial targets, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, announced yesterday. The service's cost-recovery target for 1994-95 is being raised from 55 per cent to 63 per cent, with the rest covered by the government. The service will consolidate its 15 consultancy centres into seven units to meet this target. The move will involve closing 18 local offices and will cut costs by 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li </F> Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "During His Southern Tour, Yang  Shangkun Witnesses Signs of Crisis"]    [Text] Is the vast land of China full of vigor?    In CPC organs, the answer is "yes." It is hard to find such  an opinion: A crisis is hidden behind the vitality. It is even  difficult to hear the authorities admit that vitality with  hidden crises is not healthy vigor.    Recently, a CPC document sounded the alarm bells and  analyzed  in detail the crisis the CPC is facing. Not just one, but three  crises exist.    It was an investigation report, and the report was written  by  former PRC president Yang Shangkun. The 23,000-character report  was submitted personally by Yang Shangkun to the Political  Bureau.    Between mid-January and mid-February of this year, Yang  Shangkun inspected six cities in Guangdong, namely, Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shunde. In mid-March,  he further inspected six cities in Guangdong, Hainan, and  Fujian, namely, Zhanjian, Maoming, Haikou, Sanya, Xiamen, and  Quanzhou. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee  issued a notice to the party committees in the three provinces,  stating that Comrade Yang Shangkun was going to make inspections  and investigations in a number of cities at the request of the  CPC Central Political Bureau. In early April, Yang Shangkun  submitted an investigation report in his own name to the  Political Bureau. The CPC Central Secretariat added a note to  the report, which said: "After more than one month of  inspections and investigations, Comrade Yang Shangkun has summed  up a report which points to the existence of major problems in  our work. Leading cadres at all levels should give deep thought  to the seriousness and harmfulness of the problems." The  report, entitled "Party Building, Political and Ideological  Education, and Social Morals Are All Facing Crisis," was issued  to party and government leading bodies at the provincial and  ministry level on 11 April.    The investigation report was divided into three main parts.    The first part was about party building and the quality of  party membership.    The report pointed out: In the last seven to eight years,  party building has always been the weak link. Party  rectification is often superficial and ineffective, and at most  just solves or temporarily solves some partial problems. The  fundamental problem in party building has been obscured. Party  building directly concerns the party's destiny, the relationship  between the party and the people, and the party's mobilizing  force and leading authority. At present, party cadres, including  the party's senior leading cadres, have no interest or courage  to handle party building, saying that it is not easy to achieve  marked results in party building and that they do not know what  to do in this regard for fear that this may be regarded as  backtracking toward old practices. The hesitancy of leading  cadres and their perplexity about such a matter of primary  importance has become an urgent problem we are facing right now.  The situation of party building will directly affect the  healthy development of economic construction, reform, and  opening. The success or failure of the ruling party in its own  party building will eventually determine the future of the  country.    Yang Shangkun told the truth on this matter. At present, the  Communist Party is corrupt and is rotten from top to bottom and  inside out. To exaggerate slightly, the CPC has become a sheet  of loose sand. In such circumstances, how can it effectively  conduct party building? Party rectification has not achieved  any major results, neither will the anticorruption campaign.  Yang Shangkun's report did not mention or dared not mention  this, but it is thought that he is also aware of this.    The second part was about political-ideological education  and  propaganda work.    The report pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee correctly summed up and negated  previous "leftist" practice in political-ideological education  and in propaganda and pointed out that this was unsuited to  national conditions and the development of the times. However,  after that, a set of integrated guidelines for  political-ideological education and propaganda suited to  national conditions and the socialist system was lacking. This  led to serious mistakes in work. Undoubtedly, in this regard,  as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out several years ago, both of our  hands should be tough, and we cannot only keep one hand tough  and leave the other hand soft and weak. However, we did not  handle this issue personally, and it has become a major  difficulty. In recent years, leading bodies have been  encouraged to pay attention to this issue, and the central  leading body took the lead in doing so. However, due to  obstructions in the people's minds and the influence of new  social conditions on people's thinking, party workers have  failed to conduct effective political-ideological education and  have not given vigorous publicity to socialist ideology and  communist ideals. It seems that socialist ideology, communist  ideals, and the party's objectives have all become outdated and  are no longer suited to the present days of reform and opening,  and the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief  in socialism and communism. This is an extremely dangerous  tendency and signal at the moment.    In this part of the report, Yang Shangkun also reflected  the true situation. The CPC's so-called political-ideological  education and propaganda work are dying away indeed and "lack  vitality." Who should be blamed for this? Mao Zedong once  said: "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-  Leninism." Now, history and reality both show that  Marxism-Leninism, especially Leninism, is seriously  antiscientific, and the theoretical basis of the Communist Party  has collapsed. The ideology and beliefs of Communist Party  members have collapsed. What can be used to conduct  political-ideological education? Who is still willing to listen  to sermons about Marxism-Leninism or to chant the scriptures of  socialism and communism? An informed theorist said: "Yang  Shangkun told the truth. Political-ideological education and  propaganda work is indeed completely lifeless. He was right in  saying that `it seems that socialist ideology, communist ideals,  and the party's objectives have all become outdated and are no  longer suited to the present days of reform and opening, and  that the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief  in socialism and communism,' but the words `it seems that' are  not used properly and should be replaced with `it is because.'"    The third part concerns social morals and public conduct.    The report said: Social morals are becoming rapidly  corrupted, and this has aroused serious attention and concern  among people in all social strata. Upright people in society  are calling for civilization and morality in view of the  increasing degeneration of public conduct, but this is not  forming a strong force of opinion. Problems are obviously  occurring inside the party and the government, and are reflected  in the behavior of party cadres and party members. The party's  revelation of and struggle against lawbreaking and disciplinary  violations, and criticism and condemnation of corrupt and  decadent conduct in society has not been noticed or supported by  public opinion and propaganda organs. This cannot but be  regarded as unusual and abnormal in people's China under the  leadership of the 53-million-member Communist Party. Along with  the development of human society and civilization, social morals  and public conduct should make corresponding progress and should  be enhanced. Violence, corruption, decadence, and amoral  cultural tendencies that have engendered and developed in  Western capitalist societies have aroused the serious attention  of their governments. The present worsening public conduct and  public order should arouse our party and government's serious  attention and consideration. However, up to now, problems which  could ruin human civilization, social construction, and Chinese  culture and morality, and which could affect the growth of  future generations, have not yet aroused sufficient vigilance  among the people.    This part of the report also told the truth. Social morals  and public conduct in mainland China are indeed becoming worse  now to a much more serious degree compared with Western  capitalist societies. The informed scholar said: "Yang Shangkun  was not wrong to complain that the party and the government are  not paying sufficient attention to social and moral crises.  However, if the current system and structure is not changed,  the CPC will not be able to head off these crises. Yang  Shangkun called for `vigilance' against the crises, but what  should be done after `vigilance' has been aroused?"    In facing these crises, the former state president did not  know what to do, and the current CPC leadership are also at a  loss about what to do. Even the chief architect does not know  what to do.    The appearance of these crises has profound causes. A  student of CPC history pointed out that, at present, the general  public, as well as the CPC rank and file, have strong doubts  about socialism and even hold a negative attitude. People  generally hold that the experiments with socialism has failed,  and the CPC and China should find another course, move out of  the utopian realm, and comply with the trend of the times by  thoroughly changing the system and structure. However, the big  shots in Zhongnanhai, especially the hardheaded old guard, are  still grasping power tightly and are unwilling to make even one  little move ahead in political reform. Thus, it is no wonder  that the CPC is deeply mired in a crisis-laden predicament.</p>

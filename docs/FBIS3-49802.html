			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Bosnia-Herzegovina's Foreign Minister  Irfan Ljubljankic, was the guest at a meeting today of the  Council of the Congress of Bosniak-Muslim Intellectuals. He  spoke about the position and stances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  delegation ahead of the next round of Geneva talks. [Name  indistinct] has the report.    [Correspondent] At today's discussion of peace talks at the  Council of the Congress of Bosniak-Muslim Intellectuals,  Minister Ljubljankic spoke, among other things, about elements  of our position before the next round of Geneva talks, which was  defined in the past few days.    [Ljubljankic] "As you know, in Bonn we discussed the  Croatian  state's offer that is -- from the legal and political point of  view -- useless. Starting from its heading: A contractual  agreement, and so on via the preamble and the articles  explaining the agreement -- we reached the conclusion that I  have just said: The document is useless.    The document basically contains an offer for a confederation  between Croatia -- enlarged by so-called Herceg-Bosna -- and  some future Bosniak-Muslim republic as it is defined in the  document."    [Correspondent] What forced the Croatian leadership to take  this step? Minister Ljubljankic believes that it was Croatia's  stained reputation on the international scene, as well as the  sharp criticism of Tudjman's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  voiced in Croatia itself.    What will be our reply? The working group, set up at the  prime minister's request and which included Minister  Ljubljankic, has prepared draft proposals, which were yesterday  discussed at the sessions of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency  and the government.    [Ljubljankic] "We will submit a new proposal to the Croatian  side on a confederal agreement between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Bosnia-Herzegovina meaning the territory  held by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- the Croatian side refers  to it as the Muslim army -- and Herceg-Bosna, because the  remaining territory will be considered as temporarily occupied.  This draft document will state that the power would be based on  the principle of parity between Croats and Muslims and that the  two state working groups or commissions will work on perfecting  and finding a final definition of this [word indistinct]."    [Correspondent] During his recent visit to Sarajevo, former  French President Giscard d'Estaing suggested to President  Izetbegovic to bypass Geneva in some way and bring in new  elements to the talks, Ljubljankic said and added:    [Ljubljankic] "We think that the time has come to do  something like this because Geneva, I have recently said it on  radio, has become a caricature. There is always something being  added, we have constantly been adding something to the  proposals. One side would be dissatisfied with something and it  would add an element; finally the whole project became a  caricature [words indistinct] I think that these things should  be changed and that the UN Security Council should take over.  Given the existing status quo it is better that the UN Security  Council supervises the situation in Bosnia than at the  Conference on Former Yugoslavia."    [Correspondent] The largest part of the public abroad  supports the official Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and so do  many former politicians whose opinion is still important in the  world. Active foreign politicians however, favor a division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the equation of guilt and so on. Minister  Ljubljankic will tell us why that is so.    [Ljubljankic] "I have only one answer: Because it is the  Muslims who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why are they afraid of  Bosnian Muslims (?when) the Bosnian Muslims are also Europeans?  They are surprised that if we have already accepted all the  benefits of European culture, and if we live according to the  European cultural pattern, we are still Muslims. (?Is this) a  way for Islam eventually to come to Europe as an idea, not only  as a form, as a shadow of something historical and traditional,  but also as an idea to take Europe, to encompass it, to fulfill  the emptiness of the European man with a new idea.    It is my deep conviction that this is the reason why they  are  afraid. What is the answer to this? We must find one together.  I believe that we should remain what we are and remain in  Europe."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) The date, place as defined in the permit, and time of sampling or measurements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The date(s) analyses were performed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The company or entity that performed the analyses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The analytical techniques or methods used;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The results of such analyses; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The operating conditions as existing at the time of sampling or measurement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the monitoring sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all reports required by the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The permit shall require the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Submittal of reports of all required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit requirements must be clearly identified in such reports; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Prompt reporting of any deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit. Such reports shall include the probable cause of such deviations and any corrective actions or preventive measures taken. The Administrator will define ``prompt'' in the permit for each situation and will do so in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any portions of the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Provisions stating the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of part 71 permit issued under this subpart. A violation of an alternative emission limitation, as well as any other requirement established in a permit issued under this subpart, is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act, notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire early reductions source. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action or for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The permit may be revised, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The permittee shall furnish to the Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information that the Administrator may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for revising the permit, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the Administrator copies of records required to be kept by the permitee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios identified by the early reductions source in its application as approved by the Administrator. Such terms and conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Shall require the early reductions source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the scenario under which it is operating. Provided that an emitting unit is monitored in a way that provides contemporaneous identification that a change to a particular alternate scenario has occurred, no notice to the Administrator is required. Otherwise, when such a change is made, the permittee at the beginning of the following week shall place in regular mail to the Administrator notice that a change to a particular alternate operating scenario has occurred; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each such alternative scenario meet the alternative emission limitation and the requirements of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of hazardous air pollutant emissions increases and decreases among emissions units within the early reductions source without permit revision or case-by-case approval of each emissions trade, provided that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Such terms and conditions include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The Administrator determines that the emissions are quantifiable and that replicable procedures or other practical means exist to enforce the emission trades; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The early reductions source owner or operator provides the Administrator written notification at least 7 days in advance of the proposed changes and includes in the notification a description of the change in emissions that will occur, when the change will occur, and how the increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the alternative emission limitation and other terms and conditions of the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federally enforceable requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All terms and conditions in a permit issued under this subpart are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All permits issued under this subpart shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Consistent with paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required to be submitted by a permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of &sect;71.24(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Inspection and entry provisions that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the Administrator or an authorized representative to perform the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where the early reductions source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where required records are kept;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of determining compliance with the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including the alternative emission limitation. Permits shall include each of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The frequency (not less than annually) of submissions of compliance certifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a means for monitoring the compliance of the early reductions source with its alternative emission limitation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The compliance status;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

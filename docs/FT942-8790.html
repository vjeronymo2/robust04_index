			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / GAO rings alarm bells over danger of derivatives The fragmented US regulatory structure is badly organised to deal with the fast-growing derivatives markets. The result: the markets have come to be dominated by several big dealers, some of which are completely unregulated. The failure of any one of these could bring the US - and, by extension, the world's - financial system to its knees. Those are the conclusions of the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigating arm, in its long-awaited report on derivatives published yesterday. Its warnings are the most apocalyptic yet to emanate from the string of official reports carried out in the US and elsewhere in the past two years into the derivatives markets. The GAO concludes: 'The immediate need is for Congress to bring the currently unregulated OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives activities of securities firms and insurance company affiliates under the purview of one or more of the existing federal financial regulators and to ensure that derivatives regulation is consistent and comprehensive across regulatory agencies.' The markets are concentrated in very few hands, says the report: just seven US banks accounted for 90 per cent of derivatives activity in the US at the end of 1992. These entities also dominate a large part of global trading activity. 'This combination of global involvement, concentration, and linkages means that sudden failure or abrupt withdrawal from trading of any of these large dealers could cause liquidity problems in the markets and could also pose risks to the others, including federally insured banks and the financial system as a whole.' The agency's main proposal is for legislation to bring the unregulated derivative trading units of securities houses and insurance companies into the regulatory net. At end 1992, these companies already accounted for 30 per cent of over-the-counter activity in the US (the rest was carried out by banks.) 'Congress (should) require federal regulation of the safety and soundness of all main US over-the-counter derivatives dealers,' it says. Either the Securities and Exchange Commission should be responsible for the unregulated dealers, with a new inter-agency group set up to establish common regulatory standards; or leadership in setting regulations for derivatives should be divided between different regulatory bodies, depending on their particular expertise. The report also calls for the urgent modernisation of the entire financial regulatory system in the US. 'The existing regulatory structure has not kept pace with the dramatic and rapid changes in the domestic and global financial markets' of recent years, it says. It does not offer solutions to this perceived problem, but it says: 'Many issues need to be debated and decided, including the appropriate uses of federally insured deposits and the extent to which they should be used to finance large-scale proprietary trading in derivatives or other financial instruments.' Financial regulators, meanwhile, should work together to make combined efforts more effective, the GAO says. This could be done by centralising information about firms they regulate, operating a consistent set of rules governing the capital which dealers are required to hold, and requiring dealers to have independent audit committees and adequate internal controls for their derivatives activities. It also calls for annual full-scale examinations of all dealers once a year. A second focus of regulatory attention should be the accounting and disclosure regime for derivatives, the GAO says. It calls for rules requiring both dealers and users of derivatives to publish more about their activities in this area, and a consistent accounting regime that can be applied to all types of instrument. Finally, the report calls for the SEC to extend derivatives regulation to many publicly-traded companies which use such instruments. 'SEC registrants that are major end-users of complex derivative products (should) establish and implement corporate requirements for independent, knowledgeable audit committees and public reporting on internal controls.' External auditors should also be required to report on the quality of risk-management systems for derivatives, it adds.

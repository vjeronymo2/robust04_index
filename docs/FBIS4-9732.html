			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 31  March.    According to a survey by the Center of Studies for Labor and  Agriculture Development, CEDLA, available savings -- in real  terms and not financial flow terms -- gradually declined from  10.8 percent of the GDP in 1985 to barely 1.5 percent in 1991.  According to the CEDLA survey, gross domestic savings totaled  15.1 percent in 1991, but after deducting foreign debt payments  and including donations from friendly countries, Bolivia's  available savings barely totaled 1.5 percent of the GDP. In  1991, the foreign debt's servicing was 4.8 percent of the GDP.  (La Paz HOY in Spanish 15 Mar 94 Economic Section p 20)    A consortium made up of the National Mortgage Bank, the  Bolivian-American Bank, and the Trading Bank, Inc., approved a  $12.5 million loan for YPFB, Bolivian Government Oil Deposits.  This loan will allow YPFB to pay its floating debt. The loan  establishes a 30-month repayment period and a six-month grace  period. As of September, YPFB will pay a preferential interest  rate of 11 percent yearly. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 15 Mar  94 Economic Section p 4)</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Silvio J. Mendiandua: "Visit by Carlos Salinas Will </F> Strengthen Cuban-Mexican Relations"]    [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (PL) -- Mexican Ambassador to Havana  Carlos Tello said here today Mexican President Carlos Salinas'  visit to Cuba will strengthen relations between the two  countries, and as a result, new forms of cooperation may emerge  and current programs of cooperation may be strengthened.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Mexican diplomat  said: Salinas is expected to arrive on 13 June and will stay on  the island for 24 hours, and his presence here will be further  evidence of the strength and solidity of our relations.    Tello, who began his mission in this capital this year,  affirmed: The talks between Salinas and Cuban President Fidel  Castro will produce new ideas and initiatives for promoting  bilateral exchanges.    The ambassador said the two leaders will discuss in general  political, economic, cultural, and commercial relations during  their dialogue as well as programs of scientific and  technological cooperation, all of which have been developing in  a firm and cooperative manner.    He said: No specific agreement is expected to result from  this encounter, because negotiations between the two countries  on issues of economic or commercial interest are so fluid and  dynamic that agreements may be signed at any moment, not  necessarily during a visit.    He recalled that in recent years Mexico's presidents had  visited the island during their respective administrations:  Luis Echeverria (1975); Jose Lopez Portillo (1980); Miguel de  la Madrid (1988); and now Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    To reciprocate, he said, Cuban President Fidel Castro had  visited Mexico on three occasions during the past five years.  These exchanges at the highest level are a direct and  straightforward way of manifesting the solidity of relations, he  said    Tello also mentioned the recent visit to Mexico of U.S.  Democratic Representative Robert Torricelli, who has meddled in  the domestic affairs of Cuba and Mexico and who was told during  his visit to Mexico of the independent nature of the foreign  policy of the country of the Aztecs and Mayas.    Torricelli is the author of the bill, which the U.S.  Congress  later approved, that establishes a tightening of the economic  blockade against the largest of the Antillean islands.    The Mexican ambassador said his country's foreign policy is  a  state, not a government, policy and one of its main permanent  principles is recognizing the people's right to  self-determination.    In another part of the interview, Tello revealed the Mexican  Government team that will organize Salinas' visit with Cuban  officials will arrive in Havana today.    Ambassador Ricardo Ampudia, director general of the Mexican  Foreign Secretariat Protocol Office, will head the Foreign  Policy Cabinet, which the Mexicans call these advisers, which  will include a group of individuals from various backgrounds  that will decide between today and 8 June the agenda of the  visit.    Salinas' visit on 13 June, the day before the beginning of  the meeting of the Ibero-American presidents, is a way of  manifesting solidarity with Cuba, Tello said.    Tello also revealed that during the summit, the chiefs of  state of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela will sign a free trade  agreement. Mexico has signed similar documents with Chile, Costa  Rica, Canada, and the United States, and it is negotiating  others with the Central American countries.</p>

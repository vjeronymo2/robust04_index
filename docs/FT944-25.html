			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: In search of the UK's curry capital - Nicholas Lander and Iqbal Wahhab enjoy drawing their own curry map of Britain The figures are impressive. According to Pat Chapman, founder of The Curry Club of Great Britain, there are 7,900 people for each Indian restaurant in the UK. This breaks down roughly as follows: in Bradford there are 2,000; Manchester 2,700; Birmingham 3,800; London 4,300 and Glasgow 5,319. But the figures alone do not reveal the breadth and regional differences in the spread of Indian cuisine which has been developing in Britain since 1945. To set this right - and to offer a spicy alternative to more traditional winter fare - Nicholas Lander and Iqbal Wahhab, editor of Tandoori magazine, set out to draw a curry map of Britain. EAST LONDON Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan before independence in 1971) has supplied the last main migrant community into Britain. There are 300,000 Bangladeshis in Britain, 30,000 of them in Tower Hamlets. They are mainly from the Sylhet region of north-east Bangladesh and, in the past 25 years, a large array of specialist grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have opened to serve them. Although Bangladeshis own and run the majority of this country's 'Indian' restaurants, the Bangladeshi diet is different, drawing heavily on fish and vegetables. The Shampan, 79 Brick Lane, E1, (071-375 0475) serves specialities such as Rhui, a carp-like freshwater fish which weighs an average of 10lb to 15lb and is firm and creamy-textured. At 132 Brick Lane (247-8210) there is The Aladin, replete with Formica tables and semi self-service, where you go to the glass counter and point to what you want. Here you can eat Bangladeshi vegetables such as potol, a smaller and more compact form of the courgette or lal sag, a leaf spinach that is beetroot red. Two doors away, Nazrul (247-2505) was made famous by Salman Rushdie in The Satanic Verses. Just off Commercial Road is the famous Pakistani establishment, the Lahore Kebab House (2 Umberston Street, 488-2551). This is not only popular with locals but also with well-heeled City visitors. Simple dishes such as seek kebab (barbecued minced lamb) and karahi gosht - meat cooked in a karahi, a two-handled cast iron pot used for cooking and presenting food - are popular. The restaurant is unlicensed but you may bring your own wine. SOUTHALL Punjabis started arriving in Southall, south London, when, just after the second world war, a rubber factory was set up in the area which appointed a head of personnel who had been stationed in India. He had been so impressed by Punjabi Sikh diligence that he began to recruit them. Punjabi food, by contrast to Bangladeshi, is spicy and meat based, with an emphasis on kebabs and karahi cooking. Known as Britain's Little India, Southall has a vibrant, upbeat atmosphere compared with Brick Lane. Its High Street hosts a spectacular array of colours - from sari shops to grocery stores. There are two 'upmarket' (ie licensed) restaurants of repute - Brilliant (72 Western Road, 081-574 1928) where the butter chicken is a real treat and Madhu's Brilliant (39 South Road 081-574 1897). According to local folklore, Madhu's Brilliant was set up by the sons of the founder of the original restaurant. At the end of the 1970s Sanjay and Sanjeer Anand were trying to convince their father that tandoori chicken was going to be the next big development in Indian cooking and that they should invest in a tandoor, a deep clay oven, in anticipation. The father would not hear of it and so the sons set up on their own to prove him wrong. Both continue to prosper. Catering more for the local market is Rita's (9 Regina Street, 081-571 1848) and Moti Mahal (94, The Broadway, 081-571 9443). Here more traditional Punjabi dishes are served, such as aloo tikki, fried potato in a tangy, tamarind-based sauce garnished with onion and coriander, papri, a flat crisp bread with yoghurt and sauces and sarson ka saag, a spicy puree of mustard leaves. WEMBLEY The Indians who settled in East African countries such as Kenya and Uganda - and who were then expelled in the late 1960s by dictators such as Idi Amin - came originally from the Indian state of Gujarat. Many were small businessmen who began trading again when they came to Britain. Gujaratis are predominantly vegetarian and their specialities, to be sampled at restaurants such as Chetnas (420 High Road, 081-900 1466) include bhel puris, a combination dish of puffed rice, sev (crispy vermicelli) and puri (deep fried biscuits) served with tamarind, coriander and chilli sauces. Other Gujarati dishes include channa (curried chick peas) and maag (a thick broth of black lentils served with naan bread). Meat dishes are served at the popular Karahi King (213 East Lane, 081-904 2760) and Curry Craze (8-9 Neald Parade, Wembley Hill Road, 081-902 9720). Look out for methi chicken, cooked with fenugreek seeds which gives a pungent aroma. CAMDEN Although the area is predominantly Bangladeshi, there are on Drummond Street, NW1, near Euston Station, renowned vegetarian, South Indian restaurants such as Diwana Bhel Puri House (114 Drummond Street, 071-387 5556) and Ravi Shankar (133 Drummond Street, 388-6458). Apart from bhel puris there are dosas, huge, traditional South Indian pancakes stuffed with spicy vegetables and accompanied by a coconut sauce. BIRMINGHAM The land of the balti. The balti is like a karahi and both are similar to a wok. Curries are served up in baltis, floating in a huge amount of sauce best mopped up with the massive naan breads they serve, often up to 18 inches long. Claims to the origins of the balti range from Sparkbrook, a Birmingham suburb, to a place called Baltistan which Pat Chapman, of the Curry Club, spotted with a magnifying glass on a map of north western Pakistan. Look out for The Adil (148, Stoney Lane, Balsall Heath, 021-449 0335) which like most of Birmingham's 300 balti houses is unlicensed. Also safe bets are Kababish (29 Woodbridge, 021-449 5556) and Royal Al Faisal (136-140 Stoney Lane, Sparkbrook, 021-449 5695). LEICESTER One third of Leicester's population is Indian, the highest concentration of any city outside India. They are predominantly Gujarati in origin but the owners of Madhu's Brilliant (of tandoori chicken fame in Southall) own Curry Fever (139 Belgrave Road, 0533-662941). Belgrave Road is Leicester's curry centre although Melton Road offers good competition with, in particular, The Taj at number 259 (0533-662185). BRADFORD Bradford boasts the highest concentration of curry restaurants in the country. Bradford's Pakistanis are mainly from the Mirpur region, just south of Kashmir and Pakistani cuisine is the most meat based of any region of the Indian sub continent, typified in gosht khara massala, lamb cooked with whole spices. Here there is a heavy emphasis on kebabs and biryani dishes not just in restaurants but also in private houses which open their dining rooms to those in search of an authentic, home-made curry. Look for discreet signs in the windows of these houses. The Aargh (27 Westgate, 0274-594660) serves an excellent raan - a leg of lamb marinated in yoghurt and spices and then roasted slowly. The Kashmir (27 Morley Street, 0274-726513) is the oldest of Bradford's restaurants having opened its doors in 1955. The chef at Shah Jahan (726 Manchester Road, 0274-724814) recently won the Bradford chef of the year competition. MANCHESTER Like Bradford, predominantly Pakistani. The place to head for is Wilmslow Road, Rusholme - aka 'Curry Alley' - where there are restaurants such as the Tandoori Kitchen (061-224 2329) and The Punjab (061-225 1542) and a number of cheaper cafes such as The Shezan (061-224 3116). Classic Pakistani dishes such as haleem, a spicy broth of lentils and meat cooked gently overnight, are sometimes available as a special. More upmarket is the Gaylord (Mariots Court in the city centre, 061-832 4866) where a signature dish is methi mazz - minced lamb cooked with spinach and fenugreek, Kashmiri style. SCOTLAND For the past two decades the Highlands of Scotland have been home to Pakistani door-to-door salesmen while the racial mix of the Lowlands is more evenly balanced: Punjabi Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in Glasgow, Indians and Bangladeshis in Edinburgh. In Glasgow there is the Killermont Polo Club (2022 Maryhill Road, near Bearsden 041-946 5412) and Babir's Ashoka (108 Eldershie Street, 041-221 1761) which offers no less than 10 types of pakora - pastry pyramids with spicy fillings. Popular in Edinburgh are the Indian Cavalry Club (3 Atholl Place 031-228 3282), the southern Indian vegetarian restaurant, Kalpna (2-3 St Patrick Square, 031-667 9890), and The Verandah (17 Dairy Road, 031-337 5828), which boasts Clint Eastwood among its clientele.

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Cadbury code attracts criticism A GROWING number of companies are expressing criticism of the Cadbury code of corporate governance, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual reports, Andrew Jack writes. Companies are saying the code is costly, ineffective in improving the standards of governance and irrelevant, the survey shows. The public statements come after a recent speech by Mr Michael Lawrence, chairman of the 100 Group of leading finance directors, criticising the growing burden of regulations and standards being imposed on companies from many sources. REA, the plantation group, says in its annual report that the burden and cost of Cadbury are 'to be regretted' and they cannot 'ensure the integrity and competence which must be the basis of an enduring business structure'.

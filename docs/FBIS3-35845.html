			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The debate at the  Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian Parliament) on  Monday concerning the Russian president's decree to extend the  state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia was "biased",  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev told journalists after the closed  meeting of the Federation Council approved the presidential  decree.    "This problem should be studied, since many do not know its  essence," he added.    He said that the editing commission would prepare a draft  decision for this Tuesday's meeting, which will contain some  amendments to the decree.    Aushev claimed that amendments should provide, above all,  for  introducing a direct presidential rule in the conflict area,  withdrawing all armed groups, suspending the activities of  executive power and subordinating the head of the area  administration directly to the Russian president.    The Ingush president expressed hope that a special  commission  of the Federation Council on the examination of the situation in  the conflict zone, which will be formed on the basis of the  Committee for the Affairs of the Russian Federation, the federal  treaty and regional policy as well as of the Defence and  Security Committee, "will appraise the situation on the spot and  prepare legislators for the next presidential decree which may  appear within two months, that is by the time the term of the  present decree expires".    North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told journalists  after the end of the session that he regarded today's discussion  of the presidential decree by the Federation Council as  unconstructive.    He was deadly opposed to the introduction of a direct  presidential rule. However, Galazov agreed that the state of  emergency should be prolonged.    He noted that the presidential decree was poorly drafted,  and  some of its points were "quite illiterate juridically".  According to the president, remarks by North Ossetian  representatives were not taken into account when the document  was drafted.    Adighe Republic President Aslan Dzharimov told ITAR-TASS  today that he deems it necessary "to stiffen the execution of  adopted decisions", and the start should be made with this  presidential decree.    Dzharimov, a member of the North-Caucasian Coordination  Council which started negotiations on the conflict back in  January 1993, does not preclude the need for introducing a  direct presidential rule.    "Decisions hitherto taken by the Russian president and  representative power were of small effect, but the conflict  should be extinguished at long last," the Adighe president  concluded.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA notes that regulations for the management of CKD waste under subtitle C may not be warranted or appropriate if other Agency-administered programs are better suited to address the concerns identified in this Report. Among the statutes that may have authority to address the indirect foodchain risks associated with CKD are the Clean Water Act (stormwater management regulations), the Clean Air Act (the program defining the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (which gives the Agency authority to issue appropriate regulations to address the risks from hazardous chemical substances or mixtures). These alternative authorities are being explored and a decision to pursue regulation of CKD under one or more of these statutes may form the basis for a decision that subtitle C regulation of CKD may be limited or even unwarranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether or not the Agency lifts the exemption, dust suppression and storm water management at facilities that burn hazardous waste, as well as on-site CKD management practices at all other facilities would be subject to current and potential future regulation under the Federal Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and where such provisions exist, all applicable state laws and regulations. Damages at existing CKD disposal sites also could be addressed by RCRA section 7003 and CERCLA section 104 and 106, if the site posed an imminent and substantial danger to human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 1: Retain the CKD Exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since CKD exhibits low inherent toxicity and poses minimal risk when evaluating the various exposure pathways using average or best case conditions, it may be appropriate to retain the exemption for cement kiln dust waste, that is, maintain the status quo. Under this option, CKD management would continue to be regulated by the States, if at all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 2: Retain the CKD Exemption, but enter into discussions with the industry, in which they voluntarily implement dust recycling technologies, reduce waste, and monitor and control certain off-site uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since certain management scenarios may present risks when assuming plausible worst case conditions and pollution prevention alternatives may be promising in certain instances, the Agency could enter into discussions with the cement manufacturing industry to urge it to implement selected waste minimization/pollution prevention technologies or implement, more environmentally protective management practices, including controlling certain off-site uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, some of the potential higher risk situations that have been identified in the hypothetical scenarios relate to on-site CKD management and derive from CKD releases from waste piles or other points via wind-blown dust or storm water runoff or a combination of the two. These contaminant release situations may be controllable (and at some facilities are currently being controlled) at relatively low cost by careful location of the waste pile and active use of conventional dust suppression and storm water management practices. The Agency would hold discussions with the industry to encourage them to voluntarily agree to implement these practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exception to the above conclusion would appear to be the 15 percent or so of cement plants where CKD waste is managed in areas of karst topography or other areas characterized by flow in fractured or cavernous bedrock, where leachate may directly percolate to groundwater with little or no attenuation. For some of these facilities, the groundwater pathway may become of increased concern, depending on other site specific considerations. Again, EPA would discuss with the industry opportunities to either use appropriate liners or relocate the CKD management unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> About 20 percent of current net CKD generation is used off-site for a wide variety of purposes, most of which according to the Agency's risk assessment do not pose human health or other risks. However, the use of raw CKD containing higher measured levels of certain metals and/or dioxins as a direct substitute for lime on agricultural fields and gardens can concentrate toxic constituents in crops and animal products at levels of concern for human health. This use of CKD, though not widely practiced at present, is otherwise not currently controlled, and may warrant further consideration by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TRUMP TAKES SHUTTLE OFF BLOCK  </P> <P> Developer Donald Trump has taken the Trump Shuttle off the auction block, a  spokeswoman confirmed today.  </P> <P> The move came shortly after Trump's $65-million bank bailout was officially  completed. Part of the rescue plan requires Trump, whose debt is estimated to  total $3.2 billion, to sell some assets.  </P> <P> Trump's bankers had been pressing for the sale of the shuttle, which had been  losing money and draining cash flow at his business empire.  </P> <P> A Trump spokeswoman noted that an upswing in business at the shuttle and  certain changes in operations have helped make the carrier profitable.  </P></p>

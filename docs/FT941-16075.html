			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / People: Owners - no holiday for Heald Nearly a decade ago, Malcolm Heald took his honeymoon in Majorca on a package organised by Sovereign, now part of the Owners Abroad group. Yesterday, Owners Abroad announced that Heald, 38, is to be its group finance director, replacing Geoffrey Stone, who resigned last November. Heald has been on several package holidays since his honeymoon, the most recent of which was last year when he went to Hong Kong and Bali with British Airways Holidays. Otherwise, he cheerfully admits, he has no experience of the holiday business. But he does, he says, have experience of working for companies in trouble. When he was appointed finance director of clothing company Jacques Vert in 1992, he was told it was about to break even. It was his doleful duty to inform the board they had actually made losses of over Pounds 4.5m. In 1992-3 it made full-year profits of Pounds 1.03m. Yesterday, Jacques Vert announced first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 833,000, compared with Pounds 186,000 profits last time. Heald says Owners Abroad is in less of a mess than Jacques Vert was. Nevertheless, it last year lost Howard Klein, its chairman, and Roger Allard, the managing director, who resigned after warning that profits this year would be half market expectations. The group has slipped from second to third place in the holiday market, behind Thomson and Airtours. Michael Julien, former chief executive of the Storehouse retail group, has since become non-executive chairman. Last year, he appointed Francis Baron, chairman of Anglo-Saxon Television, chief executive.</p>

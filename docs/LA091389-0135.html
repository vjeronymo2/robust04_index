			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> 'PASSIONLESS' HISTORY TEXTS DECRIED  </P> <P> Commonly used high school textbooks too often give students a picture of  American history that is without color, passion, point or interest, a study  released by the American Federation of Teachers said today.  </P> <P> The 158-page critique by historian Paul Gagnon analyzed five books and said  they neglect the role of religion in American history, give short shrift to Old  World roots and fail to explore deeply the thinking of such major figures as  Abraham Lincoln.  </P> <P> The writers, he said, "labor too hard to balance affirmation and negation, and  the result is a detached neutrality, passionless about both the ugly and the  beautiful moments in our history."  </P></p>

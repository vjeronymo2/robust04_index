			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television The series on Hollywood wives exerted a horrible sort of fascination. Living Barbie-dolls, plasticly gorgeous or surgically bedizened, spokespersons for the aesthetics of plush suburbia writ large, the intellect of airport bookstall paperbacks writ small, and the morality of the second-hand car (or husband or wife) salesman. There was a certain fun to be had from the assembled kitsch, a horrified thrill in the realisation that virtual reality had already arrived and, as in some sci-fi shocker, had taken over the real people. They made the Stepford Wives seem normal. Hollywood Kids (9pm, ITV) is as fascinating but much sadder. One automatically bristles against the plaint of the poor little rich kid, but some of these children, offspring of the famous, were genuinely hurt and bewildered. Clark Gable's secret daughter had to have those tell-tale ears altered. Having Judy Garland as a mom was no rainbow's end (nor was calling Liza Minelli Sis). Next week the four-part series moves on to children who were stars themselves.</p>

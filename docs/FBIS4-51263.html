			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "System to Make Shops Responsible For </F> Goods"]    [Text] Shops and manufacturers will no longer be able to  shrug off the complaints of customers in the near future.    The Ministry of Internal Trade plans to introduce a  "commodity accountability system" to all State and  collectively-owned stores later this year.    The proposal has been welcomed by consumers.    "This is an important move which will make our work easier  in  the protection of consumers' rights," said a spokeswoman with  the Beijing-based China Consumer Association.    But the new rule will need to be given more publicity in  order to make it effective, she added.    Trials were set up in a number of State-owned stores in big  cities last year.    The new system obliges State-owned stoles to handle  consumers' complaints on sub-standard goods, offering a repair  and exchange service and paying compensation if necessary.    In this way, customers can settle their grievances quickly.  And shopkeepers will not be able to pass on responsibility to  producers.    Under the commodity accountability system store managers and  consumers can confront the producer if a shoddy product causes  injuries.    Only when consumers demands have been met other concerns  such  as quality and transport problems can be addressed by the stores  to the manufacturers and the transporters.    But the system will not apply to privately owned shops and  markets.    The aim of the new system is to help establish and maintain  a  reliable image for State and collective-owned stores and prevent  shoddy commodities from entering these shops the official said.    Since the trials were started last March the new practice  has  been successfully implemented in 100 State-run department stores  in Tianjin, Beijing, and Harbin.    Business volume in Tianjin stores increased by 30 per cent  in  six months since the system was introduced. And the number of  consumer complaints dropped by 50 per cent.    In Beijing 50 shops and department stores were praised by  the  public for their improved service.</p>

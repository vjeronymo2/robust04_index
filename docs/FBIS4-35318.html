			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Muhammad Husni Mubarak at the opening </F> of the National Dialogue Drafting Committee Conference at the  Presidential Palace--live]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Brothers and sisters, members of the National Dialogue Drafting  Committee Conference: For the first time in a half century, the  whole world, and those of us in Egypt, feel that we are going  through one of the most delicate and difficult stages of  transformation in the lives of countries and their people. For  50 years, the world has lived under constant balance of  political, economic, and military force. International  relations, alliances, and affiliations were organized in a  specific manner and there were patterns which drew the lines  between friends and adversaries and between common and  discordant interests. We then found ourselves, along with all  the countries in the world, with the balances of force changed:  Enmity turned into friendship and those boundaries were  obliterated. Ideologies and concepts which governed half the  world for decades changed. Countries which were noted for their  domestic stability and leadership abroad were buffeted by strong  winds of chaos and conflict.    Inasmuch as the trends toward grouping grew in numerous  countries, trends toward fragmentation and division prevailed in  others. We found ourselves in the welter of a world living  through a stage of difficult transition in political and  economic systems and international relations. We in Egypt are  not living in isolation from what is going on around us, but at  the same time we are rebuilding our homeland during one of the  most delicate stages of our historical development, a stage that  the world perhaps has not seen for centuries. We are seeking to  consolidate stability in a world buffeted by disturbance,  violence, and the logic of force. We are struggling to build a  strong and prosperous economy in a world where the level of  inflation, unemployment, and recession is rising. We are  choosing a sound course of democratic practice in a world that  calls for defense of freedoms while daily it does the contrary,  prompting people to lose confidence in its credibility. We are  keen on returning security and stability to the Egyptian man and  providing him with livelihood and staples at a time when an  unholy force of evil killers and agents ally to strike the  Egyptian man's life, livelihood, and stability.    Nevertheless, we are going through our current stage of  great transformation amid domestic challenges, regional signs of  concern, and the decline of negative aspects in foreign  relations have failed to weaken our resolve, take us back, or  prevented us from forging ahead to rebuild modern Egypt, an  Egypt that is more stable and secure, more plentiful and  prosperous, more cohesive and harmonious, and loftier and  leading.    The true motive behind my national call to all the sons of  Egypt was my deep awareness of the need to provide basic  requirements of national rebuilding in Egypt, whether these  requirements were political entity, economic structure, social  establishment, or cultural values. My goal was to prepare the  groundwork so people could launch initiatives, hold dialogues,  and exchange ideas. Also so intellectual and academic societies  could engage in a comprehensive national dialogue to review the  achievements of the past years, to evaluate present  accomplishments, and to draw a new map for our sons and future  generations at the outset of the 21st century. These ideas were  the goals to which I sincerely aspired when I initiated the  appeal for a national dialogue. It was not a call for a  temporary meeting to merely submit papers and then file them  away. It was a call to work out a sound and developed  scientific formula to address all aspects of life in Egypt in  the 21st century and to specify priorities for national action  in light of the requirement of comprehensive development of the  Egyptian society in the political, economic, social, and  cultural fields. It was a call for a formula to orchestrate the  Egyptian resources with all their significance in the regional  and international arenas and to safeguard our national security  and defend the holy land.    Since our intrinsic potential is the true mainstay of our  national security, our sound and enlightened moves in the  foreign spheres are steered to serve our national interests.  The planned management of our international relations monitor  events and developments, adjust to changes, increase our  friends, contain adversaries and enmities, and deepen  cooperation and common interests. In foreign relations, we  believe in, and seek, fair peace and firmly confront and deter  any danger to our national interests no matter the source.    Brothers and sisters, in my speech before the People's  Assembly, I outlined the following mainstays for national  dialogue: first, the sound understanding of the challenges  facing Egypt; second, the meticulous perception of the  circumstances that govern our regional and external relations;  and third, the clear-cut delineation of the priorities of the  national action in the next stage.    In my speech on Labor Day, I called for crystallizing the  objectives which should be expected from the dialogue. I was  quick to warn against repercussions that might surface as a  result of the instigators' schemes. These schemes are aimed at  making the dialogue deviate from its noble goals by mixing  political action with religion so that instigators would not be  brought into account.    I affirmed that the major objective behind this dialogue is  to ensure a basic condition of democracy without slipping into  the chaos of ideas or conflict of stances which could threaten  the supreme interests of the homeland. I also explained that  the sound concept of democracy does not mean that there are no  boundaries between the legitimate law-abiding forces and the  illegitimate forces that provoke acts of violence and challenge  law.    I presented our specific concept of these legitimate forces,  because they are the forces which seek to establish a clear-cut  accord among themselves. The objective of this accord is to  safeguard the homeland's interests and to ensure that democracy  will never turn into disorder that would cripple the society's  energies.    I also explained our concept of our democratic experience. I  said that democracy is not a mold or a form that could be  applied equally everywhere. Every country has its own  circumstances, conditions, and experiences that must be taken  into consideration. I said that democracy is the course of our  life and our irrefutable choice.    I also made it a point to outline the following principles  of  this dialogue:    1. This dialogue must focus on the homeland's basic issues  whether they are economic, political, or social issues;    2. It must be above party interests;    3. It must be based on a scientific and realistic concept  that would represent the priorities of the national action in  Egypt;    . It must carefully take into account the homeland's  energies and potentials; and    5. This dialogue must never risk the homeland's security  and stability.    Brothers and sisters, hence, my honest call was made for the  sake of conducting a responsible national dialogue. Stability  is a guarantee for democracy and there can be no stability in a  society overwhelmed by infighting and division.    Brothers and sisters, if the freedom of opinion and the  interaction of views constitute the essence of dialogue, the  participation that is aware of the homeland's rights and which  is abiding by legitimacy, its constitutional duties, and  national and political principles, will represent the starting  point in formulating the scientific concept of future Egypt.    Broad participation is the sure guarantee for a rich  dialogue. It is also the guarantee for the usefulness and  effectiveness of such a dialogue. However, such participation  cannot take place without certain basiss to govern its action or  criteria to control its tempo. The most important criterion for  participation is adherence to the political standards adopted by  Egyptian society. These standards have taken root in this  society's national conscience and mind. They are the result of  this society's historical heritage and experience over hundreds  of years and the fruit of its national struggle in its  contemporary and modern history, dictated by the nature of the  structure of its civilization and geography when, on the area of  this ancient homeland, it first established a society that did  not know racial, religious, sectarian, or class discrimination.  This is a society in which various groups of its citizens have  been united since the dawn of time, a society in whose melting  pot all trends and religions were fused and held together by the  Egyptian weave. There is no room for sectarianism, nor is there  any place for fanaticism or class distinction.    The second most important criterion for this participation  is  adherence to the constitutional standards which the Egyptian  people unanimously agreed upon when they adopted a republican  and democratic system as a style and course for their political  life. This system enables the people to rule themselves, gives  the law sovereignty, protects freedoms, and sanctifies duties.    The third criterion for participation consists of the  national standards which are represented by the strength of  belonging and loyalty to this homeland; second, the depth of  commitment to the goals and significance of public  responsibility; and third, the performance of duties to the same  extent as adherence to rights.    These, brothers and sisters, are the criteria for  participation in the dialogue and the political, constitutional,  and national standards. There are no restrictions other than  what the homeland and society have approved through their  historic and cultural experiences. The agreements of the  nation, which it has reached through all its actions in its  modern history, cannot be violated. The spirit of consensus in  the Egyptian nation was a law based on justice, freedom based on  commitment and responsibility, a right backed by duties, and a  national, social, and cultural struggle which cannot be  forfeited or ceded.    Within this framework, the national call for participation  in  the dialogue was made. We made this call to all social forces  and economic, social, and cultural institutions that respect  legitimacy and adhere to the constitution and law, so that  opinions interact and our internal political and social reality  is explored to deduce the characteristics of the future. We  also made this call so that these forces and institutions can  learn from the experiences of others, pinpoint the strengths of  other societies and adopt them for themselves; and so that they  can see the obstacles and stumbling blocs in the marches of  other peoples, thus avoiding them and keeping themselves and  Egypt away from such obstacles.    The national call was directed at the national and  legitimate  forces for them to take the initiative to produce action, not be  on the receiving end. The future of Egypt is, first and  foremost, the trust of its sons, citizens, and generations. It  is not a monopoly of the present generation or the ruling party.    The national call was addressed to the professional  institutions and unions that operate within the framework of  legitimacy, and to the research centers, intellectuals,  inventors, and the masses of educated people in Egypt. It was  not merely a call for participation in decision-making, or  formulating a program, or polling an opinion; it was a call for  stimulating energies, driving determination, inspiring the  minds, and arousing the conscience to give serious and  responsible thought to the Egypt of tomorrow and the future.    Dear brothers and sisters, all of the above are elements and  parties to the dialogue who are taking part in it by expressing  their views, offering advice, contributing experience, and  voicing their opinion. There are no boundaries separating them  from telling the truth. There is nothing to prevent them from  being totally frank. Participation with such logic, with this  objective, under these conditions, and in this way could in fact  be the correct interpretation of a democratic political life in  Egypt. Expanding participation based on these criteria and  proceeding from these starting points provides the proper  guarantees for a national dialogue in which the sides will take  part within the constitutional, political, and national  regulations. The unions and all the forces of Egyptian society  capable of thinking, expressing opinion, holding discussions,  and contributing to society will take part in this dialogue.    Since this is the nature of this dialogue and its various  issues, its various criteria and standards, and the sides  participating in it, the committee tasked with preparing the  general conference is responsible for translating all this into  definite concepts and detailed plans of action.  Responsibilities and duties entrusted upon this preparatory  committee revolve round many axes. The first axis is to define  the legitimate national forces within the political, economic,  social, and cultural frameworks that will be participating in  the dialogue and which operate under the umbrella of the law and  constitution. The second axis is to choose the issues and  subjects around which the dialogue should revolve. The third  axis is to set and organize the style of action during the  conference, be that through holding general sessions, or forming  major committees or specialized working groups. In other words,  the preparatory committee will define the organizational form of  the general conference and the rules governing its measures and  discussions. It will also make recommendations at the  conclusion of the conference. The preparatory and drafting  committee will present its recommendations to the general  conference during its first session.    Brothers and sisters, there will always be a standard  governing all other standards and topping them all. It controls  all other criteria and rises above them. This standard is,  above all, a sense of belonging to this homeland within its  borders, to its history and its heritage; it is a desire to  protect its security from evil and its citizens from every harm.  I am very hopeful and confident that there will be a great  national response in the form of a national call for open  dialogue to map out Egypt's future and chart its years ahead.    The source of my hope and confidence for this national  response is what I have sensed and seen over the past few  months. I have noticed large-scale discussion in all clubs and  forums, in the media, and in research centers of the philosophy  of dialogue and its concepts, its objectives and various issues,  its requirements and usefulness, and the various parties  participating in it. Irrespective of how correct or incorrect,  real or fake, honest or dishonest things are, we have before us  today an open book with as many trends as the number of writers  who have contributed to it and as many opinions as those who  have produced it. Today, we have the responsibility of a  historic choice, because today we choose for ourselves inasmuch  as we choose for the coming generations. We choose for the  present inasmuch as we choose for the future.    The start of a national dialogue today is our way of  increasing knowledge of the homeland's concerns and mapping out  the road to achieve its objectives. The start of a national  dialogue today will strengthen confidence in our abilities to  govern our own destiny and to plan the programs that will  transfer modern Egypt from a rising, developing country into an  advanced state taking a leading position among other states in  the new world order, the features and landmarks of which are  still being shaped and reshaped every day. The start of a  national dialogue today will define concepts, control standards,  and draw up roles and missions for the homeland and its  citizens. Through it, amity will prevail and ideas and minds  will meet to promote this faithful country.    Brothers and sisters, this in my opinion is the significance  and purpose of the dialogue and these are its aims and  objectives. With all sincerity I frankly tell you that the call  for dialogue was not a reaction to a national dilemma imposed by  circumstances--never--or necessitated by modern pressures. Nor  was it a transient move to conglomerate parties into what is  being called a national front or national coalition dictated by  the requirements of what is being termed reconciliation during  this sensitive stage we are going through. National dialogue is  a sincere national call that rises above partisanship and  parties and in which the state, the government, the people, and  the whole Egyptian society will melt into one system of national  action for Egypt.    I frankly tell you that from this purely Egyptian  perspective  our national dialogue is different from other dialogues in its  nature, goals, and motives. Our dialogue derives its roots from  a nation that is the best of nations, whose cultural identity  has never been erased and whose unique character throughout  history has never been lost. God has given this nation a true  historic feeling, thanks to which Egypt has never made a mistake  in choosing the correct course at the correct time. Our  dialogue will grow and prosper in a society whose forces have  not fought with each other and whose elements have never  quarreled. This society has lived on the banks of the great  Nile in unity, cohesion, and harmony. From the political and  cultural points of view, it is futile to make comparisons  between what is taking place in other societies and what is  happening in Egypt when we open a new chapter of new dialogue.  The chapters or stages of this dialogue among the Egyptian  people have never stopped.    The launching of this dialogue begins the regulation of the  movement of society in Egypt for the next years. It will help  us avoid the past shortcomings that hindered the march of  society and will glorify the present achievements that broke  barriers and unleashed capabilities. The national call for a  comprehensive dialogue on the future of national action in Egypt  has its perils, significance, and results. But we must always  realize that the dialogue has three objectives: first, to  preserve the security and stability of this homeland; second, to  establish a balance between the citizens' ambitions and the  potentials of the homeland; and third, to secure broad  participation in the process of finding solutions to the  problems of the society and in decision-making. These three  basic objectives represent a broad framework comprising the  issues and priorities for national action.    In our contemporary world, there are three indispensable  elements which nations and homelands need to be strong: national  and social solidarity; economic and material potential; and  scientific and cultural progress. If these elements are  lacking, or if any of them collapses, states blunder and they  stumble in their steps; indeed, they retrogress and end up  depending on others for security, power, and knowledge, and even  for aid and survival.    Aware of our need for these three elements, we, in our call  for a national dialogue, proposed that the priorities of our  national work be as follows:    1. Building a strong and prosperous economy as the center of  economic development, and realizing the well-being of the  Egyptians as the center of social development.    2. Egypt's youths represent its present and future, and  their issues must top the national action's list of priorities.  High among these issues are the optimal use of manpower and the  ability of the labor market to accommodate all job seekers.    3. The relationship between the people, who constitute  Egypt's human wealth and the sources of its development and  growth, and the country's natural resources and economic  capabilities must be regulated. That is, a balance between man  and land must be created so that we can achieve abundance and  strength.    4. Culture, education, and science in Egypt represent the  triangle of the national project designed to change the face of  political, economic, and social life, achieve cultural  development in the coming decades, and to establish links  between science and society and between education and production.    5. Curative and preventive health care for Egyptians is not  only a state service, but an effort to maintain and preserve the  dearest and most valuable thing on this good land, namely, the  Egyptian man in his childhood, youth, and old age.    6. Modernizing and developing the administration is the key  to a successful performance. No matter how generous nature is,  resources and capabilities are dissipated if there is no modern  administration to design, plan, implement, and oversee. In our  modern Egypt, where resources are scarce and population is  abundant, we, more than anybody else, need a modern and  developed administration and a firm control system.    7. The call to transfer responsibility to a new generation  of Egyptian youth does not stem from a mere desire for change or  rotation of power, but is a natural response to legitimate hopes  for contributions in building the Egypt of the future.    Brothers and sisters, the start of the national dialogue  opens doors to every sincere Egyptian, to every patriotic person  committed to the security of his country and people, to every  intellectual knowledgeable of his nation's heritage and the  people's values, and to every laborer and farmer sweating and  working hard to water the soil of Egypt so that it can produce  crops, virtue, and development, and so that Egypt's fields can  bloom, its desert and valleys can be built up, and development  can reach every spot in this land.    This beginning of a national dialogue, brothers and sisters,  opens the doors of hope for Egypt's future. We are determined  to maintain Egypt's security and stability, and we have sworn to  God that we will safeguard the Egyptian citizen's right to a  dignified life in which he feels safe about his present and  future. We have vowed to shoulder this trust and not to  relinquish our responsibility in defending the unity and  cohesiveness of this nation and the sacred soil of this  homeland. We will remain faithful to our pledge to God and the  homeland. Every engagement will be inquired into on the day of  reckoning. Peace be upon you.</p>

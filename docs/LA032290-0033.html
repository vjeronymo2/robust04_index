The firm expects to have completed its audit by the  district's next board meeting on April 3, he said.  </P> <P> Merideth said the firm would be looking at "reimbursement-type expense  records." District officials said the audit will examine Ely's records,  including telephone and travel expenses. The Board of Trustees unanimously  authorized the audit at a board retreat in Simi Valley last week.  </P> <P> Ely, 54, a board trustee since 1979, is running in the county supervisorial  race to represent the 4th District.

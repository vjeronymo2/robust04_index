			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRUSH FIRE BURNS 10 ACRES IN SUN VALLEY  </P> <P> A slow-moving brush fire in Sun Valley blackened 10 acres Thursday night but  caused no injuries or structural damage, the Los Angeles Fire Department  reported.  </P> <P> The fire started about 7 p.m. near the 7800 block of North Hollywood Way and  was contained by 8:30 p.m., said Greg Acevedo, Fire Department spokesman. More  than 50 firefighters from the city and county fire departments were assisted by  four water-dropping helicopters, he said. Two engines from the Lockheed Co.  Fire Department, stationed at nearby Burbank Airport, helped battle the flames,  Acevedo said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said smoke illuminated by spotlights from helicopters mixed with  orange flames to provide an eerie backdrop for evening commuters on the nearby  Golden State Freeway. But the spectacle did not back up traffic on the freeway,  a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.  </P> <P> Cause of the fire was being investigated, Acevedo said.  </P></p>

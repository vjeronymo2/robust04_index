			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola,  FALA, Command and the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola, UNITA, secretariat for Malange Province have  vehemently rejected the remarks made by Flavio Fernandes,  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  MPLA-PT, governor for that province. Those two structures have  described the MPLA-PT governor's words as thoughtless.    Fernandes, who was interviewed in Luanda yesterday,  described  Malange Province's political and military situation as serious  because of an alleged intensification of the attacks by the  UNITA troops. According to him, those forces were also planting  mines along access routes to farming areas used by the people.    That MPLA-PT official has dared to show himself a faithful  defender of the Futungo de Belas Palace leadership's interests.  He made defamatory remarks about things that are not even  happening. He even failed to notice when he confessed the truth  by saying that Malange Province's difficulties owed to a large  extent to a lack of support by the Luanda regime. [passage  omitted]</p>

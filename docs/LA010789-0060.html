			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MEDIA DRAW BONN'S IRE OVER LIBYA  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl has complained to the U.S. government about accusations  in the American media that West German companies helped to build a chemical  weapons plant in Libya, his chief spokesman said Friday.  </P> <P> "The West German government regards the form and content of the discussion  being carried out through parts of the U.S. media as unhelpful," said spokesman  Friedhelm Ost at a news conference.  </P> <P> At the same time, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher revealed that Libyan  officials told the West German ambassador in Tripoli that they agree with the  principal of international inspections of chemical plants but only as part of  an overall ban on chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The word passed from Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi through Ambassador Juergen  Hellner was that Libya would allow inspections of its chemical plant under an  international accord but refused to be singled out for challenge inspections,  the Foreign Ministry said Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talks Due in Paris  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry sources said that Genscher would try to discuss a chemical  weapons ban with his Libyan counterpart in Paris during the conference on  chemical weapons that begins today. They said he will also ask Secretary of  State George P. Shultz about speculation that the United States plans to  destroy the Libyan plant by military force.  </P> <P> Kohl's spokesman Ost said that the United States has not provided the  government with enough hard evidence on the reported involvement of West German  companies in building the Libyan plant -- despite repeated requests from Bonn.  </P> <P> Ost said that Kohl had originally been told of American suspicions of West  German companies' complicity in building the plant during the chancellor's  visit to Washington on Nov. 15, and he promised at that time to investigate.  </P> <P> According to the spokesman, American officials said they would provide detailed  information implicating the West German firms -- singling out Imhausen-Chemie,  based in Lahr in southwestern West Germany. But Ost said that no firm evidence  was provided about any role of the company in supplying or building the Libyan  chemical complex, which Kadafi has said will make pharmaceuticals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Expert Team'  </P> <P> In discussions with the Americans, the spokesman said, "it was agreed that an  expert team would be sent to Germany to brief German authorities."  </P> <P> But the American team that discussed the case here on Dec. 22 "could not give  any concrete information," according to Ost.  </P> <P> "They just confirmed their belief that the German enterprise, Imhausen, was  responsible for the planning of the plant," he said.  </P> <P> The Americans agreed to provide further evidence, but they had not done so by  the time the U.S. accusations became public last Sunday in an article in the  New York Times and have not done so since, Ost said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Evidence Found  </P> <P> Ost said that the West German government's investigation of Imhausen-Chemie  covered the period 1984-88 but that "no clues were found that Imhausen-Chemie  had exported planning documents for the construction of a chemical plant -- or  export of know-how."  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said of West  Germany: "We are confident that it is taking the information we have provided  very seriously and is investigating fully. With regard to the Libyan (chemical  weapons) program, we understand that the appropriate West German authorities  are still conducting their investigations."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Ost's public statements criticizing U.S. procedures on the matter  seem to reflect a growing split between the United States and West Germany in  which other issues are also involved, observers here said. These include  low-flying military training flights by American planes, the European  Community's ban on imports of hormone-fed U.S. meat and U.S. pressure on Bonn  to expand the West German economy.  </P></p>

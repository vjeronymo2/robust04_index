			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: To 'Du' or not Sir, You reported that Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Prime Minister John Major by the familiar 'Du' form during their conversations relayed via interpreters ('Major backs Kohl over EU links with eastern Europe', April 28). This appears friendly, but there is a danger that Mr Kohl's attitude might appear condescending. I was born in Berlin, and I can say that I would never call another person 'Du' unless I was a member of their family, had been at the same school, was a member of the same club, or had received their express permission to use it. I do not think French President Francois Mitterrand would be happy if the German chancellor addressed him as 'tu'. A British prime minister must be treated with the respect he deserves, whatever the relationship, which cannot be measured through the voice of an interpreter.

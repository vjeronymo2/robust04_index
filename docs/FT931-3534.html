			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government disavows workfare THE GOVERNMENT has no intention of introducing a workfare-type system compelling claimants to work in return for benefit received, a junior minister told MPs yesterday, David Owen writes. On the eve of a Budget likely to include a range of unemployment-related measures, Mr Alistair Burt, a junior social security minister, said the government had been trying to provide 'practical' help for the unemployed. His comments followed Labour attacks on the burden which high unemployment imposed on the social security department's annual budget. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the Pounds 10.4bn the department expected to spend in the coming year on the unemployed - equivalent to 12 per cent of the department's total spending - was a 'frightening' figure and a 'condemnation' of government policy. Mr Dewar urged the government to recognise that the best way of cutting back on this spending was to reduce the dole queues and to support policies that would have that effect. He called for the principle of workfare to be rejected. A redesign of schemes for the unemployed to provide programmes combining temporary work with job-hunting and involving some element of compulsion is believed to be in the pipeline. Today's measures may include a relaxation of the rule on the hours someone can study before becoming ineligible for benefit.</p>

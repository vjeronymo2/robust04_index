			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (9): Foreign institutions are muscling in - Germany is starting to attract the international investment banking community Slowly but surely, Germany is developing into a mecca for the international investment banking community. This is not because the country has suddenly acquired an 'equity culture' - this is impossible when there are still only about 665 quoted companies and most are still owned by families, banks and insurance companies rather than performance-oriented institutional investors. But even if the stock market is far from being the centre of German economic might, some of the long-predicted developments for the German corporate finance market are beginning to happen. In M &amp; A, German companies are getting used to the idea of paying for services they would previously have got for nothing from their house-banks. In the capital markets arena, foreign institutions are muscling in and winning mandates which would hitherto have been the preserve of the domestic institutions. These developments suggest that the long years of marketing effort in Germany are beginning to bear fruit. But the surge of business reflects more than successful selling - a cultural shift is taking place. 'Finally we have arrived in this market,' says Frank Beelitz, joint managing director of Lehman Brothers in Germany. He is alluding to the success of investment banks in general, but is proud to point out that Lehman was retained by the Bavarian government to advise on the recent two-step merger between Bayernwerk, the state-owned utility, and Viag, a big German energy and metals conglomerate. The deal, Germany's biggest privatisation, values the combined group at around DM19bn. 'Ten years ago this would have been a shoe-in for the Deutsche bank,' says Beelitz. 'It shows how the market is developing. Corporate customers have become sensitised to at least two issues. 'First, they can see the value of independent advice - cases such as the near collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Continental/Pirelli takeover saga have served to illustrate, in a high profile way, the extent to which the German universal banking system is fraught with conflicts of interest. Second, the house-bank just does not have the capabilities to do the job. In the 1970s a German company's response to my pitch would be 'well, my house-bank will do that for me for free'. But there is now a growing recognition that you get what you pay for. 'In all situations involving financial advice major corporations immediately consider using Anglo-Saxon advisors and the beauty contest has become a fact of business life in Germany.' Such considerations have drawn a gamut of international institutions to set up and expand their German operations. The population of Frankfurt, used to bankers who wear white-socks (one of the big three German banks that tried to ban them from the dealing floor, but was forced to give way after it faced a revolt from staff) is now getting acquainted with the striped shirt and red-braces brigade: the investment banker has arrived. One after another the investment banks have signalled their intentions to increase their presence in the Finanzplatz. Goldman Sachs famously doubled its staff to 120 over 1992-93; Morgan Stanley has boldly declared it, too, wants to double the staff in Frankfurt, to 160 by mid-1995; Beelitz - who defected to Lehman last year with Peter Coym after the two of them built Salomon Brothers into the most profitable investment bank in Germany - wants to expand staff at his new firm from 90 now to 125 in the next 18 months. 'The biggest problem for us is not the amount of business, it is getting hold of the right people,' says Beelitz. Indeed, young Germans and Austrians who have spent some time abroad and are able to straddle the cultural divide between Germany and the Anglo-American business environment are in enormous demand. This optimism contrasts with the 10 per cent fall in the absolute number of M &amp; A transactions last year. According to statistics produced by the Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountancy firm, the number of deals completed last year fell to 2,231. Looking ahead, C &amp; L concludes that the main buyers of German businesses next year will be foreign companies looking for bargains after the recession has reduced vendors' expectations. Financial transactions are also likely to rise, argues Coopers, with the management buyout becoming an ever more popular solution to the problem of management succession at 'mittelstand' or medium-sized companies. It is also used as a way for big companies to divest themselves of unwanted subsidiaries. Whilst the bread and butter corporate finance work in Germany will continue to be based on transactions involving smaller transactions, the future holds one enormous piece of business which is already whetting the appetite of the international investment banking community. This is the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. Beelitz at Lehman Brothers reckons that the first tranche of the shares in the utility will be sold to the public in early 1996. Between now and then, there is a huge amount of investment banking work to be done in preparing the company for the markets and the markets for the company. No appointments have been made yet, but sources suggest that the mighty Deutsche Bank will be forced to share the role of 'global coordinator' to the issue with a foreign investment bank. In addition, a bank will have to be appointed as chief advisor to Telekom itself and there is likely to be a pair of 'book-runners' for what is expected to be a substantial tranche of the equity destined to be placed in the US. Assuming that the first privatisation is worth DM8bn, and fees amount to 3 per cent of that value, there are fees of DM240m waiting to be earned by the investment banking community. The competition to get a share of this cake has already begun.</p>

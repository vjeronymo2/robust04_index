			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report: from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] In response to the Hata cabinet's resignation, the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is now holding an  emergency executive meeting to discuss ways to form a new  coalition government. The LDP forced the Hata cabinet to resign  en masse by submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet,  claiming the Hata cabinet was a minority government that did not  represent the people's will. The LDP is taking the Hata  cabinet's resignation as a matter of course. Asserting that it  would like to form a stable coalition government with other  political parties, the LDP intends to discuss ways to form a new  coalition government with the other parties.    Speaking with a group of reporters this morning, LDP  Secretary General Mori said Prime Minister Hata had said he  would leave the formation of the next government to the Diet,  and being the largest party, the LDP will call on other parties  to cooperate with it in doing so.    While some LDP members would like to create an alliance with  the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in  forming the next government, former Foreign Minister Watanabe is  asserting the framework of the next government must be based on  policies, indicating his caution about the LDP forging an  alliance with the SDPJ. The LDP is expected to be divided over  how to construct the next government's framework.</p>

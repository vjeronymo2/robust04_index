			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU: Council Introduces Definitive </F> Anti-Dumping Duty on Imports of Russian Isobutanol"; as released  by Brussels EUROPE]    [Text] London, 31 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As briefly  indicated in yesterday's EUROPE, the Council has turned into a  definitive anti-dumping duty the provisional duty introduced by  the Commission in October on imports of isobutanol from Russia.  During the additional inquiry, this measure was contested by  the main industrial user of isobutanol (which is essentially  used as a solvent in the paint and varnish industry), saying  that:     -  Community producers of isobutanol have introduced a  new production technique for oxo alcohols that use less  isobutanol; the decline of Community production would be due to  this technological change. The Commission replied that the  isobutanol market contracted by 20 percent whereas the decline  in Community production was nearly twice that (39.8 percent) and  the use of capacities (after the reduction of installations)  fell from 73.8 percent to 57.3 percent. The result is that,  without denying the effects of the technological change, there  remains a considerable negative effect caused by dumped  imports;    -  Isobutanol represents a major proportion of its  production costs for certain intermediate products made only in  Italy and for the Italian market. For these products, the  industrial user in question must face competition from producers  in Austria, Poland and Hungary, which can continue to buy  Russian isobutanol if no measure is taken against dumping. The  Council agreed with the Commission's conclusions and approved  the definitive anti-dumping duty at the same provisional duty of  ECU102 a tonne. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom voted against  it.</p>

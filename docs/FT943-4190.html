			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / OECD critical of Swiss construction cartels Switzerland has the highest rate of spending on construction of all the industrialised countries, at Dollars 4,500 per head in 1990. And, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, this bloated Dollars 30bn annual construction bill is not just attributable to the quaint Swiss tendency to build everything for eternity. A fair part of it derives from a formidable range of anti-competitive practices that prevail throughout the country - mainly cartels and the use of industry standards and arcane qualifications to restrict entry. In Geneva, for example, a contractor has to have already built a bridge in the canton to qualify to tender on any new bridge project. In a special study of Switzerland's construction sector, the OECD also says that excessively strict zoning regulations and tenant protection laws help boost housing prices beyond the ability of ordinary people to pay. Switzerland has the lowest level of home ownership among leading OECD countries, at 31.3 per cent in 1990. High construction costs also constitute a significant drag on the whole economy because of the industry's unusually large size and links to other sectors. It accounts for 16.8 per cent of gross domestic product and two-thirds of total fixed investment. The OECD acknowledges the Swiss authorities' concern with preserving the natural beauty of the countryside, but argues 'there would seem to be ample scope' for lowering housing costs without compromising this objective. Swiss construction prices are about 40 per cent above the OECD average on a purchasing power parity basis, a figure consistent with prices in other sectors. A recent study found that the construction cost of a representative apartment building was 29 per cent higher in Switzerland than in Germany. About 60 per cent of the difference was attributable to more demanding construction standards, with much of the remainder due to higher architects' fees and taxes. Swiss builders also face additional requirements to build air-raid shelters and parking spaces. Wage rates tend to be only slightly below those prevailing in other sectors, even though productivity is considerably worse. Foreign competition is virtually absent from the Swiss construction market, partly because of a law, the so-called Lex Friedrich, restricting foreigners from owning property. Cantonal governments, which buy a third of the industry's output, also restrict competition. Many governments impose restrictive qualifying conditions, such as membership in local organisations or local domicile. 'Other devices include the automatic exclusion of the best offer or, indeed, of all offers below professional associations' reference prices and the abusive use of government charges,' the OECD says. According to a recent study, these policies add at least 3.7 per cent to the cost of public purchases. 'Cartel agreements among construction companies also boost the cost of public works. These agreements aim at dividing the work among a number of enterprises and fixing in advance the prices submitted to the authorities,' the OECD says. Moreover, cartels are endemic in building materials industries, especially kitchen fittings, cables, bricks wallpaper and cement. 'The bathroom and kitchen fittings industries have been able to influence prices because they have fixed technical standards which severely restrict imports - so much so that the major supplier of bathroom fittings has nearly 90 per cent of the market.' The cost of land for construction is inflated by zoning laws which prohibit the construction in agricultural zones of any structure not related to traditional agricultural use. In permitted zones, hoarding is common. The OECD observes that Swiss governments are taking steps to resolve all of these shortcomings - strengthening cartel laws, revising the Lex Friedrich, reviewing zoning and rental control laws and promoting home ownership through allowing people to use part of their pension fund equity for home purchases. But it argues: 'Priority should be given to eliminating structural features which needlessly lift housing costs and restrict supply.'</p>

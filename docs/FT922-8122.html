			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould back reform LABOUR must reject the notion that minor policy changes will prove adequate to win the next election and instead develop a platform with an appeal that embraces the interests and aspirations of middle-class voters. That is the view held by both contenders for the party leadership in articles published in New Statesman and Society magazine today. Shadow chancellor Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite, and Mr Bryan Gould, his challenger, definitively reject the so-called 'one last heave' notion, which argues that the party should simply repackage its current policies and improve on its communications with the electorate. But their approaches to broadening the party's appeal vary subtly, with Mr Gould delivering a thinly-veiled attack on his rival for his handling of economic policy. Mr Smith argues that Labour should play heavily on the argument of enlightened self-interest, a broad concept of freedom and economic logic. The shadow chancellor suggests that the 'comfortable and contented' are anxious about inner-city degeneration, unemployment and the decline in the quality of life. Mr Gould begins by criticising Labour's election campaign for failing to offer motives to middle-class voters to support the party. In a passage that will infuriate Mr Smith's supporters, he says the party endorsed Tory macroeconomic policies by accepting a simple goal of monetary stability, offering no route to full employment or recovery. He also asks why constructive proposals such as contributors' control over pensions funds, share ownership schemes and better employee rights were not proposed. In future, electors should not be treated as socio-economic groups but as individuals given the power that leaves them 'properly equipped to operate in a market place that would otherwise treat them unfairly'.</p>

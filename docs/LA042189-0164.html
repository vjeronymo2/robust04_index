			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARRAIGNMENT PLOY IS CHARGED IN RAZO CASE  </P> <P> An attorney for Jose Luis Razo, the former Harvard University student who  confessed to a string of armed robberies, charged Thursday that La Habra police  officers delayed his arraignment in July of 1987 so that he would keep talking  to authorities before he obtained a lawyer.  </P> <P> "They intentionally delayed it to get him to speak," said John D. Barnett,  Razo's court-appointed attorney, on the second day of pretrial motions in  Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The motions are expected to continue through next week, with jury selection  tentatively scheduled for May 1.  </P> <P> Razo, now 22, emerged from a modest La Habra neighborhood to become a standout  athlete and student at Servite High School in Anaheim and a recognized youth  leader in the community. He was recruited by dozens of universities before  enrolling at Harvard in 1985.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confessed to Robberies  </P> <P> Two years later, however, he confessed to police and local newspapers that he  had committed more than a dozen holdups in Orange and Los Angeles counties --  along with one in Florida -- during breaks from school.  </P> <P> Barnett is hoping that testimony during pretrial motions will persuade Superior  Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer to quash some or all of Razo's confessions to  police on the grounds that they were obtained through what he called  "constitutionally deficient" means.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Barnett tried to establish that Razo's first court appearance  after his arrest July 6 was delayed a day so that Costa Mesa and Whittier  police could interview him before he was assigned a lawyer.  </P> <P> La Habra Police Officer Michael Moore testified that he filed a complaint  against Razo in Municipal Court in Fullerton on July 8 and assumed that Razo  would be arraigned that day.  </P> <P> Moore's partner, Detective Robert Wyse, testified that he also believed that  Razo would be arraigned that day, and he told other police agencies that they  should interview him while he was talking and before he got an attorney.  </P> <P> But at Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987, Costa Mesa Police Detective Edmund  Zuorski testified that Wyse called him on July 8 and told him that Razo would  be arraigned July 9.  </P> <P> Razo was taken to court on July 8, but he was not arraigned. Instead, he was  taken back to Orange County Jail, where he was interviewed that night by Santa  Ana and Costa Mesa police. One of the 10 Orange County robberies with which he  is charged occurred in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Wyse said in court Thursday that until recently, he believed that Razo was  arraigned July 8.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says Police Lied  </P> <P> Barnett said the discrepancy shows that Wyse, and possibly Moore, are lying and  that the confessions they obtained from Razo should be ruled invalid.  </P> <P> "They can't be believed," Barnett said, adding that the discrepancy casts  doubts on the officers' assertion that they obtained the confessions lawfully.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta disputed Barnett's claim.  </P> <P> "I don't think Wyse is lying," Mehta said. Of the discrepancy between Wyse's  testimony Thursday and Zuorski's in 1987, Mehta said, "That's a clarification  I'm going to have to get from Zuorski," who is scheduled to testify next week.  </P> <P> Mehta said he had no idea why Razo did not appear in court on July 8 and get an  attorney.  </P> <P> "What happened at the clerk's office, nobody has a reason for it," he said. "I  know for a fact that, having heard the testimony and having spoken with the  officers, they did not delay the arraignment."  </P></p>

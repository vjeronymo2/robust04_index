			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The shadow of the taxman FT-SE Index: 2,493.2 (-10.9) It is not hard to see why debate over the Labour party's income tax proposals has degenerated into an unseemly slanging match about the level of standard rate required to meet its manifesto plans. Labour can scarcely be right to argue that it would not need any extra levy from individuals earning less than Pounds 20,300. The Tories are wrong to assert that the standard rate would rise by 10p in the pound. But Mr Lamont's problem lies in trying to argue that Labour's overall proposals would have much economic impact as they stand, even though they appear to be a sharp reversal of the Thatcherite trend towards a lower, simpler tax structure. Taking some Pounds 4bn from higher-rate taxpayers and redistributing it through higher pensions and child benefit ought, in theory, to be mildly stimulative because the recipients are more likely to be spenders than savers. But the amount is tiny against total personal disposable income. There is also a risk that the economic benefit would be offset by a further loss of confidence among affluent but debt-ridden consumers which would act as a drag on recovery. Uncertainty over the future tax regime is inhibiting the housing market, though this might dissipate after the election if only a small minority of taxpayers actually found their bills increasing. In isolation, Labour's income tax proposals have limited implications for the financial markets. As they are skewed towards consumption rather than saving, they might in theory reduce the funds available for investment, though here again the amount of money involved is small. Within the equity market, there might be some sector effects, with food retailers, for example, benefiting at the expense of stores selling big ticket consumer goods. There are, of course, plenty of other market factors which would apply in the event of a Labour victory. The foreign exchanges would probably test Mr Kinnock's commitment to the European system, forcing interest rates up sharply, at least to begin with. Labour would have to reconcile its policy ambitions to its capacity to borrow and its commitment to an unchanged tax burden for the vast majority. Where that line is finally drawn is far more important to the markets than a shift in the distribution of the income tax burden. Higher top rates have the reputation in Tory mythology of reducing incentives and constricting activity at the micro-level. The academic case for this is unproven, though Labour is pushing its luck with its plan to generate additional social security funds by reintroducing a surcharge on investment incomes over Pounds 3,000. Not only would this push up its own cost of borrowing, it would also distort investment decisions by putting undue emphasis on tax efficiency. The biggest beneficiary would be the financial services industry,which must already be totting up the fees to be earned from helping clients avoid the charge.</p>

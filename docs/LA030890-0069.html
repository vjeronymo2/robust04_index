			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC/DANCE  </P> <P> New Job for Sellars: L.A. Festival Artistic Director Peter Sellars on March 23  will be named artistic adviser for the newly formed Boston Opera Theater, which  is tentatively scheduled to open in 1990 with Sellars' revivals "Don Giovanni,"  "Marriage of Figaro" and "Cosi fan Tutte." The revivals will run through  spring, 1991. In 1993 the new company will mount a six-month season, in which  Sellars will stage a new production each year. L.A. Festival Executive Director  Judith Luther said Sellars' new position shouldn't affect his duties with the  L.A. Festival and in fact "should enhance . . . his abilities to fund-raise . .  . (through) contacts with people back East." SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

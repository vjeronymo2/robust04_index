The  majority are of the male sex, single, and from the lower and  lower-middle classes. This statement was made by the director of  the local Youth Rehabilitation Center (CIJ), Beatriz Montemayor  Gonzalez.    She added that the conclusion was based on a study made from  1991 to 1993, with a sample of 1,700 patients; stressing that in  70 percent of the cases their schooling did not exceed the basic  intermediate level, and that a high rate of school and work  instability was recorded.    Over 60 percent of the drug addicts in treatment require  daily drug consumption; others, on several days a week; and 40  percent are consuming two or more substances simultaneously.  Montemayor Gonzalez noted that the most frequent combinations  are marijuana with alcohol or inhalants.    She indicated that drug consumption most often begins  between  ages 10 and 19, primarily with marijuana or inhalants. These are  followed by depressants intended for medical use, and the first  experimenting with drug use is generally with school or work  friends or companions. It occurs on public streets, in private  residences, or at educational centers.    Montemayor Gonzalez concluded by remarking that these are  some of the results of an extensive study made by the CIJ with  personnel specializing in the treatment of patients suffering  from drug addiction within the lake region.</p>

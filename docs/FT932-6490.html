			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Sweeping victory for Sharif in Pakistan's parliament PAKISTAN'S newly reinstated prime minister Nawaz Sharif won a sweeping victory in a crucial vote of confidence yesterday after Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader boycotted the emergency session of parliament. Diplomats said the triumph removed lingering doubts about Mr Sharif's parliamentary strength a day after an historic supreme court decision overturned his dismissal by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan last month on charges of nepotism and terrorising his opponents. In all 123 members of the 217-seat lower house of parliament, the national assembly, voted in his favour. The prime minister repeated his call to the opposition to join forces to curtail powers that President Ishaq Khan used to sack both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto. Ms Bhutto, and dissident politicians who left Mr Sharif's camp last month, met to discuss ways of forming a new anti-government alliance. Mr Sharif extended an olive branch to his opponents, saying he was prepared for discussions with anyone to seek new constitutional reforms. His opponents are unlikely to be able to challenge his authority in parliament, but the government could face heated debates and fierce criticisms, senior officials said. The extent to which that could intensify political pressure on Mr Sharif remains unclear but many political observers remain convinced that Mr Sharif's most difficult political challenge could yet come in the form of new conflicts with Pakistan's four provincial governments. The provinces are widely known for their loyalty to Mr Khan. Elsewhere there were signs that business confidence was returning. The Karachi stock exchange, Pakistan's largest stock market, rise by 29 points ysterday, its largest rise on a single day this year.</p>

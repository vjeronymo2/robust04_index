Archbishop Tutu said the attackers, who left four people  dead  and five injured, were "agents of evil...who know they are on  their last lap while the country progresses to freedom and  peace", SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  reported.    The archbishop is a former recipient of the Nobel Peace  Prize.</p>

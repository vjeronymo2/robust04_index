			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Bio losses deepen to Pounds 4.2m BRITISH Bio-technology Group showed pre-tax losses up from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 4.2m in the three months to July 31. Mr Brian Richards, chairman, said that the loss - which led to a net cash outflow of Pounds 4.8m - was 'well within budget'. It was due mainly to greater spending on research and development. In July the company sold British Bio-technology Products, its research reagents business which had a first-quarter turnover of Pounds 1.7m, to concentrate on the 'core pharmaceutical business'. This had a turnover of only Pounds 467,000, since British Bio-technology's drugs are still in the R&amp;D phase and not yet on the market. The company said clinical trials of its first three products - BB-94 for cancer, p24-VLP for Aids, and BB-882 for pancreatitis and sepsis - are going well, with more than 200 patients now taking part. BB-t expects to start clinical development of three more drugs within the next year. One is Stem Cell Protector to reduce the bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapy. The other two are aimed at treating cachexia (a wasting condition associated with advanced cancer) and acute heart disease.</p>

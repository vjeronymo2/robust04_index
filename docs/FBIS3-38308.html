			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lene Froslev from the "News Analysis" column: </F> "The Start of the Election"]    [Text] A single aim seems to lie behind Prime Minister  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's (Social Democratic Party) cabinet  reshuffle yesterday: to hold onto the post of prime minister  after the election which, it is expected, will be called in  September.    The means of achieving this is helping the Center Democrats  over the 2-percent representation threshold, and to this end,  the small nonsocialist party needs a higher profile and a  platform from which its policy statements can be delivered.    This is the platform Mimi Jakobsen has been given in the  form  of the heavyweight Industry and Social Affairs Ministries.    The party's fortune, however, has not automatically been  made  with new posts and new people. The ministries will have to be  run aggressively and professionally -- and more, if the new  ministerial titles are to prove a bonus on election day.    The idea is that it will be possible to see the Center  Democrats' fingerprints on government policy in two of the  party's key areas, industry and social policy. This is not  something that will necessarily be straightforward, for there  will be no more major packages of legislation in these fields in  what remains of the life of this government.    Mimi Jakobsen will now coordinate her own Industry Ministry  -- not a ministry that attracts much popular interest. On the  contrary, it is very technical and weighed down by legislation,  and many EU [European Union] commitments are linked to it.    It is true that the CD leader inspires feelings of security  and confidence among the larger industrial and commercial  organizations that have also declared their satisfaction with  the step toward a real superministry for industry.    Mimi Jakobsen, however, will be unable to satisfy the desire  for the removal of the many subsidy arrangments which Danish  industry views as a distortion of competition.    Bente Juncker takes over an onerous Social Affairs Ministry  where her predecessor had slowly succeeded in becoming well  liked among the broader general public. The problem for Juncker  is that her direct and temperamental character could work  against her.    Also, in the coming months there will be no major  initiatives  in the field of social policy.    Initially, she will have to make do with making public her  predecessor's action plan for children.    On the other hand, the Center Democrats have gotten rid of  the troublesome government critic that Juncker has up to now  appeared to be. This in itself could mean greater calm and less  disturbance in the publicity the party receives.    A.O. Andersen -- who is highly respected inside the  government -- will try to bring life to the unsuccessful  Research Ministry, whose outgoing minister, Svend Bergstein, has  been unable to put forward a single draft law in the past year.  At the same time A.O. Andersen will look after his  Ecclesiastical Affairs Ministry, and he has therefore been  called the "minister for faith and science" at Christiansborg.    It is the Research Ministry that is to raise A.O.'s profile,  but this could prove difficult because Bergstein failed to win  any power from other ministries in the past year.    It is Nyrup Rasmussen, together with Mimi Jakobsen and  Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft, who is behind the reshuffle.  The reshuffle has been in the works since before Christmas but  has been slowed down by Helge Mortensen's illness due to heart  problems.    The uncertainty whether Mortensen would be able to come back  to work has persisted right up to the government's first  birthday, and as a result the ministers who have been fired have  succeeded in qualifying for compensation during a period of  unemployment and a lifelong pension of 57,000 kroner per year.    The fact that the cabinet reshuffle happened on 28 January  was closely linked to Svend Bergstein's criticism of the  government in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on Thursday [27 January]. The  reshuffle was originally to have taken place in a few days'  time, but Bergstein's demonstration of his lack of political  awareness accelerated his dismissal.    There was to be a demonstration of dynamism, and the  criticism of Nyrup's hesitation over unpleasant decisions was  to be rebuffed.    And dynamism was a key word for Mimi Jakobsen when the new  ministers were presented.    "We find ourselves in a place where it hurts," she said,  referring to the sacrifices, for the Social Democratic Party in  particular, that were necessary to bring about a total reshuffle.    Karen Jespersen has been fired -- quite unreasonably, it is  being said -- so that the Center-Democrats can take over the  field of social policy.    This could lead to problems with the Social Democrats'  grassroots that are traditionally identified with social policy.    While, at the same time, her successor, Bent Juncker, is not  very well liked among ordinary Social Democrats.    Karen Jespersen was applauded into the party Folketing group  on Friday morning, and she can expect to become a minister again  in Nyrup's second government after the election.    Until then she, probably together with Pia Gjellerup, will  act as the party's media strategist in the period up to the  election later in the year.    Arne Melchior is the victim, because he is too pale and  "amoeba-like" a figure.    He is angry, and this could give rise to undesirable  disturbances when he returns to the ranks of ordinary Folketing  deputies.    From the very beginning Svend Bergstein was a bad choice by  Mimi Jakobsen. He accelerated his own dismissal by his remarks  to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE.    The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen has chosen to cut the number  of  ministers only by two, and not the number of ministries --  something he had indicated in an interview with BORSEN last week  -- also has to do with regard for the Center Democrats.    Mimi Jakobsen continues to take the view that the Research  Ministry, the Tourism Ministry, and the Industry Ministry are  future-oriented and must therefore be retained. She has the  strong backing today of Social Democrat Ritt Bjerregaard.    As a result of the reshuffle, Helge Mortensen has been given  a less demanding post at the less burdensome Tourism Ministry.    Jan Trojborg, who is considered to be a rising political  star, will take a shot at the politically demanding Transport  Ministry.    The reshuffle is the Center Democrats' chance to entice  voters back into the fold. The problem is simply that the  party's unfaithful voters have been unwilling to accept being  part of or supporting a Social Democrat-led government. As many  reshuffles as you like will not solve that problem.</p>

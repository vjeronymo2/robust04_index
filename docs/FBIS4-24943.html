			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Feng (0205 7364): "A Serious Incident in </F> Inner Mongolia--4,000 Cadres Create a Disturbance"]    [Text] On 30 April, Li Peng stopped over in Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Region for four days after returning home from his  visit to Central Asia in order to handle an incident--cadres  from 31 departments and commissions of the autonomous regional  government planned to travel by train to Beijing on 3 May to  present a petition.    The incident began in early April. Cadres of the party  committees of the institutions directly subordinate to the  regional government, the civil affairs department, the  transportation department, and the cultural department of the  regional government jointly signed a petition which demanded:  1) immediate measures to curb inflation; 2) a stop to  purchasing cars and distributing luxurious houses; 3) immediate  increases in allowances to grass-roots cadres and retired cadres  in order to guarantee their living standards; 4) making public  the investigation and handling of the corrupt officials and  abusers of power in the party and government leading bodies of  the autonomous region in order to redress the grievances of the  general public. The regional party committee and the regional  government held nine rounds of talks with the representatives of  the cadres, but the talks achieved no result. On 26 April, the  regional government issued a three-point statement: 1) The  petitioning cadres and workers were instigated by some evildoers  among their representatives to challenge the authority of the  party committee and the regional government. 2) Some people  with ulterior motives were trying to create a disturbance in  order to disrupt the party's central work and harm social  stability and unity. 3) The autonomous regional government  would take necessary administrative measures to deal with the  incident, and might take legal action if necessary.    On 27 April, the representatives of cadres and workers from  a  number of regional departments met with some leaders of the  regional government. Then, the general office of the regional  government issued an ultimatum, demanding that all personnel  immediately return to their work posts in various departments  and fulfill their own duties; otherwise, disciplinary action  would be taken against them. On 28 April, cadres in 23  departments and commissions resisted the order by means of  asking for sick leave and making business trips to other places.  Nearly 800 cadres participated in the petition action in the  form of a go-slow. Then, cadres in the governments of Baotou  City, Jining City, and Hailar City also became involved in the  action. The CPC Central Secretariat and the State Council sent  Wei Jianxing and Luo Gan to handle the incident in Hohhot on  behalf of the central authorities. In view of the seriousness  of the incident, the central authorities and the regional  authorities organized 15 work teams to go to various regional  departments, Baotou City, Jining City, and Hailar City.    On the evening of 30 April, Li Peng attended a meeting of  party and government cadres in the autonomous region, and gave a  five-point instruction:    1. The members of the standing committee of the regional  party committee, the members of the regional party committee,  and the responsible officials of the regional government should  go down deeply into various localities and departments to solve  the urgent problems without delay and explain the government's  measures. They must overcome the bureaucratic style of work and  should not coerce their subordinates into submission.    2. It is necessary to increase communications between the  upper authorities and subordinates, between various party and  government institutions, and between cadres and the masses in  order to create a relaxed and harmonious atmosphere that is  beneficial to the party's central work and to the consolidation  and development of the stable political situation and social  environment.    3. It is necessary to rectify the party organizations in  order to bring their leading and exemplary role into better play  and to arouse their initiative in fully implementing the party's  policies and measures.    4. It is necessary to care about the working, living, and  welfare conditions of cadres. Leading officials and leading  bodies must not become privileged, and they should always  subject themselves to supervision by the discipline inspection  commission, the supervision department, and the people's  congress at the same level. They must not retaliate against  other people who criticize them. Subordinates and the masses  have the right to make complaints, file appeals, lodge  petitions, and propose the dismissal of incompetent leaders.    5. Resolute action should be taken to ban and crack down on  illegal underground organizations and hostile organizations  supported by external forces.    On 2 and 3 May, Li Peng met with cadres and mass  representatives from some regional departments. The cadres  demanded that the leading bodies of the regional party committee  and the regional government be reorganized, and the secretary of  the regional party committee be dismissed from office.    Reportedly, the central authorities instructed the regional  authorities of Inner Mongolia to mitigate their contradictions  with the departmental cadres in order to prevent the  infiltration of external hostile forces.    The incident was characterized by the involvement of cadres  in various party and government departments at the regional and  city levels, and such institutions involved in the incident  numbered more than 120. Over 4,000 cadres participated in the  petitioning action, more than 3,700 of them being CPC members,  including some departmental chiefs. This was the first event of  this nature since the CPC regime was set up.    This was also the first protest action to take place in the  "backyard" of a provincial government. There was a certain  degree of inevitability. The July issue of TUNG HSIANG [TRENDS]  in 1992 carried a report about the undercurrents in Inner  Mongolia. If CPC rule is a combination of Stalin-style fascist  dictatorship and traditional feudal autocracy, then its rule in  Inner Mongolia bears a stronger color of Oriental feudal  autocracy. In the past, Inner Mongolia was always ruled by a  number of feudal lords, and the Mongolian people never ceased  their resistance against the rule of the feudal lords. In the  1920's, Mongolian hero Gadameilin led a popular uprising, and  his deeds were always on everybody's lips in Inner Mongolia.  Uranfu, the representative of CPC rule in Inner Mongolia, was  in fact the greatest feudal lord in the territory; and the  people there called him a "fiend in human form." He led an  extravagant and dissipated life, like Kim Il-song in North  Korea. In Inner Mongolia, Uranfu also pursued the hereditary  system. In the 1950's, he appointed his son, Buhe, director of  the regional cultural department and appointed his  daughter-in-law, Zhulan Qiqi, who played the main part in a film  in the 1950's, leader of the broadcast, television, and film  department. The young lord Buhe long since succeeded his father  as the supreme feudal ruler in Inner Mongolia (he was once  concurrently secretary of the regional party committee and  chairman of the regional government). The privileges he enjoyed  in Inner Mongolia were greater than those of principal leaders  in any other province. He was greedier and more cruel than any  lord in history, and was an out-and-out local tyrant. Of the  four demands of the petitioners, two were related to their  economic interests (curbing inflation and increasing  allowances), and the other two were aimed at the privileges of  local leaders. The targets of the struggle were quite similar  to those of the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.  For example, the petitioners called for stopping the purchase  of cars and the distribution of luxurious houses, and  investigating and punishing corrupt officials and power abusers.  In particular, as the petitioners included a number of  department chiefs, their struggle was obvious spearheaded  against leaders at the higher level. They even required Li Peng  to reorganize the leading bodies of the regional party committee  and the regional government and to dismiss the secretary of the  regional party committee. This showed that the flames of fury  among the people in Inner Mongolia, like their ancestors led by  Gadameilin, have been burning up to the heads of local tyrant  Buhe and his clan.</p>

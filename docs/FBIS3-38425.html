			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent Chris Parkin, from </F> Dublin]    [Text] Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams tonight moved closer to  spelling out just what clarification he wants from Britain on  the Anglo-Irish peace declaration ahead of an IRA response.    Mr Adams, continuing his high-profile first visit to the US  in 20 years, listed three points connected with the December  document signed by Mr Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert  Reynolds which he said needed further explanation.    He told an influential New York audience these were:     -  Aspects of the declaration itself;    -  Contradictory  statements about it made by the two premiers;    -  The issue of  processes, measures and steps envisaged by the declaration.    He spoke out as the US administration sent what may well be  a  signal to him, by calling on all parties to the Northern Ireland  conflict to embrace the Downing Street peace declaration.    The US statement, speaking of an "historic opportunity" to  end the violence, was released after Vice President Al Gore met  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Washington.    Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, listed his demands during  an address to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy,  the high point of his 48-hour stay.    He told an audience of 300 in New York's Waldorf-Astoria  hotel -- venue for the Committee's conference on Northern  Ireland -- that the US could make a "significant and positive"  role to achieving peace.    But he accused the British Government of stalling by  refusing  to clarify the December 15 peace declaration.    But his statement brought a strong retort from Mr Major.    In the Commons, the Prime Minister accused Sinn Fein of  "prevarications" and "evasions" about the ending of violence.    Mr Major said: "There has been no commitment by Mr Adams or  the Provisional movement to end violence for good.    "That is the commitment that this House and everybody in  this  country and Ireland is waiting to hear."    Mr Adams was on day two of his visit, authorised by  President  Clinton against the wishes of the Major Government. He has  conducted a series of coast-to-coast TV interviews amid huge  press interest, as well as meetings with top American  politicians.    He told his audience that Irish republicans had to decide  whether the Anglo-Irish document was a first step for the  British Government in the direction of lasting peace, or merely  a political response by a government under pressure, aimed at  avoiding a political confrontation with Dublin.    He said: "The Joint Declaration is described by its authors  as `the first step' towards a peace settlement.    "Sinn Fein is committed to such a settlement and I am  concerned -- I am indeed anxious -- to be persuaded that the  Downing Street declaration can provide the basis for this.    "And even if this is not the case -- if there is a gap  between what it required and what is on offer -- then we should  all move to bridge that gap."    Mr Adams said the exercise of the right of Irish  self-determination required a change in British policy and the  removal of the veto on change in Northern Ireland held by the  majority Unionist community.    He acknowledged the democratic rights of the Unionists, but  claimed they would be upheld in an independent Ireland.    "The argument that the consent of a national minority,  elevated into a majority within an undemocratic  artifically-created state, is necessary before a constitutional  change can occur is a nonsense," he said.    Mr Adams also claimed that the Downing Street declaration  was  a response to proposals made after a series of talks he had with  Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume  last year.    He said it would be judged on whether it advanced the peace  process or just a "cosmetic response" to that peace initiative.    There was a degree of suspicion and scepticism among  nationalists and republicans regarding the real motives and  intentions of the British Government.    He did not mention whether the IRA would declare a  ceasefire,  Britain's precondition for Sinn Fein's participation in peace  talks.    Awaiting him back in Belfast was a letter he requested from  Mr Reynolds clarifying the declaration from the Irish  government's point of view.    He added that the British government's refusal to "provide  clarification for Sinn Fein must be a matter of deep concern to  everyone interested in peace."    "In contrast...it is clear that for the first time a Dublin  government is making a serious attempt to address the issue of  peace and a political settlement in the north of Ireland," he  said.    "I wish to commend Albert Reynolds. He has taken a postive  and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification.    "The potential for peace in Ireland has never been more  realisable."    And he made clear that Americans and the Clinton  administration could be actively involved in the peace process  and bring pressure to bear on Britain to break the deadlock.    "Progressive opinion in the U.S.A. can assist in the  development of a peace process in Ireland. The U.S. government  can play a significant and positive role in encouraging the  process by helping to create a climate that moves the situation  on," he said.    He said the U.S. government could achieve that goal in two  ways -- by facilitating the free exchange of information and,  obviously referring to Britain, "actively seeking to encourage  dialogue and agreement."    Mr Adams added: "It is clear that the British government  have  used all their influence, as in the past, to impede any progress  on this or in any other matter which could influence or inform  perceptions about the current situation in Ireland and the  British government's responsibility for the present intolerable  standoff."    He again praised President Clinton for permitting his visa  to  enter the U.S., and drew a parallel between the situation in  Northern Ireland and current political moves in South Africa and  the Middle East.    The lessons from those two areas were clear -- and "the  conflict in Ireland is no different."    Mr Adams was the third of three Ulster political leaders to  speak at the conference, behind the middle-of-the-road Alliance  Party chief Dr John Alderdice and Mr Hume.    Absent, though, were Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist  Party boss the Rev Ian Paisley and Ulster Unionist leader James  Molyneaux.    Both stayed away in protest at the involvement of Sinn Fein  and to underline their distaste at Mr Adams finally getting his  visa.    The US statement released by the White House said Mr Gore,  in  his meeting with Mr Hurd, "underscored our admiration for the  courage and vision of Prime Ministers Major and Reynolds in  putting forward a new framework for peace in Northern Ireland."    "He (Gore) reiterated our conviction that the December 15  Joint Declaration of the two governments provides an historic  opportunity to end the tragic violence," the statement said.    "It provides a process by which all parties who eschew  violence -- in deeds as well as words -- can participate in  building a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland," it read.    Mr Gore also emphasised "the importance the U.S. attaches to  close cooperation with our British ally on a range of global  issues," the statement added.    British officials, although reportedly unhappy with the  decision to reverse the 20-year policy and allow Mr Adams into  the U.S., have not criticised Washington publicly.    In London, Mr Major declared that the peace initiative  "leaves no conceivable excuse for violence."    "And all the words, all the prevarications, all the evasions  of Sinn Fein will be utterly and completely hollow until they  end violence."    Mr Adams was being subjected to only low-key security.  Volunteer members of the New York police pipe ban were assigned  to protect him "in a discreet way," according to security  sources.</p>

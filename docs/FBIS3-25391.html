The meeting  apparently satisfied both sides. The Niger minister of foreign  affairs welcomed the fact that the desired dialogue was becoming  a reality. As for the chairman of the Coordination of the Armed  Resistance, he said he was glad that the problem is beginning to  find a solution on African soil. In fact, the discussion in  Ouagadougou will center on one word: autonomy. Mano Dayak,  chairman of the Tuareg Coordination, is very keen on this word.  He spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier:    [Begin recording] [Dayak] We are ready to negotiate, taking  as a starting point a document envisaging political and economic  autonomy for the Tuareg regions--a program we consider to be  good for the whole of Niger. If it is rejected by the Niger  Government and other communities, however, we will demand  autonomy and discuss it for our regions in the north of the  country.    [Boisbouvier] You are talking about autonomy, and no longer  of federalism?    [Dayak] Unfortunately, the word federalism frightens people  in Niger and in Africa. If federalism frightens people, what we  are interested in is the content. The word does not interest  us, so we can also talk of regional autonomy, where our  communities can manage themselves economically and politically.  [end recording]    The government side appears to prefer the term  decentralization. Niger Foreign Affairs Minister Adbourahamane  Hama also spoke to Christophe Boisbouvier:    [Begin recording] [Hama] One of the political lines that the  Constitution imposes on our government is that decentralization  and devolution -- in other words, the taking over by peoples and  regions of their own administration, development, and future --  should be effective and real.    [Boisbouvier] So you are ready to discuss autonomy?    [Hama] We are not talking about autonomy. You asked me  whether we were willing to have the regions of Niger and the  people of Niger administering themselves. That is what we are  doing at the moment. We want to push this experiment forward and  give it its full and real sense. [end recording]    The negotiations will deal today with the number of  mediating  countries, and also on the timetable and location of future  political negotiations. Let me remind you that since November  1991 the Tuareg question has officially left some 100 people  dead.</p>

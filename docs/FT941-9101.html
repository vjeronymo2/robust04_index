			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Institutions pay FFr403 a share for Elf Institutional investors in the privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the large majority of which are European, will pay FFr403 (Dollars 68.3m) a share in the oil group, according to the French economy ministry. The price, determined through a process of book-building, is largely in line with market expectations. It compares with FFr385 for the public issue and yesterday's closing price of FFr424. As with the public issue, which was three times subscribed, the tranche allocated to institutional investors received strong demand, according to Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister. However, the imposition of a clawback option meant that the 27m Elf shares originally allocated to institutional investors were reduced by 20 per cent. Of the institutional tranche, about 26 per cent of the shares will go to French groups and 45 per cent will go to other European investors. US institutions will receive about 22 per cent of the shares. Combining the institutional and the public offer, about 73 per cent of Elf's shares sold on the market will be in French hands. The total proceeds to the state, including the market issues, the sale of shares to a group of long-term stable investors and the tranche for Elf employees, is expected to bring receipts of about FFr35bn. Mr Alphandery said the smooth sale of most of its 51 per cent stake in Elf, which is due to be followed by the sale of Union des Assurances de Paris, put the government well on course to achieve its target of FFr55bn from privatisation receipts this year. With the exercise of the clawback option, individual investors will receive a total of 38.6m shares, although most will be still be alloted fewer than they ordered. Applicants for between 10 and 30 shares will receive the first 10 shares ordered and some extra shares in line with the amount requested.</p>

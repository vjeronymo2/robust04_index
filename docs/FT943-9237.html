			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: The Rake's Progress - Salzburg Festival It is a measure of Salzburg's underlying conservatism that, despite three years of Gerard Mortier's modernising influence, festival patrons still regard Stravinsky with caution. Caution not being part of Mortier's vocabulary, he has programmed three Stravinsky stagings this summer. The gamble seems to have paid off. After slow advance sales, The Rake's Progress at the Kleines Festspielhaus became a hot ticket, while a street-theatre production of The Soldier's Tale caught the imagination of Salzburg's tourist hordes. The most ambitious of the three is being kept till the final week - a Peter Sellars-Kent Nagano production of Oedipus Rex and Symphony of Psalms, with designs by an avant-garde firm of architects. These are worthy festival projects, but it is odd that Mortier should totally ignore Stravinsky's biggest contribution to musical theatre - his ballets. Mortier clearly relished the opportunity to juxtapose The Rake's Progress and Don Giovanni - two dissolutes who flaunt moral conventions and are duly punished. The other point in common, of course, is a standard 18th century orchestra. But there the similarities end, and it would be hard to imagine two more contrasting production styles than the Chereau-Barenboim Don Giovanni (which I reviewed last Saturday) and the new Rake. Not for the first time, Mortier placed his trust in a visual artist with little experience of the theatre - someone who, he hoped, could transplant to our own times the operatic characters drawn from Hogarth's pictures. Jorg Immendorff responded by identifying Tom Rakewell with his own fate as an artist - prey to ideals and idle dreams, lust and consumption, devilish pacts and their inescapable consequences. The result was an entertaining exercise in artistic licence, colourful but often unrecognisable. The stage resembled a painter's atelier, with Anne posing as a model. Tom was dressed in T-shirt and jeans, while Trulove was a Joseph Beuys lookalike (the controversial postwar German artist was Immendorff's hero). Tom's flights of fantasy were symbolised by a model aeroplane, with wings like an artist's palette. His progress was followed by apes (the human beast), who acted as stagehands and became the inmates of bedlam. Modernist and Hogarthian paintings appeared in miniature on the back wall, and the auctioneer wielded not a gavel but a sledgehammer, with which he politely smashed everything on view. Thanks to a succession of pictorial dropcloths and clear stage direction by Peter Mussbach, the story - and many of its comic and ironic touches - did not get entirely lost. But the moral was wasted. It was hard to identify with characters who inhabited such a two-dimensional stage and looked the same from start to finish. There was an air of artificiality, which rubbed off on the music and led to bouts of tedium. In most other respects, the performance was exemplary. Under Sylvain Cambreling, the Camerata Academica was alert to Stravinsky's rhythmic wit, relishing all the harmonic twists and tricks. Jerry Hadley made a fresh-voiced, fresh-faced Tom. Despite her garish blonde wig, Sylvia McNair's Anne was purity personified. Monte Pederson's Nick Shadow had the body of a wrestler wrapped in a business suit, but would have benefitted from sharper characterisation. Grace Bumbry was a subdued Baba, Linda Ormiston the deliciously predatory brothel-keeper. The audience response was ecstatic.</p>

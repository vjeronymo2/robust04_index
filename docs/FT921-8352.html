			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (6): Still cracking problems - Tyne and Wear Development Corporation THE past few months have been trying times for the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation: it had just published an attractive annual report last September when Tyneside's riots made the document look like self-congratulatory hyperbole. Worse, by congratulating itself in the report for its community relations, the corporation appeared to be out of touch with reality. Advertising and promotional campaigns went into red-faced retreat while the corporation's directors and officers took stock. Any reappraisal, however, has been more about style than substance. The corporation, which spends Pounds 50m a year as the government's main agency for regenerating the Tyne and Wear economy, decided even as the riots raged that it was not going to change tack. It believed then, as now, that its policies had not failed and were already being vindicated. 'Riots would only represent a failure of policy if they happened in 10 years' time,' says Mr Alastair Balls, the chief executive. 'Most people's perception is that last September's disturbances were a seven-day wonder. There is no reason to believe they will be repeated. They were the work of a tiny minority and were mainly criminal in nature. People are very angry about them. Action has now been taken by police and the local communities to ensure they do not repeat themselves.' Moreover, he sticks by the claim in the annual report that the corporation has 'cracked the problem' of reconciling investor demand to local community aspirations. He says this means that the mechanism to crack the problem is in place, rather than the problems solved. The mechanism revolves around community consultation and involvement in developments. Relationships are sometimes fragile and hampered by lack of community centres or obvious leaders to offset the power of 'community gangs' but Mr Balls says there is no other way forward than to build on whatever legitimate points of focus can be found, such as local schools. What seems different now, however, is that the social problems are being confronted more openly. Before the riots they were acknowledged but played down so that investors would not be scared off. The resultant 'talking up' of the area led critics to accuse the corporation of obscuring crucial issues with hype. Although this rankled with some of its senior figures - 'Marxist propaganda' was one retort - the riots have forced issues more into the open. 'There are social problems and this cannot be gainsaid,' Mr Balls acknowledges. The result is that the corporation now appears to be arguing its case rather than merely promoting it. Indeed, the riots have been a stern test of argument - and judged against other attempts at economic development in Britain and in the US, Tyne and Wear's argument is a strong one. The corporation is now five years old and half way through its planned life. It has adopted a 'string of pearls' approach to regeneration, reclaiming more than 10 miles of separated, derelict waterside sites along the Tyne for a business park, industrial areas and housing and leisure developments. As with similar agencies in other British conurbations, it is its own planning authority and can enforce land assembly through compulsory purchase. This has been crucial on Tyneside because development has long been stymied by fragmented ownership of many miles of river bank. Newcastle Business Park, where the corporation now has its own offices, proves the point: there was a single landowner so it started filling up as soon as the corporation had serviced it. Similarly, a few miles down river, St Peter's Basin, an imaginative housing and harbour development, was also completed rapidly. These projects have testified to the corporation's competence - it even rescued the hotel after Rush &amp; Tompkins, its builder, had gone bust - but Mr Balls says developers need more than that. 'The one thing that gives the corporation clout is confidence among the private sector that land really will be assembled. Nearly every major site we have was in fragmented ownership. Unless people believe you can get it together, they won't take an interest,' he says. Completion of a fifth compulsory purchase public inquiry has therefore been yet more evidence of earnestness. But perhaps more important was a long struggle through the courts to beat off objections from Procter and Gamble to the corporation's plans for East Quayside, which will help Newcastle exploit the waterfront better. The corporation spent about Pounds 300,000 to win. Mr Balls says it had to be: losing would have frustrated land assembly and dented investor confidence. By contrast, he says, the riots failed to make any real impact on confidence at all, indicating the private sector's real priorities. 'We have 15 projects under way with developers building,' Mr Balls says. 'In our view that is quite unusual in a recession and contrasts considerably with elsewhere. The question is whether the area's economy is capable of sustaining the developments so that there won't be an oversupply. 'We have been careful to try and ensure that the type of property we are bringing to the market has been wanted. There is still a strong market for top quality office accommodation in Newcastle. As long as we feed the market at the right rate, we should fill it. This is about 150,000-250,000 sq ft a year at present.' The corporation also has what it hopes will be a science park approaching completion - 150,000 sq ft of modern space in the middle of Newcastle. Meanwhile, in Sunderland, the corporation owns two of the three sites comprising the new enterprise zone and is building speculatively at a rate of 75,000 sq ft a year to bring a measured volume to the market. Since the sites are only half a mile from Nissan's factory, no one believes there is much risk in building before end-users have been found. Another high-profile Wearside project is a new campus for the polytechnic, which will eventually transform itself into the University of Sunderland, with close links to Nissan. Hanging over this considerable progress, however, is the uncomfortable problem of nearly every Tyneside site being hemmed against the river by run-down or deprived neighbourhoods, sharpening the contrast being the haves and the have-nots. The riots may have been inspired by criminals, but they could not have taken hold without genuine local grievances to fan the flames. Typical unemployment rates are between 30 and 50 per cent and Mr Balls acknowledges there will be serious consequences for the corporation if opportunities do not materialise for local people. Ominously, only a handful of about 800 jobs in Newcastle Business Park have so far gone to local people. Mr Balls says that this is partly because some of the incoming companies were relocating with their entire workforces. Nevertheless, with just one exception, local people have only been able to get menial jobs with one of the park's newcomers, despite a number of well-paid white collar jobs with prospects being available. Several hundred people were interviewed but only one showed enough potential to be taken on. The scale of the problem is often not low levels of local skill, but none at all. The corporation is paying for 'pre-recruitment training' to teach people how to fill in forms, improve literacy and numeracy, and coach them in how to dress and behave at interviews. Attitude training is also proving important, to teach the importance of punctuality and turning up for work regularly. Some incoming companies have said they can cope with job training themselves - provided attitudes to work are right in the first place. If they are not, Mr Balls can rightly argue this is not the corporation's fault but that of a wider society which has tolerated such levels of inner city decline in the past and the concomitant growth of an underclass. Addressing the problem now, however, is clearly going to hinge on the corporation's community policies working. The riots could not have made that clearer.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Odd couple comes home - Lynn MacRitchie explains what Gilbert &amp; George are all about THE Cosmological Pictures, a series of 25 works made by Gilbert and George in 1989, are finally installed at the Tate Liverpool after a tour of 10 European countries including Poland and Hungary. They arrived at the Albert Dock just as a show of the artists' newest works, the New Democratic Pictures, was coming to a close at Anthony D'Offay in London. For their admirers, then, the past few months and those to come provide a welcome chance to catch up with the latest works of these remarkable artists. For their detractors, this feast is an indigestible reminder of just how celebrated they are abroad, while continuing to arouse controversy at home. The London show was criticised by many and for many reasons - the artists' nudity, a feature of many of the works, was declared to be embarrassing, that of their young male models exploitative, their subject matter at the same time both shocking and stale. Let us examine the case. Gilbert and George's work deals with themselves. They are both its subject and its content, appearing in almost all of the highly coloured, large scale photopieces which have been their established style for over a decade. In the mid-1970s, when the photopiece form was first being developed, they were their only subjects. They recorded their activities (heavy drinking, mostly) or, alone in their empty house, their feelings and moods. Then, gradually their eyes moved outwards. Street scenes and passers-by began to appear, the locations around their home in Spitalfields. The streets are grimy and litter strewn, the people who walk them poor and seeming sad, the towers of the City rearing over them, close by but detached. The walls speak. Graffiti gives the works their titles: 'Are you angry or are you boring' or 'Communism', for example, as well as, and tellingly, 'Bent, 'Queer,' or 'Prostitute Poof'. For Gilbert and George are homosexual, familiar with that public fear of 'otherness' the hostile scribblers express. But they are fearless. In their early days in Spitalfields, living in the basement of the house they now own, they tell of stones flying through the window, of being chased down the street, running for shelter in their 'responsibility suits', the fabled matching three button suits they have worn since the days when they first declared their mission in life. Law 2 of 'The Laws of the Sculptors', written in 1969, states 'Make the world believe in you and pay heavily for this privilege.' This dedication to their art goes along with a declared aim of making it as clear and understandable as possible. Thus they have forged a style like no one else's, a style which blends their own intense preoccupations - themselves, their immediate surroundings, the bodies of beautiful young men  -with a few props - jewel-like colour, the use of flowers, trees and statuary - into an emblematic language of rare power. The Cosmological Pictures show the same canny knack of summing up the state of our current everyday world while evoking the artists' place both as part of and commentators on it. 'Edger' shows a young man in profile and full face superimposed over a busy city street. While he is perfectly ordinary, tough-looking in his T shirt and jeans, his placing in the composition and its title make us think about him again, about his place in the world, as marginal, as threatened, perhaps, as well as threatening. Works such as 'My World' or 'All' showing young men in compositions with flowers, make very clear the nature of the artists' sexual feelings while presenting them in a symbolic and romantic way. 'Blood Heads' and 'Down to Earth' make clear too some of the dangerous consequences of the fulfilment of desire, while 'Big Hole' with its central image of a flowering tree, offers if not hope then perhaps consolation. None of these is perhaps quite as powerful as a key piece of 1982, 'Life Without End', an astonishing presentation of an ideal world of beauty and order which does not exist but for which we all long. That it is evoked via the persons of two men in neat suits and an array of beautiful boys should not necessarily shock. Caravaggio's models were rent boys, after all, and an artist's repetition of a favourite subject is not usually a cause for complaint. No one questions the transcendence of Matisse's endless interiors or Picasso's tortured nudes. Artists, by their obsessive grappling with a chosen subject, make it matter for us, too, make it universal. By showing us their world, their strange self-defined and intense universe, Gilbert and George show us something of ourselves. In September, their work will be seen in Beijing. What, I asked, did the Chinese make of it? For the Chinese, they told me, their work is about being an individual, discovering what an individual is. This response Gilbert and George find both satisfying and exciting. 'To enter that debate is vital while we are still alive.' Indeed it is, and for us all.

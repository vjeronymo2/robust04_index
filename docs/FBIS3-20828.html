We did not want to participate  in it, and especially we did not want to take part in putting  pressure on the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian  Krajina to accept the ultimatum and renounce the fulfillment of  their goals," Seselj stressed.    Speaking about the Program of Monetary Reform, Seselj  stressed that he did not believe it would be possible to  implement it in the way it is being done now. "I believe that  the monetary reform will not survive beyond the harvest," SRS  leader said.    During his presentation, someone interrupted Vojislav Seselj  several times. After two casual warnings, Seselj threatened the  unknown person with the following words: "Calm down or get out,  otherwise I will personally come to throw you out of the room."  The person was not heard again.</p>

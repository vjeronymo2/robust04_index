			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Oslo bourse president sacked Mr Erik Jarve, the president of the Oslo stock exchange, was yesterday dismissed by the board because of irregularities connected to his work. The move took the market by surprise but was not announced until after trading had closed. The bourse said Mr Jarve's irregularities had nothing to do with securities transactions or with the bourse's function in the securities market. Mr Kjell Froensdal, executive vice-president of the bourse, has been appointed interim president until a replacement for Mr Jarve can be named. He said yesterday the board had only in the past few days uncovered the irregularities connected to Mr Jarve and hinted they had to do with Mr Jarve mixing his own business with that of the bourse. KPMG Peat Marwick, the auditor, has been engaged by the bourse to undertake a thorough review of the allegations, but Mr Froensdal could not say if the matter would be referred to Norwegian police for investigation. Mr Jarve joined the Oslo bourse 26 years ago and was appointed president in 1977. He sought to end the bourse's reputation for insider trading and was also instrumental in modernising the exchange's rules, regulations and technical functions to bring it up to the latest European standards. Foreign investors have long complained of the risks associated with investing in Norwegian securities because of an alleged high rate of insider trading cases in a small business community with many cross-board representations and cross-shareholdings.</p>

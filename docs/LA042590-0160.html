			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> INCIDENT NO THREAT TO JUDGE  </P> <P> A window shattered in a car carrying a U.S. appeals judge under federal  protection today, but officials said it apparently was caused by a freak  accident and not a gunman.  </P> <P> Local police had earlier reported a drive-by gunman shot the judge's window out  about 9:50 a.m., triggering a search for the supposed assailant by state and  local police.  </P> <P> Stephen Boyle, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Washington, said  reports by Gwinnett County police that U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge  J. L. Edmondson was shot at were inaccurate and a "gross distortion" of the  facts.  </P> <P> Boyle said federal investigators at the scene now believe the window in  Edmondson's car simply shattered.  </P></p>

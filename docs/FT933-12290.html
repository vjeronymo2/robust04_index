			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: In the cave of the cannibal kingdom STANDING in a Scottish cannibal's cave with a single lighted match was an unnerving experience in itself. Discovering my own name scrawled on the rock was a surreal surprise. Just graffiti, or the menu? Five hundred years earlier the king's men had stood on the same spot, drawn there by the gruesome flotsam washed up on the coast at nearby Ballantrae. A mile inside the cliff they found Sawney Bean and his charming family. While the legend of Sawney Bean may still be popular in Scotland, finding the cave is more difficult. Sawney Bean's Cave is a tourist attraction in the same way that Irish pixies are: nothing on the map, no paths and no refreshments. We set out by car from Stranraer along the A77 coast road with the knowledge, culled from collective local memory, that the cave was 'somewhere near Ballantrae'. In the village a Scottish mist had drenched the castle and driven everyone indoors. At the shop, the woman behind the counter knew what we had to do. For those who wish to follow, this is what she said. Drive north on the A77 until the road rises to clear Bennane Head. At the top there is a small car park on the left. Park here, climb through the barbed wire (where everyone else has) and follow the path northwards for 50 yards. Be careful: the tourist board describes the descent as 'treacherous'. At this point, a giddy few hundred feet below you, will appear a beach of grey stone. The path drops with sickening speed down to the left and towards the beach. At the bottom a lorry rusts on the beach. When you reach the sea turn right and skirt a large rock. Just beyond this is a narrow cleft leading to the entrance to a cave partly blocked by a boulder. This was the home of Sawney Bean. On the day we went there was a tremendous sea blowing and the rain ran in a black flood down the cliffs. Standing on the beach, and looking up, it is easy to see how no one ever escaped. And no one ever did. For 25 years in the early 15th century Sawney Bean, the son of an east Lothian hedger and ditcher, lived in the cave with an ever expanding family. By the time the king's men arrived, the grandchildren (incestuous offspring of Sawney's own) had enlarged the family to 48: a lot of mouths to feed. The family ranged widely across the countryside, preying on lonely travellers and dragging them back to Bennane Head. By the time King James I arrived at Bennane Head, the number of victims that had made the one-way journey down the path had (allegedly) exceeded 1,000. When the king's men entered Sawney's cave, they found a 'ghastly, gibbet-like larder of human limbs and parts hung drying on the cords and ropes; and pickled in barrels of brine against the walls were the inner organs, hands and feet, and still more human flesh . . . ' The family was led, chained in single file, to Edinburgh and imprisoned in the Tolbooth. A trial was considered unnecessary. The men were dismembered in public, while the women were forced to watch. Then they were burnt at the stake. The journey to their little home is worth the trouble. Standing on the beach gives you a rare opportunity to imagine what it is like to be lunch.</p>

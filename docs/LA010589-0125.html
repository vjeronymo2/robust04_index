			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Staffers from two European television stations in unrelated incidents attempted  to put fake bombs aboard scheduled airline flights in apparent journalistic  tests of airport security. At New York's Kennedy Airport, Bruce Frankel, a  producer, and Alain Chaillou, a bureau chief for French station TF1, were  arrested after phony bombs with mocking notes were left for shipment on  Paris-bound flights. In Amsterdam, TV station Veronica filmed one of its  reporters carrying an attache case with an imitation bomb through security and  onto a plane at Schipol Airport. Air France, TWA and Pan Am were the New York  "targets."  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in  Portuguese on 20 February publishes on page A12 a 700-word  article by Gabriel Nogueira entitled "Deputy Denounces Air Taxi  Companies."    The author bases his article on a report by Deputy Jose  Dirceu based on Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI, and  Federal Police investigations of the Paulo Cesar, PC, Farias and  budget corruption schemes.    The author says the creation of "air taxi companies has  become one of the most lucrative ways to launder money earned  irregularly. Most large construction companies involved in the  PC and budget scandals have planes registered as air taxis,  which are used by legislators and public company executives in  exchange for favors and in order to evade taxes."    The author says most companies use the legal benefits of  current legislation granting tax exemptions to air taxi  companies and facilitating the remittal of dollars abroad  through leasing operations.    The author says: "Dozens of people open ghost companies  abroad in the name of figureheads to purchase planes in the  international market. Jose Dirceu says that once this is done  the local company makes a contract with `the foreign company'  for a rental operation (leasing) and starts legally remitting  large sums of money abroad." The author says an additional  advantage is that the law allows companies to deduct the amount  paid for renting the planes from their tax reports.    The author says: "Civil Aviation Department, DAC, rules that  regulate the operation of these planes are not respected and  transgressors go unpunished because of the lack of supervision.  There is no control over the millions of dollars sent abroad  through false plane leasing operations."    The author says that "besides the famous cases of Brasil Jet  and Mundial Aerotaxi owned by Paulo Cesar Farias," Deputy Jose  Dirceu mentions the Taming company owned by Mendes Junior  Construction Company, Aerotaxi Pampulha owned by Andrade  Gutierrez Construction Company, Wanair owned by Cowan Company,  the plane fleet owned by Tratex Construction Company, Crasa Taxi  owned by CR Almeida Company, Morro Vermello owned by Camargo  Correa Construction Company, Embrataxi owned by former Minas  Gerais Governor Newton Cardoso, and the Plata company owned by  economist Jose Carlos Alves doe Santos.</p>

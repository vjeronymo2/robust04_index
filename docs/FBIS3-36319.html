The show of military might in the troubled  Bessarabian boondocks has given way to raids against enemy rear.  The current Moldovan parliamentary election campaign has been  marked by lightning strikes against the political reputation of  a number of rulers of the unrecognized Dniester Moldavian  Republic. The authorities' reaction was not long in coming...    [Chelnokov] Aleksandr Ivanovich, how come that you, whom the  Dniester people see primarily as the man who stopped the bloody  war in Bendery 18 months ago, are now being accused by the  authorities of the Dniester Moldavian Republic of virtually  attempting a coup d'etat?    [Lebed] Organizing coups d'etat, the charge they are  leveling  at me, is not my style. I am worried about the living  conditions and the fate of the 25,000 14th Army servicemen and  members of their families living in the Dniester region. The  stores here are empty, prices in the food markets are  astronomical, there are no medicines, and teachers are leaving.  There is complete collapse and chaos. I call the government of  the Dniester Moldavian Republic criminal -- that is why the  local press sometimes calls me the "black general."    [Chelnokov] The economic situation everywhere in the CIS  right now is, to put it mildly, not in the best shape. The  reasons for that, as a rule, are certainly not of a criminal  nature....    [Lebed] The Dniester region is of tremendous interest to the  Russian military-industrial complex. There are several unique  defense enterprises here. I know that First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets would like to invest resources in this production, but  the reputation of the local leaders as thieves is an obstacle.  When these people get credits they shout for joy, plug a few  holes in the budget, but put half the money in their own  pockets. A bunch of adventurists has come to power in the  Dniester Moldavian Republic by exploiting people's natural  desire for freedom.    [Chelnokov] In Russia it has long been the fashion to talk  about mythical suitcases packed full of sensational documents  allegedly attesting to the corruption of officials. Are you not  afraid of finding yourself in the same tricky position as many  Moscow setters of that fashion?    [Lebed] I have sent a number of documents corroborating my  accusations to the Dniester region's ministries of internal  affairs and state security. What was the result? The rejected  documents rebound against those who brought them. I sent a  stack of compromising materials to the Russian law enforcement  agencies -- the Military Prosecutor's Office, the General  Prosecutor's Office, the Security Ministry, and  counterintelligence. I do not know where it has all gone... It  is a vicious circle.    [Chelnokov] In that case what is the point of your  revelations? To prompt the Dniester region's people to civil  disobedience?    [Lebed] I am calling for a civilized way out of the  impasse in which the Dniester people find themselves. People  must know that the hierarchy of the Dniester Moldavian Republic  is politically compromised by participation in the October  events in Moscow. On the instructions of President Smirnov  there were between 70 and 110 people from the Dniester region in  the White House on that day, according to various sources of  information. As a consequence, Defense Minister Grachev phoned  me 14 October and authorized me to notify this "criminal  government" that all ties with them would be broken off.    [Chelnokov] So in your opinion the only obstacle to the  settlement of the Moldovan conflict is the leadership of the  Dniester Moldavian Republic?    [Lebed] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur is not fated to be  a peacemaker either. A single phrase which he used on  television when there were killings and robberies taking place  in Bendery -- "Everything is fine, the constitutional process is  being restored" -- turned him into a political corpse. Only the  simultaneous replacement of the authorities in Chisinau and  Tiraspol will make it possible to break the deadlock in the  peace process and set a precedent for involving the Russian  economy in the Dniester region.    Snegur is now being most comprehensively wiped out. Moldovan  speaker Lucinschi is gradually destroying him in all spheres.  In the near future -- after the parliamentary elections --  Lucinschi will replace Snegur, you mark my words.    [Chelnokov] Is the 14th Army prepared for a change in the  political situation in Moldova?    [Lebed] A certain military-political balance of forces has  now been established in this region. The armed forces of  Moldova and the Dniester region are semi-guerrilla, semi-militia  gangs. It is no great difficulty to set one off against the  other. The 14th Army, which represents the only real military  force, is playing the part of the notorious sword of Damocles  here and is thus maintaining relative stability.    [Chelnokov] You have written a book called "The Spectacle  Called a Putsch" ["Spektakl po imeni putch"] and the various  events in which you have taken part are often called theater or  circus. What is your role in this?    [Lebed] I am a player-coach. This is an enforced role  dictated by Central Committee practice which still persists.  Ever since Sumgait in 1988 I have not received a single written  order, it is all done by phone. "Fly down there. Things are not  going well. Establish order," and that is all. For example, I  went to Tbilisi with three regiments -- in 140 military  transport planes. Imagine the job that we had: to get dozens of  planes from different cities, form them into an airborne armada,  fly down there, and then, when Gorbachev expressed surprise, we  had to pretend: The devil only knows how they got down  there.... Nothing has changed since that time.</p>

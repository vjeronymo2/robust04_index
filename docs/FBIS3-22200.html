Two thirds of the towns in  the country have no central water supply system and in some  regions the drinking water situation ``requires urgent  measures,'' due to threat of ``irreversible consequences.''  This was stated by Vice Premier Alexander Zaveryukha, in charge  of agrarian issues, environmental protection and natural  resources, at a meeting of the Collegium of the Russian  Federation's Committee for the Water Supply Industry on Tuesday.    According to Zaveryukha, the Russian Federation still has no  program on supplying the population with drinking water, while  as a result of ``the continuous mass pollution, two-thirds of  man-made water sources do not meet the requirements for drinking  and fishing reservoirs,'' and the construction of water supply  networks ``has been sharply falling in recent years.''    The vice premier pointed out that the Russian government  intends ``to give up inefficient administrative command methods  of protecting water resources.'' A water supply fee should be  introduced and the parliament should consider and pass the  project already submitted by experts ``The Basics of the Water  Legislation of the Russian Federation.''    Zaveryukha believes that in all industries without exception  it is necessary ``to more actively pass to economic relations  between the state and the users of natural resources.'' In his  opinion, the first step in that direction was the introduction  of considerable penalties for the pollution of the environment.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOUGHTS ON LIFE OF DAREDEVIL KNIEVEL  </P> <P> Strangely, I never found the egocentric antics of Evel Knievel of compelling  interest; he was more to be pilloried than sensationalized, I always thought  ("Evel Doings" by Bob Sipchen, April 14).  </P> <P> As a friend of Knievel's victim (talented entertainment exec Shelly Saltman of  Calabasas) I found Knievel's boast ironic: The man "I hit with a baseball bat .  . . never got a dime."  </P> <P> Perhaps this case typifies what's wrong with our judicial system: Knievel's  assault victim wins a $12.7-million judgment, but can't collect. Meanwhile,  this colorful south end of a horse headed north goes merrily on his way,  freeloading off his son's exploits.  </P> <P> There's a happy ending, however. His victim has his home, a lovely wife and  children, respect of his peers -- and a clear conscience. Knievel has none of  those, only a few expensive trinkets he was able to mooch off others.  </P> <P> Maybe justice does work, after all.  </P> <P> FRANCIS X. FINNERTY  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

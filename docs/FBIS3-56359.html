According to the Novosti First Channel news program, Friday  was the most saturated day of the Moscow visit of U.S. President  Bill Clinton.    The final round of negotiations confirmed the two countries  are working for partnership, said Novosti. A proof to it is the  Moscow declaration and other documents signed here today.    In the opinion of the Russian TV Vesti news program, the  tripartite agreement on elimination of nuclear arms stationed in  Ukraine signed today by the Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian  presidents is "historic". The document confirms non-nuclear  status of Ukraine.    Novosti offered a report from the Spaso-Perovskiy Hospital  visited by wife of the Russian President Naina and wife of the  U.S. President Hillary. "Charity and sympathy are genuinely  female feelings and it is good wives of the two presidents  personify them," said the TV program.    Evening TV news also focused on work of the Russian  parliament. Vesti reported in detail voting on candidates for  deputies of the Federation Council speaker.    Federation Council members are "very independent, they will  not blindly follow instructions of the president or the  government head," Chairman of the Chuvash Council of Ministers  Valeryan Viktorov told Novosti. Viktorov was elected today a  deputy of the Federation Council speaker. He expressed the  assurance Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko "will not  involve in unnecessary confrontation between the president and  the government".    "This can mean the beginning of the rouble exchange rate  stabilization at a new level," said Vesti commenting on today's  tenders at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange when the  exchange rate of DM [German mark] lowered by eight points. The  dollar exchange rate remains the same. The cable stated  preservation of a high demand for hard currency.</p>

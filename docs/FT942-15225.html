			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Japanese ahead in first new-car customer survey JD Power, the leading US automotive consumer research group, has launched its first UK customer satisfaction survey of buyers of new cars and is planning to expand the service to include other markets in Europe. The results of its first UK study, which was published yesterday, show that Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, has achieved the highest level of overall customer satisfaction. The motor industry in Europe has previously resisted JD Power's attempts to expand from its base in North America preferring to use its own privately syndicated quality and customer satisfaction information. These data have always been guarded with strict confidentiality by the manufacturers and have never been made public. JD Power's study has measured car owners' attitudes both to the quality of their vehicles as well as to the service and care they receive from their dealers. The top half of the rankings in the study is dominated by Japanese producers with Mazda and Honda in second and third places, Daihatsu fourth equal, Subaru seventh, Mitsubishi 10th and Nissan in 13th place. The highest ranked European producer is Mercedes-Benz at fourth equal, with Saab eighth, Skoda ninth and BMW in 11th position. Hyundai of South Korea was in 12th place with Proton of Malaysia fourth equal. The performances of the leading volume carmakers in the UK  - Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover  - are all ranked below average in the study along with Peugeot, Citroen, Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Fiat, Lada, Volvo, Seat and Suzuki. The JD Power studies, first launched in the US in 1981, have been a driving force in improving quality in the US car industry. Greeted at first with intense scepticism and hostility they helped to convince the big three US carmakers  - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler  - that they were lagging far behind their Japanese rivals.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Will today's Grand National mark a false hurrah for Britain's bookies? - Horse Racing Only rarely does a winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Britain's premier jumps race, run in the Grand National at Aintree. But The Fellow (above), this year's Gold Cup winner, does so today. Both races are steeplechases, which means they entail fences. But whereas the Gold Cup is run over 3 1/4 miles at level weights and attracts the best 'chasers in training, the Grand National is a controversial 4 1/2 -mile slog of a handicap (horses carry different weights, according to talent) notorious for its equine death toll. Alverton, winner of the 1979 Gold Cup, was killed shortly afterwards in that year's Grand National. The Fellow, owned by the Marquesa de Moratalla and trained in France, was quoted yesterday as 7-1 joint second favourite for today's race with Double Silk, just behind the soft-ground specialist Master Oats (6-1). The Grand National fences have been made less dangerous in response to protests, but fingers will be tightly crossed until The Fellow is safely back in France. Following last year's Grand National fiasco - protests by animal-welfare activists, two false starts and the race declared void - security at Aintree has been heftily increased. More than 200 uniformed police, supported by undercover teams, will be ready to counter demonstrators' efforts to disrupt the race. And a new type of starting gate has been installed, to help minimise the risk of horses and jockeys becoming entangled in the starting-tape, as happened last year. Nevertheless, anger among protest groups is unassuaged. Dene Gordon-Stansall, one of the activists' leaders, said at Aintree on Thursday: 'About 250 horses die each year on the racecourse and thousands break down and are put down. 'We want to make it clear to people that by betting on the Grand National they are contributing to horses dying. Behind the spectacle, euphoria and glamour, what people don't see is broken-down horses, the screens and a vet's bullet put through a horse's head. They don't see them three days after the race in the stable unable to walk.' Unmoved by the cruelty angle, Britain's bookmakers were insouciant yesterday  -predicting a betting turnover on the Grand National alone of between Pounds 60m and Pounds 75m. Ladbrokes, which claims to be the world's biggest bookmaker, estimated that the betting industry would handle Pounds 60m-plus in National bets from more than 15m - mainly once-a-year - punters. Its 2,000 betting shops will have 15,000 staff on duty, while a dedicated freephone service is expected to handle Pounds 1m worth of bets. 'Our revolutionary telephone service reflects the enormous growth in debit card betting since its launch on Grand National day three years ago,' said the firm. Curiously, today's Grand National could mark a false hurrah for Britain's bookies. This time next year, Britain's national lottery will be up and running. Although impossible to quantify at this distance, its impact on UK betting turnover could be distinctly for the worse. The bookies should be nervous. The Fellow is probably shivering.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / US ready to discuss migration with Cuba US officials said yesterday that they want to reopen direct talks with the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro on allowing legal emigration from Cuba, but they ruled out discussions of any other subject. Mr Peter Tarnoff, under-secretary for political affairs at the US State Department, said the US had held mid-level talks with Cuban officials on migration issues since 1984. That was 'the proper forum' to discuss the present surge in the number of Cuban refugees seeking to cross the Florida Strait to the US in the last month. 'There's no prospect of a dialogue on other matters. We feel that the Cuban government must attend to its responsibility for the current emergency and that the proper place for that dialogue is the migration talk format,' Mr Tarnoff said. In the meantime, the US is negotiating with various Caribbean countries which it hopes will agree to act as safe havens for Cuban refugees picked up by the US Coast Guard in international waters. Mr Tarnoff said he hoped that some countries would announce 'shortly' their willingness to accept such refugees. Cubans are still allowed to apply, in Cuba, for US visas or for political asylum but, since President Bill Clinton's decision last week to reverse US policy, those who try to make their own way to the US by boat or raft will not be allowed in. Those who reach the US in this manner are being interned at Krome camp near Miami, while those picked up by the Coast Guard are being shipped to Guantanamo Bay, the US military base in south-eastern Cuba. As there are already nearly 15,000 Haitian refugees in tents at Guantanamo, the base has room for only 10,000 Cubans. Even so, the new policy appears to have done little so far to deter Cubans from putting to sea in home-made rafts, inner tubes or small boats. The Coast Guard yesterday reported that 1,293 people were picked up on Sunday - the highest number in any one day since the 1980 exodus, which saw 125,000 people flee Cuba. Mr Tarnoff said that the additional curbs announced this weekend by Mr Clinton, such as a ban on currency remittances from Cuban-Americans in the US to relatives on the island, were 'not aimed at the Cuban people, but are intended to limit the ability of the Cuban government to accumulate foreign exchange which it can use to sustain its structures and to suppress dissent.' However, he added, 'a blockade (of Cuba) as such is not presently being contemplated.' Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, visited southern Florida yesterday to assess the scale of the refugee problem, and said all resources were being concentrated on the exodus. 'We do not have orders at this time to effect an economic blockade. It would require more resources, more ships than we have here to do that,' he said. US treatment of Cuban refugees has now been brought into line with that of Haitians, but US refusal to talk to Mr Castro continues to be contrasted with its willingness to hold broad discussions with other countries it regards as renegades, such as North Korea.</p>

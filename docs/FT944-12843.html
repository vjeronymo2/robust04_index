			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Hambros explores rail stock interest Hambros Bank, which has been appointed to market the three railway rolling-stock leasing companies to be carved out of British Rail, this week will start exploring Japanese interest in the sale. Hambros executives, who last week visited the US, report strong initial overseas enthusiasm. Industry analysts suggest that the three companies, with combined annual revenues of Pounds 804m, could fetch between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn. The companies will be expected to spend about 40 per cent of their turnover on maintenance, but labour costs are low. Each employs about 50 people. The companies, Eversholt Train Leasing, Poterbrook Leasing and Angel Train Contracts, known together as the Roscos, own nearly all BR's passenger trains. In the next month Hambros will speak to all parties which it thinks could be interested. It plans to issue a sales memorandum in the first quarter of next year, to accept bids in early summer and to complete the sales by autumn. Hambros reports interest from UK venture capitalists, from US banks and leasing companies, and from European organisations. No purchaser will be allowed to own more than one Rosco, in order to create competition. Mr Tony Mallin, vice-chairman of Hambros, said any purchaser would be well placed to make further acquisitions in other countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has issued an urgent appeal to the  brothers in Yemen, calling on them to refrain from fighting,  exercise self-restraint, and close their ranks. Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid warned the Yemenis that partition and civil war  would only bring ruin and hardship.    The secretary general said that Arab countries and the  league's General Secretariat are following the escalation of the  situation in Yemen with concern and that they hope to see it end  soon.    Yesterday Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid telephoned President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and offered to send a high-level delegation to  Yemen to help contain the crisis. However, the delegation could  not travel to Yemen because of the shelling of Sanaa Airport.    Today Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid received a telephone call from  Yemeni  Prime Minister Dr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. The secretary  general urged al-'Attas to seek an end to the fighting to  preserve the safety, security, and stability of brotherly Yemen.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: All spun silk and gold - The Elizabeth Hoare Gallery In 1902, a 22-year old architect, Giles Gilbert Scott, won the competition to design Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Too few people discover the austere majesty of Scott's Gothic cathedral, one of the largest in the world and one of the outstanding British buildings of this century. A new museum has now opened actually inside the cathedral, high above in the right gallery - properly, the triforium. From the Elizabeth Hoare Gallery, visitors enjoy a dizzying view of Scott's masterpiece. However, the real purpose of this unique museum is to celebrate an aspect of Victorian craftsmanship and design which has hitherto been disastrously neglected. Thanks to the Elizabeth Hoare Collection, Liverpool now boasts the only permanent display of classic Victorian and Edwardian embroidery in the country. The collection is beautifully displayed, a real feast for the eyes. Sumptuous velvet vestments and altar-frontals glow in deep-dyed hues of indigo, green, violet and red. Embroideries gleam with artfully stitched gold thread, made in true medieval fashion, by wrapping gold leaf around spun silk. Samplers demonstrate the marvellous effects from floss silk and gold thread. The museum is truly a window onto a forgotten aspect of Victorian emulation of the past. In the 1830s and 1840s, first the birth of the Oxford Movement and then Augustus Pugin's championing of medieval designs, paved the way for a magnificent flowering of ecclesiastical embroidery. Church furnishings was a lively issue, and not just in the pages of The Ecclesiologist. The collection takes the story on as far as the 1940s and '50s. Modern design may be more austere, yet the specimens from the Hoare Collection and the cathedral's own are a million miles from the amateurish monstrosities which disgrace so many parish churches and cathedrals. Admittedly, ecclesiastical embroidery might sound impossibly arcane. However, there is a lot more to Liverpool's newest museum. It could be said to be the nearest thing Britain yet has to a museum of women's art. Many things remain to be discovered about the world of the Victorian embroiderers, but it is probably true that most of these pieces were designed by male architects. At the same time, the actual work of embroidery is thought to have been women's work, done by skilful lady amateurs who eagerly joined embroidery gilds as well as by female outworkers working for the flourishing commercial firms. Anglican 19th-century nuns, like their medieval forbears, fashioned vestments for the bishop and exquisite furnishings for God's house. One of the most superb pieces in the exhibition is a frontal designed by GE Street and made by the nuns of St Margaret's Convent, East Grinstead. Everyone remembers that one of Mr Gladstone's interests was rescuing fallen women and it is piquant to discover that some of them would have ended up in convent workshops, learning how to bring a faint blush to the cheeks of virgin saints. The very survival of this unique collection is due to the vision and energy of businesswoman Elizabeth Hoare. She began in the early 1960s, when it would have been difficult to think of a more unfashionable area to collect. However, Mrs Hoare's interest was both professionally and aesthetically motivated - indeed, one might even say it was genetic. In 1874, the firm of Watts &amp; Co. was founded by three well-known architects, G. F. Bodley, Thomas Garner and George Gilbert Scott, to make fine furnishings for houses and churches. ('What's in a name' was said to have been the origin of the name, since for gentlemen architects to put their name to a shop seemed not quite respectable.) Mrs Hoare is the granddaughter of Scott the elder and therefore the niece of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect of Liverpool Cathedral. After an early career as an actress, she took over the firm after the war and has been fitting out bishops and altars ever since. In the 1960s and '70s, the era of the beige, homespun look, it seemed that a new age of iconoclasm had come upon the church in England. Vicars everywhere were throwing out Victorian chasubles and frontals, convent workrooms were closed down, and a quantity of Victorian embroidery ended up in the dustbin or on the bonfire. In the course of her work in churches, Mrs Hoare was able to rescue several hundred pieces. They rarely cost her more than the (often not inconsiderable) effort of carrying them back on the train. For years, Hoare's Bank in Fleet Street stored the bulky collection in its vaults. However, the owner always hoped to find a permanent home, partly from a deep conviction that modern embroiderers lack opportunity to study what is best in the English tradition. Four years ago, Liverpool Cathedral ordered some copes from Watts, unaware of the family connection with its own architect. The offer was made, and to their great credit the cathedral authorities reacted enthusiastically. Funds for the transformation of the first triforium (it is hoped that the second may eventually be used) were raised privately. Donors include; The Clothworkers' Foundation, Peter Moores Foundation, Ecclesiastical Insurance Group, and Commercial Union, among others. The tide may have turned; this long neglected art may yet be appreciated as one of the high points of English craftsmanship.</p>

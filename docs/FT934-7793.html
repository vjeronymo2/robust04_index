			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hungarian bank admits extent of capital shortfall MAGYAR Hitel Bank, Hungary's largest commercial bank, yesterday revealed a much larger capital shortfall than estimated. It said it was discussing a Ft50-60bn (Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m) government bail-out. The capital injection and deteriorating capital ratio figure were revealed by Mr Istvan Torocskei, managing director, ahead of today's expected cabinet decision on recapitalisation of the troubled banking sector. The authorities propose to restore the capital adequacy ratios of the main banks to zero per cent for this year's international accounts, and to 4 per cent next spring. The standard set by the Bank for International Settlements is 8 per cent. Mr Torocskei's estimate means Hitel Bank has a negative capital adequacy ratio of at least 16 per cent. The Ft50-60bn of extra capital he is seeking represents a fifth of the bank's estimated risk-weighted assets of Ft240bn. Hitel Bank's capital deficiency, according to the latest figures, is double the minus 7.9 per cent projected for 1993 in a World Bank aide-memoire on the Hungarian banking system written this year. That report concluded that most of Hungary's banks were 'technically insolvent', according to international accounting standards. Hungarian officials and bankers, however, rule out collapse of the big banks. 'Hitel Bank's liquidity has never been as good as now,' Mr Torocskei said. Mr Imre Tarafas, a deputy chairman at the National Bank of Hungary, cautioned that banks were exaggerating their loan losses to qualify for larger government injections. Clearly, though, there has been a substantial deterioration at the big banks, which officials blame largely on the recognition of bad equity investments and contingent liabilities, as well as substandard loans. Given Hitel Bank's capital demands, the government's recapitalisation of the sector is likely to cost more than the Ft100bn estimated by the World Bank earlier this year. The capital strength of Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank, the three large state-owned commercial banks, deteriorated after Hungary implemented a new bankruptcy law at the start of 1992.</p>

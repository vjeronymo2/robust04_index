			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Technology: A helping hand for the imagination - Worth Watching Engineers who design cars or buildings on the computer screen have to rely largely on imagination to envisage the final product. Now they can visualise the objects through virtual reality (VR). Bristol-based Division has adapted its dVise VR software so that it can be used with popular Cad packages such as AutoCad, 3D Studio and MultiGen. To visualise the design and to manipulate those images the designer simply attaches the VR headset and other equipment to the Cad system. Division: UK, 0454 615554. Japanese games supremo Nintendo has joined with Silicon Graphics to develop a VR games machine for the home. At the heart of the machine, which will appear in arcades in 1994 and in the home by late 1995, is Silicon Graphics' Multimedia Engine. Nintendo: US, 206 882 2040.</p>

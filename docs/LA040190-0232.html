			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE SUN SETS ON 'MORNING'  </P> <P> I am deeply disappointed that "L.A. in the Morning" is no longer on KCAL.  </P> <P> I was a loyal viewer for many years and was impressed with the needed attention  this program continually gave to serious societal concerns.  </P> <P> That this program, so well hosted by Stephanie Edwards, was removed is another  nail in the coffin of a literate and informed society, as well as an informed  electorate.  </P> <P> The authors, politicians and activists who appeared on "Midmorning L.A." (the  show's previous title) and "L.A. in the Morning" were invaluable to my bank of  information. I bemoan the loss of this program, and I know I am not alone.  </P> <P> Elaine Livesey-Fassel, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Borisenko, Pavel </F> Vanichkin, Oleg Velichko and Vitaliy Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington June 24 TASS -- U.S. Vice-President  Albert Gore described as "an outstanding success" the results of  the session of the intergovernment Russian-American commission  on economic and technological cooperation.    The commission which is co-chaired by Russian Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin drafted several agreements between the two  countries over the two days of its work. Their signing ceremony  was held on Thursday at the conference hall of the  administration complex adjoining the White House.    Chernomyrdin and Gore put their signatures under the  Russian-  American agreement in the sphere of ecology, the statement on  the principles of information exchange, the agreement on closing  down plutonium-producing reactors as well as the joint statement  on cooperation in building an orbital station.    The sides signed another 22 documents opening prospects for  cooperation between the two countries in various spheres,  including a 400-million-dollar contract on financing the  shuttle-Mir programme.    Praising the results of the session, the U.S. Vice-President  stressed that the two countries have established close and  fruitful relations at many levels. The United States as a  Russian partner and friend operates jointly with the Russian  Federation for the sake of continuing progress, he added.    Gore called the agreement on the participation of U.S. oil  companies Marathon oil and Mcdermott in developing the oil and  gas deposits on Sakhalin shelf as the largest American  investment in Russia.    The project is worth ten billion dollars. This is a very  positive signal to American investors that they can successfuly  do business in Russia, he continued.    The Vice-President called as very important the agreement on  closing down the plutonium-producing reactors in Tomsk and  Krasnoyarsk. This document is graphic evidence of mutual  determination to act jointly to strengthen the regime of nuclear  non-proliferation, he stressed.    He announced that the next, fourth session of the Russian-  American commission on economic and technological cooperation  will be held in Moscow next winter.    For his part, Chernomyrdin noted that Russia and the U.S.  now face the task of filling up the reached agreements with  concrete content. "Our meetings were held in an atmosphere of  mutual understanding," he continued.    "indeed, there were difficulties, but we have overcome them.  The achieved agreements are landmarks in relations between our  states. However, we should now start work so that these  agreements should yield practical results."    Appraising the results of a meeting with U.S. President Bill  Clinton which was held at the White House earlier in the day,  Chernomyrdin said that it was "very useful and fruitful". "We  discussed the results of the Russian-American commission on  economic and technological cooperation," he noted.    "We also discussed the G7 summit in Naples next July to be  attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Some issues  examined at the present session of the Russian-American  commission will possibly be discussed at the Naples session."    The premier expressed confidence that President Clinton and  he "established mutual understanding on issues under  discussion". "I do not think that we have such problems which  could not be resolved," Chernomyrdin stressed.    Dealing with cooperation between the two countries in space  explorations, he noted that it is being carried "on an equal  footing". "We have a potential in some areas and are ready to  share it with other countries.    "The United States also can share their possibilities, and  the two countries will only benefit by this." Turning to  prospects for cooperation between the two countries in science,  the premier said that "the sphere of operations of the  Russian-American commission will be boosted", and questions of  public health will be put on the agenda of the next session to  be held in Moscow.    "If we can pool our resources in this sphere, the two  nations  will undoubtedly benefit by this," he added.    Participants in the news conference which was held on the  results of the Russian-American commission, raised the question  on the nuclear programme of North Korea and the role played by  Russia in a search for settling this problem.    The U.S. Administration praises Russia's assistance and  cooperation in attempts to settle the question of North Korea's  nuclear programme, Gore noted. According to the Vice-President,  contacts between Russian and U.S. foreign ministries on North  Korea's nuclear programme as well as discussions held at other  levels were very useful.    "The freezing" of North Korea's nuclear programme and  agreement to hold a meeting between the leaders of the North and  South Koreas are a very positive development of events, the  Vice-President noted. He expressed hope for a settlement of this  problem.    "Measures taken in this respect are an achievement as it  is,"  the Russian premier said in turn. "It should be noted that all  this was achieved with the participation of Russia."  Chernomyrdin pointed to the need for broad international  cooperation in settling this problem.    Speaking of prospects for a Bosnian settlement, Chernomyrdin  expressed opinion that Russia, the U.S. and other countries  should find a solution to this problem. "We should extinguish  the flames which can develop into a fire at any time."    The Russian premier expressed confidence that Russia and the  U.S. "are marching in the right direction", looking for  possibilities of a settlement in Bosnia and added that a  solution of this problem is not far away.</p>

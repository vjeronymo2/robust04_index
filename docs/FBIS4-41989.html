			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulbitskiy] </F>   [Text] Bonn June 29 TASS -- Russia has submitted to German  authorities a list of 40,000 cultural valuables taken out of the  country during World War Two and the chief negotiator indicated  that many problems are yet to be solved before a solution is  found.    Russian Deputy Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy told TASS  on  Wednesday that Russian experts "have completed intense work to  compile a true list of our losses" which concern, in particular,  the Catherine Palace in Pushkino, a palace in Pavlovsk and a  museum in Orel.    Shvydkoy, who is heading the Russian delegation at the  current restitution talks in Germany, admitted that  contradictions do exist. Russia opposes the German idea that the  restitution problem is to be solved by political means and  insists on a legal settlement.    Additionally, "there are many war veterans in Russia to whom  it will be hard to explain why we have to hand over some  valuables and get nothing in return. This is the root cause of  our differences with the German side. We are strongly against  granting equal rights to the countries one of which is the  aggressor and other the victim of aggression," Shvydkoy said.    He stressed that Germany's valuables brought to the Soviet  Union by decision of state organisations are Russia's property.  However, things smuggled out of Germany by private persons must  be returned. The valuables that belonged to German religious and  charity organisations were not allowed to be taken out of the  country, he said.    Another problem is the articles that belonged to individuals  or third countries. For example, if Germany had brought  something from France and later it was brought to Russia, these  things cannot be treated as German property. "We are seeking to  make the process of restitution legal without damaging Russia's  interests," Shvydkoy said.    "We cannot agree with the German side that this process will  not be compensatory. It must be a road with two-way traffic.  The return of valuables from Russia must be linked to the  return of valuables from Germany," he continued.    Additionally, if Germany cannot trace a particular thing and  is ready to give up the search, it must pay compensation which  will be used to support Russian culture. "We are strongly  against using this money in other spheres, that is trading a  painting for a kilo of sausage or equipment for a brewery. Our  commission considers it barbaric," Shvydkoy said.</p>

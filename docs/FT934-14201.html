			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Ketchup in his veins - Mike Quinlan, chairman of McDonald's, talks to Guy de Jonquieres If there is one thing Mike Quinlan, chairman of McDonald's really relishes, it is getting out and selling the products. When he can, he drops in at one of the company's 14,000 restaurants, dons a smock and pitches in with employees in the kitchen or behind the counter. 'I can make hamburgers and Big Macs and fries. I'm a great counter person. I can work the drive-through,' he says. 'The restaurant activities have always been my favourite part of McDonald's. That's where we make or break the relationship with our customers.' Often, he will quiz diners about the quality of food and service, telling them only later what his job is. 'I love relating to the customers. I'm very interested in what our constituency wants from us and how we can do things better. That is how you grow the business.' The hands-on enthusiasm rings true because the Mcfamily, as Mr Quinlan calls it, has been part of his life, man and boy, for 30 years. A jaunty 49-year-old who still speaks with the distinctive lilt of Chicago's Irish west side where he grew up, he started working with the company part-time to supplement his income while at college. He joined full-time on graduation, after turning down a place at law school because he could not afford the fees. By his own admission, he is a 'lifer' with the company. As the saying goes in McDonald's, he has ketchup in his veins. With every passing week, more ketchup is poured on more McDonald's hamburgers in ever more restaurants around the globe. A further 900 will open this year, more than twice the total number in operation when Mr Quinlan joined the company. Next year, he aims to add another 1,000. On top of that, a proliferation of smaller outlets known as 'special venues' is bringing McDonald's to places it has never reached before. 'We are in locations we never thought of seven or eight years ago. Airports, service stations, superhighways, cruise ships. Hospitals are going like crazy. We are in Wal-Mart (the US discount store chain), Tesco in Britain. We have kiosks all over the world. We're already on one train in Switzerland, and we'll soon be on another in Germany.' He can see no end to the growth. But then, he says, he never has been able to. He recalls that Raymond Kroc, the company's late founder, was first asked almost 30 years ago when the market would be saturated and replied laconically: 'Hell, I don't know.' 'The answer,' says Mr Quinlan, 'is that you can't give an answer.' Nonetheless, he guesses that sales will at least double in the next decade - a conservative estimate, given that they trebled during the last one. 'In 15 years,' he says, 'I think we will be a giant company.' Even in the US, where McDonald's has one restaurant for every 29,000 people and faces steadily increasing competition, he sees plenty still to go for. The game may be all about increasing share in a mature market, but McDonald's aims to do so profitably by offering more varied menus, such as chicken and pizza, lowering the break-even level of restaurants and sourcing raw materials more efficiently. Outside the US, by contrast, the potential has barely been scratched. Though the company's operations span almost 70 countries, in most the fast-food market is in its infancy. In some, the opening of a new McDonald's amounts to a minor cultural revolution. The restaurant in Moscow's Pushkin Square continues to generate sales volumes 12 times higher than the norm for outlets of its size, almost four years after it opened. The first two restaurants in Poland set records for customer traffic, while operations in China are profitable after only 18 months. However, political uncertainties, limited consumer spending power, supply difficulties and the time needed to establish the McDonald's brand all make Mr Quinlan cautious about the speed of future expansion in the developing world. During this decade, he is counting on western Europe to act as the main engine of growth outside the US. The prospect of increased size and management complexity does not daunt him, he says, because his rise through the ranks has given him first-hand experience of almost every aspect of the company's operations. Most of McDonald's top managers have also worked their way up from the bottom, a system he says provides stability and continuity. What prevents the culture from becoming inward-looking is the nature of McDonald's compact with its 9,000 franchisees, some of whom are now in their third generation. 'We don't stand back and say: 'Here's your franchise, pay us your royalty, now sink or swim.' We only succeed when they succeed. If their sales don't grow, our profits don't grow. That has a way of sorting things out, of prioritising the way you do business.' McDonald's prides itself on imposing uniform standards and business systems throughout its operations, while still instilling in each of its franchisees a spirit of entrepreneurship. 'I can go to restaurants in Norway, Singapore, Butte, Montana, or Glasgow, and honest to God, it's like talking to associates I've known for 25 years. I can go anywhere in the world and feel I'm a welcome member of the family.' To go on working, the formula needs continuously to be refined and improved. 'We cannot allow ourselves to become a commodity. When customers think of McDonald's, they have to think of us as different. Whether it's our marketing, our children's programmes, our birthday parties, our community and charitable involvement, people expect a bit more of us.' This view of McDonald's as one big happy family, united in the quest for excellence, is not universally shared. In the US, fast food has become a byword in some quarters for a low-wage business offering dreary jobs to a shiftless army of unskilled workers. To its critics overseas, on the other hand, the company is the ultimate symbol of the spread of American throw-away culture. Mr Quinlan will have none of it. True, the company relies heavily on casual workers, and turnover among counter staff is high. But it offers training and unrivalled promotion opportunities to young people who stay with it. Furthermore, as he describes it, work in McDonald's restaurants is not the soulless routine alleged by some critics, but a genuine community enterprise. 'The younger people use the older full-time staff as consiglieri. They ask them advice about life, not just about the job. Each store takes on the characteristics of a family. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not. A thousand little dramas are played out every day in each of our restaurants.' Hostility, he insists, is often the result of ignorance. Such was the case with the French farmers, who recently protested against the US stance on agricultural trade by picketing its restaurants and burning effigies of Ronald McDonald. The company defused the situation by patiently pointing out that 90 per cent of the raw materials used in its restaurants were locally produced. Displays of good corporate citizenship are not, however, enough to quell frequent resistance to McDonald's choice of new sites. It has recently fought lengthy planning battles to open restaurants in Hampstead, north London, in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and near the Eiffel Tower in Paris. (It eventually won the first two, but lost the third.) Mr Quinlan replies that McDonald's will go as far as it can to tailor the design of its restaurants to local conditions. 'But when all is said and done, the answer lies in the consumer response when we finally open the doors. Piazza di Spagna opened with blockbuster volumes from day one, and I've seen the same thing happen all over the world. If we are providing people with what they want, they will tell us if they want us or not. I rest my case on that. 'When I look at my colleagues around the world, I think we all have a large dose of humility and a genuine love of serving our customers. It's kind of a religion with us. I don't think that's corny. It's the lifeblood of our business.' Personal File 1944 Born Chicago.

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN ENDS ITS FIRST-ROUND TROUBLES  </P> <P> Led by a stingy defense, Western High School defeated Troy, 13-0, in a Southern  Section Division VI first-round playoff game Friday at Fullerton High School.  </P> <P> For the Pioneers (9-2), it ended a frustrating trend of losing first-round  playoff games. Western has made the playoffs in seven of the last eight years,  but this was its first victory.  </P> <P> "So we broke the jinx," Western Coach Jim Howell said.  </P> <P> Western will face La Mirada in the second round next week.  </P> <P> Western advanced by holding Troy to six yards total offense and turning in its  first shutout of the season. The Pioneers' defense wasn't stifling as much at  it was pesky.  </P> <P> Paced by 5-foot-3, 135-pound linebacker Kevin Byun, who had four solo tackles,  and 6-foot-5, 245-pound lineman Tom Cowen, who had a couple of savage sacks,  the Western defense stopped the Warriors' running game and harassed Troy  quarterback Greg Windle.  </P> <P> Windle, usually an able thrower, completed only five of 20 passes for 72 yards.  And he was sacked four times for total losses of 65 yards.  </P> <P> "I really didn't think we would be able to shut them out," Howell said. "But I  knew we would play good defense."  </P> <P> While their defense was shutting down Troy, the offense was barely fairing any  better.  </P> <P> Fortuitous field position was helpful, however.  </P> <P> Troy's Steve Friedrich fumbled the game's opening kickoff and Western's John  Walder recovered. Although Western quarterback Gilbert Brito couldn't lead much  of a drive from there, he kicked a 28-yard field goal to give Western a 3-0  lead.  </P> <P> A poor Troy punt set up another Brito field goal, this one of 43 yards. That  was all the scoring until Corey Manligius scored on a two-yard touchdown in the  final seconds of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "We couldn't get much going offensively, but neither could they," Howell said.  </P> <P> Troy finished the season 7-4.  </P></p>

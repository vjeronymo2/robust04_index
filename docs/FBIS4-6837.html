			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 23 April  carry editorials and articles on the resignation of Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang on 22 April, one day after he lashed out  at the decision-making process of the Kim Yong-sam  administration by requesting, during a meeting with his senior  aides on 21 April, that every decision of the administration go  through prior discussions by the cabinet.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word  article by reporter Choe Yong-muk entitled "Why Prime Minister  Yi Hoe-chang Resigned." The article describes the prime  minister's resignation as "shocking," and notes, "It seems that  Prime Minister Yi had complained about President Kim's mode of  managing state affairs and his reform style." The article then  cites recent episodes that apparently angered the prime minister  -- the presidential office's habit of belittling and sidelining  the prime minister's office, such as the instance when the prime  minister strongly objected to the Presidential Office directive  on the contents of the prime minister's statement of apology to  the people in connection with the government's handling of the  Uruguay Round; the lukewarm investigation of the Samgmudae  financial scandal; and above all, the manner in which the prime  minister was sidelined by not being included in the Unification  and Security Policy Coordinating Meeting. The article  concludes, "The prime minister must have thought since his  proposals were flatly ignored, this meant that President Kim  would not fully recognize the cabinet and instead wanted a  `quasi-prime minister,' and this was something the prime  minister could never accept."    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 2 a 1,100-word  article by reporter Kim Chang-ki entitled "Upright Prime  Minister Resigns in Four Months--Background and Prospects for  Future Political Scene." The editorial notes that the prime  minister's sudden resignation on 22 April has driven the entire  political situation on alert and says, "The resignation of a  prime minister in this manner is very unusual and thrusts the  Kim Yong-sam government into suddenly having to confront a  surging wave of problems. In particular, since the Kim Yong-sam  government that was launched under the signboard of reform  selected Prime Minister Yi, the virtual star of reforms and the  standard-bearer of audits and inspections, his resignation must  come as a serious blow and burden to the Kim Yong-sam  government. This must compel President Kim to modify his style  of managing state affairs and to reconsider his policy options."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "The Prime Minister's Sudden Resignation."  The editorial begins, "The prime minister's sudden resignation  is very shocking. It is far from an ordinary development  because Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang has resigned within four  months of his assumption of office and because his resignation  resulted from his complaint about the government's management of  state affairs." The editorial then notes, "Whatever the  background and reason for his resignation may be, the prime  minister's resignation is causing considerable damage to  President Kim Yong-sam's personnel policy. President Kim  Yong-sam must have been aware of Mr. Yi Hoe-chang's strong  convictions and upright character when choosing him." The  editorial concludes, "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation  brings up the old issue in which the prime minister is put in a  difficult position regarding his role and maneuverability under  a president-centered form of government. Nevertheless, the  prime minister's control over the cabinet and his policy  coordinating role should be enhanced. For this, the prime  minister's authority should be respected."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's  Convictions." The editorial begins, "It is a shocking  development that Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, who is noted for  his uncompromising convictions, should have suddenly resigned on  22 April." The editorial notes Prime Minister Yi's strong  complaint about the way the Unification and Security Policy  Coordinating Committee was run and his resolve to restore the  authority and function of the prime minister and the cabinet,  which the presidential office regard as a challenge to the  presidential office." The editorial then notes that the people  were glad to see a prime minister of conviction who differed  from previous rubber-stamping prime ministers who are referred  to as "prime ministers who only read what someone else has  written for them" and "powerless madams," but that he had to  leave office before being able to put his convictions into  practice. The editorial asserts that his resignation will  provide a fresh jolt to the world where many are changing their  convictions to hold on to their posts."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "The Sudden Replacement of the Prime  Minister." The editorial begins: "The sudden reprimand to and  replacement of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the ensuing  sudden appointment of Yi Yong-tok, the acting prime minister, is  an unusual development that shocks and perplexes the people. It  is certainly unfortunate that the president should have  reprimanded the prime minister for his irregular words and  actions and fired him. Nevertheless, we positively evaluate the  president's swift action in appointing a replacement to launch a  new cabinet instead of concealing the problem, which is an  expression of an active will to turn the misfortune to an  advantage." The editorial notes the need for the government to  establish order and discipline, and rebukes Prime Minister Yi  for his unprudent words and actions openly revealing his  complaint about the operation of the Unification and Security  Policy Coordinating Committee. The editorial concludes: "Prime  Minister Yi's resignation should not be construed as a  deterioration of reform. We must support the president's  resolve in executing state affairs productively and efficiently  in harmony and team work to fully utilize the advantage of the  year without elections."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a  900-word  editorial entitled "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's Sudden  Resignation--the Retreat of a `Law-Upholding Man' Could Mean a  Return to Conservatism."    The editorial begins: "Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden  resignation is an incident of grave importance leading the  people into uneasy worries, not to mention the fact that it will  deal the Kim Yong-sam regime a political blow." The editorial  notes: "Prime Minister Yi had an upright character and held  convictions upholding the law, commanding high popularity with  the people. The people expected that he would excellently carry  out his role as a coordinator in the government to augment the  clumsy execution of power of the civilian government." The  editorial continues: "It is quite natural that we should be led  to suspect that the prime minister's sudden resignation may  reflect the problems in President Kim's ruling style and his  mode of executing state affairs. Therefore, his resignation  could lead the people to suspect that the government is  abandoning the law-abiding ethos and returning to the old  practice of looking for expediency in violation of the law, thus  damaging the civilian government's resolve for reform and  political morality."    The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN carries on  page  2 a 1,500-word article entitled "The Greatest Political  Crisis--Striving To Find a Way Out." The article begins:  "Political circles regard the contingency created by the  resignation of the prime minister unprecedented in the  constitutional history as the greatest political crisis facing  the Kim Yong-sam government, and are striving to find a way out  of this crisis." The article notes a comment by an unidentified  senior official of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party that `The  sudden resignation of the prime minister could kindle a fire to  the disharmony lurking within the ruling camp. The opposition  parties and other forces critical of the government will  initiate a political offensive, which could lead to the  discussion of an overall realignment of political circles.'" The  article then notes the comment by the opposition Democratic  Party that `Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's sudden resignation  well reveals President Kim Yong-sam's weak personnel policy.'"    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Replacement of the Prime Minister in Four  Months." The editorial begins: "It is regrettable that Mr. Yi  Hoe-chang resigned as prime minister in only four months since  he assumed office. Different from the former prime ministers  who were described as a `powerless madame' and a `prime minister  who only read what someone else wrote for him,' he played a  central role in the cabinet with his convictions and  demonstrated his competence and reasonableness in coping with  various difficult pending issues of the country." The editorial  continues: "We think it is a troublesome development that the  replacement of the prime minister was made very abruptly and  that Prime Minister Yi resigned because of the difference of his  view from that of the presidential office over the policy-making  process. Yi Hoe-chang's resignation means not only replacing  the prime minister himself, but the resignation of all the  cabinet members he recommended and the formation of a new  cabinet, which is an enormous state event. The abrupt action of  this magnitude not only shocks the entire society, but is  undesirable for the stable operation of state affairs." The  editorial concludes: "The uproarious replacement of the prime  minister has to be a political blow to President Kim. President  Kim, who professed personnel action to be a matter of foremost  importance, appointed a new prime minister for the third time in  one year and two months and is to reshuffle the cabinet in four  months. This must burden him. We urge the government to  reestablish as soon as possible the posture for stable execution  of state affairs."</p>

Paldiski is to be merged with Keila to form a district  of the latter, while the surrounding areas will be turned over  to the communities. The government also discussed the powers  and budgets of the government special representative to  Paldiski, Juri Tikk.    A closed contest, held by the Economy Ministry, will be  declared in order to purchase surveillance equipment for the  border guard. The Border Guard Department was allocated the  funds for the equipment. Prime Minister Mart Laar told the news  conference that comparatively few offers have been made for the  land border surveillance and the final decision can be made by  April. Although the border guard preferred the Israeli company  "Elbit", the government decided to hold a contest. Estonia has  coordinated the purchases with Latvia and Lithuania, Laar added.  [passage omitted)    The government decided to exempt foreign loans, foreign aid,  credits with government guarantee and goods purchased for them  from the sales tax. The equipment for the defence forces, the  police and border guard, as well as presents connected with  official visits, will also be exempted from the tax. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: USF&amp;G returns to profits in opening quarter USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, reported first-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 4m, against a net loss of Dollars 55m a year earlier. Net realised losses on investments totalled Dollars 300,000, compared with gains of Dollars 400,000 in the first quarter of 1991. The company said a 'measurable positive trend' was emerging and attributed the rise in operating earnings to a better performance in its property-casualty business. The company, which has pulled out of some insurance lines and pruned costs fairly drastically, had already predicted a small net profit for the quarter.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Hurd warns MEPs against Euro manifesto Conservative members of the European parliament were yesterday given a stern warning by the party hierarchy not to endorse a federalist manifesto to be issued today by the party's allies in the European parliament. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, wrote to the party's 32 MEPs disowning the manifesto and warning that the European elections in June would be fought 'wholly and exclusively on a British Conservative manifesto'. The EPP manifesto, released in Brussels today, will endorse economic and monetary union and federal government. Mr Hurd's letter coincided with a 90-minute cabinet debate on the impending European and local government elections, at which Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, warned that the Conservatives faced an uphill battle. In a televised party political broadcast last night Mr Hurd emphasised that the Tory party would safeguard Britain's sovereignty in Europe. He said: 'We want to preserve Britain's right to retain most of the decisions about Britain's future here.' The broadcast confirmed that the party would focus the European campaign on Britain's standing in the world. Sir Norman told the cabinet that private polls gave the party a double-digit lead over Labour on the issue, compared with a 20-point deficit in most published opinion polls. Several senior ministers are expected to make high-profile speeches on foreign affairs in the next few days as the party attempts to set the election agenda. However, the Tories' festering divisions on Europe re-emerged in a speech by Lord Tebbit, the rightwing former party chairman, to the Radical Society. Using language likely to irritate the prime minister, he said: 'Day by day it becomes increasingly obvious that this government and this parliament here in Westminster are becoming . . . agents for the enforcement of decisions reached outside our borders by foreigners. Mr Hurd's decision to send the letter underlines the party leadership's sensitivity to repeated criticism of the EPP link from rightwing Euro-sceptic MPs.</p>

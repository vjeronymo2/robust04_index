			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / W German prices kept in check: Latest data support view that inflation is still under control The steady stream of reassuring west German price data continued yesterday, supporting the consensus that inflation is still under control. According to the federal statistics office, producer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in July, and wholesale prices fell 0.4 per cent. The sharper-than-expected drop in wholesale prices, which are now 1.6 per cent higher than a year ago, was due mainly to cheaper seasonal foodstuffs. The producer price index which has been heavily influenced by fierce international competition, was up only 0.4 per cent on the year. Despite this, WestLB, one of the country's leading banks, yesterday suggested inflation had risen in August under the influence of noticeably higher prices for oil products. According to the statistics office, producer prices for heavy heating oil and bitumen increased 4.4 per cent and 15 per cent respectively last month. But WestLB agreed with the general view that 'inflation's general downward trend remains intact'. The prices situation will loom large at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council in Frankfurt, which will undertake a routine assessment of interest rate policy. Other factors to be considered include prospects for continued deceleration in the rate of German money supply growth, the accelerating economic recovery and Tuesday's rise in the US Fed funds rate. Although the bank council may agree with the common view that a further cut in the 4.5 per cent discount rate is possible in current monetary conditions, the consensus among analysts yesterday was that it would maintain its 'steady hand' policy, and leave this internationally sensitive rate unchanged. However, some economists suggested the bank might ease rates on securities repurchase agreements which have been fixed at 4.85 per cent for the past four weeks. Although most believed there was still more room for cuts, a report in the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung which said the discount rate might fall today was widely discounted.</p>

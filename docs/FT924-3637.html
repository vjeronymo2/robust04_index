			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Palestinians drop call for boycott of talks PALESTINIAN leaders reluctantly gave their delegation the go-ahead to attend the latest round of Middle East peace talks, starting in Washington today, after their call for a boycott was brushed aside by fellow participants Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The snub underlined the Palestinians' weak position in the talks. The fifth anniversary on Wednesday of the start of the intifada - the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories - will be a further reminder of the painful alternatives they face. The Palestine Liberation Organisation wanted to postpone the eighth round of bilateral negotiations with Israel until after the inauguration of President-elect Bill Clinton next month to protest at Israel's tough stance in the year-old talks. But the suggestion was rejected at a meeting of the Arab parties in Beirut, attended also by Egypt. The Palestinians fear their goal of full independence will be prejudiced by a planned interim stage of limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But their case for far-reaching powers in the initial stage is undermined by the PLO's acceptance of the two-stage structure when the process was launched in Madrid in October 1991. Both the Tunis-based PLO and local leaders fear they will not be able to secure an interim agreement acceptable to the rank-and-file, among whom Islamic fundamentalist and other rejectionist groups are active. Increasing disillusionment is reflected in a recent rise in violence in the territories. The security forces are braced for an upsurge of violence over the anniversary.</p>

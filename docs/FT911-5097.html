			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Lloyds Bank offers 5% pay rise LLOYDS BANK yesterday offered a 5 per cent pay rise to 46,000 non-managerial staff, in a move which could herald a tougher stance by employers on earnings as inflation falls. The bank also said that about 300 senior executives, including its seven executive directors, would receive no pay rise this year. The 5 per cent offer, on which Lloyds said there was no room for movement, compares with a 7 per cent-plus package accepted by Barclays staff and 7 per cent offered by National Westminster Bank. Lloyds' move may encourage other financial services employers to make tough offers. Settlements at the big four clearing banks traditionally set the tone for negotiations at other companies in the sector. The decision to freeze the pay of senior management only is unusual among UK companies. A growing number are freezing pay, but usually for all employees. Lloyds branch managers have been offered between 3 and 4 per cent. Explaining the 5 per cent offer, Lloyds said in a letter to employees that there had been a case for no increase. 'But we recognise the pressures of inflation . . . particularly (for) those on lower salaries.' Staff costs were growing faster than income. The benefits of cost savings, including a cut of 3,000 UK staff in the 14 months to last February, would be lost unless employees showed restraint. 'We should otherwise be faced with large-scale compulsory redundancies.' Bifu, the financial services union, rejected the offer which it described as a disgrace, but told members that the bank implied that no further offer was likely. Lloyds Group Union also rejected the offer and told members that the bank's financial performance in the last financial year bettered that of its competitors. The Lloyds offer was due for implementation from April 1, the same date as the 7 per cent offer at National Westminster. Barclays' 7 per cent-plus deal was payable from February 1, when the annualised inflation rate was 8.9 per cent, against less than 7 per cent expected this month. Midland's pay settlement is due for implementation on June 1. Negotiations have not yet begun. CBI pay warning, Page 8</p>

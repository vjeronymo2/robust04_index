			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: Seeking redress for unfair competition Sir, The government recently announced that it has accepted recommendations from the director-general of fair trading to amend the provision concerning extortionate credit bargains. The amendment, we are told, will allow unjust credit transactions to be reopened, including those which 'involved business activity which was deceitful or oppressive or otherwise unfair and improper'. The government proposes that there be regulations setting out the factors to be taken into account in determining whether the credit transaction was unjust. Therefore, the government accepts that a definition of unfair and improper business activity can be achieved in the consumer credit area. The same should be possible and is desirable in the area of unfair competition - that is, where unfair and improper business activity of one trader damages another. As things stand, redress is only available under specific headings which do not provide complete coverage of all unfair trading activity and in some cases are too complex or costly. At a time when the consumer is increasingly well-protected and the interests of the public and shareholders are being looked at under the corporate governance review, it is unfortunate that similar steps are not being taken in relation to general trading practices. William King, Macfarlanes, 10 Norwich Street, London EC4A 1BD</p>

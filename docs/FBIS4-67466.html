			<p>BFN     [Text] In the province of Savona, 11,000 drums containing  dangerous toxic waste have been discovered in the town of  Borghetto Santo Spirito. Alfredo Livi reports:    [Livi] These drums, which have been crammed into this  immense  concrete cistern, contain 13,000 tonnes of hazardous waste.  They were buried in this pit in Borghetto Santo Spirito, which  is on the Ligurian Riviera in the province of Savona. This is  the largest find of this type in northern Italy, perhaps in the  whole of Italy. The hazardous material, contained in 11,000  drums which have been reduced to scrap, was leaking into the  water table.    At this immense illegal tip, the men behind this trade in  hazardous waste accepted material which certain industries  wanted to get rid of in a hurry. Acting on the complaint made  by a brave mayor, a team of judges from Savona uncovered the  trade and the illegal tip. However, technicians from Castalia,  the state- controlled environmental company which is cleaning up  the site, have discovered that the situation is far worse than  at first thought.    It will cost the local authorities 10 billion lire to clean  up this ecological timebomb. It is estimated that the men  behind the illegal trade made 50 or 60 billion lire.    The dump discovered in Borghettto Santo Spirito is just the  tip of the iceberg.</p>

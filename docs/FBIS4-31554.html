			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign </F> affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Julius  Loerincz in Belgrade; date not given: "The War Has Reopened Old  Wounds and Opened New Ones"]    [Text] Originally, 40 minutes were reserved for my  meeting with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign affairs of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. But both of us were so  absorbed in conversation that it took 25 minutes longer than  scheduled. While the interview we publish is fairly extensive,  it actually represents only a fraction of the comprehensive  debate with this experienced 61-year-old member of the  government, who has been active in diplomacy and in the foreign  service since 1957.    [Loerincz] It is being said that the key to solving the  crisis in the Yugoslav space lies in Serb-Croat relations. Does  the opening of a Yugoslav representative office in Zagreb and of  a Croatian representative office in Belgrade herald the coming  of better days? Or are those who believe that overly optimistic  because far more serious problems in these relations are waiting  for a solution?    [Jovanovic] It is the first step toward the normalization of  relations. As far as we are concerned, we are interested in  this process [of normalization] taking place as fast as  possible. We are prepared even now to recognize Croatia in the  borders that it controls, on the understanding that the question  of the Serbian Krajina would be put aside for the time being,  until Zagreb and Knin (main center of the republic Serbian  Krajina -- editor's note) find in mutual negotiations a final  political solution to their relations. This is in keeping with  the plan of Cyrus Vance, which emphasizes its own temporary  nature and does not prejudice any future political solution.  Theoretically, this does not rule out the possibility of the  expansion of the recognition of Croatia from the viewpoint of  borders in the future. Croatia evidently approaches the  question of normalization of relations with us differently and  understands it as a means toward its recognition in its former  borders as established by the Antifascist Council of National  Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ, that is, the borders as they  emerged from the national liberation struggle during World War  II). However, for us this would mean defiance of the will of the  population of Serbian Krajina. Only they are entitled to decide  on their future, not we. For the time being, however, we could  develop mutually advantageous relations in other areas, without  allowing the disputed Krajina issue to complicate them.    [Loerincz] But at least two partners are needed for such  relations to be developed....    [Jovanovic] It seems that Croatia is not prepared for this,  as it is trying right from the beginning to politicize the  process of normalization of relations with the Krajina. The  final political solution must be achieved in the third and final  phase of the whole process. Precisely because this phase will  be the most important and the most sensitive one, it must be  preceded by phase one and phase two: an end to hostility and  normalization of economic relations. These two phases must  establish good conditions for the successful start and, I hope,  also a successful conclusion of the aforementioned third phase.    [Loernicz] Some analysts believe that the issue of Kosovo in  the south of Serbia, which is inhabited largely by Albanians,  could be tackled in some analogous way. In other words, if  Serbian Krajina seceded from Croatia, would Kosovo also secede  from Serbia?    [Jovanovic] Kosovo should not be mixed up with the elements  of the Yugoslav crisis because it is not a constituent element  of this crisis. It is a typical example of the separatism of  one ethnic minority and this problem arose many years before the  Yugoslav crisis even broke out. In the Yugoslav crisis one has  to address the problems bequeathed by the breaking away of four  republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and  Bosnia-Herzegovina). Krajina is one of these problems -- it  arose as a result of the one-sided breaking away of Croatia from  Yugoslavia and of the denial of the Serbs' constitutional rights  in Croatia.    [Loerincz] In your opinion, the problems of Kosovo should  thus be dealt with exclusively as an internal Yugoslav issue, so  to speak?    [Jovanovic] Kosovo has always been an organic part of  Serbia, it is actually the cradle of Serbian statehood, church,  and literature. It has never been part of any Albanian state.  Therefore, there does not exist any historical or moral reason  to consider Kosovo's secession and possible annexation to  Albania. Also, there is no method of carrying this out, except  by declaring war on the whole Serbian nation....    We respect our Albanian fellow citizens and apply toward  them  the same equal attitude as in relation to all citizens of  Yugoslavia. The Serbian Constitution is based on the civic  principle and defines Serbia as a state of equal nations, not as  the state of the Serbian nation. When our Albanians rid  themselves of the spell of separatism and start exercising the  rights they have, they can, within 24 hours, become active in  democratic institutions and realize their rights through them.    [Loerincz] You mentioned that the Constitution defines  Serbia as a state of citizens, which is surely positive.  However, the more than 60,000 Slovaks in Vojvodina, for  example, who had settled there 250 years ago and who made their  contribution to the creation of Yugoslavia, are being confronted  with acts of extremists who tell them: "Go back where you came  from."    [Jovanovic] What you are saying is the work of extremist  right-wing and nationalist groups. These things used to happen,  in particular, at the time when the Yugoslav crisis broke out  and when the war in the Krajina and in Bosnia had exceptionally  dramatic dimensions. Many frustrated and embittered refugees  came to Serbia, among whom feelings of revenge and retribution  became manifest. They received support also from individuals and  groups in Serbia but this was marginal and ran counter to our  policy.    The threats you mention, which were addressed not only to  Slovaks but also to Hungarians, are absolutely inadmissible and  we have taken steps against them. But they need not be  generalized. We regard Slovaks as loyal and hard-working people  who mean much for the cultural wealth of our community.    [Loerincz] Do you think that the proposal for the partition  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under which the Muslim-Croat federation  is to receive 51 percent and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent [of  territory], is a good and just solution? Is the coexistence of  Serbs, Muslims, and Croats even still possible?    [Jovanovic] You know, the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats come  essentially from one nation and speak the same language. We are  people of the same blood and have the same merits and the same  weaknesses. Unfortunately, the virus of nationalism incited  from abroad managed to destroy coexistence in  Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fratricidal war has brought new  divisions, reopened wounds from the last, far more drastic war,  and opened new wounds. Much effort will therefore be needed  both in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself and from us beyond its borders  in order to create foundations for the renewal of coexistence.  We will always remain brothers regardless of past and present  fighting there, regardless of how much hatred there is. I  believe that foreign interests have caused much evil and are the  main reason for there still being no peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces from outside Europe, in particular,  want this continent to be weakened by the prolongation of the  crisis and the continuation of sanctions. Let us not forget  that while the Serbs in Bosnia supported the plan of the  European Union, this plan was rejected by the Muslim side, after  it received signals from the Americans, Turkey, and other  Islamic countries.    [Loerincz] The leading representative of Bosnian Muslims,  Alija Izetbegovic, has repeatedly called for the preservation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multinational and multicultural state.    [Jovanovic] Mr. Izetbegovic is a well-known Islamic  fundamentalist. In December 1991, still before the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he declared on television that he was ready  to sacrifice peace for the sake of Bosnia-Herzegovina's  independence. Politicians who say things like that are usually  taken to a psychiatric ward. But the world did not react at  that time. Izetbegovic has now again said something scandalous.  Supposedly, the Serbs can never kill as many Muslims as Muslim  mothers and fathers will beget. This is typical fundamentalist  thinking and reminds me of Khomeyni, who used to send children  into war in the awareness that they would perish.    [Loerincz] What then is the way out of this war? Could a  solution lie in the aforementioned partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in a ratio of 51 to 49?    [Jovanovic] It is not the best solution in all its parts but  the Bosnian Serbs have accepted it and I would like to draw  attention to the fact that at one time, at the talks on the  Invincible aircraft carrier in the Adriatic, it had also been  accepted by the Muslims and Croats, Yugoslavia, and the European  Union. Personally, I do not think that percentages are the most  important thing but, rather, the readiness and goodwill to  achieve a reasonable compromise. The Bosnian Serbs have been  prepared for it for two years, ever since they offered territory  for peace sometime in June or July 1992, which they confirmed in  written form to Lord Carrington. The offer, which concerned the  exchange of 20 percent of the territory under their control for  peace, is still valid today.    [Loerincz] Extensive sanctions against Yugoslavia have been  applied for two years now. One of the arguments for their  introduction and tightening was that Yugoslavia had its troops  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This turned out not to be true, however.  What then is the aim of the sanctions?    [Jovanovic] Germany and the then European Community  introduced the sanctions eight months before the war in Bosnia  with the aim of forcing the rest of Yugoslavia to dissolve  itself. All parts of Yugoslavia were to accept this, establish  new states, and request international recognition. This part  (Serbia and Montenegro), which represents one-half of former  Yugoslavia, did not agree to that. It said: "You cannot deprive  us of our homeland. This is our state. True, it has been  reduced in size by the others' departure, but it is still our  state." It is for this reason that we were punished by  sanctions. We made ourselves guilty by refusing to renounce our  own country, by not being willing to disintegrate, which was  needed, in particular, by Germany.    [Loerincz] After Germany's unification?    [Jovanovic] Yes. It quickly started to carry out its  political and economic expansion, particularly in those  directions, in which it previously tried to expand by military  means. It forced its position on the then European Community.  New sanctions, or their expansion and tightening, were then  justified by the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which we  are supposedly responsible. Yet it is the coalition of Bosnian  Muslims and Croats that bears responsibility for the civil war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was this coalition that violated the  constitution of this republic in the parliament of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and deprived the Serbs of the right to  constitutionality [ustavotvornost] and the right to consensus.  The referendum that took place on the issue of  Bosnia-Herzegovina's independence was based on the majority  principle, which runs counter to the principle of consensus.  This meant the trampling underfoot of the Constitution and of  the Serbs' rights. Western countries then very quickly  recognized the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the  declaration of independence did not have the support of  one-third of the population. That led to civil war, for which  it was necessary to find a scapegoat.    [Loerincz] Are you suggesting that the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia has become this scapegoat?    [Jovanovic] Exactly, although it was precisely Yugoslavia  that accepted all the four major peace plans for a solution to  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Serbs have  accepted three of them, rejecting only the Vance-Owen plan for  the cantonization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic has  accepted only one of them, precisely the one that was rejected  by the Bosnian Serbs. He apparently did so for tactical reasons.    Croatia had its regular troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which  were involved in fighting there. But no one called Croatia to  account and no one punished it because of this. This is a case  of double standards, which are practiced also by Turkey, which  finances, arms, and incites Bosnian Muslims, or Iran, which  violates the embargo on supplies of weapons to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Loerincz] Is a certain one-sidedness on the part of some  media, which sees all evil on the Serbian side, not part of the  policy of sanctions?    [Jovanovic] The media blockade against the Serbian nation  had been organized even before the Yugoslav crisis broke out, by  separatists and their foreign helpers, who at that time came  mostly from the German-speaking bloc and from the Vatican. They  systematically created an inaccurate and extremely biased image  of Yugoslavia where, supposedly, democracy is possible only when  support is given to the breaking away of some republics.  According to this image, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serbian  nation are by their very nature negative, conservative,  demagogic, narrow-minded in their ideology, and seeking hegemony  over others. Sympathy for Slovenia and Croatia and antipathy  for Serbs were being built on this [image]. We underestimated  this because we believed that Yugoslavia would exist forever.  Following these preparations, the separatists went on the  offensive against Yugoslavia at a time when the cold war ended  and the Soviet Union fell apart. It was a "blitzkrieg," in  which they broke up one country.    [Loerincz] Relations between our states and between Slovaks  and Serbs, Montenegrins, and the other Yugoslav nations have a  long tradition. They were close and multifaceted already in the  19th century. How do you view the present and prospects of  relations between Slovakia and Yugoslavia?    [Jovanovic] This traditional friendship, forged frequently  in critical moments of history, lives in our memories and  hearts. I am thinking here of both the Czech and the Slovak  people. In 1938 my brother, like many others, volunteered to go  and defend then Czechoslovakia.    Slovakia is perhaps even closer to us, which is surely true  geographically and linguistically. We have similar geostrategic  experience. We are Danube nations and have many reasons to  develop friendship and cooperation. That is why, immediately  after the declaration of Slovakia's independence, we proposed  opening an embassy in your country -- your embassy in Belgrade  operates already. However, we have not yet received your  government's agreement. It would be in the interest of our  nations and of peace and stability in this part of Europe. It  would also be in the interest of greater mutual understanding,  for there is not enough of this after everything that has  happened in our region.</p>

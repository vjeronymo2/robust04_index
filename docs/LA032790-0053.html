			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH;  </P> <P> GAS COMPANY BEGINS RECYCLING  </P> <P> Southern California Gas Co. on Monday announced that its previously wasted  heaps of white paper scrap -- memos, letters, and assorted bureaucratic  leftovers -- will be separated and recycled in a model program that officials  hope other businesses will imitate. But in fact, such recycling programs are  now "very common throughout Los Angeles," said Joan Edwards, director of the  city's integrated solid waste management office.  </P> <P> "Many paper dealers offer this service. It's their bread and butter." A news  conference in Chatsworth featured Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus  helping to dump sheets of used white paper into a large bin for collection by a  private recycling contractor. Under the plan, used white paper from the gas  company office will be sold to the recycler, with a portion of the money going  to a volunteer service organization in Van Nuys.  </P></p>

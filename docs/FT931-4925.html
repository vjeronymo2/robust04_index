			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: More Britten at the Barbican - Weekend music in London It cannot be often that the audience at a music festival can be drawn to a programme of films about miners and postmen. The Barbican's recent study weekends devoted to the works of single composers have ferreted out some interesting fringe items for the cinema and the present Festival of Britten is no exception. On Sunday three short documentaries with scores by Britten were shown in Cinema 3. They are early works, mere bread-and-butter earnings perhaps, but bold, inventive, adventurous. Coal Face - an educational film dating from the 1930s about the coal industry's pivotal place in the British economy (how times change]) - is astonishingly modern in its aim of creating music out of the sounds of industrial tools and equipment, even coal tumbling down a chute. Encountering out-of-the-way pieces like these widens one's appreciation of how far ahead of his time the young Britten was. There is a theory recently given air-time on Channel 4 that, in later life, Britten became too much part of the establishment and in some way less true to himself. With so much of his music on offer, it should be possible to come to some overall view of his output before this month-long festival reaches its close. Certainly the music of the 1930s hits hard in a way that makes some of Britten's later work sound unduly comfortable by comparison. The main evening concert at the Barbican Hall on Sunday included the Violin Concerto of 1940. This has always seemed to me the strongest of all his orchestral works, a score with a troubling blend of disquiet and foreboding that gives it an atmosphere all of its own. Mark Lubotsky, violinist on the composer's own recording, was the pithy, occasionally uncertain, visiting soloist. There really is little comparison in the quality of this music and the sentimental pseudo-Elizabethan pastiche that makes up the Suite from Gloriana of 1953, which opened the concert. As for the Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, that can claim professionalism in its defence, though it does sound better when played less heavily than it was here by Mstislav Rostropovich, conductor and architect of the festival. No complaints about the concert as a whole, however. For at its centre was a moving account of the Serenade for tenor, horn and strings, in which Rostropovich's fondness for loving all the music he performs to excess did pay dividends. Barry Tuckwell was the exemplary solo horn (we are lucky still to have these associates of Britten with us) and Anthony Rolfe Johnson sang the tenor part with such infinite sensitivity that the few moments of strain will not be mentioned. For its part the London Symphony Orchestra would seem to be enjoying another first-rate festival. On Thursday Rostropovich had appeared as solo cellist, the role in which Britten knew him. Perhaps his technique is no longer the dazzling, note-perfect facility which inspired the daunting difficulties of the Solo Cello Suites from the composer, but he still plays them (the Third, on this occasion) with an intensity that is out of the reach of his successors. The Cello Sonata, accompanied with light-fingered grace by Ian Brown, also washed over with feeling. Britten only met Rostropovich in 1960 and so the music that he wrote for him dates from relatively late in his life. By and large they are works with a renewed sense of purpose and individuality. As our knowledge of his music grows, I am prepared to lay claim that it is Britten's middle years which will eventually be seen as his weaker period. Festival of Britten continues at the Barbican until March 21 (Box Office 071-638 8891)</p>

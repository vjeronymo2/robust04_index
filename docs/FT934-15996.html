			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / An offer that investors could scarcely refuse: The pricing of the first French privatisation French economy ministry officials could barely disguise their glee when they announced on Wednesday that the FFr8.3bn (Pounds 960m) institutional tranche of the Banque Nationale de Paris share sale had attracted applications for FFr100bn of shares in just two days, and was closing a week ahead of schedule. The reason for BNP's appeal is obvious - the offer price. Analysts had been expecting a share price of between FFr250 and FFr275 for BNP. But the government pitched it at only FFr240, valuing BNP, one of Europe's biggest banks, at FFr43bn. BNP is the first of up to 21 companies scheduled for privatisation. The issue will set the tone for the other sales. Yet the closure of the institutional issue prompted the accusation that the government was over-cautious. 'Is the price too low? Of course it is,' said Mr Thierry Tamers, head of North American equity sales at Baring Securities in Paris. 'But it was not a financial calculation, it was political scheming. The Balladur government can't afford to risk its first privatisation being a fiasco.' There are several reasons to believe the price was set too low. The most obvious is that the only tradeable shares in BNP, the non-voting Certificats d'Investissements, yesterday closed at FFr282. As it will cost CI holders FFr5 to buy voting rights, this implies a share price of FFr287. Second, the strength of capital flows from US and Japan means that a more tightly priced issue would still have attracted interest. 'It was not so much under-valuation as the fact that there is a lot of capital around,' said Mr James Alexander, an analyst at Daiwa. Third, BNP shares some characteristics with banks which have drawn investor interest in the US and the UK. That is, it is suffering from asset quality problems and indifferent management, but has strong recovery potential. Evidence is provided by the pricing of the equity at 78 per cent of net asset value, compared with a 120 per cent valuation for Societe Generale, which is regarded as better run. According to this view, the installation of Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman will allow BNP to release some of the value trapped in its large franchise. Reforms such as cost-cutting and refocusing the business should combine with falling provisions to allow a sharp recovery. However, other analysts argue that the government would have been unwise to price the issue closer to the level implied by the CI value. One reason is that BNP's share price could yet fall. The second is that there are larger questions about privatisation at stake. The rally in bank shares this year might come to grief. Investors have already discounted considerable earnings recovery, and some analysts regard French banks as over-priced compared with those of other countries. Shares of banks such as National Westminster, in the UK, and Citicorp, in the US, have rallied as investors have calculated the potential recovery in earnings, as burdens of bad debt fall away. These 'normalised' earnings levels - expected in two or three years - are similar to late 1980s figures. The ratio of share prices to bank earnings in France are already more demanding than in some other European markets. The multiple for BNP CIs last year was 17.4, compared with an average multiple for Spanish banks, which have performed better than French ones, of 7.7. This implies that French bank shares are at least capable of a correction later in the year. This is particularly true given the poor state of the French banking market, which is suffering heavily from poor asset quality in the recession. The government's need to allow a suitable margin is made more pressing by the fact that investors in future privatisations will be able to see BNP's fortunes. 'The government isn't an ordinary seller,' said Mr Thierry Aualgnon, the Tresor official in charge of privatisation. 'It needs to maximise the revenue from its entire programme.' The Balladur government badly needs the income from its proposed share sales to stem its rising budget deficit. Official estimates suggest the deficit will reach FFr317bn this year. However, private sector economists suspect it could go higher. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers, expects this year's deficit to grow to FFr345bn. The government is also aware that it faces competition from other European privatisations - the estimated total value is Dollars 100bn. Finally, it may have been concerned about public ambivalence towards share ownership. France's last privatisation drive was halted by the October 1987 crash. The misgivings this caused helped cut the number of individual investors from 5.5m to 4.5m. This helps to explain why the administration opted for a safe BNP price. But some analysts are concerned that investors will have been encouraged to expect similarly low prices for other issues, thereby raising the risk of reduced returns. 'Everyone loves a great deal,' said Baring's Mr Tamers. 'But the BNP issue might have set a bad precedent in that the market may expect sharp discounts for the other privatisations.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANK FOR SALE, GOING CHEAP?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Market     Assets end      Pre-tax   Return on                Capitalisation           1992      profits      assets                  (Dollars bn)    (Dollars bn)   (Dollars)    Per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BNP                     7.6           284.8        680m         0.24 Deutsche               22.5           303.8      2.32bn         0.76 National Westminster   13.2           216.5        612m         0.28 Citicorp               14.6           211.9      1.43bn         0.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream, The Banker  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

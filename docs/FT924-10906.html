			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading ONE large deal provided a boost to an otherwise tranquil options market yesterday, writes Peter John. While most dealers were rolling over positions ahead of expiry of the October series, one marketmaker crossed the equivalent of more than 19m BP shares, The trade was so big that the SEAQ electronic trading system was unable to report it in the normal way and had to carry a special announcement. It represented a cross of 19,250 October 160 calls. Each call cost the equivalent of 76p a share and provided the buyer with the right to purchase underlying stock today at 160p a share - a total price of 236p. The business was carried out by independent trading house Monument Derivatives and was said to represent intra-market business rather than a fundamental change of view. Elsewhere, the most heavily traded stock options will all see their October series expire today. The exception was bank HSBC which has seen sharp rises in the cash market as a result of currency shifts. It was the fourth most active stock option. Total option volume was 48,170 lots. Meanwhile, the FT-SE 100 index contract for December opened weak and slipped back quickly on the back of a weaker pound. Then, a rumour developed that a 2 per cent cut in UK interest raters was imminent. December picked up sharply to close at 2,710, 40 points above cash and at a 20-point premium to fair value.</p>

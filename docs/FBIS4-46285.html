			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of an "exclusive" two-part interview with Shaykh </F> Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, Chairman of the Higher Islamic  Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT  correspondent; place, date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] Can you clarify  the effects of the imposed peace in the Middle East and the  negligent attitude of some governments toward confronting the  effects of this imposed war in the Middle East?    [Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] In view of the fact that  the  designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in  Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained  defeat. [passage omitted] However, defeat does not mean that we  have lost all our means of defense. I stress that the ummah has  not used all its offensive resources but has merely suspended  the use of its means for defense. [passage omitted]    Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has  failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where  the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran,  which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the  political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the  Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the  infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks. [passage  omitted]    Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and  has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality  in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist  it instead. [passage omitted on World War I]    The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not  a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The  Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the  thick of international interests; right from the outset, the  ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a  struggle spanning many generations.    A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this  strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does  not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle  of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three  generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have  many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have  to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a  worldwide plot.    This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs  thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It  is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert  itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited  to a single generation.</p>

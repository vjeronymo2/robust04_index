			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / French franc under pressure: European central banks intervene in support of parity with D-mark THE BUNDESBANK and the Bank of France yesterday intervened to support the French franc, as weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism came under pressure after the holiday break. The franc moved closer to its ERM floor against the D-Mark, as dealers speculated on the possibility that the French currency could be devalued. The French and German central banks have repeatedly said the current ERM parity is unbreakable. The punt also came under renewed pressure on the first full day of trading after the Republic of Ireland's abolition of exchange controls on January 1. The punt fell to its floor against the Belgian franc, one of the strongest currencies in the ERM. Ireland's one-week interbank lending rate rose to 45 per cent from 15 per cent. Yesterday's show of strength by the D-Mark against the franc came in spite of a powerful rally by the dollar. Buoyed by very good US economic indicators over Christmas and new year, the dollar hit DM1.6413 at one point. It later closed at DM1.6365, its highest close in Europe since last summer and finished New York trading at 1.63895. Central bank intervention in support of the franc was estimated to be modest. By the close of European trading, the franc was at FFr3.419 against the D-Mark, still more than a centime above its ERM floor. In New York it closed at FFr3.4127, and in early trading in the Far East levelled off at FFr3.4138. 'There are relatively few strong sellers but no one is buying and anyone holding francs has been anxious to cover their position,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'Whenever the franc recovers, investors switch to D-Marks.' The franc's weakness was accompanied by a sharp rise in French money market rates, with overnight rates going as high as 13 1/2 per cent yesterday morning before falling back to 12 per cent. Official French rates were not increased although further rises in money market rates might make this unavoidable. Yesterday's intervention followed weeks of currency speculation in which both central banks supported the currency. The Bundesbank's decision not to lower official rates did not relieve pressure on the franc. In Ireland, the Central Bank apparently indicated to clearing banks that 'extremely punitive rates' would be imposed on banks left 'short' of funds, having lent to borrowers for speculative purposes. Market analysts, economists and business leaders broadly agree that the economy would be damaged if current interest rate levels persist.

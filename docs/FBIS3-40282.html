			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview With Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo </F> Crvenkovski by Zaneta Skerlev; place and date not given: "The  Strategic Interest of Macedonia Is -- Macedonia"]    [Text] [Skerlev] There have many public commentaries saying  your ministry is introverted. Will secrecy continue to be the  manner of the work of the Ministry for Foreign Relations?    [Crvenkovski] Secrecy is characteristic of all foreign  ministries in the world; therefore, that principle will also be  there in the future to a certain extent. What is evident, if you  have followed the events over the years, is that for a while  there have been practically no secrets. There was also a period  when we really cut off almost all information. If we compare the  results of the two periods, I think we easily realise which of  the two was better for the role and place of Macedonia in the  international community.    [Skerlev] Is it not somewhat naive to believe that the  public, or whatever is published in our mass media, was the  Greek Government's real source of information on the actions we  were going to take? Your predecessor once said that was the  reason why they were always "one step ahead of us," as  justification for secrecy in the work. They probably have their  own sources, and our public has the right to be informed.    [Crvenkovski] Anyway, it is far from true that any diplomacy  uses the newspapers as its source of information; there are  certainly many other sources of information available. Every  country, including our own, has many friends in international  communications who assist in getting information.    [Skerlev] If secrecy is characteristic of periods when  something is in preparation, what preparations are underway for  the Greek-Macedonian negotiations, since there is no other  information except the public's general worries?    [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to say that,  regarding secrecy, an image has been created that we have less  information than Greece. If you take a closer look, there are  many pieces of false information! And they are accepted by our  public, despite our frequent warnings they are false and untrue.  It is necessary to follow up cautiously not only the quantity,  but also the quality, of information, in order to see the  attitude of the public to a certain ministry.    As far as the negotiations with Greece are concerned, there  are no secrets at all. We have clearly expressed our interest in  resuming the negotiations in New York, and in December we had a  meeting with Mr. Cyrus Vance, who was directly informed about  our interest. Before that, we stated the same thing to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- all this was published,  as were the contents of the letter, and there were no secrets  there. There is nothing else. Not only are there no secrets, but  there is nothing more than that.    [Skerlev] According to the Greek press and the statements of  their current politicians on different compromises and  concessions, it seems that there is "something"? Has Macedonia  received signals about a possible change in the Greek attitude  toward our country?    [Crvenkovski] I could not say whether and how much their  attitude has changed, because it cannot be known before we sit  down and listen to what they have to say. What is probably a  fact, for a cautious observer of the events, is that both sides  are maturing in the knowledge that good relations between the  two countries are indispensable for both countries. How will  that knowledge be reflected in some concrete actions in future  is something we will have to wait and see. At this moment, since  a continuation in the process of negotiation is missing, it is  difficult to assess the real positions and the possible changes.    On the other hand, we have not yet received any official  information on the resumption of negotiations from the mediator.    [Skerlev] Do we expect the relations with Greece to be  solved  first on the political plane and only then starting with the  development of the economic, cultural, scientific, and other  relations, or, are they going to be insisted upon as the basis  for solving the political disputes?    [Crvenkovski] I think that all spheres of cooperation with  Greece are open and they have to be utilized. What we have  clearly stated everywhere is that our policy is to be open with  all, particularly with our neighbors. There should be no  obstacles to cooperation.    [Skerlev] Are there any initiatives on such a cooperation  from the Greek side?    [Crvenkovski] I do not know about initiatives on levels  other  than those that we are engaged in and that are within our  competence. However, I can see there are a lot of contacts of  businessmen, intellectuals, journalists. All forms of contact  and cooperation can contribute to overcoming the problems.    [Skerlev] Lately, a great number of U.S. politicians and  high  army officers visited Macedonia. Is the promotion of the level  of diplomatic relations between the two countries in sight?    [Crvenkovski] We have daily visits, not only by U.S.  personalities, but from practically all over the world, which is  a sign that interest in Macedonia is growing. Not only the  interest of the United States, but of almost all important  countries. Regarding relations with the United States, there  exists a very clear continuity. Since the beginning of the  process of our independence, we have received express support  for the territorial integrity of Macedonia and for the stability  of the country. I would also say that bilateral relations are  developing according to a logical schedule. The level of  contacts improve daily, the opening of the office in Skopje was  a logical step, as well as the December meeting at the level of  foreign ministers. That office will most probably be enlarged  with new diplomats. It is sure that relations will be improved  following that logical development. However, anticipating the  dynamics of the development of relations can be an ungrateful  job.    [Skerlev] What is, in your opinion, the reason for this  intensified interest in Macedonia, particularly in the context  of the different theories on spheres of interest?    [Crvenkovski] There appear to be various speculations in the  public on different spheres of interest, different alliances of  countries interested in having influence of one type or another  on this territory. I must say that these speculations are mainly  dominated by concepts of the 19th and the first half of the 20th  century. The strategic interest in Macedonia at this moment is  the fact that we have promoted a new model of relations. In the  external, but mainly in the internal policy. In extremely  difficult surroundings, in extremely difficult conditions, with  a war raging in the neighborhood, with blockades, and with a  growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans, as in the greater number  of postcommunist countries, we offered a model contrary to that  leading to conflicts and wars.    The success of the model of stability, with the help of all  groups and structures in society, through the opening of  economic and democratic areas, is of strategic interest and it  is of great interest to the United States and Europe, as well as  to the whole democratic world. In that sense, Macedonia has got  an extraordinary strategic interest of the type that dominates  at the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century.    [Skerlev] Do you think that foreign policy is sufficiently  engaged in the economy, first of all in making up for the  damages caused by the sanctions, and how great an accent is  placed on economic relations in the ministry?    [Crvenkovski] The sanctions have been our main subject in  all  our international activities. Practically, there has not been a  meeting in which the sanctions were not the first point on the  agenda. However, in all the statements we have made, we were  explicit in saying that overall compensation up for the  sanctions is an illusion deriving from great hopes. What we  succeeded in was to open a process in the United Nations with  the Security Council Resolution with which the countries members  were called to help Macedonia. We succeeded in arousing the  interest of the international financial organizations in  undertaking concrete actions. We have made an agreement with the  IMF and we have signed an arrangement that has, so far, been the  most favorable arrangement signed by the IMF with any country.  The IMF has signed up such an arrangement only with Russia and  Macedonia! It opens doors for negotiations with the Paris Club  regarding the regulation of Macedonia's debts, thus opening a  normal process of banking communication on a commercial level.    What is worth mentioning about the economic situation in  Macedonia is that we frequently talk about the sanctions, but  even without them, we would have been faced with a very  difficult situation. Normally, it was due to the break-up of the  old Yugoslav market, but primarily due to the break-up of the  whole Eastern European market. The establishment of relations  will be carried out slowly, not because of us, but because of  the situation in the Eastern European countries. Frankly  speaking, the economic situation in Macedonia, as well as the  standard, the level of currency stability, are far from the  situation in all these countries.    A year and a half ago, or two years ago, the main question  asked by the international public relating to Macedonia was  whether this country was capable of surviving economically. That  was before the sanctions. When it became clear that Macedonia  was surviving despite the sanctions and the blockades from the  south -- that it was paying a much higher price, but surviving  economically and politically, the image about Macedonia and the  interest in Macedonia changed. Despite everything, we  demonstrated that we were capable of surviving economically in  abnormal conditions, paying a very high price. Thus the image  of, and the interest in, Macedonia was suddenly changed in the  international community and they could all see a new model.  Although that model was promoted, and it turned out to be  successful, it will spread to other countries at a slow pace.  Even the strategic position of this region can be changed.  Because of all that, a country with a 2 million population is  playing a far, far greater role in the international policy and  in the interest of the international community than it was  expected to, bearing in mind its size and importance in the  region.    [Skerlev] What are the new developments in relation to the  announced extension of the Macedonian diplomatic net throughout  the world, and in that context, the main subject -- the  appointment of ambassadors.    [Crvenkovski] Very soon, we shall open two or three offices.  In a greater number of countries we have our offices -- of  course, we are now raising offices to the level of embassies.  However, I can see that a false image has been created in the  public on this issue, that we shall have embassies wherever we  have established diplomatic relations. This will certainly not  be the case, for many reasons. First of all, due to the  financial conditions, because running offices is very expensive.  Moreover, also because, today, a great number of countries have  established a different model of diplomatic services, which we  think will also be suitable for our state. It means that, in  many countries, ambassadors of another friendly country in the  region can hold our letter of accredition. Also, and perhaps the  most frequent solution applied by Sweden for decades, slowly  accepted by others, is to have accredited ambassadors located in  Skopje, in the ministry. Therefore, the greatest number of  countries will be thus covered.    There is another thing that we are going to make the first  practical action, and I consider it has to be spread very much  and very fast, which is -- the appointment of honorary consuls.  That is the cheapest and the most efficient way to implement  services for our citizens abroad. The honorary consuls will be  nominated, first of all, by the citizens of the host countries,  therefore not by our citizens living abroad.    [Skerlev] Nevertheless, you will agree that it is in the  interests of Macedonia, is it not, to have real embassies in  some countries, despite the financial restrictions.... Where  will we have embassies?    [Crvenkovski] The five countries that are permanent members  of the UN Security Council will have to have embassies, and we  have not yet established diplomatic relations with some of them.  Those countries are: the United States, Russia, France, Great  Britain, and China. Germany and Japan also, of course, because  they are countries of economic and political importance. After  that, the countries with a great number of our people, like  Canada and Australia, the Scandinavian countries, which will be  most probably covered from one center, Switzerland because of  its double role -- the bilateral relations and the relations  with the United Nations, that is with the specialized UN  agencies, and of course, the neighboring countries.    [Skerlev] In the course of this year, the validity of the  old  Yugoslav passports expires, and only the Macedonian passports  will be valid. However, there are many countries, for instance  the Latin American, African, and some Asian countries, from  which the ministry has not received information about the  recognition of the Macedonian passport.    [Crvenkovski] The ministry has received information from all  those countries that have regulated the status of the Macedonian  passport. It is true that some of the countries from Latin  America and Africa have not yet regulated that status. We are  now in contact with a greater number of those countries and we  believe that this process will be completed in the near future.    At this moment, apart from a number of neighboring countries  with which we know well the problem about our passports, it has  been accepted by all other European countries. The Macedonian  passport has been recognized by the United States, Canada, and  by almost all Asian countries. Nevertheless, a number of  countries that we are now establishing contact with have not  sent official information, but the practice has shown that, just  after the establishment of contacts, there are no more problems,  and this issue is easily regulated. We are expecting the  imminent recognition of our passport, which is perhaps above the  average compared to the other countries that started regulating  their status at the same time.    [Skerlev] How did a movie director [Crvenkovski's previous  profession] succeed, in your opinion, in dealing with the policy  of foreign affairs? And where do your ambitions lead -- policy,  diplomacy, or directing?    [Crvenkovski] Many people with different previous  professions  can cope with policy. A great number of foreign ministers used  to be chemists in their previous lives. And there are rare  ministers who were previously engaged in professional diplomacy.  I would not like to talk about the way I manage it. The  directing and my present profession have, I would say, a certain  link -- communication with people and the assessment of the  effects on the people of communication.    I will, by no means, give up directing. I have come to this  present function without any previous plans, and now, at this  moment, the situation is such that I do not have enough time to  plan my future. However, if I shoot a film one day, it will  certainly not be a political film. That has been my  determination since the days of my study, and the longer I deal  with policy, the more I believe that my determination was right.  <H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5> <H5>  Macedonia on the World Map </H5>   [Skerlev] The critics of Macedonian foreign policy, among  other things, often use as an important argument the fact that a  great number of countries have recognized us by the name of  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the way in which we were  admitted to the United Nations, and they say the happiness and  satisfaction over the admission and recognition have been  decreased because of that.    [Crvenkovski] I do not know how much the satisfaction has  been decreased, because satisfaction and emotions were not at  stake, but it was necessary to put the Republic of Macedonia on  the world map and to enable its function as a state! Survival  was at stake. There are a number of organizations within the  United Nations system without which a state cannot function, and  those organizations regulate telecommunications, post office  services, railways, air traffic, and if you are not a member of  those organizations, you cannot function as a state in the  world. You cannot travel, companies cannot include themselves in  commercial cooperation, they cannot transport goods, banks and  financial institutions cannot function, and the IMF is most  important.    It was practically demonstrated that membership in the  United  Nations was of the utmost importance.    What is of interest from that period, for those assessments,  as well as for relations in the foreign policy is that, from a  period when foreign policy was attacked from all sides and with  all possible means, and when the attacks against it were a daily  subject in Macedonia, we have now moved to a situation in which  the attacks are concentrated on one or two issues, and are of no  great intensity. Therefore, if you take a look at what has been  going on in Parliament over the past year, you will see that  there have been no real criticism of the foreign policy.</p>

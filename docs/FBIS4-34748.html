			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Justice Minister Carlos Amat  Fores has announced that Cuba will increase activities aimed at  stopping the use of its airspace and territorial waters by  international drug traffickers to ship drugs to the U.S.  consumer market.    Cuba is waging a merciless fight against drug traffickers,  Amat said in an interview with BOHEMIA magazine. In the  interview, Amat stressed Cuba's willigness to cooperate with  other nations in combating the trafficking of hallucinogens.    Amat said the island's adverse economic situation following  the loss of its traditional markets in the former European  socialist camp has not noticeably affected the nation's drug  prevention programs.    On the contrary, by virtue of our experience and the maximum  use of our available resources, we have increased our  effectiveness and zeal in surveillance, Amat remarked.    Amat said that because of its geographic position, Cuba is  located on a direct line between the world's main drug consumer  market -- the United States -- and the primary drug producing  regions in South America.    He said drug traffickers are continuing their modus operandi  in Cuba, mainly tossing packages of drugs into the sea to be  picked up later by accomplices. Frequently, these packages are  carried by the ocean currents onto the island's shores.    Amat said that last year, a total of 79 packages containing  3,364.39 kg of drugs washed up on Cuban beaches. This  represented a 104 percent increase over 1992.    In terms of international cooperation in the fight against  this scourge, he pointed out that over the past two years, Cuba  has signed agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, Barbados, Guyana,  and Argentina, as well as a letter of intent with Colombia.    Amat said some unofficial contacts have continued with the  United States. These contacts have resulted in certain kinds of  bilateral cooperation, such as the exchange of information and  evidence, and even the handing over of people implicated in a  drug trafficking case. Amat said: We think U.S. professionals  in this field are more and more interested in these  relationships, and so are we.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):  Match point for Britain's top-seeded strawberries - The Wimbledon Championships provide an ideal showcase for the best of the home-grown crop ALL UK strawberry growers are fans of Wimbledon. It is not so much that they fancy themselves as potential Navratilovas or McEnroes, nor that they spend the whole of the last two weeks of June glued to their television screens; they hardly have time for that. But Wimbledon means strawberries and cream. The country's best growers compete for the prestige involved in supplying the championships and the sales of all the rest benefit from the visual promotion on sports programmes of this delicious summer fruit. This year is turning out to be an especially good one for strawberries. The sunny weather through most of May added sweetness to the growing berries and the rains at the end of the month filled them out. The result is a main UK crop that is not only earlier than usual but is of exceptional quality, as anyone who has sampled it (as I have, several times) can verify. The introduction a few years ago of a Dutch-bred variety, Elsanta, is also partly responsible for the good fruit. It combines good taste with good appearance and a shelf life that gives the retailer three days to sell in the knowledge that the fruit will still be good to eat at least four days after picking. Needless to say it earns a premium price over other types and has now been widely adopted in the UK as the main dessert variety. A previous market leader, Cambridge Favourite, has been relegated to parts of the pick-your-own trade, where the enthusiastic but amateur expertise of the pickers may be lower and it is perceived that there is a need for a tougher variety. Cambridge Favourite is still, however, a major variety, with a high proportion of those grown going for processing into jam, yoghurt, confectionery and so on. But this is just the main crop harvested during mid-summer. As connoisseurs will be aware English strawberries are now available from April until November. And the technology that has been imported from all over the world in order to achieve such a long season in a relatively hostile climate is quite incredible. It began in Kent a few years ago when members of a marketing co-operative realised that a variety of techniques were being used in other countries to supply the UK out of season. Further investigation persuaded them that these techniques could be modified to fit UK conditions and they have now been perfected and adopted by many growers in this country. The range of techniques involves some measures to advance the ripening of fruit and some to delay it. Few growers attempt all on the same farm, preferring to fit their production patterns into a co-operatively organised and co-ordinated programme. In some cases, if they have no glass houses, they erect walk-in plastic tunnels to encourage early strawberries. A secondary method is to cover the plants, from February onwards, with a thin plastic mulch. This warms the land and, along with trickle irrigation, increases growth, bringing the plants to maturity earlier than they would otherwise. It is even possible to influence the time of ripening by using different colours of plastic, which permit different amounts of light and heat to affect plants. Some growers with a selection of land on which to grow strawberries will choose warm, south-facing slopes, combined perhaps with one of the other methods mentioned for their early crops, and land kept cool by sea for those they wish to market later. Most sophisticated of all is the system of lifting growing strawberry plants from the land at a crucial stage in their development and putting them into cold storage to be held for a period in a state of suspended animation. They are then brought out as required for the marketing programme and replanted. Eight weeks later they produce a crop. All these techniques, or variations of them are used in places like Israel, California and Spain, where long hot summers make strawberry plants fruit for months and enable growers to produce enormous yields unheard of in the UK. But because they grow so fast and are required to have an even greater travelling- and shelf-life in order to reach UK shores, the quality of the fruit produced in those countries is almost universally inferior to the British product. British growers are, in fact, relatively sanguine about such imports of fresh and very expensive strawberries because they begin by Easter before domestic fruit is ready and help to prepare committed consumers for the superior home-grown quality, which follows soon after. They are less happy about the increasing tonnages of processed strawberries being imported, mainly from eastern European countries. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, traditional suppliers of such soft fruit to western Europe, are consistently able to undercut UK prices because of the availability of large quantities of cheap seasonal labour for picking. The European Community has association agreements with these countries allowing them to export certain quantities of fruit to community markets. From June 1 this year this trade has been subject to minimum import prices to stop the suppliers, who are in desperate need of hard currency, from undermining community producers' returns. The minimum prices are nominally set at levels that are no lower than EC production costs. It is early days, of course, but UK growers fear not only that some of the new minimums are too low but that there is insufficient monitoring of imports. They believe, in fact, that, as has happened in the past, considerable tonnages are being transported to what was East Germany where they mysteriously acquire a new nationality and then move further west to threaten their markets and prices. They worry particularly because similar things have happened before. Indeed the level of imports of processed strawberries from the east has almost trebled during the past decade and many UK strawberry growers who specialised in supplying the processing market have been driven out of business. Meanwhile over the same period the fresh market has held relatively firm, helped no doubt by the growers' own ingenuity in extending the season. And this year, as they contemplate near-record main crops and good prices, the growers of fresh strawberries are content. The dairy industry should be feeling modestly confident, too. Even in an average year sales of fresh cream during the main strawberry eating season rise by 20 per cent. This year with extra and better strawberries around they may sell even more.</p>

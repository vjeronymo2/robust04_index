			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / US report gives coffee a fillip Coffee futures prices rose strongly in London and New York yesterday following a report from the US Department of Agriculture estimating that frost damage would cut next year's Brazilian coffee crop by 30 to 40 per cent. The USDA report, regarded by traders as the most accurate available, suggested that the crop would total between 17m and 20m bags compared with the 29m it predicted before the frosts in June and July. Brazil usually accounts for at least a quarter of world coffee output. Traders had expected that the USDA estimate of the damage would be lower than that of the Brazilian government, which said last month that 40 per cent of the crop would be lost. In practice, the US figures, released late on Friday, were at the top end of expectations, giving a fillip to prices that had suffered a sell-off last week, as investment funds and spec-ulators took profits. In London, robusta coffee futures staged a 4.8 per cent rally, with the contract for delivery in November rising Dollars 157 to Dollars 3,430 a tonne. Arabica coffee futures in New York were up strongly in the afternoon session, the December contract closing 13.6 cents, or 7.3 per cent, higher at 198.45 cents a pound. However, neither market regained all last week's losses, suggesting that prices might have risen too far, too fast - London peaked at Dollars 4,085 a tonne and New York at 274 cents a pound on July 13. GNI, the London commodity broker, said dry weather now appeared to be the most important concern for next year's crop. The USDA found there had been less rainfall than usual in virtually all the coffee areas it visited in its 3,800-mile field survey, saying normal rainfall was needed for a 'favourable' flowering season in October to December.

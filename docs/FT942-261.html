			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK ready to accept alternative candidate for EU job The British government sought to draw a line under the row over the presidency of the European Commission by suggesting yesterday that it was ready to accept one of several new candidates who have emerged for the post. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said that 'five or six' new names were being discussed by European Union governments as alternatives to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. Mr Dehaene's candidacy was vetoed by Mr John Major, prime minister, at last weekend's Corfu summit. But Mr Hurd, speaking on the eve of the German presidency of the EU, said the new candidates were all 'broadly acceptable' to the London government. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, took the same position by stressing that Britain's decision to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment did not foreshadow a decisive shift in Britain's commitment to the EU. Mr Clarke emphasised his personal support for the eventual goal of economic and monetary union and said the government was prepared to see a successor to Mr Jacques Delors committed to deepening as well as widening the European Union. But his comments in a speech at the Konrad Adenauer foundation in Bonn enraged Conservative party Euro-sceptics, who accused him of undermining a reassertion at the Corfu summit by Mr John Major of Britain's national sovereignty. The speech also failed to persuade many in his Christian Democrat audience that the London government's pledge to remain 'at the heart of Europe' would be matched by a constructive approach in practice. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, set out a modest programme for the country's six-month presidency of the European Union, which begins tomorrow, insisting that it went no further than what was agreed by all other member states. 'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this limited period,' he told the Bundestag in Bonn. Mr Hurd will hold talks in London today with Mr Kinkel. But the foreign secretary refused to list the potential candidates for Mr Delors' post. Diplomats in Brussels are mentioning three names in particular for the presidency: Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, his Portuguese counterpart, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former prime minister of Italy.

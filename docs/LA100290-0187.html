			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MURDOCH STOCK LOSSES BAFFLING  </P> <P> Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said today it cannot explain the recent plunge in  its stock price, which has wiped about $515 million off its market value in the  last week.  </P> <P> Company secretary Keith Brodie said the global media group believes the  Australian stock market is "fully informed on all material matters concerning  the company."  </P> <P> The stock exchange had queried News Corp. about the sharp slide in its share  price to $5.41 Monday from $7.50 on Sept. 24. News Corp. shares bounced up  today to close 60 cents higher at $5.91.  </P> <P> No public statements were made that might affect the share price other than  Murdoch's widely reported comments at an investment conference in New York last  week, Brodie said.  </P> <P> Murdoch said he is concerned about the group's high level of short-term debt  and will seek to reduce it through increased earnings in the next two to four  years.  </P></p>

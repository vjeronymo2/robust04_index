			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / IBM UK sees return to profit IBM UK, hardest hit of the computer manufacturer's national subsidiaries in 1992, staged a strong recovery last year cutting losses substantially. The company lost Pounds 174m before tax, including Pounds 55m of restructuring charges, compared with Pounds 767m losses after Pounds 369m charges in 1992. Mr Nick Temple, chief executive, attributed the improvement to cost cutting and a sharper business focus. He expected a return to profit this year. The parent company had made an equity investment of Pounds 350m last year to strengthen the balance sheet, leaving the debt-equity ratio at 100 per cent. The company did better than the rest of IBM's European operations, most of which are showing declining sales and profitability as the recession deepens on the continent. European operations showed a 1 per cent decline in revenues overall. IBM UK's turnover rose to Pounds 4.06bn, up 8 per cent on the Pounds 3.75bn recorded in 1992 and in line with average industry growth. The parent company, reporting its 1993 results earlier this week, posted an Dollars 8.1bn loss after restructuring charges on revenues 2.8 per cent down at Dollars 62.7bn. IBM UK's revenues are split between home sales, which totalled Pounds 1.73bn, and exports which came to Pounds 2.3bn. Mr Temple said the company had redesigned many of the ways it did business. Staff numbers had been cut by more than 30 per cent since 1990 and now stood at about 11,400. A 'few hundred' more jobs would go this year as restructuring continued. Mr Temple said that mainframe computers sales were 'stable' in the UK but there had been growth in services, mid-range systems and personal computers. The company's factory at Greenock, Scotland, which makes PCs for Europe, was working at full capacity, with 80 per cent of its output exported. IBM Germany's revenues declined to DM12.6bn (Pounds 4.8bn) from DM13.8bn. The company said operating profits improved, but it made a loss because of restructuring charges. IBM Netherlands' total revenue declined 12 per cent to Fl 2.98bn (Pounds 1bn). Profits after tax slid 35 per cent to Fl 127m.</p>

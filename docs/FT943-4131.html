			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Move to close pyramid scheme The Department of Trade and Industry has moved to close down another pyramid scheme. It has petitioned the High Court to wind up Global Pioneers, a scheme which traded from Morecambe in Lancashire. It said Global Pioneers 'held out the prospect of substantial earnings to members by the redistribution of subscriptions of members joining later'. Investigators believe that the scheme started in July last year and has attracted a membership of about 3,000. The government wound up a larger scheme called Alchemy Marketing in July and hearings on 3T Publications are scheduled for next month.</p>

It is already known that the U.S. President's visit to  Russia  and his talks with Boris Yeltsin are scheduled for January  12-15. The meeting between the three presidents is expected to  take place in Moscow on January 14th.    As a senior official from Russia's Foreign Ministry told  INTERFAX, Leonid Kravchuk's arrival in Moscow became possible  thanks to the progress reached at trilateral  Russian-American-Ukrainian consultations in Washington, where  the problem of nuclear arms deployed on Ukrainian soil was under  discussion.    "In the Russian capital, Kravchuk will evidently reaffirm  all  commitments concerning nuclear weapons made by Ukraine earlier,"  the Russian diplomat said. This involves the START-I treaty and  the Lisbon Protocol to it, he explained.    As it is known, last November Ukraine's parliament ratified  the treaty with numerous reservations. As for the Lisbon  Protocol, it was ratified with the exception of Article 5, which  guarantees Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty as a denuclearized state.    "The extremely negative reaction" displayed by the world  community, above all by Russia and the U.S., was understood by  Leonid Kravchuk, who announced his intention to submit the  START-I treaty for ratification to Ukraine's new parliament,  which is to be elected on March 27th, the diplomat said.    INTERFAX's source described the allegations that the U.S.  President might make changes in the plans for his European tour  in order to visit Kiev as "unfounded." "The meeting to be held  by the three presidents in Moscow makes Bill Clinton's trip to  Kiev pointless," he said.    According to him, the three presidents' meeting in Moscow  will evidently result in some document, possibly a declaration,  in which the stands taken by the three sides and Ukraine's  commitments will be clearly stated.    As the diplomat said, one more declaration -- on the outcome  of the Russian-American summit -- is expected to be adopted in  Moscow. "This will be a general document reflecting the present  state of bilateral relations," he said. "In addition, the head  of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, and Secretary of State  Warren Christopher will sign on behalf of their countries a  number of `routine' agreements, in particular on air  transportation."    According to INTERFAX's source, the Russian-American talks,  both bilateral and otherwise, will be held in the Kremlin.  However, some meetings might take place at one of President  Yeltsin's out-of-town residences, he conceded.    At the request of the American side, a meeting with the  Russian public has been included in the already coordinated  program for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, the diplomat  noted. "On January 14, the American president will address  Russian journalists and the public in one of Ostankino's  television studios. Evidently, this event will be presented  live," he said.</p>

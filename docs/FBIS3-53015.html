His Highness Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary  general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, also participated in  the meetings.  The ministers reviewed the Middle East peace process and  discussed its developments since the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, considering it a  first step that should be completed by steps on the other tracks  in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    In their deliberations, the ministers concentrated on the  extreme importance of the anticipated summit meeting between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They underscored the  vital and important Syrian role in securing the success of the  Middle East peace process and emphasized their states' strong  support for President al-Asad. They expressed the hope that  this meeting will lead to a just and comprehensive peace in the  region on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425 and the land-for-peace principle in a manner that leads  to the Israeli withdrawal from all of the Arab territories  occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem, and guarantees the  Palestinian Arab people's national rights.    The ministers have discussed the situation in the Gulf  region. In this regard, the ministers reaffirm their countries'  concern for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of  Iraq. They also hold the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the  suffering being experienced by the Iraqi people.  The ministers strongly condemn the Iraqi regime because of  its pursuit of a selective approach in its implementation of the  resolutions of international legitimacy regarding its aggression  against the State of Kuwait, because it has continued to  threaten Kuwait, and also because of its hostile conduct toward  Kuwait. Moreover, they reaffirm their full support for the State  of Kuwait in the face of all these threats, and renew their  demand that the Iraqi regime comply with the cease-fire terms  and honor all relevant UN Security Council resolutions,  particularly those concerning borders, the release of all  Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, and  compensation.  The ministers reiterate that respect by Iraq for the  sovereignty and independence of the State of Kuwait and its  international borders, as approved by the UN Security Council  per Resolution 833, is at the heart of the commitments enshrined  in UN Security Council Resolution 687, and that its failure to  do so would be a violation of the essence of this  resolution.    The ministers have also reviewed with interest the call made  by His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president  of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], urging the Islamic Republic  of Iran to hold a direct dialogue with the UAE on its  occupation of the three UAE islands of Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb  al-Kubra, and Abu Musa. While commending this call, the  ministers urge Iran to respond favorably to this call,  particularly since it seeks to reach a peaceful settlement of  this dispute in line with international law, international  conventions, and the principles of good neighborliness, and  mutual respect among states. The ministers reaffirm their  support and backing for the peaceful measures and means the UAE  may pursue to regain its sovereignty over these three  islands.    The ministers once again voice their grave concern over  developments in Somalia. They appeal to all Somali leaders  and factions to make the national interest outweigh all other  considerations. They also urge them to comply with the UN  Security Council resolutions, and cooperate with the efforts of  both the United Nations and the OAU to ensure the achievement of  peace, security, and stability in Somalia.    The ministers voiced grave concern over the situation  in Afghanistan and appealed to all the leaders to give priority  to national interests to safeguard the Afghan people's  interests.    The ministers also voiced their deep concern for the failure  of the influential world forces to take note of the tragic  political and humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  They vehemently condemned the continued Serbian aggression  and the Serbs perpetration of all kinds of crimes against  humanity. The ministers called on the UN Security Council and  the influential international forces to take all necessary  measures, including the lifting of the arms embargo from Bosnia  and Hercegovina, to end this people's tragedy. They also called  for them to maintain the sanctions imposed on Serbia until it  respects the resolutions and principles of international  legitimacy, and halts its violations of the territorial  integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina and of its people's rights.    The ministers noted with satisfaction the implementation of  the recommendations issued at their previous meeting in Abu  Dhabi on 12-13 June 1993, which seek to invigorate political and  economic coordination and cooperation among the Damascus  Declaration countries in a manner that will enable them to  proceed with this march of cooperation in accordance with the  objectives and principles of the Damascus Declaration.    The ministers expressed their thanks and appreciation to the  Syrian Arab Republic president, government, and people for  hosting this meeting and for the warm welcome and the  hospitality they were accorded.    The ministers welcomed the kind invitation Kuwait has  extended to host the next meeting of the Damascus Declaration  states' foreign ministers in Kuwait.    Faruq al-Shar' concluded the meeting of the foreign  ministers  of the Damascus Declaration states with a speech in which he  said: Your Highnesses and Excellencies, Dear Brothers: At the  end of our meetings yesterday and today I would like, on behalf  of the Syrian Arab Republic, to express great satisfaction with  the results that we attained during our deliberations. I would  like to thank you all for the cooperation we have sensed during  our meetings and for the sincere spirit that prevailed among us  enabling us to reach a common perspective on all the issues we  have discussed and about which we have adopted the appropriate  stands.    Al-Shar' added: As I said in my opening speech, our stands  toward the basic issues are identical or very close. There are  no serious differences between us. Hence, we express our  satisfaction as well as our thanks for all the efforts and pains  you have taken to reach this satisfactory result. As I said a  short while ago, the statement issued in the name of us all as  eight Arab states contains the main topics discussed during your  deliberations.    The foreign minister added: We also agreed to hold the next  meeting in the sisterly State of Kuwait and we are happy to do  so at the appropriate time. Once again I thank you for  accepting our invitation to participate in this important  meeting, which came at a critical time in the region's life,  hoping that our unified positions, joint concepts, and  aspiration for a real Arab solidarity will deliver this nation  from the setbacks to which it was exposed and help us all  rectify the big imbalance existing in the Arab arena. Thus we  can confront future challenges with sincere determination and  unified opinion on whose basis we can restore our legitimate  rights and occupied lands and achieve a just and comprehensive  peace in this region on the basis of UN Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425. In the meantime, we stress that realizing such peace  will inevitably achieve security and stability in the region--a  region that has suffered a great deal and offered many  sacrifices. Our cooperation will, God willing, continue. The  words we exchanged on our faith in cooperation and coordination  among our states, our comprehensive Arab vision, and our desire  to lay the basis of pan-Arab security will all place our march  on the right track.    We pray to God to grant us all success. I thank you again  for taking the trouble of coming to Syria -- your country. I  wish you success and a safe return home.    Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, meanwhile, gave a speech, in which  he  said:    My colleagues have asked me to speak on their behalf and  extend our thanks to His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and  his government, as well as the Syrian people for the hospitality  and kind reception accorded us in this hospitable country. We  are all extremely happy with the outcome of our meeting.    We are equally satisfied with the progress the eight  countries have made in their effort to advance their  cooperation. We are similarly impressed by the course we have  charted for our future action. I must thank the conference  chairman for the wise way in which he conducted our sessions and  for attaining the outcome we had set out to achieve -- results  that matched our leaders' aspirations as the eight states  proceed within the framework of the Damascus Declaration.    On behalf of all of us, I would like to tell brotherly Syria  that we fully appreciate its attachment to Arab causes, notably  the peace process. In this regard, we were impressed by the  Syrian official assertions, echoed by His Excellency President  Hafiz al-Asad to us this morning, that Syria will continue to  work relentlessly to promote a just and comprehensive peace in  the region. I take this opportunity to tell my brother [Faruq  al-Shar'] and through him His Excellency President Hafiz  al-Asad, as well as the Syrian people and Government, that they  can count on all of us supporting Syria until such peace that  meets our interests and our legitimate demands comes to the  region. Again, we thank the conference chairman for the  successful way in which he conducted its proceedings. We hope  the next sessions will be just as successful. We join you in  thanking Kuwait for offering to host our next session. Thank  you, Your Excellency Mr. Al-Shar'. Please accept our wishes of  success and prosperity for the brotherly Syrian people.  Farewell.</p>

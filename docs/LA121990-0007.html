			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER FOUND JUSTIFIED IN SHOOTING SUSPECT ARMED WITH 2 GUNS  </P> <P> The San Diego County district attorney's office has ruled that the San Diego  police shooting of a 22-year-old man was justified because the man was getting  ready to fire a semiautomatic pistol.  </P> <P> Sean Sylvester White, carrying both the pistol and a sawed-off shotgun, was  injured in the September shooting and charged with assault with a firearm on a  peace officer.  </P> <P> His Superior Court trial is set for Feb. 25.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office said White is known to be a member of the West  Coast Crips gang and was on parole for kidnaping after being released in April  from state prison.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office gave this account of the shooting:  </P> <P> Police Officer William Alan Albrektsen spotted White at 2:13 a.m. Sept. 5 and  began following him in his patrol car. White, with an object under his arm,  quickened his pace. Albrektsen thought the man had a gun, got out of the car  and ordered White to stop. White then ran into an apartment building and began  pounding on a door to get inside. Albrektsen followed and told him to put his  hands up and drop what he had under his arm.  </P> <P> Albrektsen said he warned White several times before he saw White "either pull  out his shirt or push up his jacket." Albrektsen said White grabbed a gun out  of his waistband and, when "he started bringing it towards me . . . that's when  I fired."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office ruled that Albrektsen was justified in using  force to protect himself.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Adding some fizz to its investments - An in-depth look at the aims and aspirations of Rutland Trust Interests in sticky labels and fizzy drinks make Rutland Trust, now listed under Other Financial, difficult to classify. Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, believes the sale of part of Ben Shaws, its Yorkshire soft drinks company, to Canada's Cott Corporation is a classic illustration of what Rutland is aiming to do. However, events have moved much faster than expected. It was only last August when Rutland paid Pounds 5.7m for 84 per cent of Ben Shaws, an old family company that had overstretched itself. Under the deal, announced on Monday, Cott is paying an initial Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of the Ben Shaws Pontefract canning line operation, the UK's largest independent canning line. The other half of the Ben Shaws business in Huddersfield, which concentrates on the local returnable soft drinks market and spring water production, will continue to be developed by Rutland. It has just won an order from J Sainsbury for own-label water. The rapid sale of part of Ben Shaws is in direct contrast to Rutland's cautious approach before buying the business. It was talking with Ben Shaws from the end of 1992 before finally making the acquisition. 'We have a very long gestation period,' says Mr Langdon at the company's Knightsbridge headquarters. Rutland never buys 100 per cent of a company - but never less than 75 per cent. This allows the former management to have a share of the company, giving them an incentive to perform well. 'It's a partnership. We keep the distinction between operating management and financial and strategic management.' Since August, Rutland has been implementing new financial and operational controls at Ben Shaws. The group insists on strict financial reporting, demanding a full management report five working days after the end of each month. The group has also made good use of Mr Langdon's supermarket group contacts, winning orders for canned drinks from J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. In spite of the short time scale, several companies had already offered to buy Ben Shaws before Cott came on the scene, according to Mr Langdon. But Rutland's aim is always to add value to an acquisition, and a straight sale was not on the cards. The deal with Cott fits neatly with that aim. Rutland will continue to own 49 per cent of the canning line, which had a turnover of Pounds 40m for the 11 months to end-December, for a year. Then Cott has the right to buy a further 31.5 per cent for a minimum of Pounds 5m and a maximum of Pounds 7.5m, depending on 1994 earnings. Rutland will retain 17.5 per cent. Cott can add value where Rutland cannot, says Mr Langdon, who is chairman of Ben Shaws and will be joining the board of Cott in the UK. Its expertise is in recipes, marketing and branding skills, and it will set up a management team of soft drink experts that can develop it faster and quicker than Rutland could on its own. In North America, Cott has sprung from nowhere to create what it terms a 'retailer branded beverage business.' It supplies supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart with own-label colas. Profits at the nine-month stage to end-October last year were more than doubled to CDollars 26.2m (Pounds 13.2m) on turnover also more than doubled at CDollars 502m. Last week Cott entered the European market through a five-year agreement with Cadbury Schweppes under which Cadbury bottling plants will produce drinks for a newly-formed Cott arm in Europe. Mr Simon Lester, president of Cott Europe, said Ben Shaws had proved the ideal candidate for his company's plans to enter the UK market. It would keep the existing business, generating 500m cans a year, and start to develop branded colas for UK retailers. The line has capacity to produce an additional 500m cans a year. Rutland has been so closely involved with Ben Shaws partly because Capital Industries, its 43 per cent owned industrial associate, had its hands full with Samuel Jones, the sticky label manufacturer acquired with Rutland's support in 1992. Last November Capital downgraded its profits forecast following trouble with some new machinery at Samuel Jones, now solved. Nevertheless, the acquisition of Samuel Jones has transformed Capital, which was spun off in 1991 at Pounds 10m. It now has a market capitalisation of Pounds 43m, giving Rutland an unrealised profit of about Pounds 10m. Rutland was formed when Mr Langdon left Price Waterhouse in 1986, and has since grown to a market capitalisation of Pounds 70m. It will continue to concentrate on its financial and business services, including Ellis &amp; Buckle, 90 per cent-owned and now the UK's fourth biggest loss adjuster, and Hunter &amp; Partners, a 77 per cent-owned architectural and building surveying practice. At the halfway stage last year, pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.6m, held back by Leasecontracts, the asset financing division which is involved in vehicle contract hire. The City is looking for about Pounds 7.5m pre-tax for the year to December, and was looking for just over Pounds 9m this year before news of the Ben Shaws disposal. Some market observers see Rutland as a hybrid, with no clear focus. 'The question has to be asked if it would not work better as a private company,' one analyst said. But Mr Langdon, who describes himself and his right hand man, Mr Christopher Dowling, as 'boring prudent accountants', is quite clear on the group's aims. 'When someone says to me: What is the core of Rutland Trust? I say we are hands on investors in businesses where we can see that we can add a value. 'But if someone is willing to pay more for a company than we think it's worth to us, and the management is in agreement, then we will sell it,' he explains. He points out that the group sees many companies through its corporate finance division. 'If we can add no value we work for a fee like any corporate finance house.' 'Ultimately our long-term aspiration is to maximise over periods of time the value of Rutland itself.'</p>

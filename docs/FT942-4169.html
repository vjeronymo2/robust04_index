			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Second place equals victory for Labour When the result of the Eastleigh by-election was read out this morning, the cheer from Labour supporters was so big that it was easy to forget they had only come second. The Liberal Democrats had taken the seat with a 20 per cent swing from the Tories - significantly lower than the last two by-elections, but a comfortable win nonetheless. But for Labour, its credibility as an outlet for disillusioned Tory voters in the south had been on the line. By achieving its own target - of coming a strong second - it succeeded in showing that it could win votes in the south and prevent itself from being squeezed by the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats pointed to an eve-of-poll leaflet distributed by Labour predicting that it would win Eastleigh by 6,000 votes. But no one, least of all Labour's own officials, believed the contest was between the two opposition parties. Both the Conservatives and Labour had privately conceded victory to the Liberal Democrats long ago. Labour, which has never fought so hard for a seat it had no hope of winning, managed to push the Tories into third place. Miss Marilyn Birks, Labour candidate, said last night she had succeeded in showing disillusioned Tories in the south that Labour was a realistic alternative. She said: 'This by-election has been a referendum on the Tory government and the voters have given them a clear message that their policies have failed.' Mr Tony Blair, favourite for the Labour leadership, had been vindicated in showing that Labour had become sufficiently attractive to win votes in the south of England. Labour had taken the risk in deciding not to 'relinquish' its votes for Liberal Democrats - as it grandly did in Newbury - and the gamble had paid off. But Labour was helped by a turnout that was significantly lower than usual. Only 58.9 per cent turned out, compared with 83 per cent in the last election. Mr David Willets, the Conservative MP minding the Tory candidate, Mr Steven Reid, said it was clear that many Tory voters had stayed at home while the majority of disillusioned Conservatives had defected to the Liberal Democrats. He said: 'The fight to take this seat back at the next general election starts on Monday.' Mr Willets consoled himself with the fact that those who abstained were supporters of the government. 'They'll come out again at the next election,' he said. Mr David Chidgey, Liberal Democrat candidate, said Liberal Democrats knew better than most that there were no prizes for coming second. He said he was 'delighted' with his majority of more than 9,000, which was significantly larger than the Liberal Democrats had been expecting. He added: 'This is a clear message to the prime minister - change your policies or change your job.' Liberal Democrats also pointed out that Labour had fought the campaign to win and had lost. As one Liberal official said: 'You have to go back to 1962 to find a Labour gain in the south of England (when Dorset South was taken by the official opposition).' While the two opposition parties were pleased with their respective results, the only obvious losers were the Conservatives.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Faruq Choukri] </F>   [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (AFP) -- A senior UN official said  here Sunday the United Nations and Baghdad still disagreed over  certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons  programmes, despite their pledge to implement the measures  quickly.    Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission on disarming  Iraq, told reporters after talks with senior Iraqi officials  that "there are definitely different assessments" concerning the  surveillance programme.    "There are still some question marks, and we have been  working on them with some, but not complete, success during  these talks," Ekeus said before leaving for Kuwait.    Ekeus, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, held talks with  Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq 'Aziz, Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf and General 'Amir Muhammad Rashid, head of the  military industrialization organization.    In a joint statement, Ekeus and Aziz said both sides  "expressed their readiness to expedite the process of  establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of  goodwill."    They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) to report to the UN Security Council "that,  in their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by  paragraph 22 of Resolution 687."    The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil  embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions  calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass  destruction.    Ekeus said he tried to emphasise in his talks with Iraqi  leaders the "political ambiance" surrounding the clause.    He was referring to the position of certain UN Security  Council members, notably the United States, which oppose any  lifting of the oil embargo until Baghdad recognises the  sovereignty of Kuwait and improves its policy toward the Moslem  Shiite and Kurdish minorities in Iraq.    Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary Riyad al-Qaysi, who  spoke at a news conference with Ekeus Sunday, said Iraq had  "implemented all that is required" under the clause.    However, last week U.S. President Bill Clinton said Iraq  still had a long way to go toward compliance with the Gulf war  ceasefire conditions, despite Baghdad's acceptance of UN  Security Council Resolution 715 in November, which called for  long-term weapons monitoring.    The joint statement issued by Ekeus and 'Aziz said the  "intense phase" of UN inspections would continue, and Iraq had  "indicated that it would welcome all such inspection teams and  facilitate their tasks."    The two sides discussed technical matters in a "professional  and business-like manner," the statement said, and their talks  "yielded positive results."    They agreed to hold a further round of talks in the first  half of March to maintain the momentum in the disarmament  process.    In the hope of obtaining an end to the embargo, Baghdad is  cooperating with efforts to dismantle programmes for nuclear,  chemical and biological weapons, which are banned under the UN  resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war.    UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four  days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990.    On Friday, IAEA officials said they would remove the last  batch of Iraq's irradiated fuel next week and start setting up  cameras at former nuclear sites.    The joint statement said Iraq and the United Nations had  "built on the significant progress" made since last July, when  the two sides discussed the possibility of lifting the oil  embargo.    Iraq meanwhile reiterated its rejection of a plan to sell  some of its oil under UN control.    Under UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, Iraq is  allowed to sell up to 1.6 billion dollars' worth of oil for six  months under international supervision. The proceeds must be  used to buy food and medical supplies, fund UN activities in  Iraq, and pay war damages.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Modigliani Painting Sets Auction Record: A Japanese gallery has set a world  auction record in sterling by purchasing a work by Italian artist Amedeo  Modigliani for the equivalent of $7.89 million, Sotheby's said. The Fujii  Gallery paid 5,060,000 in London for "Fillette au Tablier Noir," a painting of  a girl in a black dress. The previous highest auction price for Modigliani was  4.4 million in March, 1988, then the equivalent of $7.9 million against a  stronger dollar. The sale of "Fillette au Tablier Noir" was part of an auction  of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture that together brought in  $104 million. Twenty-two works, including ones by Claude Monet and Paul  Gauguin, each fetched more than $1.56 million. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy demand for ICI ICI led international stocks higher as the dollar strengthened against sterling and Mr Richard Wyatt at County NatWest put the stock into its Top 30 - a grouping regularly favoured by institutions. County bases its buy recommendation on the view that 'world economic growth has now reached the bottom of the trough and will be rebounding strongly by 1991 Q4.' Trading volume was a heavy 3.7m as the shares climbed 35 at one point. They closed a net 32 to the good at 1100p. Both Fisons and SmithKline Beecham continued to improve, the former on hopes that its asthma drug Tilade would at last get approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the latter in the wake of recent presentations to analysts. One analyst said that the talk of Tilade approval was 'more than just a nod and a wink'. Fisons rose 7 to 488p (up 18 1/2 over two sessions) and SmithKline added 11 at 842p. Racal again active There was no let up in takeover speculation surrounding the Racal 'twins', although a Racal director was reported as saying there had been no bid approaches for Racal Telecom. There was talk that one of the big international telecom groups was about to buy a big stake in Racal Telecom from Racal Electronics, or that a full takeover bid for Racal Electronics was being prepared. Hutchison Whampoa, the US 'baby Bells' as well as Mannesman and other European groups, were being spoken of as likely candidates, as was Cable &amp; Wireless. Racal Telecom shares rose 3 to 396p, while Electronics managed a minor improvement at 242p. Mr John E Clarke at Daiwa issued buy notes on both stocks but emphasised that Electronics was the cheapest way into Racal Telecom, because of its 80 per cent stake. Mr Clarke attached only a 30 per cent probability to a full bid and said he believed a cash injection, in exchange for a minority stake, was more likely. Small brewers busy Second line brewers seethed with takeover talk after Boddington bid for Devenish. The seven for ten share swap proposed values each Devenish share at 233p, and the company at Pounds 128m. It was described by one analyst as 'a cheeky offer at the bottom of the market at a price considerably below asset value.' The shares reflected the view in early trading as Boddington fell to 152p and Devenish rose to 235p. They reversed their relative motion in later trading, however. Boddington ended 6 down on balance at 157p and Devenish closed up 12 at 232p. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said Boddington was a buy because if the bid succeeded the enlarged group would have sound prospects and if it failed the company would be in play. The two beer companies have been linked before - they were in merger talks last year and last week Devenish sold its 3.8 per cent holding in Boddington. There were suggestions earlier in the month that Boddington itself might be a target for a bid from Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley (unchanged at 503p) and traders theorised that yesterday's move might have been an attempt to stave of such a takeover attempt. Analysts inclined to the view that any successful bid for Devenish would have to be at 265p-270p. Much of the decision-making power is in the hands of Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), an investment trust half owned by Whitbread. It has 21.9 per cent of Boddington (Whitbread itself owns 5.9 per cent) and 15 per cent of Devenish. Wickes placing One of the heaviest individual turnover stocks was Wickes, the building materials, distribution and retailing group, after Hillsdown disposed of its near-19 per cent stake in the company. Hillsdown said it had sold 50.48m shares for Pounds 27.4m, to SG Warburg, equivalent to 54.25p a share. The Seaq delayed ticker confirmed this and a similar series of trades carried out at 55p a share showed up a short while afterwards, indicating a profit of Pounds 378,561 on the deal. Hillsdown said Warburg had placed the shares with a number of institutions. Wickes was unperturbed by the placing and closed at 60p. Turnover was 100m. Hillsdown edged up to 262p. A large sell order overnight left Glaxo 16 lower at 1084p and it was Wellcome's turn to suffer from worries over drug patents. A US company, Barr Laboratories, said it had applied to the FDA for permission to make a generic equivalent of Wellcome's Aids treatment AZT. Mr Robin Gilbert at James Capel expressed his confidence in the reliability of Wellcome's patents, but the shares slid 15 to 534p. Buy notes issued by County NatWest and UBS Philips &amp; Drew prompted heavy trade in the power generators. National closed 2 1/2 up at 136p on 15m and PowerGen held at 137p on 10m. Specialists reported plenty of evidence that institutions had been selling the Water Package (10 lower at Pounds 3120) and buying the constituent stocks. Trading in the Package is expected to cease by the end of July, when the remaining packages will be unwound. Shares in Gardiner Group, the wholesale distributor of electronic security and surveillance equipment, were unmoved at 63 1/2 p as Scantronic placed its 16.1 per cent stake at 58p. Hoare Govett, Gardiner's broker. sold the shares to a number of institutions. Hoare placed a similar amount of Gardiner for Automated Security six weeks ago at a price of 51p. Scantronic was unmoved at 85p. Microfocus' scintillating performance since the start of the year, when the stock was trading around 700p, was maintained with the shares closing another 112 up at 1945p. Bass bucked the trend with an improvement of 13 to 978p as traders became convinced that any rump of stock from the rights issue would be small. A big buyer of Whitbread early in the day pushed the shares up 7 to 486p. A line of Scottish and Newcastle depressed its price 9 to 375p. Steelmaker Henry Barrett weakened after revealing awful first-half profits of Pounds 0.3m, compared with Pounds 6.5m for the same period last year. The new chief executive still expects full-year profits to reach Pounds 5m, and his confidence was reflected in maintenance of the interim dividend payment, but the market was not consoled and the shares fell 10 to 89p. Negative analysis in the wake of the second rights issue within a year continued to harm Morgan Crucible. Light selling, said dealers, found buyers extremely reluctant and the shares reacted to end 10 down at 238p. The nil-paid stock lost 7 to 13p premium. Improved annual results, which included a sharply increased dividend, lifted USM-listed motor distributor Mid-States 9 to 68p. Traders said that terms of a convertible preference issue from Slough Estates were so good that investors bought the stock to be able to take them up. The shares rose 9 to 253p amid predictions that they would fall when they went ex rights on May 15. Blue Circle surprised the market by not announcing a rights issue and declaring it would not have one this year. The shares dropped 6 to 254p on 4.6m, however, as analysts took on board the company's cautionary noises about the outlook in 1991. Robert Fleming cut its current year forecast to Pounds 160m to allow for a much higher interest charge. Heavy trading at the close in Saatchi and Saatchi fully paid (106m) and Ossory Estates (20m) looked like the placing of the rumps of recent rights issues. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (251).

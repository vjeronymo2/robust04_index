			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone hit by revisions VODAFONE, the UK's biggest cellular radio group was yesterday hit by a number of downgrades as the company completed a series of meetings with analysts. Attention focused on Vodafone's non-core businesses, in particular its partly owned Orbitel manufacturing subsidiary. According to one analyst, Orbitel is looking at losses of Pounds 6m this year. Another subsidiary, Vodata, which produces value added telecoms services, is also not performing as well as thought. For the year 1992-93 County NatWest is now predicting profits of Pounds 290m, down Pounds 20m, Kleinwort Benson forecasts Pounds 300m, down Pounds 25m, while Hoare Govett, in its second downgrade in three weeks, puts profits at Pounds 280m, a reduction of Pounds 30m from its original figure. However, analysts remain supportive of the company. Mr James Dodd at Kleinwort said: 'The outlook on products and on the non-network business is prudent, but the cellular side seems to be holding up well.' Mr Paul Norris at BZW, which turned cautious on Vodafone recently, said: 'The latest series of downgrades are really just points of detail against the fundamentals of the business, which remain solid.' But Hoare expressed worries over cellular subscriber rates. Vodafone lost 8 to 348p in heavy turnover of 4.2m. Cadbury wanted Confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury Schweppes was firm yesterday after two securities houses registered their enthusiasm for the company. Hoare Govett, broker to the company, reiterated its buy stance on the shares. The house's foods team underlined its confidence that Cadbury would still match its forecast for 1991 profits of Pounds 315m when the company announces full-year results on March 4. This compares with a 1990 figure of Pounds 279m. The broker has maintained its estimate in spite of a fall in soft drink volumes, flat confectionery sales and poor general trading conditions. It argues that Cadbury represents a flight to quality. Also, SG Warburg was said to have sent a note to clients highlighting the value of Cadbury's brands. The shares were ahead 5 at one stage but eased with a weak market to end 3 up at 445p. Another weak performance by crude oil prices - February Brent slipped 10 cents more to around Dollars 17.70 a barrel - kept the oil sector on the back foot. Profits downgrades by a number of the City's top broking firms caused a bout of weakness in BP and Shell. BP were 7 weaker at 286p on 4.4m shares traded and Shell 5 easier at 493p on 3.2m. British Gas, still sustained by suggestions that the group may be considering a hive-off of its industrial gas marketing operations, closed only marginally down at 245p; turnover in the stock reached a heavy 10m shares. Lasmo, given a strong boost in recent sessions by a number of broker buy notes, retreated after a firm opening and closed slightly easier on balance at 254p, with volume reaching 5.4m shares, its heaviest for many weeks. A mid-morning decline in the shares followed a bearish note issued by Strauss Turnbull, who said the group had adopted a change in accounting policy which could affect the dividend policy. Strauss also mentioned the high level of capital expenditure and said Lasmo had agreed to take on an environmental indemnity claim referring to Ultramar's refinery business. High drama at MEPC's annual meeting yesterday left the property group 17 weaker at 381p. The board's decision to pay an increased final dividend was challenged by associates of Mr Harry Hyams, a significant minority shareholder. A vote was taken, and the dividend passed with ease, but it unsettled the market in brisk turnover of close to 1m shares. There was also talk that MEPC was on the verge of successfully letting its Alban Gate office development in the City, but it denied this to analysts. The sharp fall in MEPC pulled down the rest of the property sector. British Land slipped 6 to 257p, Hammerson ordinary 7 to 528p and Land Securities 9 to 464p. Merger talks between Rosehaugh and Stanhope - which have been under way since the summer - were finally called off yesterday, a move one analyst described as 'a disaster for both companies'. The merger had been seen by some in the market as the first of many such moves to rationalise the depressed and crowded property sector. Rosehaugh lost 1 1/4 to 5 1/4 p, while Stanhope eased 1 1/2 to 23 1/2 p. In the financial sector, Union Discount fell 24 to 150p, compared with a 1991/92 high of 600p. Union's annual results early next month are expected to suffer from fears that the company's leasing subsidiary has been hit badly by the recession and from the general malaise affecting the discount house sector at present. Discount houses are particularly sensitive to interest rate movements, benefiting from lower rates but faced recently with a firming of money market rates, following higher rates in Germany. Sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism also means that the potential for volatility in rate movements has been severely restricted. Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding company in which ADT has a 27 per cent stake, halved in price to 8 1/2 p as the company announced 'very substantial write-offs and provisions' to cover its US property portfolio. Lep said it was undergoing a restructuring which would 'likely include a partial conversion of debt into equity'. The group was also reviewing the proposed sale of the National Guardian Corporation, its US security business. ADT dropped 15 to 423p. Construction equipment suppliers BM Group fell 18 to 382p after announcing a Pounds 60m rights issue to repay the debt of its latest acquistion, Thomas Robinson, and to cover the cost of another company it is negotiating to buy in Canada. Thomas Robinson jumped 11 1/2 to 24p. Reports that Cable and Wireless had suspended talks with AT&amp;T, of the US, over a possible alliance left the telecoms group off 10 at 579p after moderate volume of 2.1m. BT, which slipped under the flotation offer price on Tuesday for the first time, eased further on Oftel regulatory worries. Both the old and the new shares were off a penny at 315p and 108 1/2 p respectively. Sentiment remains bearish on the group, with individual investors joining institutional investors in becoming sellers. Pharmaceuticals were weak on the back of a depressed Wall Street, but the price of Wellcome was marked up as analysts were enthusiastic after meetings with the company. The shares rose 22 to 1077p on desultory turnover. Glaxo fell 16 to 843p. It was announced that more than 25 per cent of Glaxo's shares are now held in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts, against some 22 per cent in September. A confident presentation to analysts from Fisons failed to translate into the share price, which declined 6 to 352p. Food company Hillsdown Holdings fell 7 to 153p as securities house Hoare Govett placed 6.5m shares with clients at 150 1/2 p. Photocopier group Southern Business was active after a broker placed just under 6m of its shares in the market. The stock shed 3 to 90p on turnover of 13m. Further weakness in Meyer International left the builders merchant 10 lower at 391p as Hoare Govett downgraded its forecast. The broker is now looking for profits of Pounds 26m this year, down Pounds 4m. Public houses and hotels group Greenalls saw its 'A' shares surge ahead 36 before ending a net 28 ahead at 207p. The company announced that it was to abolish its two-tier share structure. Under the changes, 'A' shareholders will receive one ordinary for every two 'A' shares held. There was strong speculation that the enfranchisement will pave the way for an acquisition and Boddington Group was seen as the target. There has been heavy turnover in Boddington shares recently, and yesterday it was announced that Scottish Amicable Investment Managers had disposed of just over 2m shares, 1.92 per cent of the company's equity. One leading integrated securities house has been a keen buyer, and Boddingtons yesterday gained 4 to 179p. Greene King, also affected by the bid talk, advanced 7 to 475p.

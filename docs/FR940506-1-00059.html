			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has delivered supplies or performed services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract requirement. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. Except in the case of a contract for the purchase of a commercial item or service as defined in 15.804&hyph;3(c)(3), including a brand name commercial item for authorized resale ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> commissary items), the contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed. The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending the constructive acceptance period beyond 7 days. Extended acceptance periods shall not be a routine agency practice but shall be used only when necessary to permit proper Government inspection and testing of the supplies delivered or services rendered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The due date for making payments on contracts that contain the clause at 52.232&hyph;10, Payments under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts, shall be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The due date for work or services completed by the contractor shall be the later of the following two events: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor. On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> release of claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the settlement. For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after Government approval of contractor estimates of work or services accomplished. For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after contractor estimates have been received by the designated billing office (see also paragraph (b)(4) of this section). In the event that actual approval occurs within the constructive approval period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice or payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice or payment request, provided a proper invoice or payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor compliance with contract requirements, or the requested progress payment amount. These requirements do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The due date for making payments on construction contracts shall be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The due date for making progress payments based on contracting officer approval of the estimated amount and value of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project, shall be 14 days after receipt of a proper payment request by the designated billing office. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date shall be the 14th day after the date of the contractor's payment request, provided a proper payment request is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. The contracting officer may specify a longer period in the solicitation and resulting contract if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance under the contract. The contract file shall indicate the justification for extending the due date beyond 14 days. The contracting officer or his representative shall not approve progress payment requests unless the certification and substantiation of amounts requested are provided as required by the clause at 52.232&hyph;5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232&hyph;5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, shall be as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30 days after approval by the contracting officer for release to the contractor. This release of retained amounts shall be based on the contracting officer's determination that satisfactory progress has been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The due date for final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts), and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the Government ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in the contract) shall be as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

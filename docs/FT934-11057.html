			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome slides Anxiety in the drugs sector, triggered last week by Wellcome's results, continued to pull stocks lower. Few investors came to the rescue of pharmaceuticals and shares slipped almost across the board. The flagging sentiment was not helped by Kleinwort Benson's move from overweight to neutral on the sector and a shift from buy to a hold on Glaxo. Its shares fell back 8 1/2 to 674p, while Fisons gave up 2 to 159p, Zeneca 17 to 756p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' 7 to 413p. Wellcome lost 15 to 675p, with 2.6m shares traded. But as bearish stances hardened across the sector, one analyst stood out to say that the profit-taking on the stocks had been something of an over-reaction. He said the harsher climate that gripped pharmaceuticals should lead to lower expectations of growth, and therefore Wellcome's figures should not be seen as extremely as the market had done. 'The sector has turned the corner but the fundamentals are just not as good as they used to be.' He also pointed to Wellcome's yield and suggested that that would soon prove to be a pull for investors. British Petroleum's rehabilitation continued yesterday, the shares creeping up a further 3 to 352 1/2 p - their highest close since October 17, 1991 - ahead of next Thursday's third-quarter numbers. 'No-one wants to be short of BP, which is now seen as well set on the road to recovery,' said one analyst. BP shares slumped to a record low of 185 1/2 p in August 1992. after the group cut its dividend. The leisure sector was enlivened by a number of features which acted to keep most of the stocks in positive territory. Thorn EMI surged on weekend press comment on the bright outlook for the multi-media market, with interesting hints on the prospects for mergers and takeovers - BT notwithstanding. Thorn shares added 13 at 964p, albeit in dull turnover of 1.1m. An announcement from Stanley Leisure that trading in its casinos and betting shops was 'considerably ahead' for the first six months of the current year compared with the same period a year ago lifted the shares and impacted on related stocks. Stanley made the revelation along with the purchase of a regional betting group for Pounds 6m. The shares moved ahead 20 to 249p. Stanley's good news helped Rank Organisation, which gained 6 at 847p. Bass, owner of the Coral Racing chain, put on 2 at 490p. The group also announced that it was buying a stake in the Czech Republic's second largest brewer. Ladbroke, however, remained friendless and was down a penny at 172p. The dullness in Ladbroke was also connected with the continuing revelations over the fall of Queens Moat Houses, which kept hotel stocks under a cloud, Forte slipping 2 1/2 to 219p. Compass Group appreciated 5 to 570p on announcing a deal with Burger King. After last week's rally, Guinness softened a penny to 434p. Two US-owned brokers have been recommending the stock in the past week and analysts say support will probably be forthcoming prior to a visit to the group's Greek operations by institutions and brokers. Turnover among food retailers returned to normal after the hectic activity seen last week, fuelled by talk of a price war and worries over discount operators. NatWest Securities in its latest research note adopted a 'neutral' stance on the sector and said J. Sainsbury, a half-penny firmer at 396p, Asda, steady at 54p, and Kwik Save, off a penny at 641p, held good value. The broker downgraded Argyll Group and went from 'buy' to 'hold'. The shares receded 3 1/2 to 292 1/2 p. In a weak food manufacturing sector, Unilever's good run continued, the shares climbing 15 to 1166p. Strauss Turnbull was again recommending the stock. Agency broker James Capel was said to be behind a rise in Tate &amp; Lyle of 5 to 387p. Trouble in its pig rearing division was blamed by Cranswick for a profits warning, which sent the shares plunging 32 to 159p. Buoyed by US support and interest sparked from well publicised reappraisals of the Globex futures trading system, Reuters moved up strongly, recording a rise of 28 at 1662p. Fears over the possible imposition of VAT on newspapers in this month's Budget continued to nibble away at the price of publishing stocks. Telegraph shares suffered additional nervousness ahead of third-quarter figures due in two weeks' time and the price lost 5 to 677p. United Newspapers gave up 3 to 539p, News International 2 to 293p and Mirror Group a penny to 160p. Standard Chartered moved up 13 to 1071p, an all-time high, with marketmakers citing Continental buying interest, which uncovered a stock shortage, as responsible for the strong rise in the shares. Hong Kong's latest upsurge also accounted for some of the rise. SG Warburg was the outstanding performer in merchant banks as expectations of bumper interim profits saw the shares gain 6 more at 930p, after touching a record 932p. Legal &amp; General fell to 511p before settling 9 down on balance at 516p, allbeit in thin trading of only 843,000 shares, amid persistent worries about Lautro's investigations into the industry. Pittencrief forged ahead 31 more to 436p, still boosted by revaluations of its US telecoms interests. Hopes that British Aerospace will gain a satisfactory outcome from its crisis talks with the Taiwan authorities this week helped the stock advance 8 to 434p. Steel group ASW saw its shares tumble after issuing a profits warning. They closed 41 down at 147p.</p>

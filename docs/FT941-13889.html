			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Books: Poet laureate of the politically incorrect - A look at the life and work of Rudyard Kipling RUDYARD KIPLING: SELECTED POEMS edited by Peter Keating Penguin Pounds 5.99, 229 pages KIPLING THE POET by Peter Keating Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 25, 270 pages 'And a woman is only a woman; but a good cigar is a Smoke'. 'Take up the White Man's Burden/ Send forth the best ye breed . . .' It is difficult to think of another English poet - apart from Shakespeare - who has had so many of his lines turned into popular sayings as Kipling's were. The most memorable seem today to be the epitome of political incorrectness. Even so Kipling sprawls across seven pages of the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations while Donne, say, is contained in three and a half. The last time Penguin gave us an edition of Kipling's poems - in 1977 at Pounds 1.25 - it was called Rudyard Kipling: Selected Verse. In Peter Keating's selection just published the word 'Verse' in the title has been replaced by 'Poems', and in his critical book that appears at the same time Keating argues forcefully that Kipling was a true poet, not just a writer of verse. Kipling himself always referred to his poetry as verse to distinguish it from the outpourings of the fin-de-siecle poets who were his contemporaries. When in 1941 TS Eliot began the work of bringing Kipling the poet in from the cold by writing an essay on him, followed by a selection of his poems, he called this A Choice of Kipling's Verse, thus perpetuating the second division term. Kipling's posthumous respectability as a poet dates from Eliot's selection even though Leavis and others vehemently demurred. Eliot's selection was widely reviewed and prompted two additional important reappraisals, by Orwell and by Auden. They declared themselves to be admirers but revealed, as Eliot had done, just how difficult it is to define Kipling's poetic merits in the light of a tradition that includes Shakespeare, Donne and Yeats. Orwell came to the conclusion that Kipling was a 'good bad poet'. Auden felt that Kipling's poems '. . . have the air of brilliant tactical improvisations to overcome sudden unforeseen obstacles . . .' He also suggested that, despite their amazing variety of material, the poems present a recurring situation, the danger of encirclement '. . . by inanimate forces, the Picts beyond the Roman Wall, . . . the Danes, the Dutch, the Huns, the 'new caught sullen peoples half devil and half child', even the Female of the Species.' Kipling's muse began to work overtime when he was a pupil at the United Services College in Devon and for the rest of his life it never stopped. His father published his juvenilia in Lahore in 1881 as Schoolboy Lyrics. Half a century and hundreds of poems later, Kipling published 'Storm Cone' in the Morning Post. In this poem he warned his countrymen of the threat posed by a resurgent Nazified Germany. Four years later, in 1936, Kipling died. 'The present book' says Keating 'is not only a study of Kipling as a poet, but also a life of Kipling as revealed in his poetry.' Because Kipling responded as a poet so strongly to contemporary events it does help to know the historical and biographical background. Here Keating, formerly an English don at the University of Edinburgh, is at his most useful. His explanations complement those given in 1973 by Charles Carrington in his edition of The Complete Barrack-Room Ballads. Keating, for example, further elucidates one of Kipling's most celebrated poems 'The Absent-Minded Beggar'. It appeared first in the Daily Mail in 1899 at the height of the Boer War. Its intention - hugely successful - was to raise money for serving men's wives and families. Hence the odd title: the beggar's (ie the duffer's, ie the soldier's) 'absent-mindedness' about his family's needs was a typically ironical touch: 'When you've shouted 'Rule Britannia,' when you've sung 'God Save the Queen,' When you've finished killing Kruger with your mouth, Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little tambourine For a gentleman in khaki ordered south?' Keating points to the time when Kipling was living in Villiers Street, by Charing Cross Station, almost next door to Gatti's, one of the Victorian Music Halls, and shows how cunningly he adapted the catchy rollicking rhythms of the popular Cockney songsters to his needs. As a patriotic gesture Kipling waived his copyright in 'The Absent-Minded Beggar' and the poem spread like wildfire. Sullivan set it to music, Lily Langtry recited it on stage, it appeared on handkerchiefs, scarves, biscuit barrels. There was even a backlash from the great Albert Chevalier who sang a parody of it suggesting there were more deserving causes in the inner cities. 'Through the roll of the drums hear the cry from the slums, and pay] pay] pay]' It clearly belongs with the Barrack-Room Ballads (first published in book-form in 1892) though Kipling did not put it in a book of poems until 1914. It is through the Ballads that Kipling as a poet makes his greatest appeal. Enjoyable to read to oneself they work even better in performance. Keating comments on their use of Cockney dialect, their roots in the dramatic monologue, the way succeeding collections reflected Kipling's shifting points of focus, from land to sea, from common soldier to ship's engineer (see that magnificent Calvinist ballad 'McAndrew's Hymn'), from India to South Africa. But Keating also shows how much more there was to Kipling as a poet than the Ballads - verses celebrating his love of the Sussex countryside, imitations of Horace, the terse epitaphs during the first world war (in which Kipling's son was killed) in the manner of the Greek Anthology, elegies, protest and didactic poems, poems about animals and nursery lyrics. Keating succeeds in plotting the course of Kipling's life exclusively through discussion of his poetry; but, as he says, a peculiar feature of that poetry was how frequently poems were written as an accompaniment to Kipling's stories. Whereas many writers of fiction head a chapter with a quotation from a poem, Kipling often wrote whole poems to serve as chapter-headings and end-pieces. Several of these poems then took on lives of their own in revised or expanded form. 'If', Kipling's best-known poem, is a prime example of this process. It first appeared as the closing poem to the story 'A Priest in Spite of Himself' in Rewards and Fairies. Kipling said this poem was based on Dr L S Jameson, leader of the Jameson Raid. Keating sheds a flood of light on many poems by tracking them back to their places of origin. Both confirmed Kiplingites and those taking Kipling up for one more try are likely to benefit from Keating's work.</p>

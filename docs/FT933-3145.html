			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Utd Friendly's big general branch loss A SHARP rise in the underwriting loss on the general business account has hit first-half profits at United Friendly Group, the life assurance company. The shares fell 42p to 635p yesterday as the group announced a fall in the pre-tax figure from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 6.08m. The general branch underwriting loss rose to Pounds 6.98m (Pounds 1.69m) while total net premiums written increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 53.5m. Mr George Mack, finance director, said a review had strengthened claims reserves, especially in the motor business, where claims for injuries had run ahead of estimates. In addition the group had stopped taking some categories of business. Strengthening the reserves had accounted for a third of the increased loss, he said. Another third reflected the cost of new business because of the expansion of the property and motor sectors. Life business profits rose to Pounds 5.6m from Pounds 3.9m. Total premium income in the life accounts was Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 98.7m). Earnings per share fell to 6.98p from 9.14p. The interim dividend is raised from 4.9p to 5.5p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 22, BNS -- "The Vilnius problem will  surely be mentioned in one or another form in the treaty with  Poland," said Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy minister of  foreign affairs.    Januska said Lithuanian and Polish positions on the  estimation of disputed historic events have "sufficiently drawn  closer." Therefore it became possible "to choose formulas that  would satisfy both sides," he said.    A delegation of Lithuanian negotiators, led by Vladislovas  Domarkas, deputy minister of foreign affairs, left for Warsaw  Monday [21 February], to continue talks on some disputed clauses  of the Lithuanian-Polish agreement on friendship and cooperation.    Januska regretted that his Polish counterpart Iwo Byczewski,  who heads the Polish negotiation team, "speaks widely about  things that might only become a result of talks."    The Polish news agency PAP quoted Byczewski as saying that  Lithuania gave up its intentions to sign a separate declaration  on the 1920 annexation of Vilnius together with the main  agreement.    Lithuanian radio said Monday that the Polish official  expressed doubt whether history will be discussed in detail,  except for several "general" sentences in the preamble of the  accord.    In Januska's opinion, the return of history to the text is  considered a positive step but "not just another concession of  the Lithuanian side.    "It seems, we have reached a stage when a return to the  initial formula can be made -- to include everything in one  treaty, and this makes things more significant."    Lithuania sought to mention the annexation of Vilnius in the  main agreement from the very beginning of interstate talks, but  when Poland disagreed, the Lithuanian side suggested to move  history to a separate declaration that would be signed  simultaneously.    The Lithuanian negotiators are scheduled to return from  Poland Feb. 23.</p>

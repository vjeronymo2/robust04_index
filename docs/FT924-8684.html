			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Buy-out activity continues to decline - In a Nutshell The volume of large buy-out activity has been sharply reduced by the recession but there has been a much smaller fall, just 10 per cent, in the number of smaller buy-outs where management takes a majority stake, according to a survey* by 3i, the venture capital group. The review of 188 buy-outs financed by 3i showed that the average price/earnings multiple fell from 7.5 to 6.1 per cent between 1989 and 1991. Individual managers invested on average just Pounds 40,000 in their company while the average investment by management teams was between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 150,000. The average ratio of debt to equity (gearing) of the buy-outs was relatively constant over the three year period at 1.75:1. *Management in the Majority.

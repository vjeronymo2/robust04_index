Quite the contrary, talks might have failed  finally.    According to corresponding reports by both government  parties, the negotiations on a new law on alternative national  service, which lasted for months, have now failed. In fact,  politicians declined to confirm this officially yesterday, but  in hastily arranged news conferences and in numerous statements  that were issued, both sides blamed each other for the failure.  Thus, Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend (Austrian People's  Party) announced that he has the impression that the Socialist  Party of Austria [SPOe] was determined to prevent a successful  conclusion. He no longer expects an agreement.    SPOe manager Cap stressed in an interview with DIE PRESSE  yesterday: "The truth is that the Austrian People's Party  [OeVP] has always wanted the commission [that decides whether  the reasons cited by young men in favor of alternative national  service are plausible]. For me Fasslabend signaled that there  will be no more talks."    Shortly before the end of the year, agreement seemed within  reach after renewed secret contacts between Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek: They suggested 11  months of alternative national service this year and delaying  the decision as to whether and when it should be extended to 12  months.    When difficulties occurred again in the negotiations between  Fasslabend and Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak (SPOe), the  OeVP finally lost its patience.    The result is that the old law went into effect at the  beginning of the year. Alternative civilian service lasts eight  months, but reasons must again be given before a commission.  However, currently no personnel and no infrastructure are  available for such a commission.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat, identified by nom de guerre Abu-'Ammar, in Tunis  by unidentified Radio Monte Carlo correspondent in radio studio  on 25 February -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] President 'Arafat, good morning.    ['Arafat] Good morning, brother.    [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what is your comment on the  massacre?    ['Arafat] I regret that this massacre has taken place. First  of all, I do not absolve the Israeli Army of this  responsibility, because everyone knows that the Israeli Army  protects the entrances of the Ibrahimi Mosque and the area  surrounding it. How, then, has it allowed armed settlers to  enter the mosque while worshipers were performing dawn prayers?  Therefore, there is some form of collusion. This has serious  implications and meanings. Everyone must know that our people's  blood is not spilt without a price, and that our people's blood  is precious. To open fire on worshipers while they are  performing dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an incident  over which I cannot but call on the world at large, the  cosponsors of the conference, the UN Security Council permament  members and the other UN Security Council members, the EC, the  Nonaligned countries, and the Arab and Islamic countries to  shoulder their responsibility. I specifically call on the  cosponsors of the conference which signed the peace agreement  with us. What peace are they speaking about while crimes  against our people continue and while fire is opened on our  worshipers, children, and women? What peace are they speaking  about?    [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what steps does the PLO intend  to take in the occupied territories in wake of the massacre.  What do you have to say to the Palestinians in the occupied  territories?    ['Arafat] All morning, I have been contacting officials in  many friendly countries to apprise them of the situation. Even  in America, I contacted them, through some brothers, to inform  them so they may assume their responsibilities, including the  cosponsors of the conference. At the same time, we asked our  representative at the United Nations to call for an urgent UN  Security Council session so it can take appropriate measures to  protect our people, children, women, worshipers, mosques, and  holy places which are being violated day and night.    [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what impact will this have on  the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations?    ['Arafat] It will have very serious dimensions not only on  the negotiations, but on all levels and in all directions.    [Reporter] One last question, President 'Arafat. U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced at the U.S.  House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday  that the United States has to continue its confrontation of the  enemies of the peace process. Christopher said that you, that  President Yasir 'Arafat is not an enemy of peace, and that he is  cooperating with Israel to end violence, as he said. What do  you have to say to the U.S. secretary of state's statement?    ['Arafat] Well, I would like now to see what stand he will  adopt on these armed settlers. From where have they received  weapons, and how are they permitted to carry arms while our  people are not permitted to do the same? How can he allow the  collusion that took place between the settlers and the Israeli  Army? I would like to ask him too about the U.S. stand, given  that the United States is one of the sponsors of the conference,  and a signatory of the peace agreement, an agreement we signed  at the White House under the auspices of President Clinton?    [Reporter] President 'Arafat, a thousand thanks.    ['Arafat] What about the stand of the entire world, not only  the cosponsors of the conference? What is the stand of the  European countries, the Nonaligned countries, the Islamic  countries, and the Arab countries? This is a crime which cannot  be treated lightly.    [Reporter] President 'Arafat, thank you. We will contact  you later during our next newscasts. Many thanks.    ['Arafat] Thank you.</p>

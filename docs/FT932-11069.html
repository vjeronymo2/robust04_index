			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Hoover 'misled union' on plans HOOVER, the domestic appliances manufacturer, was accused yesterday by the AEEU union of contradicting itself over the future of its UK operations, Robert Taylor writes. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the engineering and electrical union's Scottish chief executive officer, said he had written to Mr Leonard Hadley, president and chief executive of Maytag, the US parent company, asking him who was running Hoover. Earlier this year Mr Airlie negotiated an efficiency deal with Hoover that resulted in its decision to transfer vacuum cleaner production from Dijon in France to Scotland. Last week doubt was cast over that when it became clear that the company was reviewing all its European operations. Mr Airlie said yesterday that Mr Hadley and the company's new European president, Mr Gerald Kamman, appeared to have contradicted each other over Hoover's Scottish plant at Cambuslang. In his annual statement to shareholders on April 27 Mr Hadley said the move was proceeding as planned. Only a day earlier Mr Kamman wrote to every Hoover employee in Europe to say that 'nothing will escape review'. Management, Page 14</p>

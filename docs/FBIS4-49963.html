			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, May 11 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC]'s ambassador to South Africa, Loh I-cheng, on Wednesday  [11 May] denied reports that President Li Teng-hui had a dinner  meeting with Zambia President Frederick Chiluba during which the  two discussed establishing diplomatic relations.    Several Taipei newspapers carried reports Wednesday that  Chiluba was the guest of honor at a dinner given by Li at Loh's  residence Tuesday. Both President Li and Chiluba were among the  heads of state attending the inauguration of new South African  President Nelson Mandela.    Loh and Presidential Spokesman Raymond Tai, who is  accompanying Li during his trip, said only embassy staff and  President Li's entourage were present at the dinner.    But Loh said Li did have a meeting with ranking South  African  officials, including a provincial governor and a member of the  new cabinet, at his residence Tuesday.</p>

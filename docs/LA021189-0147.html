			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> INFLATION FEARS PUSH DOWN BOND PRICES  </P> <P> Bond prices lost ground Friday after the government reported wholesale prices  shot up faster than expected last month.  </P> <P> But prices managed to recover from the day's lows reached shortly after release  of the wholesale price report.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished down 18/32 point, or $5.25 per  $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from  its price, rose to 9.04% from 8.89% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Prices of some 30-year issues plunged by nearly a full point shortly after the  Labor Department released its report that its producer price index climbed 1%  in January, its biggest monthly increase since an identical surge in October,  1985, and equivalent to a 12.7% annual rate of inflation.  </P> <P> The inflation report reignited fears that the Federal Reserve would push  interest rates higher in a bid to slow the economy and curb inflation.  </P> <P> Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as Treasury notes  and bonds, but so do rising interest rates.  </P> <P> As the day progressed, bond prices retraced some territory as the dollar surged  on foreign exchange markets. A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated  investments more attractive to foreign investors.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell by between 3/16 point and 11/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 11/32  point and long-term issues were down 1/2 point, according to Telerate Inc., a  financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 3.83 to 1,127.79.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials fell. Moody's investment grade corporate bond  index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of  5 years or longer, lost 0.68 to 298.52.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds fell 17/32 point to close at 91 7/32. The average yield to maturity rose  to 7.65% from 7.61% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Yields on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 8.86% as the discount rose 9 basis  points to 8.56%. Yields on 6-month bills rose to 9.05% as the discount rose 13  basis points to 8.55%. Yields on 1-year bills rose to 9.20% as the discount  rose 12 basis points to 8.53%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9.0625%, down from 9.125% late Thursday.  </P></p>

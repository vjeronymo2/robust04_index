			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Company start-ups increase sharply A sharp rise in company formations last month has been reported by Jordans, the Bristol-based information company, Philip Coggan writes. It said 10,498 companies were formed in February, a 6.8 per cent increase on the same month last year. January saw a 4.8 per cent increase. The information is compiled using data supplied by Companies House and excludes Northern Ireland. Excluding March, which is a big month for company formations because it is the end of the financial year, last month's figure was the largest since May 1991. Last year 113,561 new companies were formed compared with 107,375 in 1992.</p>

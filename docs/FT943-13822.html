			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: NBC financial video network NBC, the US network television company, plans to launch a new desktop video services for the financial community in September. It will do so through its business television division, CNBC. The new services will use normal terrestrial TV to deliver to personal computers news stories that might affect the financial markets. The new services, NBC Desktop Video, will also provide on-demand video retrieval of items already broadcast, and enable subscribers to send their own multimedia information to other subscribers on the NBC network. Trials have already begun in the US before the September launch. The service will be introduced to Europe in the fourth quarter of this year. NBC already delivers specialist desktop information to the financial services industry, with the launch last year of Private Financial Network. Tom Rogers, president of NBC cable and business development, says that since the launch of PFN 'the need for live video coverage of market-moving events, linked with a retrieval component, has become even more important to our customers in the financial market-place.' In the UK, Reuters, the news and information group, has recently launched a service of breaking news to City terminals, although without retrieval capability so far.</p>

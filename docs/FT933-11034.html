			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Fading sound of music: Why there may be a requiem for one of the world's finest piano makers There is hardly a musician who does not know about Bech-stein, one of the world's finest pianos, whose keys were played by Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. There is hardly a Berliner who would not demand its rescue as bankruptcy now hangs over the 140-year-old company. Bechstein has had an uphill struggle since it was bought by Mr Karl Schulze, regarded as a master piano maker, from the US-based Baldwin keyboard manufacturers in 1985. Mr Schulze had only one aim: to restore the international reputation of this grand concert piano. Baldwin had acquired the renowned established family business in the 1960s, and afterwards, the quality of the pianos was compromised, experts say. Its infrequent presence on the concert platform seemed to confirm this perception. Before the second world war, Bechstein and Steinway competed with each other to grace the world's concert halls, Today, about 90 per cent of them are using Steinway, followed by the Vienna-based Bosendorfer. 'Baldwin is a good American firm. It thought it could sell more pianos by capitalising on the name. But each piano has to be crafted, individually made, and cared for,' said Mr Roger Willson, manager of Whelpdale, Maxwell and Codd, a piano manufacturer, and the sole importer into the UK of Bechstein. Soon after acquiring Bechstein, Mr Schulze bought new premises in west Berlin, not far from Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing point between east and west Berlin, and with help of 68 craftsmen, revived traditional piano-making skills. By the early 1990s, the company was making 350 concert grands and 600 uprights a year. Mr Schulze, confident about the future, decided to expand. He bought a small piano factory in Bavaria, as well as the established Zimmermann piano factory in the eastern German state of Saxony. Then things started to go wrong. An explanation is offered by Mr Willson. 'The recession hit him badly,' he said. 'You see, about 60 per cent of our sales of Bechstein, and Bluthner, another great German piano manufacturer located in Leipzig, is sold to the older generation. With the fall in housing prices, especially in Britain, people held back. These are expensive instruments.' A Bechstein grand costs between DM80,000 (Pounds 31,128) and DM100,000, and an upright between DM18,000 and DM30,000. As a result of the recession, piano sales in the UK fell last year by 15 per cent, to between 10,000 and 12,000. Worldwide, 680,000 pianos were sold, 270,000 fewer than in 1991. The market faces growing competition from Japan, and especially South Korea and China, which have exploited the global downturn by offering low prices and somewhat inferior quality. But, when it comes to concert grands, the Japanese are up against a bias which favours European tradition and craftsmanship. Some German bankers say that Mr Schulze expanded at the wrong time. But another factor could be that unlike his competitors, Steinway and Bosendorfer, both of which are owned by US companies, Beckstein has no private backers. 'He did it alone. It would be a shame to see Bechstein disappear,' said Mr Michael Glazebrook, director of technical services at Steinway. Because of the recession, Bechstein's bankers, Dresdener and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in Berlin, have been reluctant to provide loans of about DM3m to the company, which saw turnover fall by 15 per cent to DM20m last year. This year it may be even lower, at DM15m. Without financial backing from the Senate, Berlin's city government or from a consortium of bankers, Bechstein could be forced into liquidation. The irony is that Bechstein's bankers have refused their support at a time when other great piano manufacturers, particularly those in east Germany, are slowly re-establishing their reputations. These include Bluthner and Zimmermann, both based in Saxony. Bluthner was founded in 1853, and was chosen for concert performances by Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Rubenstein, and Claudio Arrau, the latter one of the finest interpreters of Beethoven's sonatas. Ingbert Bluthner, a direct descendant, managed to bring the business back into the family in 1990 from communist state control. He began to market the piano again, and opened a workshop to recondition second-hand instruments. 'It is difficult, but we are surviving, and we are regaining our traditional niche in the upper end of the market,' said Ms Gitta Grosse, manager of Bluthner's showrooms in Leipzig. 'You must remember that we had no chance to compete, or gain access to high-quality parts for our piano under the old system. This has all changed,' she added. 'The quality of Bluthner is much better now,' said Mr Willson. 'It has that lovely soft tone.' Zimmermann, which caters for the middle end of the market, has also regained its reputation as a high-quality family piano. But its fortunes depend on the fate of Bechstein. 'If Bechstein is allowed to fail, it would be very sad. We are talking about quality, about a name, about craftsmanship, which Germany is so good at, and which people still want. The Bechstein is as famous as Berlin's coat of arms, the bear,' said Mr Willson. Steinway's Mr Glazebrook added: 'Some would think we would be delighted to see the end of Bechstein because it would mean less competition. But it's not like that at all. It's about retaining the continuity of quality and tradition.' The Senate, and any prospective rescuer, will next week have to decide the price it will pay for maintaining, or neglecting, that tradition.</p>

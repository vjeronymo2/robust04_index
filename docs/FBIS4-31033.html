			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Antoine de Gerondo; place and date not given]    [Text] Gyula Horn, leader of the (former Communist)  Socialist Party which won last Sunday's parliamentary elections,  should logically become the next Hungarian Government chief. He  will then have many reasons to savor his victory. First,  because shortly before the first round of the elections this  62-year-old man miraculously survived a car accident, which has  left him wearing a metal surgical collar. Second, because he  has overcome the accusations about his controversial past when,  as a young Communist, he formed part of the militia responsible  for crushing the 1956 uprising. Indeed, for most Hungarians,  this former Communist is still primarily a reformer who  contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc by enabling East  German refugees to reach the West via Hungary in 1989.    [De Gerondo] How can your past as party leader be reconciled  with your recent conversion to supporting free trade and the  market economy? Will you continue the previous government's  policy?    [Horn] I find it difficult to understand how my past as a  party man can interfere with my conversion to a supporter of a  free market economy. On Sunday, in the parliamentary elections,  the Hungarians overwhelmingly rejected the previous government.  Logically, I find it difficult to see why I should continue that  government's line. But, to the extent that your question  relates to the Hungarian Socialist Party's intention of setting  up a market economy, I say firmly that this is our intention.    [De Gerondo] If you become prime minister, what will you do  to draw a distinction between your role as party leader and that  of government chief? In particular, will you be able to  counterbalance the influence of the MSZOSZ (the powerful trade  union federation led by Sandor Nagy), the legacy of the past and  the basis of your electorate?    [Horn] The functions of government chief and party leader  are not incompatible. Moreover, there are many examples in  Western Europe. I personally await the decision of the  forthcoming Socialist Party congress. As regards the second  part of your question, we have still not analyzed in detail the  fundamental structures of our voters or their sympathies. My  intention is to entrust this task to an opinion poll institute.  Today, nobody in Hungary can answer this question. Everybody  has the right to express his own views. However, I must add  that I am well enough known for people to realize that I make my  decisions alone.    [De Gerondo] Will you continue the current privatization  policy? In particular the return of land to its former owners  and the payment of compensation?    [Horn] We will not continue the privatizations in the same  way. Compared with the policy pursued by the former government  coalition, we want to prevent corruption. Privatization  operations will be open and subject to the sovereignty of the  deputies. The goal will be to protect jobs, and even to create  them, and not to deliver Hungary to uncontrolled commercialism.  To answer the second part of your question, it is natural that  the legal provisions on compensation, which have already been  adopted, should be respected and that compensation should be  carried through without restrictions.  <H5>  Respect for the Opposition </H5>   [De Gerondo] Following your victory on Sunday, will you take  account of the opposition's proposals if they serve the  country's interests?    [Horn] Even in the past, I have always taken account of  proposals or even ideas from other groups. Without  discrimination. I will not depart from that line of conduct now.    [De Gerondo] Hungary needs Western aid to rebuild its  economy. Will you continue the policy of cooperation with the  Western countries set up over the past four years, or will you  adopt a different course? In particular, will you have  different relations with the countries of the former Socialist  bloc and with the countries which have emerged from the former  USSR?    [Horn] Hungary does not need Western aid to rebuild its  economy. To modernize its infrastructure, this country must  follow one political line: maintaining market relations with  all the countries which have a mutual interest. The Hungarian  Socialist Party's position is known: We will not question the  bases of our foreign policy which is the result of a general  consensus among the six parties represented in parliament.  However, we cannot deny that the previous government made  mistakes in relations with the East European countries.  Geopolitically, and also because of historical circumstances,  it is logical that we should give more weight to our relations  with Eastern Europe.    [De Gerondo] Will you give new impetus to the process of  integrating Hungary in the European Union and NATO?    [Horn] That would be a kind of "unrequited love." The  integration process is now functioning by itself as a series of  provisions which have been discussed and drawn up and which  contain preconditions. In this respect, it is rather unlikely  that a change of government will make big differences to the  process started.    [De Gerondo] You are also known as the Socialist monarch.  You were a reformist Communist in the past, and now you are a  Socialist. Are you really a democrat?    [Horn] Over the past four years and especially in recent  weeks, I have been given many titles. I have not heard the one  you mention, or at least I do not remember it. I think that  over the past few years, the Hungarian Socialist Party has  asserted itself as a truly democratic movement, as a force of  the Left which defends the interests of the majority of society.  I am president of this party. But you probably know this  comment by Heinrich Boell: "Any honest man has been a Communist  at least once in his life."</p>

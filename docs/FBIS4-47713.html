			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 30 SAPA -- Heads of the  International Observer Missions to South Africa on Saturday [30  April] said the elections up to the end of voting had been free.  United Nations special representative Lakhdar Brahimi said  everyone who had wanted to vote had been able to.    The observers said they could not yet comment on the  fairness  of the elections.    The heads of the European Union Election Unit and Observer  Mission, the Commonwealth Observer Mission and the Organisation  of African Unity Observer Mission were addressing a press  briefing at the Independent Electoral Commission's Gallagher  Estate offices in Midrand.    In a joint statement they said the elections had been  successful despite administrative problems.    Former Jamaican prime minister and Commonwealth mission head  Michael Manley said he had been impressed by the enthusiasm of  South African voters and the good relations between black and  white people queueing at voting stations. South Africa was on  the threshold of rejoining the Commonwealth, Mr Manley said.  "This is really the end of the anti-colonial struggle."    The joint statement read: "The people of South Africa  clearly  demonstrated their commitment to the end of apartheid and the  transformation to nonracial democracy by turning out in enormous  numbers to vote. "The escalation and spread of violence which  was widely predicted and feared did not happen."</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Trident warhead should be redesigned, says study BRITAIN'S latest nuclear weapon, the Trident II warhead, should be redesigned, suggests a draft report from Basic, a London-based think-tank which specialises in critiques of Nato policy. The study also calls for a halt to all movements of nuclear weapons in Britain while an independent review is made of their safety in storage and transport. Basic's report draws upon criticism of US nuclear weapons levelled by independent scientific assessors over a year ago, and assumes that British weapon designs relate closely to their US counterparts. Britain's first Trident submarine is scheduled to enter service in 1994. Its warheads are believed to be behind schedule because of production difficulties. They were designed by the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, Berk-shire. Safety of British Nuclear Weapon Designs. Basic, 33 Southampton St, London WC2E 7HQ.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Fashion Focus - At the Paris spring/summer 1995 collections, the FT conducted its annual survey. Brenda Polan elaborates on the results Humanity is notoriously torn between the comfort of the familiar and the thrill of novelty. And even for the most susceptible (and experienced) followers of fashion it is not unusual to perceive a conflict between creativity and wearability. The great leaps of imagination which give us new and appropriate ways to dress have all initially found their dismissive opponents before gaining complete acceptance and supplanting all that went before. We often need a little period of adjustment. In fashion-speak it is called 'getting your eye in'. This helps to explain why many of the industry experts who participated in the Financial Times survey of the Paris collections for spring/summer 1995 voted one designer most creative but intended to buy their wardrobe from another. On the strength of October's showings, Jean Paul Gaultier was acclaimed, by a substantial margin, the most creative designer of the season. In second place was Britain's Vivienne Westwood, followed, fairly closely, by her compatriot, John Galliano, the Japanese designers, Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo of the Comme des Garcons label and then by the two Frenchmen, Claude Montana and Christian Lacroix. The picture is slightly confused by the admirers of Karl Lagerfeld. His own-label range, Lagerfeld, placed eighth and his collection for Chanel tied with Lolita Lempicka for ninth place, but, if you add up his percentage points, the number of experts naming him most creative is the same as those nominating Galliano. Interestingly, it was Lagerfeld's Chanel collection which was considered far and away the most likely to be copied by the lower echelons of the fashion industry worldwide. It was also the collection most likely to attract the experts' hard-earned pennies. In this category Vivienne Westwood tied for second place with Christian Dior (unranked for creativity), Jean Paul Gaultier came sixth while, in between, was Lolita Lempicka (ninth in the creativity ratings), and Chantal Thomass, a hardy survivor from the early 1980s. If respondents appeared to neglect the designers who had shown the previous week in Milan and London (and they could hardly take the Americans, who were to show at the beginning of November, into consideration) then that is because Paris is still the influential heart of fashion. With admirable Gallic ruthlessness, Paris seduces the most imaginative of the rest of the world's designers on to its schedule, gathering them to its otherwise stony bosom with tenderness and passion. To watch the officers of the Chambre Syndicale, the French industry's governing body, leading a standing ovation for Issey Miyake is to understand that in Paris the nationhood of talent takes precedence over nationalistic concerns with export figures. When Denise Dubois, the achingly, 'Frenchly'-elegant head of its press office, gazes with misty-eyed pride at a bowing Vivienne Westwood clad in one of her own rigid bustles, you understand that a different kind of chauvinism is at work. The great fashion innovators, whatever their place of birth, belong to Paris. The atmosphere of excited anticipation, of euphoric pleasure or desperate disappointment which characterises these shows is unique to Paris. And when Paris comes up with a season like this one, so full of drama, triumph and disaster, beauty and perversity, passion and magic, even the accomplishments of the Milanese faded into memories hard to revive. So when one interprets the figures from this survey and discovers only minimal mentions for designers showing in Italy and London, one has to offer them the comfort of an explanation. In the first FT survey (conducted in March during the Paris collections for autumn/winter 1994), Giorgio Armani topped the polls for commercial success and long-term influence, but for creativity, (the focus of the current survey), he came eleventh. Ahead of him were Westwood, Miyake, Gaultier, Yohji Yamamoto, Kawakubo, Galliano, Martin Margiela, Romeo Gigli, And Demeulemeester, Karl Lagerfeld and Jil Sander. So what do the great creative designers of the mid 1990s have in common that impels even those who would not wear their product to acknowledge their pre-eminence? I recently asked one of the brighter supermodels, Kate Moss, to name her favourite designers. She dutifully mentioned Calvin Klein, her biggest employer, and added Westwood, of course, and then her face lit up with that wicked litile grin which so devastates photographers. 'And John Galliano because he's always got a story. John tells you a story, like you're the romantic young widow of a very rich older man and you've just come back from the funeral and all the other mourners have gone and suddenly you can't stand being alone in your empty mansion and you hit the town in your widow's weeds. And you can be someone. It's so great ..' It may not always be that well thought out, but many of the great creative designers have a story. They are not actually costuming a mini-drama of their own creation but instead they evoke a mood, a moment, an identity which finds a response in the way women, at that moment, imagine themselves. Jean Paul Gaultier, for instance, started his carnival of a show by presenting what appeared to be a potted history of 20th-century dress, from Edwardian sugar-icing elegance to space-age micro-dresses. But, lo, we were not, after all, in a museum but in a Hollywood wardrobe department. And as the carousel music sped up, Gaultier's heroine, heavily-lidded, glossy-mouthed and nightclub pallid, reappeared in an archivist's nightmare of chronologically mismatched pieces, dissolving the process of logical time and inspiring chuckles of delight from his audience. Of course, to women who just want flattering, sensible, smart clothes, this can all seem overly cerebral, elitist, pretentious and precious. But out of a joyous exercise such as Gaultier's come the new shapes and textures,combinations and contrasts which will define the moment and dictate what we all wear. Fashion does not always achieve such vitality. The times must demand it before the designers can feel a need that must be answered. In the mid 1990s we are lucky (or not, if you don't give a damn and love your shellsuit) to have so many extraordinarily creative designers in fashion. Chanel may have had Schiaparelli as a despised companion and rival in experiment, but Dior had to go it alone and Yves Saint Laurent risked his sanity before a generation of designers accepted his creative lead. Today, there is a comradeship of creativity. Westwood, Galliano, Miyake, Kawakubo, Lacroix, Yamamoto, Margiela, Marongiu (when he is on form), Ozbek (ditto), Mugler and Lagerfeld all approach their craft in an analytical, deconstructionist way, using the work of all their predecessors as a springboard for ideas. Their points of focus differ, of course. Westwood may explore extreme historical concepts of female beauty, styles and aspects of dress, such as the bustle, or cleavage-contorting corsetry that caricature women's 'Erotic Zones' (the title of her show). Yamamoto may compulsively, deconstruct the kimono, the garment his nation wore, unchanging, for centuries, and then reconstruct it in stunning and startling marriages with aspects of western dress. Miyake may push the beauty and functionality of fabric beyond all boundaries, reconciling comfort, flattery and breathtakingly magical effects in defiance of the limits of the possible. But whatever their focus, they all simultaneously expand our understanding of the past as expressed through dress and enrich our present with amusing and beautiful choices for getting dressed tomorrow. Even Karl Lagerfeld, most copied and, it appears, most coveted, is an irreverent deconstructionist. He is best known for deconstructing and reconstructing (in a manner that many deem extraordinarily vulgar) the life's work of Coco Chanel. For those of us who hero-worship Chanel, thc vitality of the result is clouded by a frisson of lese majeste but as Karl himself said to a packed lecture hall at the Sorbonne, 'My taste is so bad, it is good.' Well, sometimes. What his poor taste expresses is a healthy dissent from the stale, the safe, the overly respected. In the late 1980s, Lagerfeld used his licence at Chanel to pander to the status-hunger of the times while simultaneously, mocking it. He broke every rule the sober-sided Coco ever made. This demonstrates that making an icon of the century's greatest fashion iconoclast was a pretty silly move - even if she, in her later years, would have approved of the accolade. It is, however, the authority of the Chanel name, the icon-quality, which makes Lagerfeld's line so imitated and so covetable. Within the narrow confines of the fashion world, Lagerfeld has an impressive track record; outside it, Coco's name still sells and sells. The glamour conjured by her name still comforts, still reassures. Which is what we need now. So, as the emphasis of fashion turns once more towards formality, glamour and the joy of a little light-hearted, self-conscious role-playing, the truly creative designers move in from the fringe to oust the more conventional designers from centre stage. And this season, as the FT survey shows; the man who summed up the spirit of 1995 was Gaultier, and the woman was his posy, red-lipped, spike-heeled drama queen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT Survey Results  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Most creative designers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranking                              % of vote  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Jean Paul Gaultier             26.9  2    Vivienne Westwood              20  3    John Galliano                  16.5  4    Issey Miyake                   15.6  5    Comme des Garcons              12.1  6    Claude Montana                  9.5  6    Christian Lacroix               9.5  8    Karl Lagerfeld                  8.6  9    Lolita Lempicka                 7.8  9    Chanel                          7.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Most copied designers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranking                              % of vote  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Chanel                         35.6  2    Jean Paul Gaultier             11.3  2    Yves Saint Laurent             11.3  4    Karl Lagerfeld                  7.8  5    Vivienne Westwood               6.9  6    Dries van Noten                 6.0  7    Christian Dior                  5.2  8    John Galliano                   4.3  9    Gianni Versace                  3.4  9    Comme des Garcons               3.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Most promising collections  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranking                              % of vote  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Herve Leger                    10.4  2    Dries van Noten                 8.6  3    John Galliano                   7.8  4    Helmut Lang                     4.3  4    Lolita Lempicka                 4.3  6    Ann Demeulemeester              3.4  6    Veronique Leroy                 3.4  6    Rifat Ozbek                     3.4  6    Alexander McQueen               3.4 10    Marcel Marongiu                 2.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Most covetable collections  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranking                              % of vote  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1    Chanel                         13.9  2    Vivienne Westwood               8.6  2    Christian Dior                  8.6  4    Lolita Lempicka                 7.8  4    Chantal Thomass                 7.8  4    Jean Paul Gaultier              7.8  7    Valentino                       6.0  7    Christian Lacroix               6.0  9    Commes des Garcons              5.2  9    John Galliano                   5.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- For this Survey we canvassed the opinions of an international cross-section of fashion editors, buyers and industry specialists attending the recent spring/summer 1995 collections in Paris. They were asked to rate the designers for 'creativity', and the collections they fund 'most promising', 'most covetable' and 'most likely to be copied'. For our Top Ten lists we scored the number of votes for each designer as a percentage of the number of respondents. There was surprising consensus of opinion within different age groups and between nationalities despite slight variations. Respondents in their 20s put Gaultier, Westwood and Galliano at the top of their lists for 'creativity', with Miyake in fifth place, meriting only a third of Gaultier's score, while those in their 30s and 40s put Miyake on top, with Galliano and Gaultier close behind. Men and women alike thought Gaultier the 'most creative' but women placed Miyake a decisive second while men ranked him fifth. Perhaps surprisingly, the French rated Westwood the 'most creative' (with Gaultier a close second), while the British reversed the order (but only by a few votes). In the category of collections 'most likely to be copied', Chanel's strong lead reflected an overwhelming French vote, although only the British respondents had another candidate for the top slot (Westwood). There was also a broad unanimity about the 'most covetable' collections with Chanel, Westwood and Dior leading the pack.</p>

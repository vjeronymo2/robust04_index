			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from correspondent Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi in Aden -- </F> recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There is reaction here to the  recent decision made in Sanaa to withdraw confidence from 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the presidential council and  secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, and from other  party officials and to the declaration of a 30-day state of  emergency in the country.    [Al-Bid] We know from where we draw our legitimacy. Our  legitimacy stems from our people. The legitimacy of radio and  television that is imposed on the people is transient and can  last only a few days. President Salih might believe that he can  impose it for 30 days. Well, he cannot, not even for a few  days. Trust your cause and your people, your cohesion, and  national unity and protect every citizen without discrimination,  no matter from what province they come. All those who are with  the pledge and accord document, with full national cohesion, and  with the peaceful and democratic struggle are with us, wherever  they are born or from whatever province they hail. We have also  issued instructions and a camp has been opened in Lahij for our  brothers who want to join us from any province. They are  welcome. [passage omitted]</p>

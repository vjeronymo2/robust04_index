The next round of the pre-election  struggle is fast approaching, and everybody has suddenly started  mentioning ecology. Are the candidates just making eyes at a  fashionable topic? Or do you have a different interpretation of  this matter?    Panov: No. That's the way it has been and always  will be in all countries, not only in our young Ukrainian state.  Populism, demagogy--neither you nor I made up these words. The  world, unfortunately, is unfinished and imperfect.    Smaha: That's true, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, but do  you recall how the Green Movement began in Ukraine? That first  meeting near the Central Kiev Stadium on 13 November 1988, the  First Congress of the Green World [Zeleniy svit] Association  with the dazzling greetings by Oles Honchar, the first  election--as it were--to a democratic parliament. That "rebuilt  euphoria"--what was it that brought it all to an end so suddenly?    Panov: In my opinion, it was the profound crisis  in the environmental-protection movement.    Smaha: But what caused this? Because for nearly  seven years you were the deputy chairman and executive director  of the Green World Association, and so--to a certain extent--you  must have felt responsible for what happened in this country's  environmental-protection movement....    Panov: That's true. Nor do I shirk my  responsibility in this matter. But understand me correctly: From  the very beginning our movement has included forces that can be  characterized--so to speak--as centrifugal and centripetal. Some  persons (a typical example would be Serhiy Konev from  Dniproderzhynsk) who emphasized the political aspects of the  cause. Others (and here i could cite Alla Shevchuk from Odessa)  regarded the coordinating organ as something to provide help in  solving small-scale, regional problems--things live saving the  well-know Kulyanyk Estuary near Odessa. The "politicians" and  the "practioners" persisted in taking very different stances in  their attitude toward the environmental-protection movement.  Enthusiasm really did exert a substantial influence on the fate  of the Green World Association.    Smaha: Just what did happen? Was it something  similar to the former Society for Environmental Protection?    Panov: No, come on now Valentyn Ivanovych! People  were making careers, and the cause stood still. I don't want to  publicly name those persons who made careers for themselves  based on the phraseology of environmental protectionism. Nor do  I wish to enumerate the "beetles" who became rich on Western aid  or various kinds of speculative ventures. What I want to do here  is to list the problems which Green World has done some  organizational work on. The public can solve them or not, as it  sees fit....    Smaha: What specific problems do you mean?    Panov: First, there should be a moratorium on  building new units at nuclear-power stations, and the  continuation of operations at the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear-Power  Station] should be revoked. These continued operations threaten  Ukraine with a catastrophe in the very near future. They will  not bring the energy crisis to an end, but rather deepen the  economic crisis. The whole trouble is that Ukraine lacks a  machine-building and raw-material base for nuclear-power  engineering. All the talk about the effectiveness of our  nuclear-power stations is a bluff. We do not have such  possibilities as Beria had for maintaining order in the  atomic-power industry. Nor will we ever have them. It would mean  that one out of every three citizens would have to be condemned  for the absurd Article 58. What nonsense....    Smaha: Does that mean that the aggressive plans to  use nuclear power for Ukraine's future electric-power  engineering are basedon nonsensical principles?    Panov: Of course! Chernobyl in its present-day  guise is potentially hazardous. We "Greens" have officially  demonstrated that Kiev lies within the zone which suffered from  the accident at this AES. People from Narodnychi have been  resettled. But there are districts in Kiev where the level of  gamma-type radiation is higher. Why, then, are Kievans not being  resettled? Because the Supreme Council has blocked this  decision. The reason is a simple one: They don't have the money  to do this.    Smaha: If they don't have the money, where did it  all go?    Panov: We must speak honestly about the conditions  under which Ukraine's capital is now living. The state cannot  help--the world community must come to its assistance! But we  seem to regard it as best--during these times so trying to our  souls--to conceal our illness within. It's as if we fail to  understand that future generations will have to pay for this.    Smaha: But could not all this likewise be  understood as inflaming the passions?    Panov: Certainly. But why, then, are the people  who are most competent in these matters leaving Ukraine.  Mykhaylo Sorokin has become director of the Kursk AES, after  having left the Chernobyl AES. The deputy general director of  Ukratomenergonaglyad--Heorhiy Kopchynskiy--has quit working  there. And the director of the Ukryttya facility--Mykola  Sherbyna--has also left his post. These people are professional  experts in the nuclear-power field! They understand better than  anyone what is going on. But we--either because of stupidity or  willful negligence--continue to keep millions of people in  ignorance.    Smaha: There's a great deal of talk nowadays about  a new isotope--americium. Its appearance will compel us to  rethink the entire strategy of eliminating the consequences of  the Chernobyl accident. What's your attitude toward this?    Panov: I view it as a great deal of speculation on  a fashionable topic. Carrying the weight of authority for me are  the words of Academician Dmytro Grodzynskyy to the effect that  americium will not be any safer that the hot sections in the  core of Energy Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl AES. And the presence  of material from these sections has been ascerained even as far  away as California.... Therefore, let me repeat the following:  The declaration of Kiev as a place which suffered from the  Chernobyl AES is a central question in the politics of  eliminating the consequences of the accident there.    Smaha: Let me make sure that I've understood you  correctly: You're saying that the bureaucrats who are shutting  their eyes to the obvious truth are knowingly condemning our  capital to die out gradually?    Panov: I would not use the word "knowingly." It is  more through stupidity and ignorance. The central question is up  to the strength and possibility of the state  environmental-protection organ with strong support from the  public. So far our Ministry of Environmental Protection has been  producing ambassadors: in Israel and in Romania. Now Mykola  Korobko is a functionary in Krivoy Rog. But when he was a  deputy, he at least set to work and made an active initiative.  The ministry, however, as soon as this project started to gather  momentum, has cut it off at the roots by an administrative  reduction of personnel. Just think: We are reducing a department  which could enable us to survive! Nothing more absurd could be  thought up. Everything is perishing in the debates on  environmental protection. A typical example is Mykola  Fedorynchyk, who is the present executive director of Green  World. Words, words, words.... There are no people who do  anything--that's the whole trouble.    Smaha: As I understand it, the key question is  reforming the political system. Are you taking part in the  election struggle?    Panov: Yes, I am. The collective of the Kiev  Polytechnical Institute has put me up as a candidate for the  office of deputy from the Radyanskyy Election District. I am  participating in the election as a citizen, and I have a calm  attitude toward my possible defeat.    But the "Greens" are people with intense feelings. The  stormy  disputes within the Association are turning some truly  intelligent persons away from us. The Association is becoming  impoverished of intellect and enriched with careerism. This is  hardly to the benefit of our cause. I left Green World because  of its political intrigues. I consider that the main thing is to  achieve effective work by the environmental organs.    Here's a simple example. An inspector closes down the  Mariopol Sintering Plant as being too harmful to the health of  the population there. But the minister opens it up again, citing  its "importance" for the Ukrainian economy....    Smaha: And just how will things develop?    Panov: As of now, parallel structures are emerging  within the environmental-protection movement. They have lost  faith in things as they presently exist. I can cite as an  example the "Mama-86" organization--an association of young  Kievan ecologists. Matters simply cannot go on as they are now.    I think that--with some help from VECHIRNIY KYYIV--the Green  World Association will achieve a new life. I am opposed to the  political bent in its work, and--indeed--I am against  politicking as such. Let's try to help the readers of this  newspaper to analyze and understand such vitally important  questions as the true safety of americium, the ecological time  bomb under Kiev, the so-called polygon in Pyrogova, and  defective production. Let's give some thought to how to regulate  the chaotic building of dachas near Kiev and to accord our city  the status of a sufferer from the accident at the Chernobyl AES.  There are many other unsolved problems, the solutions to  which--I anticipate--we will be seeking with the help of  VECHIRNIY KYYIV's readers.</p>

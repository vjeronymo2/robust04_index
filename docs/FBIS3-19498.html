			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 17 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  should set 1997 as a date for thinking hard about accepting East  European candidates into the Union, EU Commissioner for Foreign  Relations Hans Van den Broek said here Thursday [17 March].    In an address to the Institute for European Studies, he said  it was too early for the European Union to take countries such  as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, and  Bulgaria into the Union.    But Van den Broek urged the European Union to set a date --  "1997 seems reasonable" -- for reviewing the applicants'  progress towards membership.    In the meantime, he said, the European Union should help  prepare them for membership with carefully targeted economic aid  and faster lowering of trade barriers against their exports.    The European Union has already negotiated European  agreements  with the six countries which aim at a single market and state  membership of the Union as an ultimate goal. But they give no  dates.    The Union is negotiating similar accords with Slovenia and  the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.    The European Union last year set several conditions for  membership, including a market economy, stability, democracy,  respect for human rights, acceptance of the Union's rules and  the ability of Brussels to absorb the newcomers.    Earlier this month the European Union also announced a  programme for closer political cooperation with the six  applicants.    Van den Broek urged the European Union to go further by  setting up a "multilateral political and economic relationship  which would be a true precursor of membership."    But he warned that any attempt to add new membership  conditions would be unpopular in East Europe. His speech  coincides with increased pressure from the region for  incorporation into the European Union.    Hungary and Poland have said they will apply formally for  membership very shortly. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said  last week that he wanted his country in the European Union well  before the turn of the century.    Looking further east, Van den Broek urged urgent aid to  stabilise the Ukrainian economy. He added that Russia was not  being left out of the developing web of European economic and  political cooperation.    The European Union's executive European Commission is to  hold  a special meeting next Wednesday to consider all aspects of the  enlargement of the Union into East Europe.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises in calm before expected storm Italy had its own agenda yesterday. But where equity markets were strong, as in New York, London, and Frankfurt, they were accompanied mostly by the expiry of futures and options contracts, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN took advantage of the relative political calm to move higher again, ahead of next week's expected storm when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, faces a confidence vote that could topple him from power. The Comit index rose 13.94 or 2.4 per cent to 605.77, up 0.7 per cent on the week, dealers reporting a further awakening of foreign demand. The banks remained in focus. Credito Romagnolo was L537 higher at L18,884 in response to the Cariplo's counter-bid. Credito Italiano rose L24 to L1,645 and BCI was L50 up at L3,331 amid speculation that the two might launch a joint offer for Rolo. Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura rose L265 or 10 per cent to L2,909 on renewed speculation about a shake-up in its shareholder structure. Telecoms were supported by ministerial approval of some concessions on tariffs and fees charged by the state for its lines. Telecom Italia moved ahead L121 to L3,883 and Stet L61 to L4,385. Fiat rose L209 or 3.8 per cent to L5,707 after the company said that its results to October 31 and forecasts for the full year were continuing to show signs of improvement. James Capel, which upgraded the stock to a buy this week, commented that since July there had been a marked improvement in both the Italian car market and Fiat's position within it. The company was also making progress in other major European markets and was performing exceptionally well in Latin America. PARIS failed to build on early gains as the little momentum that was evident during the morning petered out after lunch. The CAC-40 index slipped 6.94 to 1,924.16, a fall of 0.6 per cent on the week. Peugeot, down FFr22 or 3 per cent at FFr725, but off a session's low of FFr720, was hit by a big sell order in reaction to comments from the company on Thursday that seemed to suggest that second-half results would show only a small improvement over the first six months. But, said Mr Christopher Will of Lehman Brothers, the picture could be quite different; he said the group's sales have been holding up extremely well during December, after a strong performance in November, and he believed his full-year earnings target of FFr2.5bn, following a first-half FFr688m, was on line. Hoare Govett downgraded Moulinex, off 3 per cent at FFr101.30, from buy to sell on the expectation that its earnings recovery will take longer than expected. The electrical appliance manufacturer reported a higher half-year loss on Thursday. AMSTERDAM's derivatives expiry passed quietly and the AEX index rose 0.69 to 408.38, up 0.5 per cent on the week. KPN added Fl 1.10 at Fl 57.80, bringing its gain on the week to 6.25 per cent following the announcement that Unisource, in which the Dutch telecoms group has a stake, is to link up with AT&amp;T, of the US. ZURICH saw further demand for blue chips which took the SMI index 6.7 higher to 2,604.7, for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week. The financial sector remained focused on CS Holding and Swiss Re after Thursday's announcement of an alliance to develop financial derivatives on reinsurance. CS Holding rose SFr17 to SFr546, with some investors said to be switching out of Swiss Re into the bank. Swiss Re gave up much of Thursday's advance, easing SFr7 to SFr787. Cyclicals remained volatile, with BBC declining SFr5 to SFr1,096, while Sulzer lost SFr10 to SFr866. Fischer recovered after Thursday's fall with a rise of SFr30 to SFr1,530. Landis &amp; Gyr, still supported by Wednesday's better than expected full-year results, put on SFr9 at SFr804. BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index rise 10.61 to 1,394.44, a fraction higher on the week, as dealers took positions at the start of the two-week trading account. Cockerill added BFr5 at BFr205 ahead of its Bel-20 debut on Monday, and business in Union Miniere was lifted by block trades as the shares rose BFr50 to BFr2,510. COPENHAGEN fell, the KFX index losing 1.17 to 91.54. Sophus Berendsen, the holding company which owns Rentokil, of the UK, dropped DKr22 or 4.5 per cent to DKr470 after Thursday's revelation that divestment losses in 1994, at DKr158m, would be some DKr60m higher than expected after the sale of a US engineering unit.

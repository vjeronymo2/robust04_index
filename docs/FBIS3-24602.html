In particular,  oligoribonucleotides containing the ApUpG initiation codon on  the 5'-terminal of the molecule have found application as mRNA  models in studies of ribosome functional processes. The most  promising and universal method for preparative synthesis of  short oligoribonucleotides is based on using immobilized T4  bacteriophage RNA-ligase for joining chemically synthesized  triplets. In this work, the oligoribonucleotides  ApUpG(pU)[.sup]n[/] and ApUpG(pU)[.sub]n[/]pUp were  synthesized from oligoribouridilates via catalysis with  immobilized RNA-ligase. The oligoribouridilates were obtained  from hydrolysis of poly(U) endonuclease from cobra venom and  from ApUpG trinucleoside diphosphate that had been chemically  synthesized by the phosphotriester method. Seven reaction cycles  were carried out on one column with the immobilized enzyme. The  end product yield varied from 4.9 to 18.0% after  chromatographic purification. The structure of the obtained  compounds was verified by chromatography with labels and enzyme  hydrolysis down to the nucleosides. References 15: 12 Russian, 3  Western.</p>

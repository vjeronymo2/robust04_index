			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week and Next): France outlines final stage of sale process - Bull The French government will this week inform those companies that have made preliminary bids for a stake in Groupe Bull whether they can go on to examine the books of the state-controlled computer company to make a final offer by mid-February. The industry ministry has said that it has been decided after all not to announce a shortlist by Christmas of companies 'pre-selected' for the final stage of the operation. It indicated that some companies had wanted to keep their interest in Bull confidential, and the government would respect this. By contrast, Quadral, a French electronics company, has said it made a bid, which is reported to be in the form of a joint offer with AT&amp;T of the US, while NEC of Japan has shown interest in increasing its existing 4.34 per cent stake in Bull. The industry ministry said that from now until mid-February it would be up to the companies concerned to reveal their interest in Bull if they wanted to. According to some sources, the Bull privatisation has drawn interest from several non-Japanese Asian groups such as Samsung of South Korea and Acer of Taiwan. The government wants to reduce its 76 per cent stake in Bull, headed by chairman Jean-Marie Descarpentries (pictured above right), to a minority holding by next spring. But, given that Bull is still losing money - though on a reduced scale - the government is seeking privatisation through the formation of industrial partnerships rather than a public offer for sale. It has said it is looking either for a majority shareholder or several important shareholders each taking at least 10 per cent of the capital. It has equally said that new partners could subscribe new capital, so diluting the the state's stake, or they could buy shares off the state.</p>

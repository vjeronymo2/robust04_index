			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Gardening: April flowers - in February / How spring can make an early arrival Among this week's snow drifts, spring seemed to retreat several months. To bring it forward, you need the advice which I most value in February. Go into the garden, cut branches off spring-flowering shrubs which are showing the slightest trace of their buds, and give them five to seven days in water in a warm house. By the next weekend, they will be in full flower, an accelerated view of April. I spent this week looking onto snow over windowsills of yellow forsythia, cherry blossom and flowering currant two months before their time. These familiar shrubs are the best for pre-cutting, but they tend to be dismissed nowadays by keen gardeners who see them used conventionally everywhere else. Forsythia is the least popular; its yellow flowers are regarded too strong and, most often, it is planted by non-gardeners who cannot think of anything else on the front fence. I have learned, however, to crave it as a cut flower - the brighter, the better. The usual spectablis form responds wonderfully to pre-cutting; and if you strip the branches now, you save them from the birds later. If the usual yellow of spectablis is too golden for your taste, look for Spring Glory or the lemon-yellow Densiflora instead. Outdoors, I would only bother with one other possibility: suspensa atrocaulis. Indeed, if the strongest forms will open so early indoors, I see little point in wasting space on less usual varieties just because they will flower a few weeks earlier than the others if left outdoors. Cherry blossom is more straightforward. Nobody can have missed the white-flowered winter cherry because it has been showing such clouds of flower since November. The white form, Prunus subhirtella autumnalis, is the essential choice because it flowers earlier and longer than the pink variety. This winter cherry will open of its own accord outdoors and remains my first choice as a tree for gardeners. But there are two moderately early varieties which are just emerging from bud and respond beautifully to early cutting. Both were bred by the former king of cherry blossom, Collingwood Ingram, but neither has yet been as popular as its merits deserve. Prunus Okame is earlier and more widely available in the trade: its pale pink flowers appear on a slight, easily housed tree but have a tendency to vanish when the birds first see them. Prunus Kursar is, therefore, my favourite, although it is a deeper and sharper shade of pink. In March, the colour is enlivening in the garden, but it is even better if you pick branches which are in bud and work magic on them now with the help of central heating. These two small trees are completely hardy. I would rate them very highly in any orchard or setting against darker evergreens where they outclass the later sugar-pink varieties, which upset civilised taste. Pre-cutting is at its most exciting with the familiar old ribes. Right now, its stems are almost bare, showing only the slightest green buds of future growth. Yet, within a week, they will open indoors into hanging currant flowers of red and white which we associate with mid-April. Unlike golden forsythia, ribes has not been coarsened by poor placing and repetition in every boundary hedge. It grows surprisingly well in difficult shade under tall trees and is almost indestructible. Despite its familiarity, I would always put it in my personal top 10. The family has a wider variety than many gardeners realise but the best is still the deep crimson King Edward VII, which flowers willingly if brought indoors at the first signs of life. Like all the coloured forms of ribes Sanguineum, it responds well to hard pruning of the flowering stems. If you cut them now, before they open, you are still cutting them correctly. I never believed that flowering currants could be forced in time for Valentine's day until I read this advice in a casual piece by Vita Sackville-West. Spring now comes early in academic Oxfordshire, with a further bonus for the far-sighted. When you come to turn the ribes out of its water, you might well find that some of its stems have sprouted white roots. If you save these branches and use light soil to grow them on, they will probably root and grow away freely. Multiply while you accelerate and be thankful that there is a kinder streak to nature than sudden frosts and snow drifts.</p>

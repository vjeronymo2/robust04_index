			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / A subtle battle of monetary wills: America Central bankers and elected politicians have an uneasy relationship in most democracies. The US is no exception. Although the Federal Reserve has historically enjoyed far greater independence than, say, the Bank of England, it is careful to describe itself as independent within, rather than of, government. Many Democrats, moreover, are pressing for reforms to make it more open and accountable. Mr Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate banking committee, is one of several senior Democrats sponsoring bills that would increase Congress's leverage over the Fed. Flexing his political muscles last week, he summoned all 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks to Washington to deliver their first ever testimony en masse before his committee. The presidents were squashed together like a row of sardines and solemnly lectured on the need for 'teamwork' in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. Following President Bill Clinton's election, the nation was expecting 'more accountability from everybody', Mr Riegle declared, before departing early for a more important meeting at the White House. The hearing was civil, although some of the presidents seemed disconcerted by the lordly demeanour of the senators, who wandered in and out of the hearing room, sometimes leaving their guests with hardly anybody to talk to. The presidents were kept sitting in place for more than four hours, finally being dismissed well after the normal lunch break. But the meeting has set a precedent: if and when inflation starts to rise and the Fed shows signs of tightening policy, the presidents will be hauled in for a public roasting. Even in today's benign economic climate, senators were seeking assurances that presidents would loosen monetary policy if deficit-cutting legislation retards growth. The presidents are a target because they hold, in rotation, five of the 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets the level of short-term interest rates (and hence strongly influences the short-run jobless rate). The Fed's board of governors, headed by Mr Alan Greenspan, holds the other seven votes. Yet while the Fed's governors are appointed by the White House and subject to Senate confirmation, the regional presidents are elected by private-sector boards and thus escape direct scrutiny by Congress. Mr Riegle is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Mr Paul Sarbanes, a colleague on the banking committee, that would strip the presidents of their right to vote on monetary policy decisions. The legislation is supported by Mr Jim Sasser, chairman of the powerful Senate budget committee, and in the House of Representatives by such heavyweights as Mr Lee Hamilton and Mr David Obey, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. A separate bill championed by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the house banking committee, goes further. It would keep the FOMC but subject regional presidents to the same selection and confirmation process as governors. It would mandate a more diverse FOMC, with positions reserved for women, minorities, community groups and unions. It would tackle excessive secrecy by subjecting the Fed to the Freedom of Information Act and by requiring the timely release of videotapes of FOMC meetings. Finally, it would ask a review body to investigate whether the geographical distribution of the regional Feds (which are clustered in the east) is appropriate given huge population and income shifts in the past 80 years. The critics have some good points. As private citizens partly responsible for public policy, the regional presidents do have an anomalous role. There are few, if any, parallels abroad: even in Germany, the Land presidents who sit on the Bundesbank's policymaking central bank council are nominated by the Bundesrat (the upper house of parliament) and formally appointed by the president. And last week the regional presidents - 12 middle-aged white males - inadvertently underlined the lack of diversity at the Fed. There has only ever been one female regional Fed president. No black or Hispanic has ever held the top job, not even at the Atlanta Fed, which covers much of the south. The Fed is clearly vulnerable to the criticism that it does not promote minorities or women. But it is likely to resist any other changes on the grounds that the present system, even if anachronistic, seems to work quite well. The Democratic critics, for their part, are not likely to push their legislation too hard. With the economy reviving, the Fed is much less unpopular than at the height of the recession. Mr Greenspan, moreover, is a canny opponent, having already put himself in Mr Clinton's good books by warmly endorsing the president's economic plan - a move which is spurring the recovery by helping drive down long bond yields. But this does not mean the Democratic campaign is not succeeding. The real goal is to intimidate the Fed's policymakers, to make the institution more malleable. The US is at a monetary turning point: depending on decisions in the next few years, the Fed will either firmly establish price stability for the first time since the 1950s or permit short-sighted politicians to embark on yet another inflationary cycle. The economic stakes could not be higher.</p>

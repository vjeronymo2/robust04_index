			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PRAUNHEIM TRILOGY TAKES ON THE AIDS CRISIS  </P> <P> German filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim's "Silence=Death" and "Positive" (at the  Nuart through Saturday) compose the first two-thirds of a new trilogy which  promises to be the most comprehensive documentary yet on the response to the  AIDS crises. The first two parts are centered in New York, the last part in  Berlin.  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, Praunheim, who bears more than a passing resemblance to  Arnold Schwarzenegger and whose real name is Holger Mischwitzki, has chronicled  the gay experience in America and Germany with a candor and openness that has  often invited controversy. This also means that he has been in the vanguard of  the gay liberation movement, and four years ago, his "A Virus Respects No  Morals," a savage, imaginative, scattershot Brecht-like allegory set largely in  a gay bath, became one of the earliest and most provocative attacks on the  hypocrisy, ignorance, politics and economics surrounding the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> In short, Praunheim is just the man for the job he has taken on with  "Silence=Death" and "Positive": he has the breadth of vision, the compassion  and the militance and, yes, the sense of humor necessary to tackle the AIDS  epidemic in all its aspects.  </P> <P> What emerges is a portrait of a much-beleaguered minority learning how to  organize in the face of a society and a government that has regarded AIDS with  much indifference and downright hostility. (The key villains of the two films  are inevitably former President Ronald Reagan and former New York Mayor Edward  Koch.)  </P> <P> Praunheim makes a very strong case for all gays still closeted to come out and  join the struggle to press for a cure for the disease and for more education in  regard to its prevention, especially at a time when gay bashing is on the rise  and when the far right and various religious groups seem determined to view  AIDS as a fit punishment for homosexuals.  </P> <P> "Silence=Death" focuses on AIDS and the arts, while "Positive" deals with AIDS  and politics; Praunheim being Praunheim, you can be sure some X-rated, though  safe, sex is involved in both films. The participants in the first film range  from poets to filmmakers to fashion designers to painters. The most vivid  presence in the first film is poet-filmmaker David Wojnarowicz, who has tested  HIV positive and requests that his corpse be dumped on the White House steps.  On a calmer note, Allen Ginsberg and late Keith Haring contribute to the plea  for safe sex.  </P> <P> Both films are suffused with the rage of their participants, and in "Positive"  Wojnarowicz's counterpart is pioneering AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who has  also tested HIV positive; both describe themselves as unapologetically  "hysterical" in their anger. Just as "Silence=Death" shows a wide range of  talented men contributing their respective arts to the cause, "Positive" argues  for the need for gays to hit the streets and protest the government's slow  response to the AIDS crisis.  </P> <P> The films show gay men not merely changing their sexual practices and gathering  information about the disease but also discovering a common unity and identity.  If there is a consolation in the face of such devastating losses, it is that  AIDS has led to gays demanding greater participation in society rather than to  retreating from it. One of the last men interviewed in "Positive" says he  regards AIDS as "our Pearl Harbor" and that "we will win the war."  </P> <P> 'SILENCE=DEATH'  </P> <P> A First Run Features release.

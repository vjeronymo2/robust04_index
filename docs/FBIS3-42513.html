Teslenko; UDC </F> 629.197.23]    [Abstract] Until recently, trajectory designs have involved  a single-stage, one-impulse flight to halo orbit near libration  points L[.sup]1[/] and L[.sub]2[/] of the Sun-Earth  system. Launch parameters were chosen so that after boost near  Earth, the spacecraft would enter a trajectory passing rather  close to the libration points, with halo orbit C = 0. Farquhar  has proposed a design that reduces the orbit-size parameters  ("Halo-Orbit and Lunar Swing-by Missions of the 1990's," 41st  Congress of the IAF, October 1990, Germany) and that recommends  a rendezvous with the Moon not immediately after launch, but  after a given number of revolutions in a highly elliptical orbit  whose perigee is near the Earth and whose apogee distance is  greater than the radius of the lunar orbit. There is yet to be  any published data, however, on the possible use of such a  trajectory to perform the Relict-2 mission in the context of the  constraints on the control system that is to be used in the  mission. Analysis shows that a design with two revolutions in  intermediate orbit is best for trajectories involving a lunar  swing-by. The researchers here analyze the control  characteristics for only the segment before lunar rendezvous.  Their analysis considers launch errors, as well as measurement  and correction-execution errors. Fuel expenditure at the  velocity typical for performing control during entry into halo  orbit is the principal criterion for quality of control. Control  parameters are calculated for flight trajectories based on  launches in October and November 1994. Figures 4, references 5:  3 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Regrettably, some of our writers prefer the policy  of straddling the fence to confront terrorism. This is why one  finds them devising a strange terminology to water down the  issue. If, for example, they are compelled to denounce radical  groups, they rush to denounce what they allege to be government  terrorism and police methods that create a climate of violence,  as they say.    This card shuffling leads them to say strange things with  the  sole purpose of inciting the masses in the wrong direction.  Instead of declaring their rejection of any acts that are  capable of terrorizing citizens and awakening sedition, you find  them twisting words in order to give people impressions that are  in total contrast with the truth.    One of the strangest forms of criticism and opposition in  Egyptian political life is the kind that criticizes the  government and the security agencies for confronting terrorism.  It is as if this kind of criticism and opposition wants the  government to stand idle in the face of terrorists until the  fire spreads to the straw and until they turn Egypt into another  Iran.    Do the security agencies initiate violence and terrorism in  the streets? Do they hit peaceful tourists and strike banks? Are  these agencies expected to stand and watch criminals who pose a  threat to public security and who spread fright among people? Do  these critics consider the security agencies' confrontation of  this evil tendency a form of repression and terrorism?    The terrorists have recently developed their strategy in  Egypt and have moved to adopt the idea of destroying anything  and everything indiscriminately. Their terrorism is blind and  mindless. This is why all agencies concerned have had to  confront this bloody terrorism firmly and with all means and  methods and to uproot it in order to protect this country's  security and safety.    It is normal to arrest the plannners and leaders of  terrorist  groups. Without these arrests, terrorist activities and  incidents in Egypt would have multiplied and sedition would have  spread everywhere.    Despite the delicate and sensitive situation, the decisive  and effective confrontation that we witness today is conducted  in accordance with the law which empowers the Ministry of  Interior to detain suspects for a one-month period. After this  period, the detainee is entitled to resort to the judiciary. If  a court orders the detainee's release, the ministry is entitled  to appeal the decision in two weeks. If the court orders his  release again, then he is released immediately. But if the court  orders continued detention because of the detainee's danger to  society, then the detainee is entitled to appeal anew to the  court once every month, as stipulated by the aforementioned law.    This means that arrests of the leaders of sedition are made  under the judiciary's control for the sole purpose of ensuring  society's security and safety.    If those who follow the misguided path had God's fear in  their hearts for their country and kinsmen, they would have  dropped the weapons with which they threaten the peaceable  workers of this country, and they would have proceeded to  express themselves peacefully through parties, newspapers,  unions, and other channels of peaceful political action and  opinion-expression podiums. They would not have subjected  themselves to arrest, appeal, and other similar procedures,  especially within the democratic system under which our country  lives and that guarantees free political action and a free press.    In Egypt, there are 13 political parties and more than 100  newspapers. Egypt also has trade unions and workers federations,  and all of these are legitimate outlets for whoever wishes to  participate in political action. As for those who intentionally  and purposefully abandon and reject all this and take up the  rifle to kill peaceable people, then they have only themselves  to blame. The government's eyes are vigilant and the national  security agencies are performing their role in the best manner,  and may God protect Egypt from all harm.</p>

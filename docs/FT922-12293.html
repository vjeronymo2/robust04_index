			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Leading Article: Next stage of Russian reform THE RUSSIAN government appears, for the moment, to have won its game of chicken with the Congress of People's Deputies. That victory owes much to the absence of any plausible alternative to the policies of the government; it owes much to the commanding place still held by Mr Boris Yeltsin; but it owes nothing to the enthusiasm of the people for the hardships of economic reform. The government may be unbowed, but it has been bloodied. It walks a politically narrow path between the chasms of hyperinflation on the one side and of economic collapse on the other. Whatever its difficulties, the government must be given the benefit of the west's doubts. It is composed of young, competent, western-oriented technocrats and, in Mr Yegor Gaidar, possesses a leader who has grown rapidly in stature, not least following his confrontation with the Congress. Furthermore, it is the first government that has actually undertaken reform, rather than just talked about it. The price liberalisation of the beginning of the year has already eliminated queues and put downward pressure on demand. The higher price of petrol announced yesterday is an important further step. An announced budget deficit of less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, a credit squeeze and, by Russian standards, high interest rates have helped to constrain inflation, even if it remains at uncomfortably high levels. The government hopes to lower the monthly rate of inflation to 3 per cent a month (an annual rate of 40 per cent) by the end of the year. Backsliding This is good, so far as it goes; but it does not go far enough. Worse, there is danger of backsliding. Increased monetary financing of the budget is probable. The government is also committed to a Rbs 200bn expansion of central bank credit to the economy, which is expected to generate a total increase of Rbs 400bn-Rbs 500bn, a rise of about a quarter. That expansion is supposed to be targeted selectively on agriculture, investment and viable state enterprises. But it is also a response to an explosive increase in inter-enterprise bad debt, now about Rbs 900bn, a fifth of GDP. The scale of the bad debt shows how little has changed in the behaviour of state enterprises. Equally revealing is their failure to adjust prices to falling demand. In these circumstances, the planned monetary expansion may simply pour monetary petrol on the hyperinflationary blaze. Broad consensus The government's macroeconomic difficulties, along with its increasing determination to intervene more directly in the economy, reflect the latter's structural defects. A radical programme of privatisation and demonopolisation, in which currency convertibility will play an important part, is a high priority. On this, the government and its academic critics agree. For the west, the case for early and generous assistance remains overwhelming. It would remain so even if the stabilisation fund were to be used to support an adjustable exchange rate, as the government now suggests, rather than a fixed one. But the price for western support must include a consistently tight monetary and fiscal policy, swift privatisation of retail and wholesale trade, rapid moves to world prices for the principal commodities, above all oil, and accelerated change in the economic structure, including establishment of clear rights for private property. No less important is clarification of the relationship between Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Members that are not prepared to co-operate in monetary control should leave the rouble area forthwith. In return, the west should help develop payment and credit arrangements that allow energy-poor CIS states to survive when Russia moves, as it should, to world prices. Russia is a country of huge potential. Nothing could justify a permanent aid programme of the scale now contemplated for this year. Large sums can be justified, but for a strictly limited period, perhaps five years, after which Russia will either be a recipient of huge private inflows or reform will have failed. Russian reform remains a great gamble, but for a great prize. The Congress has not made the bet worse. The west would still be right to take it.</p>

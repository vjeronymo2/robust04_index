			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Mercedes plans Dollars 300m US plant: Strategy shift aimed at countering market inroads made by Japanese MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car manufacturer, yesterday made a significant shift in strategy and announced it is to build a new four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle in the US. The company is a big manufacturer of heavy trucks in the US, through its Freightliner subsidiary, but this will be its first car manufacturing operation in the US and the first on any scale outside Germany. It will spend Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) to construct a new plant which will employ 1,500 people by the end of the decade and manufacture up to 60,000 units a year of the new sports utility vehicle. A site for the plant is to be selected during the next three to four months, with construction starting by the end of the year and the first vehicles coming off the production line in 1997. Mercedes officials would not be drawn on the plant's locations, but there is widespread speculation that favourite states include North and South Carolina. The company is following the lead of German car rival BMW, which last year broke ground with its first US manufacturing plant, in South Carolina. Both companies have seen their US sales hit by competition from Japanese manufacturers, which over the past four years have made huge inroads in the US luxury car market with keenly priced models. Up to 40,000 Mercedes vehicles a year will be exported. Some 20,000 will serve the North American market for sports utility vehicles, which is the largest in the world and has enjoyed explosive growth over the past decade, from sales of 240,000 vehicles in 1980 to 1.1m in 1992. In another strategy shift, Mercedes said its vehicle would not compete in the luxury segment of the market where the company has traditionally been strongest. Its chief US competitors will be vehicles such as Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford's Explorer, priced in the Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000 range, rather than Britain's Range Rover at Dollars 40,000. Mercedes said the vehicle reflects an important shift in product strategy: to extend its range from the luxury category into premium cars in segments showing good growth prospects. Mr Helmut Werner, vice-chairman and chief operating officer, said the new strategy was a forward-looking, rather than defensive, answer to the challenge from Japanese manufacturers. 'We will not withdraw into the ivory tower of a 'mega-luxury class' but rather attack the Japanese competition in its market niches by offering our own technologically superior product concepts,' Mr Werner said. However, US production will also be substantially cheaper than in Germany, where the company faces high labour costs. Daimler said yesterday that it had also reached agreement after several years of negotiation to build buses in Russia in partnership with Avtokron, a Russian manufacturer. The buses are to be built at a plant near Moscow. Further details will be released in Mannheim on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Hurd rallies support over Euro-veto row Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night addressed senior members of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee to rally support for an eventual compromise over Britain's demand that there should be no change to its blocking veto. The foreign secretary earlier received the cabinet's backing for a deal which 'preserved the substance' of the UK position, which seeks to prevent the number of votes needed to block legislation rising from 23 to 27. But he was warned by Euro-sceptics that they would not vote for any deal which 'further diluted the Common's authority'. Both Mr Hurd and the prime minister, however, have made it clear that the dispute should not lead to a delay in enlargement of the community. At prime minister's questions Mr John Major rebuked Mr Roger Knapman, a Conservative Euro-sceptic, for trying to get the government to rule out any compromise. 'I have no intention of being moved by synthetic efforts to pressure us from any source,' he said. He insisted that Mr Hurd was negotiating to safeguard Britain's short and long-term interests, and added: 'I am entirely confident that can be done in an acceptable way without any question of delaying enlargement.' Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, which have been opposing the proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next January. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Hurd had the full support of his cabinet colleagues for negotiations with EU foreign ministers on Tuesday. Mr Heseltine said at a press conference on deregulation that he had always described himself as a European because Britain's membership of the EU was 'a policy extension of Britain's self-interest'. It did the UK no harm if there were rows with Britain's partners, he said. The government plans to bring forward legislation to the Commons in the autumn if there is agreement on enlargement. But a number of Conservative rightwingers and Euro-sceptics are threatening to rebel if the government compromises over weakening its blocking veto. Some Tory Euro-sceptics unsuccessfully demanded that any deal agreed by Mr Hurd should first be discussed in the Commons. One Euro-sceptic said: 'We shall continue to back Mr Hurd until he gives in.' The pro-European wing of the party is lobbying the foreign secretary to compromise on the issue to secure enlargement. At present the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76, distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90.</p>

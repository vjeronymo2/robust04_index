			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Top American companies have evinced interest in  investing in the Indian infrastructural sector. At the  roundtable meeting with the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha  Rao, in Houston the chief executives of several companies  expressed an upbeat mood to invest in India. Over 100 chief  executive officers of major companies attended the meeting. The  prime minister outlined the salient features of the economic  reforms and invited American businessmen to become partners for  further mutual benefit.    Our correspondent Rama Rao accompanying the prime minister  reports that for the first time since the launching of economic  reforms, the foreign investors focussed attention on specific  pattern of their projects. In another significant change, the  investors themselves have analyzed the relative advantages of  various markets in South Asia and have ranked India well above  others. Our correspondent further states that the new projects  outlined at the meeting include the setting up of a commercial  bank, mining and exploitation of bauxite in Andhra Pradesh and  Orissa, and a computer company.    A heavy schedule awaits the prime minister when he arrives  in  Washington DC tonight on the last leg of his week-long visit to  the United States. [passage omitted]</p>

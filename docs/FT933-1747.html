			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Japanese brokers forced to revise profits forecasts JAPAN'S leading brokers were forced yesterday to revise their earnings forecasts, with Nomura Securities, the largest house, cutting its expected pre-tax profit to Y25bn (Dollars 240m) from Y35bn for the first half to the end of this month. The brokers complained of weaker-than-expected commissions on the Tokyo market, where the daily value of turnover has been 10 per cent below expectations, and the Nikkei index has hovered just above the 20,000 mark. Of the 14 largest brokers, 12 have revised forecasts. Daiwa Securities was the exception among the 'Big Four' houses, maintaining its pre-tax interim forecast at Y30bn, having apparently increased bond commissions to compensate for the stock market's weakness. The other company not to make an announcement was Cosmo Securities, the second-tier broker to be rescued by Daiwa Bank. Cosmo, crippled by losses from the unauthorised shifting of stocks from client account to account, is expecting a pre-tax loss of Y2bn. Brokers say that although they are over the worst of the damage suffered during the stock market collapse, nervousness remains about the health of the Nikkei index, which hit 14,309.41 last August after peaking at 38,915.87 in late 1989. The 10 second-tier brokers are still under extreme pressure, and will need to cut costs in coming months. Only three - Kokusai Securities, New Japan Securities, and Wako Securities - are expecting to record a pre-tax profit in the first half. The largest losses are expected at Sanyo Securities (Y5.7bn) and Kankaku Securities (Y5.6bn). Meanwhile, Kokusai Securities, closely linked to Nomura, forecast the largest pre-tax profit, Y4.5bn, among the second-tier houses. Tokyo stock prices have been flat in the past few weeks, and brokers are disappointed that two government stimulative packages, along with falling interest rates, have failed to attract more investors back to the market. Bond commissions were weak early in the period, but have since improved, while a spate of new listings has helped the larger brokers. Most are still attempting to cut personnel costs, but have been restrained by the lifetime employment system in Japan. The 'Big Four' are generally in better shape than a year ago, but will still need to shed further employees to improve profitability. They will also face increased competition, particularly in the bond market, through financial deregulation, which has allowed Japan's long-term credit and trust banks to establish securities subsidiaries. Of the larger houses, Nikko Securities had the sharpest revision, cutting its pre-tax forecast from an optimistic Y30bn to Y10bn. Yamaichi Securities, meanwhile, halved its pre-tax forecast from Y20bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No General Accord on Senate Speaker"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- A meeting of senators from  across the political spectrum failed to produce agreement on a  universally-approved candidate for the Senate speaker's chair,  MPs said Thursday evening [14 April].    While the country's likely future government -- made up of  Forza Italia, National Alliance, the Northern League and smaller  allies linked together in the Freedom Front -- has reached a  deal to field economist Carlo Scognamiglio for the post, the  right-wing line-up does not have an absolute majority in the  upper house, and may have to bow to opposition pressure for an  `institutional' nomination.    Both the Senate and Lower House gather tomorrow for the  first  session of the 12th legislature, with electing speakers at the  top of the agenda.    Gianfranco Fini, secretary of National Alliance, the renamed  neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, was confident, however,  that Scognamiglio would pull through: "I haven't done any  counting but others have, and they have assured me that  Scognamiglio will be elected. I know that we will get a  majority."    The economics professor himself, a member of Forza Italia,  was resigned to facing competition, and said "but in the end the  Senate is sovereign and it will have to decide on the basis of  the voting. It comes as no surprise to me that there will be  other candidates."    Northern League leader Umberto Bossi seemed unconcerned  about  the fact that the Freedom Front candidate may lose his bid for  the speaker's chair: "what the hell do I care," he told curious  journalists.    Less brusque was League member Marcello Staglieno who  confirmed that Scognamiglio was the candidate of the whole  right-wing alliance, but who said that, given the lack of an  absolute majority in the Senate "the League is ready to weigh up  an institutional candidate, should one arise."    On the opposition benches, the Left Democrat Secretary  Achille Occhetto promised that his party would be fielding a  counter-bidder for the post, which is the second highest in the  land, after that of president.    Mario Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact, voiced  disappointment that the Freedom Front had not opted for an  institutional candidate: "they have missed a great opportunity  for electing, in at least one house, a candidate with wide-based  support."    From the People's Party, the renamed Christian Democrats,  Pierluigi Castagnetti said he was certain that the names of  Scognamiglio for the Senate and 31-year-old Irene Pivetti for  the Lower House were a smokescreen for the real candidates. "But  anyway, we will not be voting for them," he said.    The name of Pivetti drew fire from the Pannella Ticket,  nominally supporters of the Freedom Front, with Marco Pannella  accusing her of anti-Semitic leanings.    Pivetti replied this evening, saying "I have total respect  for diversity."</p>

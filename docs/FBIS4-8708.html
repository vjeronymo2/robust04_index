			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Dnevnik 2" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister of the  Federal Government, views for Dnevnik the protection of the  dinar, the increase in production, and the first effects of the  program for economic recovery.    [Begin Sainovic recording] The situation regarding the  implementation of the program is completely stable. The best  indication of this that I can present at the moment is that  production, industrial production in March has increased in  comparison to February by 21.3 percent. Let me remind you that  in comparison to January, the production in February increased  by 12.4 percent. This is [word indistinct] information that  tells everyone that production is increasing. That is the basic  reflection of stability. Prices have been stable for some time  now, and I can also say that the National Bank's activities have  secured (?funds) for procuring raw materials for the economy, in  excess of $100 million. This will have a positive effect in the  coming months.    Let me also add that the balance of the foreign currency  exchange of both citizens and the economy with the National Bank  and the merchant banks is positive [sentence as heard]. This  means that foreign currency reserves are increasing, while the  total activities and complete coordination of the Yugoslav  National Bank, the Service for Monetary Transactions [Sluzba za  platni promet], and the federal and republican governments has  made sure that negative occurrences on the financial market have  been efficiently suppressed.    You can see that in the past week the technology of handling  ready cash has been altered. This, in turn, has led to a  decrease of financial scams and an increased return of ready  cash into the channels of monetary transactions. This  coordinated activity has decreased the so-called sticung [the  cut taken by dealers when selling foreign currency on the black  market]. Some of these people are already behind bars.  Therefore, this is a simple demonstration of the efficient,  synchronized activity of all state bodies in maintaining the  stability of the program. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Germany likely to back UK on Brussels powers GERMANY is likely to back a British plan to add an interpretation to the Maastricht treaty on European union, seeking to define and limit the powers of Brussels to intervene in questions better decided at national or regional level. The idea, mooted in London earlier this week, was greeted with some dismay in Brussels where officials are nervous that any tampering with the treaty could affect plans for speedy ratification. The British suggestion was that certain aspects of the Maastricht treaty be clarified - not renegotiated - to make it more palatable to Denmark and other countries in the European Community. Danish voters rejected ratification of the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last week. A senior German official suggested that the heads of government meeting in Lisbon at the end of this month should set up a task force involving the Council of Ministers and the Commission, to look into subsidiarity - under which decisions and action are taken by the central institutions of the Community only if their objectives cannot be adequately achieved by the individual member states or their regions - and report back to the Edinburgh summit in December. 'The charm of the British idea (on the additional interpretation) is that instead of waiting until the European Court of Justice defines it, the governments themselves already start to define those areas where subsidiarity applies. 'If we could, it would be helpful for us. It may even be helpful to the Danish people,' the official said. However, Mr Anders Rasmussen, Danish finance minister, yesterday suggested the UK plan would have little effect on the outcome of the referendum. 'Of course we appreciate the British government's attempt to find solutions, but we have to underline that we have to abide by the result of the referendum. The Danish No must be respected and we can't change it by declarations. A No is still a No.' Officials in London made clear yesterday that Britain's proposal would be only one of several ideas to be discussed by EC ministers in coming months. They stressed that the government was not proposing a renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty, but merely more detailed explanations of how it would work in practice. However, the officials denied that Britain had proposed a special protocol, codicil or addendum to the treaty. The form of the desired clarification would be a matter for discussion with the other EC members, as would the idea itself. In Paris the government rejected any suggestion of adding new text to the treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, raised the British proposals at lunch with Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, during the first day of the state visit to France by the Queen. Mr Dumas said the French government remained committed to the position agreed by the 12 last week. The British government is under pressure from a growing body of Conservative Euro-sceptics to modify the Maastricht treaty. However, it claims that its latest proposal is motivated as much by the desire to persuade the Danish people to change their mind and to meet similar concerns from Germany and France.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Curtain goes up on latest scandal SPECTATORS queued for seats yesterday for the opening act of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trial, billed as the event that will topple the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or as just another Japanese political farce. Two former executives of Tokyo Sagawa, the parcel delivery company, are on trial for breach of trust, having allegedly caused damages of Y95.2bn (Pounds 435m) to the company by offering illegal loans to gang-run businesses. A third man, the former president of a gang-linked property company, faced similar charges. But the real interest is whether the hearings will implicate leading officials of the LDP, as Tokyo Sagawa was a prominent donor of political funds and, according to prosecutors yesterday, acted as an intermediary between the party and Inagawa-kai, the gangster group. Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's self-proclaimed 'kingmaker' and head of the party's largest faction, has admitted receiving Y500m from Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, former Tokyo Sagawa president and one of the three defendants yesterday. Prosecutors referred several times yesterday to a leading member of the LDP, and without naming Mr Kanemaru, it was clear that they were referring to him, a point made on Japanese news broadcasts last night. In their opening address in the Tokyo district court, the prosecutors alleged that a certain leading politician had received a substantial amount of money from Tokyo Sagawa. The prosecutors also referred to an incident in 1987, when the leading politician allegedly sought the assistance of Mr Watanabe, through his friendships with gang members, in silencing extreme-right groups, which were then running a noisy and embarrassing campaign against the LDP. It was clear that the prosecutors were putting pressure on Mr Kanemaru, who quit as vice-president of the LDP last month, to either admit that he had violated political funding laws or to at least submit himself to formal questioning over the issue. Since conceding that he received the Y500m, Mr Kanemaru has stayed at his Tokyo home and refused to visit the prosecutor's office. Meanwhile, his lawyers have negotiated with the prosecutors over whether a written statement would suffice or whether he must appear in person. The unusual stand-off suggests that the prosecutors may be content to pursue Mr Kanemaru over the donation, but will leave unexplored some of the more damaging allegations about the LDP's gang links. Even if the 'kingmaker' is found guilty of that violation, he is liable to a maximum fine of only Y200,000. A more severe punishment faces Mr Watanabe and Mr Jun Saotome, former managing director of Tokyo Sagawa, both of whom pleaded not guilty. However, the third defendant, Mr Munenobu Shoji, former president of Hokusho Sangyo, the gang-linked property company, admitted the charges.</p>

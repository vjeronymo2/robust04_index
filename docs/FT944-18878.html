			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Nagging at the recovery By rights, it ought to be a quite a party in Madrid this weekend. For the first time in several years, the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven largest industrial countries all have growing economies, with barely a hint of inflation to go with it. Even the latest World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund allows itself to be unusually upbeat about the state of the world recovery. Who could ask for more? The IMF would not be the IMF if it did not see reasons to worry, and corresponding room for improvement in many industrial countries' monetary and fiscal policies. But finance ministers rarely pay much attention to its straitlaced prescriptions: certainly not enough to let it ruin a couple of days' sunshine and sangria. The nagging of the financial markets, however, is more sobering. Every downward lurch in American and European bond markets - like the one which occurred this week - can mean another missed budget deficit target and, possibly, another difficult round of tax increases and spending cuts. The markets' worries may be less consistent than the IMF's, but the underlying message is the same. Seizing today's opportunity for an unprecedented period of global growth requires prices to remain stable, and public borrowing to fall. The good news is that the opportunity is there for the taking. As the IMF's report states, 'the recovery of world activity and trade became firmly established during the first half of 1994'. Overall, the organisation is predicting 3 per cent growth in global output this year, a little more than it thought likely when it produced its May Outlook. Signs of recovery in continental Europe and Japan, and the growing momentum behind the US and UK upswings, mean that the global growth figure hides less diversity than before. The developing countries continue to grow fastest: the IMF expects output of poorer countries to grow by over 5 1/2 per cent in 1994 and 1995. But the more sedate 2 3/4 per cent growth expected in both years from the G7 countries compares well with the 1.4 per cent achieved in 1993. Liberalisation As the report shows, the global reach of the upturn owes much to the widespread liberalisation of capital markets. As a group, the world's poorer countries were able to attract annual net capital inflows of Dollars 94bn, on average, in the first three years of the 1990s. The average figure for the preceding seven years was a mere Dollars 9bn. This influx of investment capital continues to play a large part in ensuring these markets 'emerge'. There are familiar laggards in the global growth picture. Africa, for one, has received little of the new investment flows, suffering slight net outflows of capital in both periods. But the IMF expects that even Africa will achieve 3.3 per cent growth this year, up from a meagre 1 per cent in 1993. The world has not seen this combination of freely flowing capital and goods, and near-universal economic growth, since the early years of this century. Market sentiment Why then are the financial markets determined to spoil the party? As the IMF notes, long-term government bond yields have been on the rise world-wide, increasing by an average of 2 per cent in industrial countries since January. On Thursday, the yield on long-term US treasury bonds briefly touched nearly 7.90 per cent, the highest in over two years. Not every shift in market sentiment has a sound rationale. But the underlying pressure on both nominal and real interest rates worldwide can be traced to two doubts that did not cloud the picture in the early 20th century. Then, the global capital market could rely on two things: stable prices and a large pot of rich country savings. Prices are again relatively stable in the main industrial countries: the IMF estimates consumer prices will rise only 2.4 per cent in the course of 1994. But the inflationary cycles of the 1970s and 1980s are too recent to be forgotten. And low inflation came after a long recession that has left unemployment at stubbornly high rates in Europe and elsewhere. Thursday's US bond market fall, which was triggered by unexpectedly strong economic data, follows a pattern which is likely to become familiar elsewhere as the recovery takes hold. Investors worry that national monetary authorities will not act quickly enough to stem inflation, because of political pressures to deliver higher growth. Yet not all of the rise in bond yields can be put down to inflation jitters. The rise in index-linked government bonds in the UK and Canada since February points to real pressures on investment funds. Partly, this is a predictable result of the pick-up in the cycle. But it also stems from the fact that governments, companies and developing countries are all borrowing at the same time. Something has to give: the ministers and government officials assembled in Madrid should decide it will be them.</p>

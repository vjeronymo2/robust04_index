			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian banks face claim over O&amp;Y loan AN international banking syndicate led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation and Credit Lyonnais has accused four Canadian banks of garnering an extraordinarily large chunk of Olympia &amp; York's assets as collateral for a relatively small CDollars 126m (USDollars 105m) loan. A Credit Lyonnais official alleged in an affidavit lodged with the Ontario Court of Justice that the Canadian banks may have obtained a 'fraudulent preference' as creditors of the property developer. The international banks, which provided a USDollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to O&amp;Y in 1989, obtained a court ruling on Thursday evening which permits them to challenge the collateral should O&amp;Y eventually be placed in bankruptcy and its assets liquidated. The four Canadian banks cited in the affidavit - Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada - advanced the CDollars 126m loan at the height of O&amp;Y's liquidity crisis in March to help fund the Canary Wharf project. The banks had originally agreed to provide CDollars 240m, but one of them raised objections as rumours circulated about O&amp;Y's financial condition. Security for the full loan had already been registered. According to the affidavit, security for the loan includes two debentures, each for USDollars 275m, against O&amp;Y's two biggest towers in Toronto, plus pledges of shares in two other Toronto buildings. Meanwhile, in New York, Mayor David Dinkins yesterday announced a plan that will allow O&amp;Y to pay over 12 months a Dollars 126m property tax bill, half of which would have become due on June 30. Failure to make the could have forced O&amp;Y into a formal US bankruptcy filing on its New York properties. The city has agreed to accept 12 monthly payments of Dollars 10.5m each, plus two payments of Dollars 2.4m in interest penalties. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, last night downgraded to Caa from B1 some Dollars 548m worth of securities issued by O&amp;Y's Water Street Finance Company. On Tuesday O&amp;Y told a meeting of Water Street noteholders that cash flow from the Manhattan building would be insufficient to service the property's debt next year.</p>

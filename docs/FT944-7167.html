			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Investors harbour concern over political moves UK and Italian bond markets were overshadowed by political worries yesterday although they took their lead from Germany where prices rallied on the better tone for bonds after Wednesday's market shift in the US. Dealers and analysts believe investors will be waiting to see if US Treasuries continue to benefit from a switching out of equities today after yesterday's Thanksgiving holiday when the US market was closed. Volumes across Europe were light. Mr Mark Cliffe, international economist at Midland Global Markets said: 'There has been a lot of talk about the switch out of equities into bonds but not a lot of action. It is difficult to believe there will be a rally in the US bond market even if stocks fall. If the Fed is raising rates it is not the time to be rushing into US bonds.' German government bonds rose yesterday as investors moved to pull out of short positions. The December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 91.29, up 0.39 on the day. Trading was quiet in the morning but lower-than-expected inflation news in the states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg led to buying. The Bundesbank council meeting left rates unchanged. Mr Bob Tyley at Paribas Capital Markets said: 'Nothing has happened in core European markets to create a change this week. But because of what has happened in the US, people have been covering themselves in case there is a change here. But a pull out of equities need not be positive for bunds, it might be for cash.' UK government bonds started the day by slipping, largely due to the fall in sterling due to political worries over talk of the Conservative government resigning if it was defeated over legislation on the UK contribution to the European Union budget. However, gilts shrugged off those worries and perked up on the back of bunds, and by the end of the day the December long gilt future had moved up  3/32 of a point to trade around 103 5/16 . The yield spread over bunds had moved out from 123 to around 128. Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg, said: 'We are getting used to these crises. They come and go.' Mr Cliffe at Midland said: 'Considering the pre-occupation that political problems are in other European markets it is remarkable how sanguine people are in the UK. They are working on the assumption that the threat from the government will work, but the implications of the bill not passing are rather disturbing. One wonders if the market will pay this more attention later.' The yield on Italian government bonds fell yesterday as bond prices followed the positive tone on bunds. The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds fell 7 basis points to 12.07 per cent. However, Mr Pio de Gregoria at NatWest Markets said: 'Until the political situation is clear and the budget is passed there is very little scope for the bond market to recover. There is enormous uncertainty and if the political crisis becomes even worse than it is now then it could hamper the pace of the recovery because confidence could be damaged.'</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Owners Abroad Airtours may have made an informal approach earlier this year for rival tour operator Owners Abroad but the Germans have now firmly laid out their towels on the beach. In seeking a 10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, the German LTU Group aims to secure its strategic position in the UK package holiday market following its recent acquisition of the Thomas Cook travel agency. But LTU also envisages considerable operating benefits from pooling its German chartered airlines and tour operations with those of Owners in the UK. As for Owners, the proposed deal brings a useful cash injection and access to the 340-outlet Thomas Cook chain. This will allow it to achieve the vertical integration which has become the latest rage for tour operators. Such a low-risk diversification may be particularly appreciated by Owners' shareholders given their company's distinctly patchy acquisition record. But the deal also has clear defensive implications - not least in diverting attention from a pretty dismal set of annual trading figures. It is of course possible that the move may flush out a hostile bid from Airtours. Either way, Owners' shareholders should be happy enough to sit tight.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / PM given plans for new constituencies A Japanese advisory panel yesterday submitted a draft to Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama for redrawing constituencies for the lower house, one of the main pillars of a political reform package, Emiko Terazono reports from Tokyo. The last phase of the reforms that have dominated Tokyo politics in recent years, the redefining of the boundaries of 300 single member constituencies, aims to eliminate discrepancies of voter representation. Politicians have for long seen the old multi-seat system as the root cause of a string of funding scandals. Candidates, often from the same party, felt obliged to compete on the basis of lavish campaigns rather than on policies. At present, there is a huge difference in the size of urban and rural constituencies. The plan presented yesterday reduces the level of disparity between the most populated electoral district in the northern island of Hokkaido and the least populated constituency in Shimane, western Japan, to 2.1 times, down from as much as three times. As a result, rural areas will lose seats while cities will gain. Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at brokers Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says the changes will eventually lead to more consumer oriented policies, and boost deregulation efforts. Electoral reform will also reduce the number of seats in the lower house from 511, which are elected in multi-member districts to 500, of which 300 will be elected in single member constituencies and 200 will be decided by proportional representation in 11 regional blocks. The passage of electoral reform legislation through parliament, which could come as early as next month, will pave the way for the government to enact the political funding bill, which will regulate the distribution of public subsidies to political parties. While parties in the ruling coalition - Social Democrats, Liberal Democrats and New Harbingers - are seen as wanting minimal changes in electoral boundaries, because of fears of losing their old support bases, they are not expected to haggle over electoral reform because they need funds.</p>

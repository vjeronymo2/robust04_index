			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Appeal to Brussels on currency charges EUROPEAN Community banks and bureaux de change still charge travellers too much and display insufficient information on exchange rates and fees, according to the European consumers' organisation. The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) yesterday called on the European Commission to introduce binding legislation to improve cross-border payment systems and ease the establishment of the single market. The Commission estimates that consumers will save more than Ecu1bn (Pounds 700m) in bank charges annually, if financial institutions follow guidelines issued in March. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC financial services commissioner, has threatened to introduce legislation if the banks do not cut their fees and improve transparency by the end of the year. But Ms Laura Mosca, Beuc's chief economist, yesterday condemned the Commission's voluntary 'users' charter' as a 'public relations gimmick' and urged Sir Leon to take rapid and tough action which would bring financial institutions into line. 'The consumer's lot has not altered since 1988 when the first (Commission) recommendation on payment systems was adopted,' she said. Beuc and UFC Que Choisir, a Paris-based consumer organisation, examined the specific area of holiday money and found, for example, that two-thirds of EC banks and bureaux de change displayed no information on exchange rates and fees for travellers' cheque transactions. The consumer groups also attacked banks and card issuers for the lack of information available to consumers using payment cards and cheques when overseas.</p>

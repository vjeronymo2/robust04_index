			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 28 (OANA/ANTARA) -- Indonesia's  Western Regional Fleet Commander-in-Chief Rear Admiral Aried  Kushariadi inaugurated the new amphibious squad and exercise  fleet command here Thursday.    The two new units will strengthen the naval operation in the  western region of the archipelago and will consolidate the  so-called "integrated fleet system" of the Indonesian Navy.    The Western Fleet commander-in-chief also swore in the  commanders of the new units -- Colonel Sumarjo appointed as the  amphibious ships squad commander and Colonel Fakhmi Jamaris as  exercise fleet commander.    The Western Regional Fleet was established in 1985, while  the  Eastern Regional Fleet has been in existence since the country's  independence.    According to Kushariadi, two more squads will be set up --  the escort ships squad and the minesweepers squad -- following  the arrival of 39 warships purchased by the Indonesian Navy from  Germany.    Of the 39 warships, nine minesweepers, five corvettes, and  three amphibious LSTs (landing ship tanks), have already arrived  here.</p>

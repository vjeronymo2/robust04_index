			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, United Nations, June 28, IRNA -- Iranian  permanent representative to the united nations, Kamal Kharrazi,  protested against illegal movements of some Iraqi vessels in the  border river of Arvandrood.    In a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali dated 24 June, the representative stressed that the  Iranian authorities recently observed the "illegal movement of  some vessels in Arvandrood which were wrongfully and without  authorization using the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran".    Furthermore, the letter added, during recent months, the  Iranian authorities seized a number of non-Iranian ships  carrying goods to Iraq through Arvandrood who were either  carrying Iranian flag without the consent of Iranian authorities  or were declaring Iranian ports as their final destination.    The letter which was issued as a Security Council document,  continued that "Iran has resorted to limited measures in  Arvandrood in order to curb these activities which not only  violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial intergrity but also  the international sanctions against Iraq."    Iran held the Iraqi regime responsible for the consequences  of its actions which are in violation of international law and  regulations as well as the principle of good neighbourliness, it  stressed.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, the letter concluded,  "reaffirming its full compliance with the cease-fire established  under Security Council Resolution 598 as well as its total  commitment to the provisions of the treaty concerning the state  frontier and neighbourly relations of 13 June 1975 and its  protocols, reiterates its desire for improvement of relations  with Iraq on the basis of principles of good neighbourliness and  international law."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing paragraph (bb) requires that the location of ventilating devices used to control air movement through worked-out areas be included in the ventilation plan. The proposal would add a requirement contained in the previous regulation, that the location and sequence of construction of proposed seals also be indicated. Improper sequencing of seal construction can have a deleterious effect on mine air quality, and therefore the location and sequence of construction of these seals should be reviewed and approved as a part of the ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (r) of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. Section 75.325(d), as reproposed, would require that areas where mechanized mining equipment, including longwall equipment, is being installed and removed be ventilated. Paragraph (r) of &sect;75.371 would require that the quantity of air that will be provided be included in the ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.372&blank;Mine Ventilation Map  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed paragraph (b)(3) would revise existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;75.372(b)(3) to assure that all known adjacent workings are shown on the mine map, regardless of whether they are located on mine property or on adjacent property. It would do so by deleting the phrase ``on mine property'' from the existing standard. In response to comments received, the Agency has concluded that it would be inappropriate to exclude from the mine ventilation map all known workings located in the same coalbed within 1,000 feet of existing or projected workings simply because they are not located on the mine property. Safety benefits associated with the knowledge of nearby mine workings accrue, even when the nearby workings are not on the mine property. The Agency also notes that this revision would be consistent with existing paragraph (h) of &sect;75.1200, Mine map. Paragraph (h) of &sect;75.1200 requires that the mine map show all adjacent mine workings within 1,000 feet. Like the previous standard, this revision would assure that all adjacent mine workings appear on the &sect;75.372 map in those cases where operators do not use a &sect;75.1200 map for their required submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments, the proposed paragraph (b)(19) would reinstate the requirement in the previous standard that the mine map include the entry height, velocity and direction of the air current at or near the midpoint of each belt flight where the height and width of the entry are representative of the belt haulage entry. The belt entry is required to be examined in accordance with subpart D. The proposal would assist the examiner in rapidly determining whether the air is flowing in its normal velocity and direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the discussion of proposed &sect;75.301, instances have developed where operators take air from an intake air course to ventilate shops, electrical installations, or for other purposes, and this air is then coursed to the surface and is not used to ventilate working places. Under one interpretation of the existing definition, because this air has not ventilated a working place or a worked-out area, the air course cannot be considered a return air course. In these instances, the proposal would expressly permit the redesignation of the affected portion of the air course as a return. Because it is important that personnel, including examiners, the miners' representative, and representatives of the Secretary, know which air courses have been redesignated, the proposal would require that they be shown on the map. The proposed paragraph (b)(20) would require that the designation and location of air courses that have been redesignated from intake to return for the purpose of ventilation of structures, areas or installations that are required by this subpart D to be ventilated to return air courses, and for ventilation of seals, be shown on the map.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.380&blank;Escapeways; Bituminous and Lignite Mines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would revise paragraph (f) and portions of paragraphs (d) and (i) and repropose paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal, &sect;75.380(d)(3) would provide that in areas of mines where escapeways pass through doors or in areas of mines developed before November 16, 1992, where escapeways pass across or under overcasts or undercasts, the height of the escapeway may be less than 5 feet provided the height is sufficient to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency situation. It was brought to the attention of the Agency that in some instances the removal of roof support or the lowering of the tops of overcasts may be necessary to provide the 5-foot height required by the existing rule. It has been suggested that this could, in and of itself, result in a diminution of safety. Historically, the dimensions of escapeways were addressed through criteria. Some mine operators have requested and received approval for lesser dimensions than that in criteria based on a performance test referred to as a ``stretcher test.'' Under this test, 4 persons are required to carry a person on a stretcher through the area in question to demonstrate that the lesser dimension would not delay escape. The Agency would expect that when there is a need to determine whether sufficient height is provided, the stretcher test discussed above would be applied. Since the goal of the standard is to assure that the escape of miners is not impeded, the demonstration that there would be no delay assures that there is no reduction in safety when the proposed standard is compared to the existing standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

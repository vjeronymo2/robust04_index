			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN WOMEN SEEK TO END DROUGHT  </P> <P> They have done their best to ignore the facts.  </P> <P> They have prepared for tonight's California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's  basketball game the same way they always do.  </P> <P> "We're treating it just like any other game," Cal State Northridge Coach Leslie  Milke said.  </P> <P> So is there reason not to believe her?  </P> <P> Absolutely.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors' opponent tonight is not just any CCAA team. It is Cal Poly  Pomona (15-4, 4-0 in conference play), ranked No. 2 in Division II and a team  that has won or shared the conference championship each of the past 7 years.  </P> <P> More to the point, Pomona is 29-1 against Northridge, its only loss on Jan. 20,  1976.  </P> <P> Since then, the Lady Broncos have trampled the Lady Matadors 28 times. Yes,  trampled. Of Pomona's 29 wins, 25 have been by 10 or more points -- including  18 by 20 or more.  </P> <P> "This year is a little different," Milke said. "We have a lot of new kids. I  don't think the mystique has been ingrained in them yet."  </P> <P> Northridge came close to ending its losing streak against Pomona 2 seasons ago.  The Lady Matadors led by 7 points and had the ball with 32 seconds left. The  final: Pomona, 88-78.  </P> <P> Pomona forced 4 turnovers in the last half-minute to tie the score after  regulation, then outscored CSUN 14-4 in overtime.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Milke is quick to point out, only one player from this season's  team -- guard Vicki Mallett -- was around to see that one.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors (15-4, 3-1) will be playing without center Chris Cavalin.  </P> <P> Cavalin, the team's leading scorer (16.6) and rebounder (10.1), is still  bothered by a pulled groin muscle she suffered in practice last Friday. "It's  still bad," Milke said, "and if we play her now we might lose her for the rest  of the season."  </P> <P> Pomona center Niki Bracken leads the conference with an 18.4 scoring average  and is fourth in rebounding with an 8.6 average. Guard Cathy Gooden is  averaging 14.9 points and 5.6 assists.  </P></p>

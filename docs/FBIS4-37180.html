			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, June 16 (MAP)--Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri confirmed Wednesday that his latest remarks  about the Sahara issue were not "personal".    Dembri had told Moroccan daily "L'OPINION" that a "political  solution" to the Sahara issue within a Moroccan framework was  possible without the referendum.    In a clarification statement to Algerian "EL MOUDJAHID"  governmental daily, Dembri said the idea was not his and it was  among the ideas raised in 1983 by "top Moroccan political  personalities" and namely "the stamp and flag" formula.    "What was valid earlier can be accepted today", said head of  the Algerian diplomacy, adding that several proposals were made  including the idea of an international conference proposed again  by Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organisation of  African Unity at the OAU summit of Tunis.    After recalling the difficulties facing the referendum,  Dembri said it is possible that the referendum will confirm  after all a political accord and stressed the need to give way  to politic and diplomatic initiatives to get out of the impasse.    For Moroccan daily "L'OPINION", mouthpiece of the Istiqlal  party, said Wednesday Algeria speaks a double language and  wondered what Algeria really wants in the Sahara issue a  "political solution" or the referendum.</p>

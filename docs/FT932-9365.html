			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Talks end as PLO rebuffs US proposal THE NINTH round of Middle East peace negotiations ended without any sign of progress yesterday after the first direct US attempt to bridge differences had been rebuffed by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. No date has yet been set for a resumption. Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO executive committee, said a US document, submitted late on Wednesday, openly sided with Israel and was 'a dangerous step' in the peace process. The Palestinian negotiators in Washington refused to attend the meeting with US and Israeli officials at which the US compromise formula was presented. Mr Abed Rabbo claimed the US document had been agreed in advance with the Israelis. 'It was an Israeli document to which the Americans had given another name,' he said. The Israeli delegation said it also had reservations about the US draft document, which was being studied in Jerusalem. The US proposals, which seek to find common ground on a statement of general principles covering interim self-government for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, were later delivered to the Palestinians. A senior member of the Palestinian delegation said that the document had not been rejected out of hand. State Department officials stressed that the proposals were further evidence of the US commitment to become a 'full partner' in the peace process, as promised by President Bill Clinton. It is the first time since the Madrid conference 18 months ago that the US had presented proposals on substantive issues. The ninth round of negotiations, which opened more than two weeks ago after a gap of four months, was already bogged down over Palestinian accusations that Israel and the US had reneged on promises made to bring them back to the negotiating table. At the weekend the Palestinians reduced their negotiating team from 14 to three and halted work on three sub-committees. They cited killings of Palestinians by Israeli troops and worsening economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza caused by sealing off the territories, as evidence of Israeli bad faith. Those members of the Palestinian delegation most concerned at erosion of support at home are openly sceptical about the value of continuing the talks.</p>

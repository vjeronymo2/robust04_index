			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hostile bid by BBA subsidiary BBA, the component maker for automotive, aviation and industrial markets, yesterday announced that Pacific BBA, its Australian subsidiary, had made a hostile ADollars 86m (Pounds 39m) bid for Siddons Ramset, a diversified manufacturing group. The offer comprises ADollars 42m cash and the issue of 18m new shares in Pacific BBA. There is also a full share alternative. BBA is hoping that the offer will be accepted in respect of 70.5 per cent or more of the shares which would reduce its 57 per cent stake in Pacific BBA to below 50 per cent. The UK-based group no longer wants to assume the total debt of companies in which its Australian subsidiary has a 51 per cent stake. Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said: 'We are planning to reduce our controlling stake in Pacific BBA to allow it to grow without hindering our balance sheet.' Siddons Ramset, which has debt of about Pounds 12m, made pre-tax profits of ADollars 4.3m in the year to June 30.</p>

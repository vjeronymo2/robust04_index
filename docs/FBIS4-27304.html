			<p>BFN     [Text] Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA]  Comrade Kim Chong-il has sent thanks to Yi Ki-pom and Hwang  Tong-kyu, political functionaries of the unit of the Korean  People's Security Forces to which Comrade Kim Tae-song belongs,  and four discharged soldiers who collectively advanced into the  socialist rural area.    Yi Ki-pom, political functionary, visited Choe Hyong-nak, an  officer who displayed an exemplary deed in carrying out his  combat duty, every day when the latter was seriously injured  from an unexpected accident and was receiving medical treatment  in a hospital. Yi Ki-pom brought food and encouraged Choe  Hyong-nak to receive medical treatment. When Choe Hyong-nak was  evacuated to a hospital distant from his unit, Yi Ki-pom often  visited and comforted him.    Yi Ki-pom later visited Choe Hyong-nak who was residing in  his home town, Samhwa-ri, Munchon, as a disabled veteran, and  encouraged him, urging him to remain loyal to the party and the  leader like a soldier although the guardpost was changed. At  Choe Hyong-nak's wedding, Yi Ki-pom visited him with the  commanding officer of the unit and congratulated him. On many  occasions, he helped build Choe Hyong-nak's home, along with  other soldiers of the unit. Together with him, Yi Ki-pom went  to the Samhwa cooperative farm to encourage enthusiasm among the  workers.    Officers Yi Nam-son, Yi Pyong-man, Choe Su-hwan, and Pak  Myong-son, who visited Choe Hyong-nak with Yi Ki-pom,  collectively advanced into Samhwa cooperative farm where the  comrade-in-arms was living when they were discharged last  December, not returning home, thus blooming the great leader's  grand rural area-building plan.    Political functionary Hwang Tong-kyu, deeply impressed by  the  comradeship of the soldiers of the unit, including Yi Ki-pom,  made his sister, who was working at a fabric plant, marry a  disabled veteran, and made his sister Hwang Kum-suk, who was  working at a cooperative farm, marry Choe Hyong-nak in August  last year.    The meetings to deliver the thanks of the KPA Supreme  Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il were held on the spot. At the  meetings, the comrade supreme commander's thanks were delivered  amid enthusiastic applause of the participants. This was  followed by a debate of resolutions. The meetings adopted  letters of pledge to the dear leader of our party and our people  KPA Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

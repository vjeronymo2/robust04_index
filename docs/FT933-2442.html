			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler loses its shine Any company with annual sales approaching DM100bn, and half-year profits of only DM168m has got a problem. Under US accounting practice, however, Daimler-Benz loses the magic of released provisions and other convenient adjustments. The US-style loss of DM949m is a much better measure of the size of the difficulty facing the company. Daimler is apparently moving to cut the losses, yet the 12 per cent cut in staff numbers announced yesterday will be phased over three years. With conditions in the European motor industry abysmal, most, if not all, of those cost savings will be lost to competitive pressures. Even if more painful cuts are made, European unit production costs are much higher than those in the far east, and that gap may prove unbridgeable. In some ways Mercedes-Benz's position is even worse than that of Volkswagen since the luxury car market is under threat both from Japanese competition and the trend towards smaller cars. And as much of the allure of buying a Mercedes is in its dependable German construction, the company is in a double bind. Were production transferred elsewhere, the brand's cachet could be compromised. In fairness, Daimler recognised some of the strategic threat when it diversified into aerospace and electronics. Yet its expensive purchases have proved poor value, and have failed to protect the company from the automotive cycle. They may also have distracted management attention from the central problem facing its car business at a critical time. Flotations in New York and rights issues in Europe will not avail Daimler if the company's heart ceases to beat.</p>

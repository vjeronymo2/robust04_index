			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: IBM plans to market its Ambra range in the US IBM, the US computer maker, plans to form a subsidiary to sell low-cost personal computers in the US under the Ambra brand name, mirroring its earlier moves in Europe and Canada. It has also formed a new division within its personal systems organisation to develop a new generation of high-performance desktop and PCs based on the Power PC microprocessor it has developed with Apple Computer and Motorola of the US. The moves reflect IBM's determination to extend its lead in the PC market by offering products that appeal to all segments. While the formation of the US Ambra subsidiary may give IBM a boost in PC profits in the near term, the new division represents a long-term strategic effort to ensure IBM is strongly positioned in an emerging segment of the PC market. Ambra will offer products aimed at price sensitive buyers and will compete directly with the 'clones' of IBM's PCs offered by lesser-known manufacturers. As in the UK, where Ambra was introduced last year, the product line will not carry IBM's name and the subsidiary company will operate independently. Ambra US could represent a serious threat to second and third-tier PC manufacturers in the US who are already feeling the pressure of intense price competition. In contrast, the newly-formed Power Personal Systems division is an in-house effort to benefit from IBM's substantial investments in Power PC microprocessors for PC products. By placing the development group in a separate division, IBM aims to maintain the focus of its existing PC business on development of PCs using Intel microprocessors. IBM's semiconductor partner in the Power PC chip effort is touting the new chips as having 'the power to blow away Pentium,' Intel's latest microprocessor chip. IBM PC, however, has no plans to abandon the Intel architecture and is developing PC products using 'Pentium and future Intel microprocessors,' a spokesman said. However, IBM aims to make the most of its investment in Power PC by offering the broadest possible range of products using the new technology.</p>

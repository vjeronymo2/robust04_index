			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX STAYS HOT AGAINST COLD CAPITALS  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux had a goal and an assist Friday night at Landover, Md., to extend  his scoring streak to 33 games and lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 6-4  victory over the slumping Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> It was the seventh loss in a row for the Capitals, who were leading the Patrick  Division on Dec. 29 and are now tied for last place.  </P> <P> Only one player in NHL history has exceeded Lemieux's streak, and he did it  twice. Wayne Gretzky had a 51-game streak during the 1983-84 season and one of  39 games two seasons later.  </P> <P> "The streak," Lemieux said, "is important only if we win. There's no  satisfaction extending it in games in which we lose.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that we are finally starting to play the way we should. We're  lucky to be in a division where nobody has taken charge."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh defenseman Paul Coffey reached a milestone. He scored his 270th  goal, tying Bobby Orr for second place in goals by defensemen.  </P> <P> Coffey is only 28. Barring injury, he seems certain to surpass the record of  310 by Denis Potvin.  </P> <P> Lemieux has 25 points in the last eight games, during which the Penguins are  6-2-0.  </P> <P> The surge of the Penguins, who are only three points out of first place in the  Patrick Division, began when Craig Patrick took over as coach and general  manager Dec. 5.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, New Jersey 2 -- Stephane Richer scored twice and set up another to  help the Canadiens end a five-game winless string (0-4-1) on the road.  </P> <P> It was only the third win in the last nine games for the Canadiens, who are  trying to battle back from injuries and a lack of scoring punch.  </P> <P> The three victories have come in the last four games and Richer is a major  reason why. He has four goals and three assists in the three victories.  </P> <P> "It's up to Stephane to lead us out of our rut," Coach Pat Burns said. "The way  he looked tonight he's ready to do just that."  </P> <P> Winnipeg 7, Detroit 5 -- Paul MacDermid had a goal and two assists at Winnipeg  to lead the Jets to their seventh victory in the last eight games.  </P> <P> The Jets (21-17-5) moved ahead of the Kings and into third place in the Smythe  Division.  </P> <P> Jimmy Carson had two goals and an assist for the Red Wings.  </P> <P> The game was marred by a lengthy brawl in the second period that resulted in 86  penalty minutes. All 12 players on the ice drew penalties.  </P> <P> St. Louis 5, Vancouver 2 -- Power-play goals by Paul MacLean and Brett Hull 57  seconds apart late in the second period at Vancouver carried the Blues to their  fourth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> St. Louis scored all but one of its goals on the power play as the Blues moved  into second place in the Norris Division, one point ahead of Toronto.  </P> <P> MacLean tied the score, 2-2, with his 18th goal of the season during a two-man  advantage at 17:15. Hull then scored the game-winner, his 38th goal of the  season, at 18:12. He is one goal behind league leader Pat LaFontaine of the New  York Islanders.  </P> <P> Rod Brind'Amour, Sergio Momesso and Steve Tuttle scored the other St. Louis  goals as the Blues handed the Canucks their third defeat in a row.  </P> <P> Trevor Linden and Dan Quinn scored for Vancouver, which was outshot, 31-23.

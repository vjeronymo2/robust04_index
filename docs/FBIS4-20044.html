			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog, </F> CDU/CSU candidate for federal president, by Gunter Hofmann and  Robert Leicht; place and date not given: "Toiling in  Weizsaecker's Footsteps"]    [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Germany is unified as a nation but it is  still divided internally. What can and should politics  contribute to the rectification of this condition?    [Herzog] Politics in both the old Federal Republic and in  the  new laender must have a clear idea of how far unification should  really go. In terms of the economy, the question is easy to  answer. As far as this famous overcoming of mental barriers is  concerned, the aim is, in my opinion, being set too high in the  discussion of it--at least in the old federal laender. I have  never shared the view that all Germans have to think alike. I  regard it to be absurd: It is unhistorical, it is not  pluralistic, and it is also not democratic. The idea of this  Wall in the Mind and the dismantling of this Wall I consider to  be two-thirds west German imperialism.    [DIE ZEIT] Was it not also "western imperialism" to  translate  this slogan of "Freedom for the east Germans" into "Property for  the west Germans"--to wit, the property ruling?    [Herzog] This is the first issue on which I am not allowed  to  comment. That is before my court.    [DIE ZEIT] You would, to be sure, like to become federal  president but expect the public--because of your present  office--to buy a pig in a poke?    [Herzog] In regard to this issue, that is correct. On the  other hand, it is the Federal Assembly that elects me and I am  doing everything conceivably possible to explain my convictions  and my person. There are problems, however, that I cannot  comment about.    [DIE ZEIT] After unification, hardly anyone wanted to open  the constitutional debate--let alone conduct it aggressively.  Nonetheless, we talk day after day about aspects of our internal  and external constitution. The current federal president has  embarked upon a rather exhaustive criticism of the partisan  political state. Would not the constitutional debate have  offered an opportunity to clear up the inadequacies of the  partisan political state?    [Herzog] I do not believe that at all because here we are  dealing for the most part with things that cannot be regulated  by law. To be sure, one can stringently regulate--and I want to  do so and have been calling for it ages--the issue of party  financing and similar things. One of the faults of our system  that has resulted in the scandals of recent years is that all of  that was not regulated.    [DIE ZEIT] Not even as a result of the  by-no-means-consistent  legal rulings from Karlsruhe...?    [Herzog] That too is completely right. But the issue of  internal party democracy and the issue of limiting the negative  consequences of internal party democracy that exist as  well--those are issues that cannot really be regulated by law.    [DIE ZEIT] If the political process is to be reformed it  would have to be reformed against the interests of the parties  and at the same time with the cooperation of the parties--and  one cannot have both. How can you prevent parties from  cooperating, as it were, among themselves?    [Herzog] Do you want to do away with the parliamentary  system  of government? The parliamentary system of government, which I  consider to be a very momentous breach of the principle of the  division of powers, consists of the parliamentary majority  simultaneously dominating parliament and the government--as a  result of the majority principle. The attendant consequences can  only be avoided by introducing a presidential system--something  I can hardly imagine now.    [DIE ZEIT] If it cannot be solved by a presidential system,  would not the introduction of enhanced plebiscitary elements in  our constitutional life be a means of overcoming this incestuous  relationship within and among the parties?    [Herzog] There are two things to be distinguished here. One  is the question of to what extent the parties should really have  influence on the appointments to leading positions in individual  areas. In southern Germany the mayors have been elected by the  people since time immemorial. In Bavaria, even the district  magistrates are elected by the people. The popular election of  mayors is now, so to speak, penetrating northward. It has proven  itself in the south.    The second thing is the plebiscitary element. I have always  said that I am not against it. I come from Bavaria where that  has been customary for ages. I was a minister in  Baden-Wuerttemberg where it has existed for ages. I have no  problem with it. The problem is different. The issue is  plebiscitary elements and some say Yes and others say No. Yet  the discussion of it, after all, must take place: What can be  decided by a plebiscite and what not? This discussion is not  really being conducted here.    [DIE ZEIT] How should we treat the Basic Law as revised  following unification? Do we need a referendum on the final text?    [Herzog] I would welcome the newly formulated constitution  being submitted to a plebiscite because that is customary in  democratic nations.    [DIE ZEIT] How should this unified nation interpret its  external role? There are a lot of people now who want to go  merrily charging into international affairs--to a certain extent  with military means even.    [Herzog] The military question--we have that before us as  well and therefore I cannot comment on it. Furthermore, the  whole problem consists of many aspects. The nice little  pigeonholes have been gone now for some years. The northern  hemisphere was neatly divided between the Warsaw Pact and NATO  and the very concept of "Third World" shows that the rest of the  world was defined in terms of these two pigeonholes--something  that cannot be true. This is past. I use the following somewhat  silly example for this: To date, it has been a game of pingpong  between the East and the West and now it is Rastelli with an  unlimited number of balls. It is an entirely new way of thinking  that all of us have not yet mastered. Moreover, there is no  question at all that in the long run we will not be able to  shirk the responsibility on the international scene that results  from this country's importance. And we are not doing that either.    [DIE ZEIT] From German history and World War I and II we  have  thus far drawn the following conclusion regarding Germany's role  in Europe: Germany should conduct itself with the greatest  reserve in international affairs. Now it looks as if many people  are throwing this practical knowledge overboard. Can we once  again be completely normal in our foreign policy?    [Herzog] No, we cannot. For a long, long time we will have  to  make allowances for the sensibilities that we have created in  our own history. What in the early days of the Federal Republic  was regarded as a limitation upon our sovereignty and a burden  became, however, an advantage as it were over the course of the  intervening 40 years. Although we have every reason to draw our  conclusions from history, no one will be willing any longer to  accept in the long run that we, with a reference to our misdeeds  of the past, claim for ourselves a position that others today  regard as a privilege.    [DIE ZEIT] In reference to East Europe, there is the  quotation: "That which we did not gain in war will fall into our  lap in peacetime."    [Herzog] That must not be allowed to become policy. Even the  appearance of it must not arise. That is, moreover, the  reason--and I am permitted to state it now that it has been  ruled on--why in the final analysis I was also for the  Maastricht Treaty.    [DIE ZEIT] After unification there has been a growing chorus  of voices claiming that we no longer need our close ties to the  West, that our linkage to the West was a special course and now  we can go our own way.    [Herzog] That is sheer nonsense: We cannot. He who leans far  out of the window--and we have to do that in East Europe--must  ensure that there is someone there holding onto him--that is our  integration into the West--so that he does not fall out of the  window. And finally: Who knows, to put it this way, what the  national character of our own people will once again bestow upon  us?    [DIE ZEIT] If the future Berlin Republic therefore has to be  in essence a continuation of the Bonn Republic, what is the  situation with the catchword "constitutional patriotism?" Dolf  Sternberger characterized the concept by stating that the  republican rules of the constitution are the core of our  society, and thus it is sufficiently defined. More and more it  is now being said that a purely republican constitution is not  sufficient, that we need in addition a national consciousness.    [Herzog] Because of everything in my entire background, my  sense of national pride and such things is downright  underdeveloped. I love the German people, who are a difficult  people, but I really love them in all their branches--and I do  not say that just since I have become a candidate for the office  of federal president. But one has to proceed with caution in  these things.    [DIE ZEIT] The sociologist Lepsius once said: "We simply  cannot identify with Germany's history...National Socialism has  made this absolutely impossible."    [Herzog] I think that we are dealing only with a difference  in wording here. The word "nation state" is, after all, an  archaic word. The phenomenon of the nation state in the form in  which it used to exist is a thing of the past. Basically, it was  already relegated to being put in quotation marks by the entry  into the world economy, and then it was really put in quotation  marks by West European integration and it has been basically  antiquated. But nonetheless the peoples of Europe live in states  that constitute their nations. And they want their states. No  Frenchman would ever be prepared to give up France just for  Europe. It is exactly the same with us.    [DIE ZEIT] Steffen Heitmann once said that the identity of  the country must be culturally defined.    [Herzog] Now here again I can do relatively little with that  because already during the time of the classic nation state I  considered culture to be something that transcends nations. In  addition--and I would really like to emphasize this once  again--culture was always international or predominately  international.    [DIE ZEIT] When the RAF [Red Army Faction] was terrorizing  this country, society--the state--was prepared to undertake the  most extreme measures. Is it unfair to say that this society did  not act so decisively against the Right?    [Herzog] There was a phase of perplexity, of  irritation--that  is entirely correct. I no longer see this, however.    [DIE ZEIT] Konrad Adenauer was extremely suspicious  regarding  the Germans' democratic loyalties in general.    [Herzog] Yes, we have to be on guard. To be sure, I go on  the  assumption that the great majority today is at heart faithful to  democracy, yet the times are past when the ultraleftist and  ultrarightist groupings, which exist in any nation, were  quiescent. For more than a generation they were disqualified by  Stalinism and National Socialism. That, of course, has changed  with the expiration and succession of generations. For that  reason I have always said: Pay attention to these people, do not  let them drift away.    [DIE ZEIT] The Federal Republic has always lived in the  shadow of the past. Now we are living in the shadow of a double  past. What should we learn from the years after 1945 for our  dealing with the dictatorship in East Germany and its legacy in  the form of the Stasi [State Security Service] files? Should we  make amends there for what we failed to do in 1945, or did we  learn after 1945 what must not be neglected in coming to terms  with the past?    [Herzog] I believe the latter. One thing must be clear:  Flagrant violations of human rights, the killing of people,  arbitrary incarceration of people, torture and the like must be  exposed and must be documented--as has been done in the final  analysis in the case of the Third Reich as well, albeit with  large delay factors.    [DIE ZEIT] But mean-spirited denunciation, spying on people,  snooping around?    [Herzog] I would make considerable distinctions in regard to  what happened. It is a different matter in cases where people  were really harmed than it is if someone submitted a report  about a trip to the Federal Republic or to France. The  "arrangements" that someone made with this regime over 40  years--that is, after all, something known from the period after  1945 as well--you cannot pursue either politically or through  the criminal law.    [DIE ZEIT] But you are not advocating a "sealing of the  files" either, are you?    [Herzog] I, too, do not advocate sealing the files for a  very  simple practical reason: Sooner or later it will come to light  after all.    [DIE ZEIT] We have a year ahead of us in which the  anniversaries will pile up and one has the impression that, like  1984-85, we are once again stumbling somewhat clumsily into the  situation. Should we be present [at the commemorative  ceremonies] on the Atlantic coast?    [Herzog] It depends upon the nature of such ceremonies. We  should, I believe, have nothing to do with those that basically  celebrate victory over the Germans. It is proper that we are not  being invited and, in my opinion, it is also proper that Helmut  Kohl says he would not go there at all. When it comes to  ceremonies that point to the future from the perspective of that  time--that say that was the beginning of a new European  policy--then the matter is entirely different. But in all these  things I would be very much opposed to a  we-have-to-participate-in-everything mentality as well as  opposed to a mentality that feels itself disqualified when the  others celebrate their victory.    [DIE ZEIT] Are we at least able today to acknowledge that  the  military defeat of the German Reich was the sole prospect of  achieving a free Germany and a free Europe?    [Herzog] I do not have the impression that that is disputed  in our country. If you direct the question to me--it is to be  answered in the affirmative. It is my view that we should be  able to see that and not to worry further about it at all.    [DIE ZEIT] All federal presidents to date have suffered from  the fetters of the office and occasionally have tried to tug on  the chains. What attracts you to this basically weak office?    [Herzog] What interests me about the office are two things.  The first is: We have a pluralistic society and it is proper  that we do. I feel comfortable in it. The only thing is that a  pluralistic society naturally develops centrifugal forces, yet  it only functions when the sum of the centripetal forces is at  least equally great as--if not somewhat greater than--that of  the centrifugal ones. And there are, after all, many  communalities among our political camps, but they, in fact, get  lost in the business of politics. What actually emerges all the  time are only those things that divide them, not those that  unite them.    [DIE ZEIT] That means that you, as president, would be the  personification of the "Round Table."    [Herzog] No, but to that end one must look around and see  where there are integrative agencies. And my opinion on that  score has always been that one is the federal president and  another is the Federal Constitutional Court--in different areas  and with entirely different methods. The other thing is that I  have the feeling that the parties, to a certain extent for  easily explainable reasons--and that is not just their failure  but that is a part of the system--also have to deal a lot in  these political discussions with details, and that the citizens  see the larger problems and therefore feel to a great extent  that they are not being understood.    [DIE ZEIT] That means that the federal president would then  on occasion be the spokesman for the citizenry to the parties as  a whole?    [Herzog] Yes, publicly.    [DIE ZEIT] You are thereby attributing a compensatory  function to the federal president. He would jump in...    [Herzog] That is not incorrect. But it is not just the job  of  the federal president to act as a counterweight, rather it  belongs to those people who ought to do it.    [DIE ZEIT] That means now and then taking the parties to  task  then?    [Herzog] Yes. Only it is a question of whether to do it  publicly. That has to be decided on a case-by-case basis.    [DIE ZEIT] Did not Richard von Weizsaecker's administration  raise expectations for this office much higher than the office  can in fact live up to?    [Herzog] Yes.    [DIE ZEIT] Will not then a period of normalization set in  following Richard von Weizsaecker's administration?    [Herzog] I would not say normalization, but it is very clear  that it will be terribly difficult to toil in the man's  footsteps. That, however, will apply for anyone who assumes the  office.    [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Herzog, the liberals in this country say that  Roman Herzog is not nearly as conservative as a Christian  Democratic Union (CDU) candidate could be. Many CDU supporters,  even in the conservative press, say that Roman Herzog is not as  conservative as he should be. In that quarter you are considered  to be ideologically a bit unreliable. How liberal are you? How  conservative are you?    [Herzog] That is the old story, and once again I have to  say:  Pigeonholes do not do any good.    [DIE ZEIT] In general, what does this society as it is  presently constituted need more: a bit more liberality or a bit  more conservativeness?    [Herzog] Now you would have to hold a long discussion as to  what is liberal and what is conservative. I believe in any case  that solutions can only be found in free discussion. On that  score I am an almost childlike liberal: I still believe in the  freedom of discussion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Venezuelan  President Rafael Caldera agreed, during a meeting held at La  Guzmania presidential residence, to increase bilateral  cooperation and fully use consultation and political dialogue  mechanisms.    The two presidents decided to create a high-level binational  commission that will be chaired by their foreign ministers and  comprised of the ministers in charge of bilateral cooperation  issues. The presidents also agreed to hold the second meeting  of the Venezuela-Brazil political consultation mechanism in our  country. Furthermore, they issued instructions to authorities  in the foreign trade sector to assess and step up the  negotiations to reach an economic complementation agreement  within the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]  framework.    Even though no agreements were signed in the meeting, it  helped establish the groundwork for common projects in different  sectors. In the highway sector they agreed to finish highway  BR-174 and to broaden a land transportation agreement. In the  electric sector they reached an agreement for the purchase of  Venezuelan energy. In the hydrographic sector the topic was  navigability between the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. In the  mining sector they will work jointly to protect Indians at the  border area. In the ecology sector the issue was ecological  tourism in a joint action to recover areas degraded by illegal  miners. In the steel works sector the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron and  Steel Works] furnaces will manufacture iron and manganese alloys.    Later, during a news conference, the Brazilian president  said  his government is carefully analyzing border problems with our  country, adding that neither Venezuela nor Brazil should neglect  looking into these issues because they might cause an atmosphere  of uncertainty in the relations between the two nations.  Moreover, President Rafael Caldera said that following the  talks with his counterpart he is fully convinced the current  Brazilian Government is clearly inclined to adopt the necessary  measures to prevent illegal mining on Venezuelan territory.    [Begin recording] [Franco, in Portuguese] It is clear that  the border problem between Brazil and Venezuela will be  carefully analyzed. We have a very extensive border with  Venezuela, a border that was abandoned by our peoples. Now with  the presence of President Rafael Caldera and with the presence  of the Brazilian Government, we will be able to study and  carefully analyze those aspects which today cause problems in  our relations.    [Caldera] I am fully convinced that the current Brazilian  Government is clearly inclined to adopt all the measures  possible to prevent the garimpeiros' [Brazilian gold seekers]  illegal mining activities in Venezuela -- both by watching the  border and by adopting precautionary measures in the State of  Roraima and other border states where they may have their  operations centers and by enforcing legal measures through  Brazilian courts against those who have perpetrated illegal  actions in this area. [end recording]    Referring to the first meeting held between the heads of  state of Venezuela and Brazil, Gilberto [as heard] Poletto,  minister of state and president of the Foreign Trade Institute,  and Andres Velasquez, governor of Bolivar State, agreed that new  roads have been opened to strengthen bilateral relations.    [Begin recording] [Poletto] There was talk about stepping up  the negotiations to sign an economic cooperation agreement  between Venezuela and Brazil because this had been discussed a  couple of years ago. This will bolster the partial agreement we  currently have, perhaps by adding more products and including  some additional norms. The goal is to consolidate and improve  trade relations between Venezuela and Brazil, which have  recently increased but are still insufficient compared with the  immense possibilities we have in different trade sectors.    [Velasquez] Specifically referring to the Brazilians' case,  I have had the opportunity to discuss a specific proposal. All  the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish  with the Brazilian Government should include a specific  agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe  Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or  logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the  garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length  because the latest information we have, based on investigations  that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just  involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as  scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and  the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug  trafficking. [end recording]</p>

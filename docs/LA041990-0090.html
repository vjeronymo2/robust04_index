			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL EXPECTS FAST RESOLUTION ON SHOPPING CENTER  </P> <P> Public hearings on the proposed Sport Chalet shopping center, which became the  crucial issue in last week's La Canada Flintridge City Council election, could  begin before June and be resolved quickly, council members said this week.  </P> <P> The council, which met Tuesday to swear in new members, scheduled a special May  3 meeting to announce the hearing dates. The city requires that notice of  public hearings be posted at least 20 days in advance.  </P> <P> The election April 10 of three council members who favor the controversial  retail development should speed the appeal hearings and at least one councilman  has said the hearings will be over in a month.  </P> <P> "People are sick of the Sport Chalet deal," said Councilman Chris Valente.  "They just want it out of the way."  </P> <P> The proposal calls for the construction of a 163,995-square-foot shopping  center on 11.75 acres at Angeles Crest Highway and Foothill Boulevard. The  $25-million complex would house the Sport Chalet store, a large restaurant, a  market and a number of smaller shops.  </P> <P> The Sport Chalet project has been the subject of a series of 15 public hearings  by the city Planning Commission during which time many residents spoke out  against the development, calling it too large.  </P> <P> The commission voted in February to approve a conditional use permit for the  shopping center and sent the proposal to the City Council for approval. But  after the developer filed an appeal objecting to some of the conditions set by  the commission, the council decided to reconsider the entire proposal. On March  19, the council voted to delay public hearings until after new council members  took office.  </P> <P> The proposed development became the top issue in the city's recent election,  which some residents called an unofficial referendum on the issue. Although all  seven council candidates acknowledged the right of Sport Chalet owner Norbert  Olberz to develop his property, only the three candidates who were elected gave  the proposed shopping center a strong endorsement.  </P> <P> Sam Allen, a spokesman for Sport Chalet, said he thought it would be six to  nine months before the company would be able to break ground on the project.  Allen estimated the construction of the retail center would take 12 to 18  months.  </P></p>

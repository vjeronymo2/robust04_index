			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- The United  States will likely downgrade Taiwan from its "priority watch  list" to ordinary "watch list," reducing the threat of trade  sanctions against Taiwan for failing to eliminate commercial  piracy, US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said here  Wednesday [13 April].    Kantor made the statement while meeting with Taiwan's  Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang to discuss bilateral  trade issues. The two are here to attend a ministerial meeting  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Kantor told Chiang he is fully aware of Taiwan's efforts to  improve intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. "I  understand Taiwan has made progress in IPR protection," he added.    "We also know Taiwan manufacturers are organizing an IPR  foundation to fight against domestic and foreign infringements  of their copyrights, trademarks or patents," Kantor said.    "So we are considering placing Taiwan on the less serious  `watch list' instead of the `priority watch list,'" Kantor noted.    The US trade representative placed Taiwan on the "priority  watch list" last April for possible trade sanctions under its  "super 301" provision. It will decide whether to remove Taiwan  from the list late this month.    Chiang told Kantor that Taiwan is determined to wipe out  commercial piracy and has taken measures to improve IPR  protection during the past year, including revising laws to  increase penalties for offenders and launching massive  crackdowns on IPR violations.    "We hope America can take note of our efforts and remove  Taiwan from its super 301 watch list," Chiang added.    Chiang and Kantor also exchanged views on tariff reductions,  market opening and wildlife conservation issues during their  40-minute talk.    Kantor reaffirmed US support for Taiwan's early entry to  GATT, but asked Taiwan to accelerate trade liberalization and  lower tariff rates in accordance with GATT regulations.</p>

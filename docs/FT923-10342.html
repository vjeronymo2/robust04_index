			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Slide in company starts continues THE number of companies being formed is continuing to fall, according to a survey that is likely to heighten worries about the effect of the recession. According to Jordans, a business information group, 56,022 companies were created in the first half of this year, a drop of 3.1 per cent from the 57,788 starts in the same period last year. Although the year-on-year fall is lower than the rates recorded early in the recession, the figure indicates how the weak economy has reduced opportunities for budding entrepreneurs. According to Jordans, the number of company starts has declined particularly in northern and eastern England, with the west Midlands and Scotland less affected. Besides the poor business outlook, the reduced enthusiasm of banks to back fledgling businesses is seen as a further factor behind the fall in company starts. Jordans' figures for company formations are based on registrations at Companies House and cover the UK excluding Northern Ireland. This year's figures follow a year-on-year fall of 9.1 per cent last year, and one of 7.1 per cent the previous year. Last year, 110,108 companies were formed, down from a peak of 130,478 in 1989. In the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, there was a 28 per cent fall in the number of companies established in northern England. In eastern England, the east Midlands and north-west England the falls were 25 per cent, 24 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Scotland and the west Midlands each saw a drop of just 7 per cent, while outer London suffered a decline of 12 per cent. The figures for the south-west, south-east, Yorkshire and Humberside region, and southern England were 18 per cent, 17 per cent, 16 per cent and 14 per cent. Inner London and Wales saw rises of 12 per cent and 8 per cent in the number of registered companies. That, though, reflects large numbers of 'shelf' companies registered at accountants and agents in London and Cardiff, not new economic activity in those areas.</p>

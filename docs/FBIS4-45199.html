			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Over 78 kg of pure cocaine with a market value  exceeding 230 million new pesos were confiscated yesterday in  the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, by members of the Federal  Judicial Police Counternarcotics Division. Two presumed public  prisoners were arrested in the operation, considered "one of the  most important carried out to date by the National Institute To  Combat Drugs [INCD]."    Reports provided by the INCD, which is subordinate to the  Attorney General's Office, reveal that Hermenegildo Vazquez  Reynoso and Rutilo Larios Tovar were arrested in the underground  parking lot of the Plaza Patria shopping center. They were  engaged in closing a purchase and sale deal involving 78 kg and  800 grams of the drug.    It was stated that the drugs, hidden in the false bottom of  a  pickup truck's platform, are thought to have been intended for  shipment to Tijuana, Baja California, and subsequent smuggling  into California for sale and consumption.    According to the department itself, and based on laboratory  tests, the confiscated cocaine, distributed in several "bricks,"  had a high degree of purity. Hence, it was estimated that, after  processing, its weight would have been increased up to 700  percent; which would have netted the drug dealers sizable  profits.    The authorities stressed that the capture of those now  indicted and the drug confiscation "resulted from an extensive  investigation." They added that it is being continued in both  Jalisco and Baja California, to determine culpability, and  whether those responsible belong to a group engaged in  international narcotics trafficking.    It should be noted that, nearly a year after the  aforementioned institute's creation, and although it has highly  sophisticated technological equipment and agents who are  graduates of the Attorney General's Office's own Training  Institute, its results in the battle against the drug traffic  have been minimal. For this reason, yesterday's confiscation is  regarded as one of that institute's most important achievements.</p>

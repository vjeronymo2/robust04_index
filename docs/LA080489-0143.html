			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CARDIS TRYING AGAIN TO SELL TUNEUP MASTERS  </P> <P> For the third time in three years, troubled Cardis Corp. is trying to sell its  most valuable property, Tuneup Masters.  </P> <P> Cardis, which moved from Buena Park to Cerritos early this year, applied  Tuesday in bankruptcy court in Los Angeles to auction off its Tuneup Masters  subsidiary.  </P> <P> Cardis filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal  bankruptcy code last May. Tuneup Masters is not part of the bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Cardis has come very near selling Tuneup Masters twice before, but both deals  fell through without explanation.  </P> <P> The company has proposed a beginning bid of $55.8 million for Tuneup Masters,  according to Andy Granatelli, Tuneup's chairman and CEO. Cardis bought Tuneup  Masters from Granatelli and several partners in July, 1986, for about $58  million.  </P> <P> Tuneup Masters, based in Newbury Park in Ventura County, owns 240 quick-fix  automotive stores in eight Western and Southwestern states.

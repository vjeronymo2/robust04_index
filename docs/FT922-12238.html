			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (5): Growth takes up the space - Real estate ONE GLANCE at Seattle's skyline, and the casual observer will fear the worst. The downtown area is dominated by several dozen skyscrapers, many ominously high and gleamingly new. In today's recessionary climate, this would seem to spell problems of unlet space, souring real estate loans, and all the domino effects which have savaged the US banking and insurance industries nationwide. In reality, Seattle's recent growth and resistance to the worst recessionary forces means that such problems - although not entirely absent - have been significantly mitigated. The Seattle office of Coldwell Banker, the Sears Roebuck subsidiary, reckons that around 13.7 per cent of the downtown commercial office space is vacant, compared with a peak figure of around 18 per cent in 1988. It suggests that vacancy rates have dropped during the past three years, and then flipped back upwards to a smaller extent in 1991. This is a simple function of supply and demand. Over the past three years, downtown Seattle saw 4m square feet of new office space come on to the market, principally in five large buildings. The market had been absorbing around 1m sq ft a year, but this figure fell to about 250,000 sq ft last year. Locals attribute this last development to the economy - which, although far from fullblown recession, finally felt some winds of change last year. Boeing, for example, is still a very big factor in Seattle's economic health, and its fortunes can even influence spin-off demand for office accommodation. The wave of bank mergers also cast an element of doubt over the real estate market, although property experts remain relatively relaxed about the amount of space which these deals may result in. Vis-a-vis the largest transaction  -the merger between Security Pacific and Bank of America and its Washington subsidiary, Seafirst - much is thought to depend on who buys the 86 SecPac branches which BoA is required to divest and what sort of 'head office' structure the purchaser takes on. 'Banking consolidation is the wild card,' says Boh Dickey, chief financial officer at Safeco, the large Seattle-based multiline insurer, summing up the general uncertainty. Rental rates, meanwhile, have seen relatively little increase for almost a decade. That said, while some foreclosures have occurred, there has been nothing on the scale of the East Coast. Bank of America itself came to the aid of one large local developer, acquiring the Columbia Seafirst Center, Seattle's biggest single property with 1.4m square feet of office space. Outside the downtown area, the office space situation is somewhat variable. For example, in Bellevue, home of Microsoft and many other high-tech businesses, the supply situation is viewed as significantly tighter than downtown, with vacancy rates in single digits. The real estate community, ever optimistic, seems hopeful that this situation could pertain in downtown Seattle in a few years' time. It points out that no new space is likely to come on stream until 1994 or 1995. Meanwhile - and more speculatively - the turmoil in Hong Kong is prompting some flow of Asian money into Vancouver. It is a small step, some suggest, from there, down the coast to Seattle and San Francisco. On the residential housing front, Seattle's traditional problems have been supply, rather than demand-oriented. At the end of 1990, for example, it was estimated that the city had about 250,000 housing units, of which half were single family homes. Less than 5 per cent were believed to be vacant. About half the city's households, meanwhile, were thought to be renting. This tight balance between supply and demand, therefore, pushed up house prices in the Eighties, and may also have contributed to a significant homelessness problem. (Around 3,000 people a day are homeless in Seattle). Equally inevitably, the present slowdown in economic growth has mitigated the problem somewhat, although experience varies depending on area. In general, prices have been softer in recent months, with the average price of an existing home standing at around Dollars 164,000.</p>

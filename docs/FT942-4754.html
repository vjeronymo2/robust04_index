			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile market Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, was typically gung-ho at yesterday's annual results. Not only did he predict that Vodafone's revenues per subscriber would hold at last year's level of Pounds 665, despite new rivals in the shape of Orange and Mercury One-2-One, he even forecast that competitors would raise their prices to near the level provided by Vodafone's 'umbrella'. If Orange and One-2-One do indeed shelter under Vodafone's umbrella rather than dragging it into a price war, the company's premium rating would be more than justified. But it would be wrong to take Mr Whent's forecasts at face value. They are best regarded as attempts to lure the new players into a cosy oligopoly rather than predictions. If anybody can pull off this feat, Mr Whent is probably the man. But the dynamics of the new tetrapoly will be harder to control than that of the old duopoly. When Orange and One-2-One attain nationwide coverage in two or so years, their imperative will be to fill their networks up. It is hard to see that being achieved without large price cuts. Meanwhile, Vodafone's international strategy is set to move up a gear. It wants to increase its stakes in overseas licences, turning them from investments into associates and eventually subsidiaries. Greater control would help Vodafone add value to its investments, some of which have not performed well. The group is also likely to bid higher prices for new licences. That makes sense given that Vodafone lost the Italian licence through too low a bid. The more aggressive approach should enable Mr Whent to meet his expansion targets. But it will not come cheap.</p>

In that notice, Western committed to develop and use principles of IRP in its resource acquisition and transmission planning programs. The separate public process to develop IRP principles for Western's programs begins with publication of these draft principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft principles outlined in this notice differ from those proposed for Western's customers. Western's resource aquisitions are primarily short-term purchases of supplemental resources to firm variable hydropower generation, not aquisition's of resources to meet long-term load growth through the principles set forth in section 114 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The principles have also been modified so that they can be applied to Western's transmission planning process, which does not deal with new generation resources, only new or upgraded transmission facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western is currently involved in other public processes that can have an impact on future purchase power requirements. These processes are the Replacement Resources Process, pursuant to the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;575); the Central Valley Project 2004 Power Marketing Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); and the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects Power Marketing EIS. The principles being developed under this public process will be applied when acquiring resources related to the decisions from these other public processes. These principles will serve as the policy under which specific procedures are developed as each project identifies the need to acquire resources or increase Western's transmission capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed formal principles of IRP would apply specifically to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Normally, formal principles would not be applied to unpredictable seasonal purchases, day-to-day economy energy purchases, and other short-term transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS LIFTED BY PUBLIC SECTOR;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: HOME BUILDING REMAINED WEAK. OTHER REPORTS INDICATED A SLACKENING  ECONOMY AND FEWER LOANS BEING TAKEN OUT BY CONSUMERS.  </P> <P> Record spending on public projects during October boosted construction for the  first time since July, the Commerce Department said Monday, but private home  builders remained in the doldrums.  </P> <P> Economists said the public spending surge would be temporary because  governments at all levels -- federal, state and local -- are too financially  strapped to continue putting more money into roads, sewers and other  taxpayer-financed activities.  </P> <P> In all, spending on construction of all types increased to $434.4 billion in  October from $428.9 billion, the department said. It followed a decline of 2.8%  in September, no change in August and a slight $200-million increase in July  over June.  </P> <P> But spending on residential projects -- new homes and apartments -- fell to  $179.5 billion from $181.2 billion in September and was the lowest since March,  1986, when spending was $177.4 billion.  </P> <P> Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Assn. -- Fannie  Mae -- said consumers are so worried about the Middle East crisis that they are  unwilling to buy new homes.  </P> <P> Obrinsky said the earliest that housing construction is likely to revive is  during 1991's first quarter.  </P> <P> "The key is consumer sentiment even more than lower interest rates," Obrinsky  said. "If the Middle East situation worsens, we'll likely have to set back  forecasts for recovery."  </P> <P> Nonresidential building activity also weakened in October, to $102 billion from  $102.8 billion in September and $104.4 billion in August. The category includes  factories, hotels and office buildings, all of which have suffered because of a  weaker national economy.  </P> <P> Separately, the nation's purchasing managers reported that their index of the  economy's vigor fell for the fifth straight month to 41.3% in November -- the  lowest level in eight years -- as new orders plummeted.  </P> <P> The 7.7% rise in public spending during October, to a record $117.8 billion  from $109.4 billion, is seen as a short-term boost. It surpassed the previous  record of $115.8 billion set in August, 1989, department officials said.  </P> <P> Spending on schools, highways and sewers increased from September levels.  </P> <P> In another industry report, a banking group reported that consumers continued  to pay their bills in the July-September quarter but were scaling back  borrowing as the economy headed into what many analysts say is a recession.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Purchasing Manager's Index  </P> <P> The purchasing manager's index tracks overall business activity at 300  industrial companies.  </P> <P> November: 41.3%  </P> <P> Source: National Assn. of Purchasing Management  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction Spending  </P> <P> Billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted  </P> <P> Oct., '90: 434.4  </P> <P> Sept., '90: 428.9  </P> <P> Oct., '89: 429.3  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

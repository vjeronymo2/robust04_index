Fujii told a regular press conference that he has heard no  discussions in the government of new steps, such as  much-discussed macroeconomic targets.    He declined to say directly whether a proposed increase in a  10- year 430 trillion yen public works spending program would be  included in a market-opening package to be compiled this month.    Leading Japanese business organizations are calling for a  boost in the fiscal 1991-2000 spending program and for targeting  a reduction in the current account surplus as a percentage of  gross domestic product (GDP).    Asked about such proposals, Fujii repeated that cabinet  ministers discussing the market-opening package will likely  confirm plans to act "voluntarily and positively" in four key  areas, in a meeting expected to be held before U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher arrives Wednesday for an official visit.    The four areas are deregulation, import promotion, the  boosting of antitrust enforcement and the improvement of  government procurement practices.    He also called for steady implementation of the government's  15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package together with the  fiscal 1993 third supplementary budget, and swift enactment of  the fiscal 1994 budget.    He repeated that these measures will have "an extremely big  effect" in boosting domestic demand, a key component of efforts  to reduce Japan's trade imbalances.    Fujii said he hopes the steps will be taken "as soon as  possible" with "sufficient deliberation" in the Diet on the tax  revision bills, which include tax cuts of some 6 trillion yen  contained in the stimulus package.    He declined to say whether a delay beyond the month's end in  passing the bills might hold up the staged income tax cuts,  which are slated for implementation this summer.    On Monday, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a press  conference he wants the government to pass the bills by the end  of March to give the ministry time to implement the tax cuts  promptly.</p>

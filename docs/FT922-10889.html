			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Olivier Messiaen: Obituary MESSIAEN'S death yesterday at the age of 83 has robbed contemporary music of one of its few universally acclaimed and respected elder statesmen. In an age characterised by schools and circumscribed aesthetic movements, his pre-eminence stemmed from his singular achievement in forging a musical language with profound implications for succeeding generations of composers, while remaining absolutely wedded to his highly personal vision of music's function. Olivier Messiaen was born in Avignon in 1908; his father was a literary scholar, his mother a poet, and his development appears to have been precocious: he taught himself the piano and wrote his first compositions at the age of nine. A year later he began to study music formally, and encountered Debussy's Pelleas for the first time. Throughout his years at the Paris Conservatoire, 1919 to 1930, it was to be Debussy's example that provided the essential antidote to the hidebound syllabus he was compelled to follow. In 1931 he was appointed organist at La Sainte Trinite in Paris, a position he was to hold for the rest of his life, and from the outset of his career celebrated his Roman Catholic faith not by providing music for the liturgy, but in producing works whose impulse and function were essentially meditative. The organ cycles La Nativite and L'Ascension (originally written for orchestra) characterised his music in the 1930s and have become established as perhaps the most widely admired of all 20th century works for the instrument. During the Second World War Messiaen was interned for two years at a prison camp in Silesia. Out of that confinement he produced what has remained one of the most widely played of all his works, the Quatuor pour la fin du temps (1941), written expressly for the composer to perform with his fellow inmates. On release he returned to the Paris Conservatoire as a professor not of composition but of harmony, and later also of analysis. A meeting with the pianist Yvonne Loriod (who became his second wife in 1962) led to the start of a series of piano works with Visions de l'amen (1943) and Vingts regards sur l'enfant Jesus (1944). The piano was to remain an integral part of his scoring, finding its way as a soloist into almost all his conceptions, parts conceived expressly for Loriod. But it was the premiere of his Trois Petites Liturgies in the newly liberated Paris in 1945 that established Messiaen as a radical and controversial composer, even if his avant-garde affinities seemed at odds with his unabashed Christianity. In the post-war years his growing reputation as a teacher, his open-mindedness and interest in a host of western and non-western musical models brought many young, highly gifted composers to his analysis classes and to the private composition seminars he held in Paris. His early pupils included Boulez, Stockhausen, Barraque and Xenakis. In the 1950s he began an intensive and systematic study of the songs of birds, 'the greatest musicians to inhabit this planet', incorporating them into works such as Oiseaux exotiques (1956) and the huge cycle of piano pieces Catalogue d'oiseaux (1956-58). From the 1960s onwards his music tended to become ever more monumental and meditative. The culmination of this line of development and indeed of Messiaen's life work appeared to be his 'scenes Franciscaines', St Francois d'Assise, staged at the Paris Opera in 1983. Messiaen's was a non-developing art, and in that sense strangely foreign to the Western art-music tradition. He was one of this century's most singular and distinctive creators.</p>

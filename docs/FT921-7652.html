			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bensons pulled back by potato shortage Principally because of potato shortages last summer, Bensons Crisps saw pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1m in the year to November 30 1991. Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said the quality of old crop potatoes in June was 'extremely poor' and there was a shortage of new crop potatoes in July. The group ran up excess costs of Pounds 300,000 through higher prices paid for 'spot' potatoes, lower yields, factory standing time and lost sales through limited production. The pattern of forward purchases for 1992 has been changed to reduce the risk of any recurrence, the chairman stated. Sales rose to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 22m). There was a significant switch in consumer purchasing from standard packs to multipacks, with their inherent lower margins. In addition, higher priced products suffered under consumer down-trading. Earnings came to 9.8p (12.5p). The final is held at 2.15p for a total of 2.85p (2.75p).</p>

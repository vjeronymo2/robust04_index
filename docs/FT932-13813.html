			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Moscow coup leaders defiant The leaders of the Moscow coup attempt, now facing trial in the Russian supreme court, yesterday launched a public relations campaign to put across their version of events, writes Gillian Tett in Moscow. Although the trial began last week, amid considerable poltical controversy, it was suspended after one day, ostensibly because one defendant suffered a stroke. Looking subdued but defiant, the coup leaders yesterday reiterated their claim that former Soviet leader Mr Mikhail Gorbachev had been implicated in the coup, and that President Yeltsin's control of the media was denying them a fair trial.</p>

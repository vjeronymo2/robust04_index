			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Queens Moat calls in finance consultant MR ANDREW COPPEL, the former finance director of jewellery group Ratners, has been appointed as a consultant to Queens Moat Houses to mastermind the financial reconstruction of the troubled hotels group. Mr Coppel said it was 'not appropriate' to join Queens Moat's board until its financial position became clearer. Mr Coppel, who left Ratners in April 1990 before the group ran into financial difficulties, said one of his first priorities was to improve Queens Moat's management information systems. Further details emerged of Queens Moat's financial condition. A preliminary estimate by Grant Thornton, the accountants, shows that profits before interest and depreciation charges were Pounds 106m in 1992. 'That shows the group is viable,' a banker said. The group's 64 bank creditors, which are owed Pounds 1bn, are hopeful that the eventual financial restructuring will not involve conversion of debt into equity, though it might require some deferment of interest and rescheduling of principal payments. However Grant Thornton believes Queens Moat made a pre-tax loss in the year of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 80m. The accountants have not fully quantified the effect on profits of the way that Queens Moat accounted for revenues derived from management incentive contracts. Under these contracts managers promised to earn specified revenues for the group during the forthcoming financial year but Queens Moat booked these revenues as profits for the previous financial year. Last year, as the hotel industry went into recession, the managers delivered less profit than Queens Moat had booked. Barclays, which is chairing a steering committee of the banks, has asked bank creditors to agree to a two-month standstill, involving the suspension of all interest and principal payments for that period. The standstill request also involves a freeze on banks' rights to take possession of Queens Moat deposits. Some banks would like to use these deposits to reduce their loans to Queens Moat. However, Barclays believes that the group's survival depends on its ability to draw on these cash reserves to continue trading. Lex, Page 22</p>

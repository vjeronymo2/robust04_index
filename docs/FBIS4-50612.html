			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Chinese National  Federation of Industries will send a 60-member delegation to the  Philippines' Subic Bay May 24-26 to inspect potential investment  sites, a federation official said Thursday [19 May].    Vice Secretary-General Chen Chin-nan said the group members  will seek to understand labor problems there and consult with  Philippine authorities on the business tax they will collect  from Taiwan investors.    Chen said as the Philippines has frequent labor disputes and  strikes, Taiwan investors are concerned about whether there will  be similar incidents when they set up business there.    Investment in Subic Bay is one part of the government's  "southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan investment in  Southeast Asia.</p>

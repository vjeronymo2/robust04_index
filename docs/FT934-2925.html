			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / SA police ordered into KwaZulu South Africa's two-day-old Transitional Executive Council (TEC) tested the limits of new black political power yesterday, with far-reaching orders to the police and the KwaZulu black homeland, Reuter reports from Cape Town. The multi-party TEC, the country's first statutory body to give executive powers to blacks, adopted proposals initiated by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and the South African Communist Party. One resolution instructed police to move into northern Natal, including parts of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's largely autonomous KwaZulu homeland, to deal with the unrest there. 'The KwaZulu police have been standing by, doing nothing when people are being killed and injured,' Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC delegate, said. 'Units of the South African police should be deployed in the area. Some of these areas fall under KwaZulu.' South Africa's white-led police have traditionally respected the nominal autonomy of Chief Buthelezi's local police. Chief Buthelezi has refused to join the TEC, vowing to defy its authority. The TEC also appointed a delegation to talk to police about the activities of its controversial internal stability unit, the police branch which replaced the riot squad. The UN yesterday agreed to unrestricted resumption of shipments of oil and petroleum products to South Africa, ending a 16-year embargo widely observed but not mandatory, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Sharp rise to Dollars 733,000 at Holmes Protect Holmes Protection, the US security group which is quoted in the UK, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits, from Dollars 133,000 to Dollars 733,000 (Pounds 473,000) in the six months to June 30. The group said its performance demonstrated continued improvement in spite of a drop in half-year sales from Dollars 27m to Dollars 25.8m. It attributed the progress to continuing steps taken to reduce operating expenses. Last month Sir Ian MacGregor, the former chairman of British Steel and British Coal, resigned as chairman of Holmes. This followed disagreements over a deal in which HP Partners, a US investor group, injected Dollars 10m into the group in return for a 34 per cent stake. Mr Paul Douglas, a director for the past 19 months, succeeded as chairman of Holmes, which plans to delist its shares in London and obtain a quotation on the Nasdaq exchange in New York. Earnings per share rose to 1.5 cents (0.1 cents). There is no interim dividend.</p>

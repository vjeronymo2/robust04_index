			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, April 16 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebel leaders  demanded the dissolution of the interim government as a  precondition for entering truce talks, AFP learnt here Saturday  [16 April], as renewed fighting rocked the capital and trapped  refugees and UN troops at the airport. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile the chief of staff of the interim government's  forces issued his own set of truce conditions, appealing for an  immediate halt to all fighting in the east African country, as  media sources reported heavy arms clashes between the two sides  in the capital Saturday afternoon.    The airport was another flashpoint, with Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes saying Saturday in Brussels that some 400  Belgian UN peacekeeping troops were "trapped like rats" there  and under imminent threat of a rebel attack. [passage omitted]    A second bilateral session scheduled for Saturday in a hotel  in a rebel-held sector of Kigali had yet to get under way at  6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) in Kigali, AFP learnt. The meeting was  called to discuss both sides' ceasefire proposals under the  auspices of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (UNAMIR).    In Brussels, Claes told journalists his troops were "trapped  like rats ... We have information from very good sources that  armed Rwandan (rebel) forces are preparing to attack the  airport, while the chaos in Kigali is growing by the hour and  anti-Belgian sentiment is still intense." Claes added that the  commander of UNAMIR, General Romeo Dallaire, had been charged  with ensuring the safe departure of the Belgian troops along  with around 100 European and Rwandan refugees still at the  airport. "There is no time to lose, the runway at Kigali  airport is in danger of being destroyed," he said.    Belgium has decided to pull out its troops from Rwanda,  where  10 days of inter-ethnic bloodletting has ravaged the country and  left thousands dead since the April 6 death of the country's  long-ruling Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane is  thought to have been destroyed by rocket fire.    Reporters witnessed from their hotel as violent heavy arms  exchanges rocked the eastern side of the Kigali Saturday  afternoon, the combats centred on a communications centre  equipped with a satellite broadcast receiver. [passage omitted]    In a document received by AFP in Nairobi, the government  forces' chief of staff, Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi, called for "an  immediate end to fighting and military operations" in Rwanda as  one of a series of "mechanisms to be put in place to help ensure  a return to peace. He demanded an end to "punitive expeditions  and revenge operations led by the RPF," and called on rebel  radio to end its "provocative campaign of lies."    Government forces also called for frequent meeting between  themselves and RPF commanders to help put an end to attacks by  renegade forces, and the establishement of emergency aid  corridors to feed "forces on both sides."

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York City, 17 Jun (DPA) -- The Guatemalan  Government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  (URNG) reached an agreement today in Oslo on the resettlement of  people uprooted by the internal strife that shook the country  for 30 years, the United Nations reported today in New York  City. The agreement will not enter into force until the  government and the URNG sign a final peace agreement at the end  of this year. The preparatory work for this accord will begin  in the next 60 days, it was announced.    Once the resettlement concludes, the sides will begin to  discuss the topic of the "identity and rights of Indian  peoples," which is the next step in the negotiations. This new  pact, accompanied by the one signed already on human rights,  consolidates the possibility of bringing to an end the longest  continuing conflict in Latin America, the United Nations  indicated.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 24 June  carry editorials, reports, and articles on nationwide strikes by  locomotive engineers and subway workers.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a  1,100-word editorial entitled "Should the Innocent Citizens  Suffer Pains?" Noting that the railroad is the "main artery of  the nation and the subway is the feet of the people," the  editorial stresses that their operation should not be suspended  under any pretext, and that the "serious traffic disorder"  caused by recent strikes by railroad and subway workers is  indeed unfortunate.    Pointing to the "deplorable position of the people who can  do  nothing except watch the strike," the editorial writes that "the  one who suffers pains and damages for the strike is none other  than the nation and the people," not railroad and subway  authorities or their trade unions, asking if the leadership of  the railroad engineers and subway workers unions has ever  thought about the "catastrophic consequences" to be brought  about by their strike.    The daily stresses that the locomotive engineers trade  union's demand for improvement of working conditions and the  subway workers union demand for a 15.4 percent wage increase  does not justify such a drastic act which "restricts the  national economy and binds the citizens' feet." The editorial  points out that the railroad and subway are different from  private enterprises, and moreover, railroad engineers are public  service personnel, and the law prohibits their strike and  "sabotage." The paper denounces their hasty strike as an act of  driving the nation and the people into "a bog of confusion."  The editorial emphasizes that the people do not think that "the  demand of unionized subway workers is urgent nor has  justification and that their strike cannot evade condemnation by  the citizens as an act of betrayal." The paper writes that the  railroad and subway are "possessions of the nation and the  people," not of the government or the trade unions. The  editorial concludes by stressing that "it is a most urgent task,  which should be resolved before anything else, to normalize the  operation of the railroad and subway."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  3,000-word editorial, under the headline, "Who Has Stopped the  Train?--The Government's Hardline Measures Cause Catastrophe."    The editorial points out that the "serious traffic disorder"  caused by the suspension of train and subway operation is "the  result of the government's wholesale roundup of striking  locomotive engineers" in a bid to prevent the strike of railroad  and subway workers slated for 27 June, defining this step as  "the worst choice" among measures for resolving the  labor-management dispute. Thus, the editorial writes, the very  "ringleader" who caused a catastrophe is none other than the  government, and the government's step even violates the law,  because the workers taken to the police did not refuse routine  daily work nor did they disturb normal operations. Branding the  government's arrest of the leaders of the workers in strike as  an "excessive step," the editorial observes that the strike was  prompted by "outdated labor management and the policy of  unreasonable repression of wages" by the railroad authorities  and that the workers' demand reflects the urgency in their  working condition and everyday life. The paper then notes that  the demands of workers in the past were "ignored and refused" by  the authorities, who are the users of workers.    The editorial stresses that the government should have shown  "a sincere attitude" to make its best efforts for a satisfactory  solution of the dispute instead of shifting the responsibility  to the workers. The paper then calls on the government to  release all arrested workers and to provide the union leaders  with the opportunity to participate in negotiations with the  government for a solution to the dispute. While urging the  workers' side to show a sincere attitude for a solution of the  situation if the government puts forward concrete measures, the  editorial calls on the press to make a fair and impartial  report. The paper urges the people "not to condemn only the  workers' side but patiently endure personal inconveniences and  wait for the satisfactory settlement of the situation."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 30 a 1,000-word  article by reporters Son Yong-kyu and Pak Chon-ho on citizen  reaction to the railroad and subway workers strike:    Chang Chun-su (age 36, businessmen living in Puyong  Apartment  Complex in Pyongchon, Kyonggi Province): Trade union workers  should not victimize the citizens' everyday life to accomplish  their demands. The attempt of some workers to sacrifice all the  people for the interest of some trade union workers should not  be pardoned.    Yu Hui-su (40, business company employee): The attitude of  the locomotive engineers trade union to accomplish their will by  binding the citizens' feet is erroneous. The government is also  responsible for failing to prevent the paralysis of the national  economy. Both sides should show the will for a satisfactory  solution to their dispute at an early date.    So Kyong-sok (member of the National Federation for Economic  Justice): Drastic actions causing acute confrontation are  always a problem. The illegal strike by railroad workers can  hardly win the support of the people. A matured attitude for a  solution through dialogue and negotiations is urged.    Kim Song-su (40, public service official): Both sides should  show an attitude of making concessions. The government should  also show a more sincere attitude for negotiation with workers.  The citizens' unrest is increasing for the strike, in addition  to the North Korean nuclear issue.</p>

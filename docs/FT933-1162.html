			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Brittan urges rate cuts to 'kick-start' EC economies SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community's chief trade negotiator, yesterday called on member states to take advantage of the newly flexible exchange rate mechanism to cut interest rates and 'kick-start' their economies out of recession. Laying out a policy for closer economic co-operation within the Community based on agreed monetary growth targets for each of the 12 member states, Sir Leon sought to salvage European economic and monetary union and restore confidence in the Community's political ambitions. Without mentioning France and other countries which have put a higher priority on maintaining close links to the D-Mark, Sir Leon said interest rate cuts should take place on condition that inflation risks were limited. In a speech to the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London, Sir Leon staked his claim as a contender to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. In defiance of UK government policy, he made clear that he did not share the scepticism of Mr John Major, the prime minister, about the desirability or likelihood of Emu. It would be 'a grave mistake to assume that this issue will now slip quietly off the European agenda,' he said. At the same time, nobody in the continent would try to force the UK back into the ERM or Emu. Sir Leon also ridiculed the suggestion - floated by Mr Delors a week ago - that capital controls might be the way to ward off currency speculators and strengthen the ERM as a vehicle for future monetary union. Such controls could not seriously be entertained, Sir Leon said. 'Their reintroduction would be contrary to the commitments which European governments have made to each other and internationally. They would undermine price stability goals. They could be a step, not toward a single currency, but away from it and certainly a step away from the single market.' Sir Leon sought to make a virtue out of the August 2 crisis which led to the introduction of 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the ERM. He called for a new road to Emu, based on member states adopting tough price stability and monetary growth targets in common. If applying these targets led to some countries being able to cut their interest rates, even at the expense of a fall in the value of their currencies inside the ERM, this should not be deemed a competitive devaluation, he argued. Instead, he suggested that the Maastricht treaty's provisions for EC finance ministers to set down 'broad guidelines' for economic and monetary policies could underpin such a move. 'Such an approach will give member states a framework within which they can better respond to their own economic needs. But it will be a step towards, not away from, the goal of a single currency.'

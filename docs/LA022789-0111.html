			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CANADIAN FOOTBALL TEAM SALE OKD  </P> <P> Local businessman David Braley received unanimous approval from the Canadian  Football League's board of governors as the new owner of the Hamilton  Tiger-Cats. League chairman Roy McMurtry said the board is "totally  enthusiastic" about accepting the sale of the Ticats to Braley from Harold  Ballard, despite objections from Hamilton's acting solicitor, Phil Hooker.  Hooker said earlier this week that the proposed agreement between the city and  Braley contravenes the Ontario Municipal Act, which disallows municipal aid for  private companies. But McMurtry, a former attorney general of Ontario, said  Friday, "I'm quite satisfied what council is doing is legal." Under the  agreement, the city will charge Braley $1 annually to rent Ivor Wynne Stadium  and is granting the new owner control of the concession and advertising rights  for league games at the stadium.  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Designer labels for buildings  -A voluntary standard is giving developers the chance to mark their environmental progress Trevor Silver, director of Doxford International business park in Sunderland, northeast England, would have liked a windmill to power the landscaped water features but a payback of 15 years or more was a non-starter with the accountants. The shrubs and trees, flourishing in landscaped beds around the first phase of offices, will provide a pleasing green backdrop, but the police would have preferred more security-conscious concreted surfaces with unimpeded views. The development lacks parking space for bicycles - an omission which cost one credit on the Building Research Establishment's 'green' office rating - but letting agents are far more interested in the number of car parking spaces per square foot of office than in pedal power. While frequently lauded as a good thing, environmental ideals are not always easy to reconcile with harsher economic and social reality, especially in a recession. Compromise, as the first phase of the Pounds 125m business park illustrates, is inescapable. But the Sunderland enterprise zone development, the first to be assessed under the BRE's recently updated Environmental Assessment Method for New Offices (Breeam), nevertheless suggests there are commercial as well as ethical attractions in striving for improved environmental standards. Silver says that Akeler Holdings, Doxford International's parent company, noticed a couple of years ago that institutional investors were beginning to ask for a 'green statement' for new developments. Nobody, however, seemed to have much idea what that meant. Akeler became convinced that protecting the environment was becoming commercially, as well as morally, worthwhile. Environmental quality, it decided, would be a valuable marketing tool in promoting its planned Sunderland business park, both by attracting potential tenants and by convincing them the space they leased would be ahead of, not behind, future environmental legislation. So the company set about finding a standard against which to measure its aspiration that the Doxford development, sited on low-grade agricultural land on the urban fringe, should result in net environmental gain. The standard it used was an upgrade of the BRE's original office Breeam scheme which, since its inception in July 1990, has attracted developers of 25 per cent of all new office space in the UK, even though it is voluntary and self-financing. The updated Breeam, launched last January, has already attracted 15 applications for assessment of new schemes, mostly at design stage. BRE, an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, is delighted at striking a chord with developers. 'We certainly see with the update of the Breeam scheme we've moved forward the boundaries of standards,' says Paul Bartlett, head of BRE's Environmental Assessment and Futures section. A building's environmental performance is not necessarily visible, he says. Breeam acts as a label. The updated office scheme, covering global, local and indoor issues, offers developments up to 42 credits for a standard list of features, assessed by independent consultants licenced by BRE. An overall rating of fair, good, very good or excellent is also awarded. Doxford business park's first phase was rated 'very good'; two of its office blocks won 34 credits, the others 33. Provision and use of buildings has a greater impact on the global environment, says BRE, than almost any other human activity, excepting population growth. For example, it estimates buildings now account for around 15 per cent of UK CFC emissions, contributing to depletion of the ozone layer, and half of carbon dioxide emissions, adding to the greenhouse effect. The Breeam scheme aims to raise awareness of buildings' impact on the environment, to stimulate market demand for environment-friendly buildings, to reduce the use of increasingly scarce resources and improve the quality of buildings' indoor environment, hence the health of their occupants. It tackles CO emissions, acid rain, ozone depletion, legionnaires' disease, noise, water economy, hazardous materials, lighting, ventilation and thermal comfort. The European Network of Building Research Institutes, of which BRE is a founder member, has decided to adopt Breeam as a basis for Enbreeam, a Europe-wide grading, which will take into account national factors, such as climate and construction techniques. The Breeam assessment charge, paid by applicants, averages between Pounds 3,000-Pounds 5,000; the total cost of the environment-friendly features which win credits ranges, says BRE, from 0 to 3 per cent of development costs. At Doxford's first phase, sold on to Property Enterprise Trust for Pounds 18m, Silver estimates the additional cost of environmental friendliness at around Pounds 400,000. 'That isn't as frightening as it might sound out of context,' he says. Some features, such as highly efficient boilers, offer immediate savings which will be attractive to tenants; quantifiable annual energy savings at Doxford's first phase office blocks are estimated at Pounds 7,800. However, striving for environmental quality may open up new areas of responsibility for developers. Having decided he wanted a landscaped environment - 'not Fort Knox' - in which the adjacent community would take pride, Silver has been drawn into worthwhile, but time-consuming, school project work. A dog-owner, he is nevertheless ambivalent about the enthusiastic response to his landscaping from neighbourhood dog-walkers, but sees it as a small price to pay for local goodwill. Different versions of the Breeam scheme already cover domestic buildings and superstores and a light industrial and warehouse category is being developed. More radically, environment secretary Michael Howard launched a new Breeam for existing offices last week. 'It encourages the market to move in the direction of improved environmental performance. It's a valuable tool in harnessing market forces,' said Howard. In the property market of the 1990s, 'Breeamed' looks likely to become a familiar word.</p>

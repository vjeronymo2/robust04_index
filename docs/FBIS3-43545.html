			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gordon Mbuli] </F>   [Text] The banned Ngwane National Liberatory Congress  [NNLC] has charged that Tinkhundla [traditional community  councils] is a collection of chiefs gathered for evil political  purposes. In its end of year message, the NNLC has warned the  government to stop threatening political parties in the country.  The party said government must realise that without political  parties, the British Government would never have granted  independence to Swaziland.    The statement signed by the NNLC President Dr Ambrose Zwane  and the secretary general, Mr Africa Mhlanga, said both the  Prime Minister and his deputy should not pretend to be ignorant  of this as they are witnesses. "Both Mbilini and Sishayi  Nxumalo were on the side of political parties when all this took  place, they must not pretend to have forgotten so quickly.  There can be no democracy without political parties. The  international community is pressuring non-democratic countries  like Swaziland and Malawi to change their government and  parliaments towards the direction of multi-party democracy."    The NNLC says South Africa has accepted the challenge,  Malawi  is in the process of changing, Mozambique has accepted  multiparty democracy, and both Lesotho and Botswana have also  accepted it. "Why should people think Swaziland should be alone  -- no man is an island, and therefore, our country Ngwane --  Swaziland -- cannot afford to be the only country in Southern  Africa that has not accepted democracy. The Swaziland  Government now calls itself a new democracy, they have not yet  fullfilled the big question mark, who opposes them in  parliament?"    The NNLC said this is a question the masses were asking them  during the Tinkhundla review issue and are still asking in 1994.  "This is a ten thousand dollar question for Prince Mbilini and  his cabinet." The party claimed that the 1993 elections were a  minority affair not an event involving the entire nation. It  claimed that statistics have proven that 25 percent of the  people entitled to vote participated in the elections. The NNLC  also cited a number of contradictions to what is going on,  different to the recommendations of the Prince Mahlal'engangeni  Tinkhundla Review Commission.    It said page 45 of the report states clear that the House of  Assembly should be a wholly elected house, i.e., none of its  members are to be appointed. NNLC says the aim of the  recommendation was to retain as far as possible, the democratic  composition of the house based on the direct election of the  house by not diluting the house with appointed members.    "The NNLC has always recommended that parliament should  consist of 60 members elected on a basis of single member  constituencies on a basis of one man, one vote and one woman,  one vote. We decry the tendency to mix the meaning of the word  constituency with Inkhundla [traditional community council].  Inkhundla in our opinion is a conglomeration of chieftancies  gathered for evil political purpose."    The NNLC said paragraph 48 of Prince Mahlal'engangeni's  report states that the majority of speakers at the Mbabane  Inkhundla did not want the Tinkhundla system altogether.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave Bibby Pounds 12m in the red J Bibby and Sons, the South African-controlled conglomerate, plunged into the red in the 26 weeks to March 26 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.4m, against profits of Pounds 4.8m last time. The deficit was due to a decision to withdraw from the agricultural feeds business. Bibby last month agreed the Pounds 35m sale of this business to Associated British Foods. The company suffered a Pounds 12.6m loss on disposal and was forced to write off the Pounds 2.5m costs of its aborted plan to float the division. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, had previously said the company would have had to take a Pounds 35m loss on disposal if the business had been floated. Excluding these charges, and a further Pounds 5.2m write-back of goodwill, profits after interest were ahead 65 per cent at Pounds 7.9m. Sales declined from Pounds 416m to Pounds 409.1m. The group benefited from a Pounds 2.4m drop in interest charges to Pounds 5.8m. Bibby's debt, incurred after the ill-fated Pounds 82m acquisition of Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar dealer, fell from Pounds 155m to Pounds 117m. This was largely due to disposals in the Caterpillar division. Mr Mansell-Jones said trading in Spain and Portugal remained weak in the first half. Since February, however, there had been 'a small but significant improvement in the order book level for new equipment'. The chairman said cost-cutting had helped the capital equipment division to reduce first half losses. As forecast the interim dividend is halved to 1p. There is also a special pay-out of 2p following the disposal of the agricultural feeds business. Barlow Rand, which owns 79 per cent of Bibby, has waived its entitlement. Losses emerged at 10.79p (1.43p earnings).</p>

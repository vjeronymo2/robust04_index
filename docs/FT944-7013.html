			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW plan to cut investment prompts slip in share price The Volkswagen share price suffered yesterday as the company announced plans to slash capital investment and reports circulated of internal profit forecasts which fell far short of analysts' expectations. After trading up during the day, the automotive group's shares shed more than DM6 towards the close, ending DM3.70 down at DM451.80. The company last night refused to confirm or comment on the existence of a document reportedly presented at a meeting of the supervisory board yesterday which showed the management expected pre-tax profits in 1995 of DM890m (Dollars 571.17m). The document was also reported to say the outcome could be up to DM200m higher or lower, and added that sales would rise only modestly next year and it would be difficult to increase prices. According to the Reuters news agency which said it had copies of the paper, the management forecasts were far more gloomy than those of stock market expectations, which were mostly based on earnings well above DM1bn. The agency quoted one analyst describing such a result as 'depressing', although others found it hard to believe the figures were correct, suggesting the management could have massaged the data to present as poor a picture as possible to the supervisory board. Under German accounting rules, companies commonly add to or draw down hidden reserves at any time without publicising such moves. While investors are convinced that VW is set to rebound strongly from its net DM1.94bn losses last year, management may want to play down the extent of the recovery while it is still trying to cuts costs and increase productivity. Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, recently angered his competitors with a down-beat assessment of the car market's prospects which hit all automotive groups' shares. VW may also want to paint as black a picture as possible to enhance its chances of success with its current lobbying exercise in Bonn for government subsidies. The company wants funds for a 'scrapping premium' scheme similar to those used earlier to liven up the Spanish and French car markets. Ordinary car owners were paid substantial sums to trade in cars over 10 years old for new models. VW says more than 20 per cent of the German car market would stand to gain most, while other groups such as Mercedes and BMW are believed to be strongly against subsidies which would appeal mainly to owners of lower-priced cars. The non-executive supervisory board, which is dominated by worker representatives and Social Democrat politicians, yesterday approved a sharp cut in medium-term investment plans, which reduces the five-year budget for 1995 to 1999 to DM58.5bn compared with DM69bn for the current budget to the end of 1998. The total will be divided virtually equally between the factories and the group's financial services business.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Himont postpones polypropylene plant HIMONT, the US-based chemicals company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi group, has postponed the start-up of its latest polypropylene plant, believed to have cost more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m), because of the recession. The Brindisi facility in southern Italy has the capacity to produce 180,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, making it one of the largest of its kind in Europe. Originally, Himont expected that the new plant and an earlier 160,000 tonne parallel facility in Brindisi would meet about 10 per cent of estimated demand in the European Community for polypropylene. However, leading polypropylene producers have been severely affected by the recession, notably in the motor vehicle industry, which is one of their main customers. The commissioning of new plant has exacerbated existing overcapacity, while manufacturers have responded with cut-throat price competition. Ferruzzi gave no indication when production at the new unit would begin. The plant will be moth-balled for at least the rest of this year, with production being put off 'in anticipation of more favourable market conditons,' it said.</p>

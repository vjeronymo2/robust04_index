			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Privatised utilities could face more legal challenges Privatised utilities, including the water companies, British Gas and British Telecommunications, were yesterday left more exposed to legal challenges over a wide range of issues after the High Court ruled that South West Water operates under 'state control'. The ruling suggests that all privatised utilities, unlike other public limited companies, will be required to implement European Commission directives, even when these have not been incorporated into UK law. This was seen by lawyers as giving employees and pressure groups extra scope to mount legal challenges against the former state-owned industries by claiming possible breaches of EU directives. These could include challenges over issues covered by EU directives such as employment and environmental concerns. Ms Melanie Tether, an employment partner with Norton Rose, the London law firm, said the ruling would affect the position of all the privatised utilities. 'Undoubtedly a judgment of this kind will be welcomed by employees in this kind of organisation. It will have widespread implications.' The government had recently increased the pace of legislation bringing UK law into line with European directives, so lessening to some degree the difficulties posed to utilities by the ruling, Ms Tether pointed out. However, with new directives continuing to emerge from Europe, the issue would still be a 'moveable feast' for the courts, she said. The ruling followed an attempt by Unison, the public services union, to challenge redundancies planned by South West Water. Although Unison lost the bulk of its case, the judge, Mr Justice Blackburne, ruled that despite South West Water's status as a plc, it was an 'emanation of the state' because it provided a public service controlled by a state-appointed regulator. The judge said: 'The question is not whether the body in question is under the control of the state, but whether the public service in question is under the control of the state. 'The legal form of the body is irrelevant. The fact that the body is a commercial concern is also irrelevant. It is also irrelevant that the body does not carry out any of the traditional functions of the state and is not an agent of the state. It is irrelevant too that the state does not possess day-to-day control over the activities of the body.' British Gas and BT declined to comment on yesterday's ruling. South West Water has not indicated if it will appeal.</p>

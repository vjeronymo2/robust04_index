			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Turan Yavuz: "Conclude a Stand-By Agreement and </F> Get the Cash" --punctuation as published]    [Text] Washington--The possibility of a stand-by [previous  word in English] agreement between the IMF and Turkey during the  next few weeks has almost been agreed upon. Ambassador Volkan  Vural, adviser to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who has been  having preliminary contacts in Washington prior to the prime  minister's visit on Friday [14 April], ascertained IMF's  inclination on the matter during the talks he held with IMF  Deputy Chairman Russo yesterday. In addition to Volkan Vural,  Emre Gonensay, presidential adviser on economic matters; Necati  Ozfirat, under secretary of the Turkish Planning Organization;  and Bulent Ozgun, head of the Directorate of Foreign Trade, are  among the members of the Turkish delegation to the United States.    The question of Turkey's urgent need for new credits was the  focal point in the Turkish delegation's talks with the IMF and  World Bank officials. They mostly focused on the possibility of  new financial resources for Turkey. Russo informed the  delegation that the IMF is prepared to extend new credits to  Turkey, saying that the conclusion of a stand-by agreement  between the two sides will facilitate the credits.    Meanwhile, Thomas Wiens, one of the deputy chairmen of the  World Bank group in which Turkey is included, informed Volkan  Vural that a request by the Ciller government for new financial  resources can be considered within the framework of an agreement  between the World Bank and Turkey.    The officials in Washington are convinced that Ciller will  launch an initiative with the World Bank and the IMF on Friday  aimed at persuading them to extend new credits to Turkey. A  World Bank official, who prefered to remain anonymous, has  informed MILLIYET as follows: "Turkey has two options at the  present time. It will either find a short-term credit with high  interest, which I believe will be very difficult to get, or it  will conclude a stand-by agreement with the IMF and the World  Bank. That will enable Turkey to get a credit that can be  repaid without difficulty. There is no alternative."    It has been reported that Prime Minister Ciller will try to  secure a credit of $5 billion in New York and Washington.  However, it has been ascertained that a stand-by agreement  with, for example, the IMF, will only provide a credit of "$300  million or $400 million for Turkey.    Ambassador Vural and his delegation also held talks with  Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman, who is responsible  for European affairs. They discussed matters that concern the  relations between the two countries in general and tried to  establish the agenda of the meeting President Clinton will have  with Prime Minister Ciller probably on Friday. Drawing  attention to the economic situation in Turkey, Vural explained  the Ciller Government's "urgent need for financial resources"  and urged the Clinton administration to support Turkey.  Furthermore, Vural suggested that a certain amount of cash from  the Turkey-U.S. Defense Fund be transferred to Ankara without  being linked to any project. However, U.S. officials refrained  from responding favorably to his suggestion.    The Ciller government is very interested in the U.S.  Eximbank  Fund for $5 billion, which the Clinton administration disclosed  in December 1993. Although the existence of that fund has been  used as propaganda material in domestic politics in Turkey, a  U.S. official said: "The United States benefits from that fund  more than Turkey does. It is a fund that facilitates the sale  of U.S. products on a unilateral basis. That gives an  opportunity to U.S. businessmen to make profits."    Stephen Oxman responded to Vural's request for financial  resources as follows: "We want to help Ankara particularly at a  difficult time for Turkey. However, we are also in a difficult  situation. Meanwhile, we have to make recourse to the U.S.  Congress on such matters. The congressmen will immediately  respond by raising the question of human rights, the Cyprus  issue, and the Kurdish problem. Securing approval for cash aid  or financial resources for Turkey will be easier if progress is  made on those matters."    The chilly approach the Clinton administration, the IMF, and  the World Bank have adopted on Turkey's request for financial  aid, particularly IMF's insistence on a stand-by agreement, has  undermined the chances of Ciller's visit to the United States  being successful.</p>

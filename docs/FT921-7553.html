			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / MoD to ground cheque flights EVERY MONTH a group of companies hires a helicopter to collect contract payments from the Ministry of Defence in Liverpool and fly them to London. Among the quaint practices that have become part of British military tradition, the 'helicopter club' is among the least known. Its existence is revealed in a report today by the National Audit Office, which monitors how public funds are used. But the practice is set to disappear when the MoD introduces automatic payment transfers, due in April. The ministry has been chewing over this change for eight years. Meanwhile, contractors such as GEC-Marconi and Westland have organised the helicopter run to collect payable orders from the MoD's Directorate of Accounts (Bills) in Liverpool, rather than wait for the post. Under current practice, the companies present bills to the MoD every fourth Monday. Payable orders are available for large contractors at 11.30am on Friday, and for other suppliers the next Monday. Using the mail would mean companies waiting until Wednesday or Thursday for the funds to be cleared. Leading contractors yesterday confirmed the arrangement - one acts on behalf of the others to pick up payable orders often worth tens of millions of pounds. The round-trip, usually by twin-engined helicopter, might cost between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 5,000, and the cost can be more than covered by earnings on overnight money markets. The NAO found that the MoD overpaid contractors by Pounds 166m in 1989-90. The money was subsequently recovered, but on average five months later. Half the mistakes were because of amendments made after companies had taken their payments, and in one in four cases there were errors in the bills sent by contractors.

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: FLY ME TO THE MOON -- FOR A NOSTALGIC LOOK  </P> <P> Elections come and go, but junkets are forever.  </P> <P> Image-wise, these have not been good times for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his  Unification Church.  </P> <P> Those pictures of mass weddings of Moonies in South Korea are a trifle spooky.  That 13-month federal prison sentence Moon served for tax evasion was a nasty  bit of business. And, late last year, bishops of the United Methodist Church in  South Korea complained that Moon's international conferences are nothing but  Christian-bashing sessions.  </P> <P> One group, however, is dedicated to repairing Moon's tattered persona in the  United States: the Washington-based American Freedom Coalition.  </P> <P> The coalition's president is the Rev. Robert Grant, founder of the Christian  Voice political action committee. Its director is Richard Ichord, former  Republican congressman (1960-81) from Missouri and the last chairman of the  now-defunct House Un-American Activities Committee.  </P> <P> Grant wrote in the Washington Post that the coalition has received $5.2 million  from "business interests of the Unification Church" since it was founded in  1987.  </P> <P> Grant took to the op-ed page to answer allegations by a former employee that  the coalition is nothing but a front group to help Moon spread his cultish  ministry. Nonsense, Grant said. The coalition is interested solely in  "promoting traditional American values."  </P> <P> Now, however, the coalition is organizing a junket to South Korea for a dozen  or more former members of Congress and their spouses.  </P> <P> The highlight of the weeklong trip is to attend one of Moon's international  conferences. Departure is Jan. 30; expenses are being paid by the AFC and the  Unification Church.  </P> <P> Among those in the traveling party: former San Diego County Congressmen Lionel  Van Deerlin and Bob Wilson and their wives.  </P> <P> Wilson, a fellow Republican who served with Ichord on the Armed Services  Committee, is also a board member of American Freedom Coalition, a paid  position.  </P> <P> Wilson represented San Diego from 1952 to 1980 and is now a Washington lobbyist  and director of Air/Space America in San Diego. He did not respond to repeated  phone calls over three days.  </P> <P> Van Deerlin, a Democrat who represented the South Bay from 1962 to 1980, said  he views the trip merely as a free way to visit places he hasn't seen in  decades, including Panmunjon, where American troops are stationed.  </P> <P> He said that, if Ichord and the coalition are looking for someone to influence  public opinion in favor of Moon, "I'm not much of a catch."  </P> <P> "I've been around the block a few times, you know," Van Deerlin said. "You  don't grow up in politics in San Diego County without being able to defend  yourself in all company. I don't think I'm going to be wooed and won over by  anything I see or hear."  </P> <P> </P> <P> They're Playing His Song  </P> <P> Something for everyone.  </P> <P> * The space shuttle Columbia retrieved 12.5 million tomato seeds that had been  in an orbiting satellite for six years, to test the effects of weightlessness  and cosmic radiation.  </P> <P> The seeds will be distributed to students around the country, who will report  back to NASA on how the plants fare, as part of SEEDS (Space-Exposed Experiment  Developed for Students).  </P> <P> While hauling in the satellite, the astronauts played the theme song from  "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," the cult classic by Steve Peace, movie maker  and assemblyman from Chula Vista.  </P> <P> * It could be hot today when a San Diego City Council committee considers the  proposed Human Dignity Ordinance to ban discrimination against homosexuals.  </P> <P> Expect strong support from gay leaders and equally strong opposition from the  religious right and Young Americans for Freedom. Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T.  Maher also opposes the ordinance.  </P> <P> A majority of council members like the proposal: Bernhardt, Filner, Hartley,  Pratt and Wolfsheimer.  </P> <P> Henderson and O'Connor oppose it as an unneeded duplication of existing civil  rights laws; McCarty and Roberts are undecided.  </P> <P> If it passes, Christian groups are vowing a referendum to repeal it.  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / German mining rights approved AN Anglo-American energy consortium is on course to complete one of the largest, single investments in eastern Germany after Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, said he would grant it mining rights, writes Judy Dempsey in Dresden. The decision to grant the rights for Schleenhain, one of the brown coal fields the consortium is buying, clears the way for an investment of more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) in eastern Germany. It also means eastern Germany's highly regulated energy sector will be prised open. The consortium - comprising PowerGen, the UK-based utilities company, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho - is buying a 44 per cent stake, or the equivalent of 400MW capacity, in a power generating plant at Schkopau, near Halle in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is also buying the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, lignite fields straddling the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.</p>

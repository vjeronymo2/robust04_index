			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Markets: Breaking the bear's chains - Global Investor The first quarter results season begins in the US in a few weeks' time, and Wall Street is expecting strong earnings gains. Could this be a trigger for US stock markets to decouple from the bearish influence of the bond market of the past two months? Ever since the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on February 4, and sent the fixed income market diving, US equity markets have taken their general direction in large measure from the jittery bond market. That said, a remarkable feature of the turmoil in global markets since February 4 has been the relative stability of US equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen little more than 4 per cent from its all-time high, reached at the end of January, compared to a decline of about 6 per cent in Treasury bond values since the Fed tightened; the Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation stocks has outperformed the wider market, hitting several new highs this month. There is no small irony in this, since Fed tightening was widely expected to blow a lot of froth off equity markets, while reassuring the fixed income segment that the bank had inflation firmly under control. But the big equity market corrections have been outside the US  - mainly in emerging markets - as American investors' enthusiasm for foreign parts has cooled, and the resulting repatriation of funds may have helped stabilise US equities. The US equity markets even took in their stride last week's unsettling combination of a second tightening by the Fed; the first rise in the prime lending rate in four years; a flurry of fresh political posturing in the Whitewater affair and the assassination of the front-runner to be the next leader of Mexico. That said, Friday afternoon's drop in the long bond through 7 per cent did sent the Dow down sharply. Stocks may be, as some Wall Street analysts maintain, only halfway towards a post-tightening correction of roughly 10 per cent, yet the market's behaviour over the past few weeks suggests considerable resilience, and potential for recovery, when stocks complete their current adjustment from a world where their primary fuel is falling interest rates to one where earnings are the driving force. Wall Street is expecting solid double digit earnings increases both this year and in 1995 as the economy expands rapidly and companies benefit in productivity gains from the restructurings of the past few years. Stocks would certainly benefit from a recovery of the bond market's nerve, but the rally in Treasuries which followed last week's Fed tightening has now been replaced by anxiety about the bank's next turn of the interest rate screw, which could come on or about May 17, the date of the next policy-making Open Markets Committee meeting. Certainly, its hard to see Treasuries making much progress ahead of the employment figures for February, due out on Good Friday, though thereafter a reassessment of economic fundamentals could help it claw back some of its recent losses. While history is no sure guide to the markets, the behaviour of stocks and bonds following the 10 initial Fed tightening moves which have occured over the past 30 years throws up some interesting statistics. An analysis by Elizabeth Mackay at Bear Stearns shows that six months after the tightening the S&amp;P 500 index was on average 1.2 per cent higher and a year later it was 6.1 per cent higher. However, those averages hide some large disparities: for example, a year after the March 1981 tightening the S&amp;P was down 16.8 per cent, while it was up by a similar amount following the February 1988 action. And on three occasions these rallies ended in bull market peaks: 1972, 1981 and 1987. In other words, post tightening rallies can end nastily. European bonds Could the next few weeks finally bring about the much predicted decoupling of European long bond prices from US Treasuries? European markets followed the US into a sharp decline following the Fed's February 4 tightening, much to the surprise of many analysts and hedge fund managers, and they have yet to rally, even though the economic fundamentals on the two sides of the Atlantic remain very different. With main continental economies still in recession, the trend is still to easier money, but the fixed income markets are still waiting for a strong lead from the Bundesbank, which has been edging rates down at a snail's pace. Last week the Bundesbank cut the key repurchase rate by 8 basis points, taking its month-long reduction to 20 basis points, and Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets reckons that is consistent with a 25 basis point cut in the discount rate and 50 basis points off the Lombard rate at the bank's April 28 meeting, provided the cost of living inflation figures for the month comes in at less than 3 per cent. Hong Kong Hong Kong has suffered one of the greatest drops of any leading equity market since the Fed tightened. But with the Crown colony in the middle of a reporting season producing strong results, has the correction run its course? The market, in common with others in south-east Asia, enjoyed a wonderful run in 1993 as US investors focused more clearly on the region's rapid growth; but a combination of growing political tension between the US and China, and the Fed's tightening, has sent Hong Kong into sharp reverse. Fed tightening matters partly because it has discouraged a flow of US funds into emerging markets and partly because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US currency, so US rate rises feed through into the local market. On Friday, Hong Kong banks began tightening, with a 0.25 per cent rise in their base rates. The bull case for Hong Kong is that at current levels the market is good value, compared to most other leading equity centres. Earnings are expected to grow 15 per cent or higher this year, on the back of similar increases for the past few years, and the market's prospective p/e ratio is about 15 to 16 for 1994, falling to 13 to 14 next year. The market also remains the easiest way to place a bet on the extraordinary spurt of growth transforming mainland China. Against that, however, are several large negatives. The Hong Kong property market - a particularly large component of the Hang Seng Index - is overvalued, and could be vulnerable to a continued rise in long US rates, though for the moment Hong Kong rates remain negative in real terms. The political and economic climate in China is also casting a long shadow. The market has learned to shrug off the dispute between the British Governor and Beijing over democratic reforms in the colony, assuming that when China takes control in 1997 it will not want to destabilise such an important economic asset. However, This year's round of annual brinkmanship between the US and China over American demands for human rights concessions by Beijing, in exchange for renewal of most favoured nation trading status, has been particularly bruising. And while most analysts expect a comprise to be reached - the US needs China's good offices in the nuclear weapons confrontation with North Korea - there remains the possibility that one side or the other could make a serious misjudgement. David Roche, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, reckons that failure to sign a deal could cut Hong Kong's GDP growth this year from the forecast 5 per cent to 3 per cent. Also weighing on the market are domestic Chinese issues. Deng Xiaoping, China's leader since 1979 and the guiding hand behind its pragmatic economic expansion, is 89 and on a recent appearance looked extremely frail. His death could provoke a power struggle or weaken central government control. At the same time, it is far from certain that the government can succeed with its policy of slowing growth (from 13 per cent last year to 9 per cent this year) and reining in inflation, without a hard landing which would also hit Hong Kong's growth. Over the long term, the Chinese market holds immense potential, but with the current economic cycle looking long in the tooth, and international investors wary, it is hard to see what is going to re-ignite the Hong Kong market in the near term, though any decline through 7,500 would present a good buying opportunity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 24/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     % change over period                         US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week                0.06    0.04     0.10     0.12    0.15   0.10   Month               0.29    0.19     0.51     0.53    0.68   0.43   Year                3.44    3.28     6.88     8.69   11.06   5.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week               -0.46   -0.06    -0.55    -0.70   -0.57  -1.00   Month              -1.47   -0.87    -0.67    -0.86   -0.97  -2.10   Year                2.59    5.43     7.53    10.83   20.34   6.42  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week               -1.08   -0.09    -1.38    -1.83   -1.33  -2.53   Month              -2.80   -1.77    -1.88    -2.69   -2.54  -4.88   Year                2.27    5.35     7.29    11.91   27.18   6.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week                -1.2    -2.1     -0.1     -3.9    -2.6   -3.8   Month                0.3     0.3      2.7     -2.7     2.1   -3.9   Year                 6.4    16.3     29.7     18.3    42.5   15.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES                       IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  24/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change                                          Close   Week   Month    Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deelkraal Gold (SA)                       8.00   17.6    16.8   113.3 TV Broadcasts (HK)                       33.25   17.5    18.8   104.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranger Oil (Canada)                       8.50   17.2    25.9    54.5 Freestate (SA)                           72.00   16.1    16.6    98.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Randfontein Est.( SA)                     50.50   16.1    30.3   201.5 Driefontein Gold (SA)                    59.85   16.0    19.7    57.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Southvaal Hldg (SA)                     163.00   15.6    45.5   156.7 Guoco Group (HK)                         37.25   15.5     3.5   104.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Femsa B (Mexico)                           na  14.6   -11.0    64.5 HK Aircraft (HK)                         44.50   14.1    -6.3    54.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Leading Article: A shot across the EC's bows TOWARDS THE end of Europe's annus horribilis, Switzerland has sent its own small shaft into the battered edifice of European integration. Yesterday's Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area and, by implication, the European Community was neither unexpected, nor a disaster. The longer term effects on Switzerland are likely, however, to be negative. Beyond its frontiers, the No will delay the establishment of the free-trade area between the EC and the European Free Trade Association, which was due to have started in January. The vote delivers another jolt to EC leaders as they confront the larger conundrum: the future of the Maastricht treaty after its rejection by another small country, Denmark. Switzerland's history of neutrality and its direct democracy make it a special case. But the vote is a further example of the volatility of electorates. As in Denmark, the Yes campaign was supported by the country's political and business establishment. Yet the people trusted their instincts more than their leaders. The Swiss government believed the domestic recession, coupled with political changes across Europe, would make voters less resistant to diluting independence. Instead, disarray within and outside their borders may have made the electorate more sceptical about abandoning their formula for wealth and stability. The electorate was not ready to support the Berne policy of making the EEA a waiting room for EC membership. The Efta-EC link would have drawn Switzerland - with the exemption of agriculture - fully into Europe's single market. It would have dismantled some cartels, without allowing the country a part in formulating the EC laws to which it would be subject. Further ahead, Community membership would have integrated the Swiss into the Community's political and monetary union. It would be regrettable if the electorate's vote against integration added to misgivings elsewhere in Efta about joining the European mainstream. Yet the EEA can exist without Switzerland. If, through the single market, economic integration continues, more Swiss companies may transfer manufacturing capacity abroad. In view of the sharp split yesterday between French- and German-speaking Switzerland, the larger question centres on the future of the country's own political system. When Europe was split into two blocs, Switzerland gave the appearance of a model of democracy. Now that the cold war has ended, the erstwhile paradigm may itself be weakened by linguistic division. Switzerland is strong enough to weather the short-term economic consequences of the vote. Restoring Swiss consensus may be more difficult. As Switzerland ponders this loss of consensus, the rest of Europe must face up to the problems caused by the EC's failure so far to reconcile nationalist aspirations with the political structures needed for effective co-operation.</p>

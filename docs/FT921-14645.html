			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Poor response for Cluff rights issue Cluff Resources has failed to find many takers for its Pounds 8.4m, 11-for-20 rights issue. More than 60 per cent was left with sub-underwriters. Kleinwort Benson Securities, Cluff's advisers, said acceptances had been received in respect of 9.7m new ordinary shares, representing 37.8 per cent of the total offered to shareholders at 34p each. Last night the shares closed 1p up at 32p. Hutchison Group, which owns 24.6 per cent of Cluff, had irrevocably undertaken to take up its entitlement, suggesting shareholders took only 13.2 per cent. The cash raised will be used to develop a new gold mine in Ghana, which the company said was another step in its transformation into an old-style mining finance house focusing on Africa and gold. At present its income comes from gold mines in Zimbabwe.</p>

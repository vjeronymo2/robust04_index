			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our commander in chief, Comrade Fidel Castro,  presided over the plenum of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]  national committee, which for 10 hours discussed the Parliaments  in the Workplace held throughout Cuba. Fidel pointed out the  need to implement measures on the topics discussed and called  the report presented at the meeting by CTC Secretary General  Pedro Ross Leal very useful and extensive.    If we do not achieve economic efficiency, there can be no  cleanup of the nation's finances; and if there is no  streamlining of the finances, we will not achieve economic  efficiency, Fidel said, linking these two basic ideas as two  parts of a single whole.    Castro pointed out that the first decision, to take the  subject of the economy extensively into the bosom of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], was a  positive one. Castro pointed out that the second important step  was to hold these meetings in the workplaces, so that we would  all have a precise awareness of what is being examined.    Fidel said this was a courageous decision on the part of the  Cuban Revolution, because the country is currently in very  difficult circumstances; he noted that in other countries this  kind of thing is sometimes not discussed even in the  legislatures, among a nation's deputies. Instead, such decisions  are made by the government and the measures are out on the  street the next day, with different results.    Fidel said: The results of these discussions are very good,  in our case, very positive; and this is a colossal experience  which puts us in a position to make everything we do turn out  much better. Fidel Castro reiterated that the plenum's report  was objective and at the same time optimistic, and that the  process has yielded positive results with a high degree of  efficiency and awareness.    The Cuban president said we have been subjected to difficult  trials, tremendous tests from day one and have confronted them  with dignity, courage, and patriotism. He pointed out that  little by little, small advances are being made; now the task is  to surmount the problems, always keeping in mind that we are not  going to exit the special period overnight but rather, to the  extent that we are capable of organizing everything, by working  and applying measures that are correct in a difficult world.    The commander in chief said: The last harvest was a  difficult  one. The drop in production was really brutal. Just figure what  kind of situation we were in, what the situation was for all of  us who had to confront all this alongside the Cuban people,  amidst a harvest without fuel, without tires, without spare  parts. That is why I say that, during this harvest, we must  effect cane recovery -- and the recovery, too, of the grinding  and the yields. That is the reason that, during this harvest,  which is still going on, the workers movement should not drop  its guard: not in the tobacco harvest, nor the potato harvest,  nor the sugar harvest, said Fidel.    Fidel pointed out that all of this is being done amidst the  blockade by the United States but that a meeting like this is  very stimulating, to study now the necessary measures and which  the workers have discussed, measures that have been made public  through all the media and of which the people are aware.    Fidel reminded the group that certain measures might not be  popular, but that there is an awareness of this just as there is  of decriminalization of the dollar -- a measure that was taken  with full knowledge of its consequences but which was necessary,  even though the inequalities that have arisen hurt us, and a  measure about which Fidel himself has spoken publicly on other  occasions,.    Fidel pointed out: In the last analysis, the economic  cleanup  is not the most important thing. Rather, the most important  thing is the awareness that has been achieved, to date, about  these problems the nation is facing. The measures will be  discussed at the ANPP, and the ANPP will make the pertinent  recommendations to the government, which, in the last analysis,  is the body that has to apply them at the proper time.    Castro pointed out the need for the deputies to have all the  pertinent information, the most important aspects of what has  been discussed in the Parliaments in the Workplace, because  everything must be studied carefully, reflected upon carefully.  There were numerous speeches made during the plenum by the  members of the CTC's national committee, union leaders, and  certain ministers and other government officials.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Demonstrators demand return of Union: Communists take to streets of Moscow on Armed Forces Day ABOUT 5,000 communist demonstrators yesterday seized upon the former Red Army's traditional holiday to attack the Russian leadership and demand the restoration of a country and parliament which no longer exist. Bearing pictures of Lenin and Stalin and placards saying 'Peoples of the USSR Unite' and 'Hurray to the Soviet Army', the crowd tried to push its way through police barriers to march on the Kremlin. The aim was ostensibly to pay homage to the armed forces at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the foot of the Kremlin walls. Armed Forces Day has been renamed, dropping the word 'Soviet'. Yesterday, it provided an opportunity for supporters of the outlawed Communist party - mostly pensioners, officials and professionals, with a few token officers - to vent their anger at the collapse of the Soviet Union and harsh market reforms. 'Our government are traitors,' complained Ms Elena Dvortsova, a retired Communist chemical worker. 'They've betrayed the workers. They've turned our savings into nothing. They've sold out to the Americans and they got rid of the Soviet parliament in just one day. If this is democracy, we don't want it.' 'The democrats are surrounding us like the Germans at Stalingrad,' was how a retired engineer described the city authorities' decision to forbid demonstrators to proceed to Manezh Square. 'We'll get through next time,' shouted another old age pensioner, explaining that a similar demonstration would be held on March 15 to back demands for the reconvening of the Soviet parliament. Also present were the predictable communist-nationalist duo of Colonel Viktor Alksnis, a former co-chairman of the hardline Soyuz (Union) faction in the Soviet parliament, and Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose so-called Liberal-Democratic Party wants to reconstitute the Soviet empire. President Boris Yeltsin, who laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier and watched a march-past of soldiers carrying the Russian flag, may have taken comfort from the relatively small size and marginal nature of the demonstration. Although there were a few violent scuffles when demonstrators tried to break through a line of baton-wielding police backed by a line of trucks, there were no serious injuries. It also provided a low-key parallel to last March, when President Mikhail Gorbachev tried to ban a much larger demonstration in support of Mr Yeltsin. Nonetheless, it was no coincidence that the Armed Forces holiday has been preceded by a series of statements by President Yeltsin and Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth commander-in-chief, trying to combat the discontent in the armed forces. President Yeltsin on Thursday issued a decree raising officers' minimum pay to Rbs1,800 a month, and promising measures to deal with the military's acute housing shortages. His government has also publicised plans to expand arms sales abroad - to help finance increased spending on the army's welfare and the conversion of military factories to civilian output. Marshal Shaposhnikov, meanwhile, has cautioned against haste by republics seeking to imitate Ukraine in establishing their own army. In a weekend newspaper interview, he said Azerbaijan should not create its own army until it had resolved the conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh by political means.</p>

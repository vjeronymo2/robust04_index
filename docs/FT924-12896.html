			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Monthly retail sales show slight rise on a year ago RETAIL sales in September were slightly better than a year ago, marking the first year-on-year increase since May, according to the distributive trades survey published today by the Confederation of British Industry. Sales rose in spite of high unemployment and debt levels, which have hit consumer confidence and spending power. Retailers, however, fear that September's rise will be reversed this month, according to the CBI survey, which was carried out before the recent announcement of mining redundancies. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the September rise 'is clearly good news, but it is difficult for retailers to judge which way things will move in the months ahead'. Government figures for September retail sales, to be published on Wednesday, are expected to confirm the small year- on-year rise. According to MMS International, a financial information company, the median of City expectations is that they will show a 0.7 per cent rise compared to September 1991, but a 0.3 per cent fall on August. According to the CBI report, the September increase was driven by sales of clothing, furniture and confectionery, partly offset by sharp falls in sales by chemists, household goods and off-licences. Volumes were considered poor for the time of year throughout most of retailing. The London economy has deteriorated further, according to the latest Quarterly Economic Trends survey published today by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Conducted after Black Wednesday, September 16, when the pound left the European exchange rate mechanism, the survey says that 'expectations for turnover and profitability for the year ahead are significantly less optimistic than at any time during the past 15 months'.

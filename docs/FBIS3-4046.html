			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xien Zuan (6200 9449): "Guangdong Runs Short </F> of 10 Billion Jin of Grain a Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At the  meeting of the Guangdong delegation to discuss the government  work report and the planning and budget reports, State Councilor  Chen Junsheng aired his views on the grain issue. He pointed  out: Although China hit a record high in increased grain output  in 1993, strains on grain still could be seen in some  localities. For example, Guangdong is still short of 10 billion  jin of grain a year. In the days to come, the province must  strive to raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain.    Chen Junsheng remarked: The imbalance in the regional grain  supply remains a problem. Take Guangdong for example, its  current grain output is 30 billion jin or so but its grain  demand is some 40 billion jin, or it is short of 10 billion jin  a year. It has to buy grain from outside the province. He  maintained: Guangdong must feed some 10 million people coming  from other parts of the country. In doing so, it should not just  rely on buying grain from other provinces.    Chen Junsheng stated: Guangdong has provided the country as  a whole with useful experience in reform and opening up to the  outside world. Its township and town enterprises have developed  rapidly. The increased peasant income is achieved mainly by  developing township and town enterprises. However, on the grain  issue, Guangdong must work really hard to ensure the area of  land sown to grain, increase grain output, and give  consideration to social benefit rather than put exclusive stress  on economic results. In a word, the province must strive to  raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain.</p>

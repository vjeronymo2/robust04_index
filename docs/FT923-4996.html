			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Canadian bank hit by O&amp;Y loans ROYAL BANK of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, suffered a 57 per cent plunge in third-quarter income largely due to further write-downs on its loans to ailing property developer Olympia &amp; York. RBC has classified its entire CDollars 766m (USDollars 643.6m) exposure to O&amp;Y as non-performing. The company said yesterday a significant, but not the entire, amount would be written off as a charge against income. More than a third of RBC's exposure is in the form of participation in a jumbo loan secured by O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi-Price, newsprint maker, and Gulf Canada Resources, energy producer. The O&amp;Y losses have been partly instrumental in Royal more than doubling its estimate of specific loan losses for fiscal 1992 to CDollars 1.45bn, from CDollars 705m last year. The company said the rest of the increase was due mainly to difficulties at Central Capital, a troubled Canadian financial institution, and to other real estate borrowers in the Toronto area. Recoveries of earlier provisions for Third World loans would however, reduce the losses charged against income to CDollars 1.15bn for 1992, versus CDollars 605m last year. Net earnings slid to CDollars 112.4m, or 26 cents a share, in the three months to July 31, from CDollars 261.3m, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions for the quarter soared to CDollars 390m from CDollars 155m, but were partly offset by wider domestic interest rate margins and by a strong contribution from RBC Dominion Securities, the bank's securities dealer subsidiary. Dominion Securities earned almost CDollars 25m in the third quarter. The return on equity tumbled to 5 per cent from 16.1 per cent, and return on assets was down to 0.33 per cent from 0.80 per cent. Total assets stood at CDollars 139.5bn on July 31, up from CDollars 130.2bn a year earlier. Total non-performing loans, excluding Third World debt, have jumped in the past year to CDollars 2.85bn from CDollars 1.79bn. In spite of its loan problems, RBC maintains a strong capital position. Its ratio of total capital to assets was 9.5 per cent on July 31, or 10.3 per cent if measured by US regulatory definitions.</p>

Provocative fire was again opened with infantry arms. One  member of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was wounded near  Plocari in the Fojnica commune.    In the Bakovicaka Ciptonja region, the fighters of the HVO  used incendiary ammunition and set ablaze the forest close to  our defense lines.    Members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] can confirm what  the situation on the ground is. As the Information Service of  the 1st Army Corps reports, our units are observing the  cease-fire agreement.</p>

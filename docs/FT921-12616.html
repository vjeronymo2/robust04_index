			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees more profit-taking in construction sector THERE WAS some response in Europe to Wall Street's intermittent attempts at a recovery yesterday morning, but in general the tone was muted, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT registered a brief uptick on London talk of a steel pay settlement but the metalworkers' union, IG Metall, soon gave the lie to this story. The FAX and DAX indices fell 3.30 to 677.53 and 4.80 to 1,664.77, each down a fraction on the week. Volume xxxx from DM6.2bn to DMxxxbn. The talk was still of gentle consolidation, but there were areas in which the change in sentiment was more sharply defined. Construction stocks, which had performed 'astonishingly well' since Christmas, according to Mr Urs Waldvogel of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, fell for the third day in succession. Bilfinger &amp; Berger dropped DM19 to DM931 for a three-day loss of DM39, Hochtief by DM13 to DM1,150 for DM41 and Philipp Holzmann by DM22 to DM1,148 for DM36. At the same time, the building materials company, Heidelberger Zement, leapt by DM37.50 to DM940. Mr Waldvogel said that the constructions had combined very good output figures with the latest fashion for cyclical stocks, and now offered opportunities for profit-taking. Heidelberger Zement had been left behind, had cheaper earnings, US recovery potential and no need to finance east German acquisitions. Other share price recovery stories lost some of their recent gains, Asko falling DM15.50 to DM640.50 and Degussa by DM7 to DM329.50. Meanwhile, some former laggards continued to improve, with AEG rising DM3.20 to DM216.50 and Linotype by DM8.80 to DM347.80. PARIS overcame an early bout of selling linked to the liquidation of the January account yesterday to finish just below the day's highs. The CAC 40 index rose 11.23 to 1,849.92, but was down 0.5 per cent on the week. Turnover eased to about FFr2.2bn from FFr2.4bn. The building materials sector saw some volatility. Lafarge dropped FFr8.80 or 2.6 per cent to FFr329.90 in 113,640 shares following much worse than expected 1991 results from its US subsidiary. Lafarge Corp suffered a particularly bad fourth quarter loss and said that it saw no signs of any pick-up in the North American markets. Ciments Francais made the day's biggest gain, of 8.5 per cent, or FFr22 to FFr281 and Poliet jumped FFr28.90 or 6.7 per cent to FFr460 but both rises came in thin volume. Elsewhere, LVMH added FFr50 to FFr4,340 on the back of its good 1991 turnover figures, while Saint-Gobain eased 10 centimes to FFr494 on its 1991 profits. MILAN closed little changed, with turnover estimated at below Thursday's L134bn. The Comit index rose 0.83 to 549.10, steady on the week. The insurance sector continued to attract attention as shares in La Fondiaria subsidiaries were readmitted after Thursday's suspension. News of La Fondiaria's restructuring of its subsidiaries did not have much impact. La Fondiaria fell L200 to L38,500, while Ausonia eased L56 to L834, Latina fell L230 to L7,800 lire and La Previdente firmed L50 to L18,570. In the same sector Generali, rose L150 to L31,200. ZURICH, moderately active, ended slightly higher after Wall Street's opening. The all-share SPI index closed 1.5 higher at 1,114.0, up 0.9 per cent on the week. BRUSSELS closed mixed to lower in moderate trading as the market consolidated Thursday's gains. The Bel20 index fell 5.42 to 1,178.21, up 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover worth BFr1.4bn. The market leader, Petrofina, eased BFr25 to BFr10,850 on heavy volume of 26,880 shares. But the retailer GIB was one of the few blue chip shares to buck the trend, closing up BFr22 or 1.7 per cent at BFr1,350 in heavy volume of 161,200 shares. STOCKHOLM had its ups and downs although the Affarsvarlden General index closed only 0.6 lower at 984.7, up 0.3 per cent on the week. The ups included a SKr15 recovery to SKr560 in Astra A on Aids treatment hopes for the group's Foscavir drug. Among insurers, however, Skandia fell SKr3 to SKr157 after Thursday's meeting of the heads of four major Nordic insurers, at which talks on the creation of a pan-Nordic insurance group seem to have faltered. OSLO closed marginally lower, the all-share index dipping 0.35 to 443.43, down 4.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at NKr301.2m. Norsk Hydro, which shed NKr12.5 on Thursday on news of a special charge in the fourth quarter, recovered NKr1 to NKr145.5. COPENHAGEN ended mixed, though Danisco recovered another DKr10 to DKr835 on heavy turnover of 119,000 shares. The index edged up 0.25 to 360.96 but was little changed on the week. ISTANBUL leapt more than 3 per cent on speculation that the Social Democrat Party's congress this weekend will not lead to political unrest. The 75-share index ended at 5,022.60, up 148.84 on the day and little changed on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 24  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am     11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1128.50  1128.54   1130.38  1130.14  1130.57  1131.04  1132.83  1131.86  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1133.25    Day's Low  1128.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 23      Jan 22      Jan 21      Jan 20       Jan 17 1131.98     1134.07     1136.99     1135.91      1135.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

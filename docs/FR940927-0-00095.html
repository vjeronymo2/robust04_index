VOCs and NOx are precursors of ozone in the lower atmosphere, which is a primary component of smog. A more detailed summary of these requirements, including the relevant statutory provisions can be found in the General Preamble to title I of the Act (57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific requirements that New Jersey must meet vary by area, depending upon the severity of the ozone problem. Eighteen of the twenty one counties in New Jersey are designated as severe nonattainment for ozone. Of the remaining three counties, Atlantic and Cape May Counties are designated as moderate nonattainment for ozone and Warren County is designated as marginal nonattainment for ozone. In addition, section 184(a) of the Act recognizes that ozone is a regional problem by designating all of New Jersey as part of an ozone transport region. Since most of New Jersey is designated as severe nonattainment for ozone, and all of New Jersey is part of an ozone transport region, New Jersey has chosen to implement statewide all of the control requirements that are addressed in this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> State Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted to EPA a request to revise its SIP for ozone. This submittal had undergone public hearings on October 27, October 29 and November 5, 1992. While New Jersey did address additional requirements in its November 15, 1992 submittal, the only requirement that EPA is addressing in this action is the requirement to adopt RACT regulations for all source types for which EPA has developed CTGs. EPA will take action on the other submittals that New Jersey made in other  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to determine if a state's SIP submittal is complete within sixty days of submittal but not later than six months later than that date. If EPA does not notify a state of the completeness of a submittal within six months of receipt it is automatically deemed complete. The criteria that EPA uses to determine completeness are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. On April 20, 1993, EPA sent New Jersey a letter informing it that its November 15, 1992 submittal was not complete because it did not contain a compilation of the public comments and the State's responses to those comments. On May 14, 1993, New Jersey submitted a compilation of public comments and the State's responses to these comments. These public comments did not result in any substantive changes to New Jersey's submittal. Most of the comments involved portions of the SIP which New Jersey is still developing and will be better addressed as part of those SIP submittals. On June 10, 1993, EPA wrote to New Jersey and informed them that EPA had reviewed its May 14, 1993 submittal and was finding New Jersey's submittal complete insofar as it contained adopted RACT regulations for all source types for which EPA has developed CTGs. The following summarizes EPA's evaluation of New Jersey's submittal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act sets forth two separate provisions requiring states to promulgate VOC RACT rules in ozone nonattainment areas. RACT is defined as the lowest emission that a particular source is capable of meeting with the application of control technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first provision, referred to as RACT fix-up, requires the correction of RACT rules for which EPA identified deficiencies before the Act was amended in 1990. Under the pre-amended Clean Air Act, ozone nonattainment areas were required to adopt RACT rules for sources of VOC emissions. EPA issued three sets of CTG documents, establishing a ``presumptive norm'' for RACT for various categories of VOC sources. The three sets of CTGs were (1) Group I_issued before January 1978 (15 CTGs); (2) Group II_issued in 1978 (9 CTGs); and (3) Group III_issued in the early 1980's (5 CTGs). Those sources not covered by a CTG were called non-CTG sources. Under section 172(a)(1), ozone nonattainment areas were generally required to attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. Those areas that submitted an attainment demonstration projecting attainment by that date were required to adopt RACT for sources covered by the Group I and II CTGs. Areas, such as New Jersey, that sought an extension of the attainment date under section 172(a)(2) to as late as December 31, 1987 were required to adopt RACT for all CTG sources and for all major (i.e., 100 ton per year or more of VOC emissions) non-CTG sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the mid and late 1980's, EPA issued SIP Calls, notifying numerous states that they contained nonattainment areas that had failed to attain the ozone standard. In the SIP Calls, EPA required states to correct deficiencies in their existing RACT rules and to adopt rules that were required but not yet adopted. Under the amended Act, section 182(a)(2)(A) requires states to correct these RACT rules by May 15, 1991. New Jersey submitted its RACT fix-up rules to EPA on March 13, 1992, which EPA approved on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 17933). Thus New Jersey has met the RACT fix up requirement and no further action needs to be taken with respect to this requirement in today's action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second provision, set forth in section 182(b)(2) applies to moderate (and above) ozone nonattainment areas. The goal of this provision is to ensure that areas, that were not required previously to adopt RACT for some or all of the CTGs or for major stationary sources not covered by a CTG, adopt rules and ``catch-up'' to those areas previously subject to more stringent RACT requirements. In addition, the RACT catch-up provision requires those areas for which the major source definition has been lowered to adopt RACT for those sources now covered by the more stringent major stationary source definition. Section 182(b)(2) sets forth three requirements for the purpose of achieving those goals. First 182(b)(2) requires states to adopt RACT for sources subject to pre-enactment CTGs. Next, this provision requires states to adopt RACT for all sources subject to any new CTGs issued after enactment of the Amendments. Finally, section 182(b)(2) requires RACT for all major stationary sources not subject to a CTG. Section 182(b)(2) requires these rules to be submitted to EPA by November 15, 1992. Moreover, under section 185, all areas in the Ozone Transport Region, which includes all of New Jersey are subject to this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey has met the RACT requirement as it applies to sources for which there was a pre-enactment CTG. New Jersey has adopted rules for all but three of the pre-enactment CTGs and incorporated them into Subchapter 16, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollutants by Volatile Organic Compounds.'' The three CTG source categories for which New Jersey has not incorporated specific control requirements into Subchapter 16 are: rubber tire manufacturing; high density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene resin manufacturing and air oxidation processes in synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry facilities. In its 1982 SIP for the Attainment and Maintenance of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standards, New Jersey declared that it had no rubber tire manufacturing facilities. EPA approved this declaration on November 9, 1983. New Jersey reaffirmed this declaration in its November 15, 1992 submittal. New Jersey submitted on March 31, 1987, and supplemented on May 4, 1991, an equivalency demonstration which showed that high density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene resin processes would be regulated under general provisions contained in both Subchapter 8 and Subchapter 16. An equivalency demonstration must show that the state rules applicable to the source category result in emissions within five percent of the emissions that would result from the control requirements recommended by the CTG. EPA approved this demonstration on October 9, 1991. On November 21, 1989, New Jersey submitted an equivalency demonstration showing that air oxidation processes at synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry facilities would be regulated under general provisions contained in both Subchapter 8 and Subchapter 16. This submittal was supplemented on May 10, 1991. EPA approved this demonstration on September 24, 1991. EPA is approving New Jersey's reaffirmation that there are no rubber tire manufacturing sources in New Jersey. As a result of EPA's approval of New Jersey's negative declaration and of New Jersey's equivalency demonstrations, EPA finds that New Jersey has fully approved rules for all pre-enactment CTGs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As to the requirement for adopting RACT for sources subject to a post-enactment CTG, New Jersey has followed the process set forth by EPA in its CTG document issued as appendix B to the General Preamble. In appendix B, EPA provided that states could delay submission of non-CTG rules for those sources the state anticipates will be covered by one of EPA's 11 proposed post-enactment CTGs. Section 183(a) requires EPA to issue these 11 CTGs by November 15, 1993. Pursuant to the procedure established in appendix B, New Jersey is required to adopt regulations in accordance with a CTG issued by November 15, 1993, in accordance with the schedule set forth by EPA. In the alternative, for source categories for which a CTG is not issued by that date, the State will adopt RACT for those source categories by November 15, 1994. Appendix B also requires states to submit a list of sources that it anticipates will be covered by such a CTG. As part of its November 15, 1992 submittal, New Jersey submitted a list of sources that it anticipates will be covered by such a CTG. New Jersey also indicated that it intends to adopt RACT regulations for all of those sources by the required date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1993, EPA published a CTG for reactor processes and distillation operations in the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry. On March 23, 1994, in 56 FR 13717, EPA published an addendum to that CTG. In that addendum EPA explained that states are required to adopt RACT rules for this CTG category by March 23, 1995 and that sources must be in compliance with these rules no later than November 15, 1996. EPA did not publish any additional CTGs by the November 15, 1993 deadline. Therefore, in order to meet the appendix B requirement, New Jersey must adopt RACT rules for reactor processes and distillation operations in the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry by March 23, 1995. In addition, New Jersey must adopt RACT rules for all major sources which would be subject to other post-enactment CTG categories by November 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, New Jersey was required to submit by November 15, 1992, non-CTG RACT rules for all major sources not covered by a pre-enactment CTG and not anticipated to be covered by a post-enactment CTG. New Jersey failed to submit such regulations on the required date and on January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of New Jersey that it was starting the 18-month sanction process required by section 179(a) of the Act. On November 15, 1993, New Jersey made submittals intending to meet this requirement. EPA determined that this submittal was complete on December 29, 1993. This determination stopped the sanction process. EPA will be taking action on this state submittal in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 05 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this rulemaking, EPA is approving New Jersey's reaffirmation that there are no major sources of rubber tire manufacturing in New Jersey. In addition EPA finds that this reaffirmation along with New Jersey's previously approved regulations and demonstrations fulfills the section 182(b)(2) RACT catch-up requirements to adopt RACT requirements for all sources for which EPA issued a CTG before the 1990 amendments to the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP.

However, in a separate document in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. Thus, this direct final action will be effective November 28, 1994 unless, by October 27, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the EPA receives such comments, this rule will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this rule should do so at this time. If no adverse comments are received, the public is advised that this rule will be effective November 28, 1994. (See 47 FR 27073 and 59 FR 24059). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moveover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 US 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H.

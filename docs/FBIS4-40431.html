			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander of the Ukrainian Navy Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy accused the Black Sea Fleet commanders of removing  property from the garrisons, which are to belong to Ukraine. He  told INTERFAX-Ukraine on Wednesday [15 June] that the Black Sea  Fleet commanders hoped to make the property of the Black Sea  Fleet Russia's property.    "The removal of the property will inflict direct damage on  the economic interests of Ukraine," said Bezkorovaynyy.    In his opinion, this question must be discussed during the  next round of the Ukrainian-Russian talks on the division of the  Black Sea Fleet.    He also announced that the headquarters of the Ukrainian  Navy  were considering the parameters of the Russian fleet's temporary  stay in Sevastopol.    He said that the discussion of the division of the logistics  property continued.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: GEORGIA HOSTEL OFFERS ROOMS IN TREE HOUSE  </P> <P> For the bargain price of $6 a night, young travelers can stay in a tree house  in Georgia. Then, using it as a base, they can investigate an island park with  200 wild horses, a 600-square-mile swamp that is home to more than 10,000  alligators, and another island that was once the private resort of America's  wealthiest families.  </P> <P> Located in a 90-acre section of forest, about 15 miles southwest of Brunswick,  the Hostel in the Forest can accommodate about 40 people. Most stay in  dormitory rooms in a geodesic dome, but there are also two tree houses, each  with a large picture window and a double bed. All beds are $6 a night for Youth  Hostel Assn. members, $7 for nonmembers.  </P> <P> Those needing transportation can arrange to be picked up at the airport or bus  station for $2 by a member of the hostel staff. To make arrangements, call  (912) 264-9738. The hostel entrance is on U.S. 82. From Interstate 95, take  exit No. 6 for two miles.  </P> <P> Guests without their own transportation to surrounding sites can obtain  assistance from the hostel staff. When time permits, the staff will use the  hostel mini-van to provide transportation for the cost of gas.  </P> <P> About nine miles from the hostel is a causeway that stretches six miles across  marshland to Jekyll Island. For 55 years the island was a private resort for  families, including the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and Goodyears. Now  it has 10 hotels and a campground. Rent a bike for $10 per day at the miniature  golf course and use the 20 miles of paved paths to investigate the historic  district and beaches or bird-watch by the marshes.  </P> <P> Jekyll Island Campground is off Beachview Drive on the north end of the island.  It has 220 tent and trailer sites, which range from $10 to $14 per night. A  deposit equal to one night's stay is required to hold a site. Visa and  MasterCard are accepted. Call (912) 635-3021.  </P> <P> About 50 miles from the tree house hostel, on the border between Georgia and  Florida, is the fishing village of St. Mary's. This is where to catch a ferry  ($7.95 round trip) to cross several miles of marsh to reach Cumberland Island,  the largest and most southern of Georgia's barrier islands.  </P> <P> This 16-mile-long island has a white-sand beach, sand dunes up to 40 feet high,  a nesting ground for loggerhead turtles and is home to about 200 wild horses  that are descendants of polo ponies, plough horses and wild mustangs.  </P> <P> Park staff offer some interpretive walks that include ruins of a Carnegie  mansion and a museum in the Carnegie estate's original ice house. Free camping,  for up to seven days, is possible in developed and back-country sites. There  are no shops on the island, only water and washrooms.  </P> <P> Whether you plan to go for the day or camp, you need reservations. Call  weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.: (912) 822-4335.  </P> <P> The Okefenokee Swamp is about 55 miles from the tree house hostel. Now a  National Wildlife Refuge, the swamp is home to 225 species of birds and 58  species of reptiles. From the hostel, enter at Folkston, where there is a  4,000-foot scenic boardwalk and a 50-foot observation tower. A guided boat tour  is $5 an hour. Canoe rentals are $10.77 per day, motorboats $27.80.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Georgia, contact Tour Georgia, Georgia  Department of Industry Trade, P.O.

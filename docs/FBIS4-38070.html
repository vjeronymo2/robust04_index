			<p>BFN     [Text] A young Jew was stabbed in the head in Jerusalem's  Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood this morning, and his condition is  very serious. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the  man was repairing his car when he was suddenly stabbed by a  young Arab wielding a large knife. He was sent to Hadassah-'En  Kerem Hospital with head and neck injuries. The knife was found  near the scene, but the Arab assailant had fled to the village  of Dahiyat al-Barid.    The police have his description. He is believed to have been  employed as a laborer in the Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood.</p>

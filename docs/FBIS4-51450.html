			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 26 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  official said here today that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's  proposal to set up a human rights commission in the territory  not only violates the Basic Law but also poses a threat to the  smooth transition of Hong Kong.    Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong  branch, made the remarks here on a public occasion on Wednesday  [25 May] while commenting on the proposal recently put forward  by Chris Patten for establishing a human rights commission in  the territory.    The human rights of the Hong Kong people are fully  guaranteed  in the Basic Law, Zhu said, noting that the proposal runs  counter to the Basic Law, and therefore, is not conducive to the  smooth transition of Hong Kong.    He also criticized Patten for paying only lip service to the  Sino-British cooperation on the one hand, and constantly setting  up new barriers on the other hand.    Zhu warned that such a human rights commission would be  dismantled in 1997 if it were indeed set up.</p>

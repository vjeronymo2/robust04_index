			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES;  </P> <P> CCAA LOOKING FOR MORE PEOPLE TO SIT UP AND TAKE TAKE NOTICE OF THEIR TEAMS  </P> <P> The California Collegiate Athletic Assn. often skunks its Division II  competition when it comes to winning NCAA titles. CCAA teams have dominated  sports such as swimming, softball, cross-country and volleyball and have won  titles in basketball, baseball, wrestling and other sports.  </P> <P> But in the shadow of the Pacific 10 Conference -- as well as the Big West and  the West Coast Conference -- the CCAA (and Division II in general) is often  ignored. And the conference's most prestigious member, Cal State Northridge, is  stepping up to Division I after this school year. What's a conference to do?  </P> <P> In the CCAA's case, a long-range planning committee -- including various  administrators from CCAA athletic programs -- is looking into the weighty  matters of realigning the membership and increasing exposure.  </P> <P> As Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, a member of the  planning committee that met last week, says: "We say we're the conference of  champions, but we're the only ones who know it."  </P> <P> With Northridge leaving and at least one other CCAA team -- UC Riverside --  looking at moving up to Division I, the CCAA is wooing Cal State San  Bernardino, an independent Division II school with a growing program, and has  also been approached by UC San Diego, which now competes in Division III.  </P> <P> Whoever comes and goes, the CCAA will have a new look in the 1990s, and will  probably have more competitive races without Northridge, a school that dwarfs  most of the eight-member CCAA with an enrollment of 31,000.  </P> <P> Guerrero said San Bernardino, the fastest-growing school in the Cal State  system, has approached the CCAA and is openly being courted. It is hoped San  Bernardino can join the CCAA next year, which would make the school a  full-fledged member by the 1991-92 season.  </P> <P> UC San Diego's approach was more of a surprise but is being considered  optimistically, with membership probably a little farther down the road than  San Bernardino. "The committee is in favor of seeing both of those schools  involved," Guerrero said.  </P> <P> The other pressing point the committee discussed was expanded media attention.  The CCAA would like to get a television deal for its post-season basketball  tournament -- a similar attempt last year turned into a confused fiasco -- and  is also working on a volleyball package.  </P> <P> "It's an issue of image enhancement," Guerrero said. "We're pursuing TV  exposure for the post-season (basketball) tournament, and we're thinking of  adding some type of conference volleyball tournament since we're such a power  nationally." A volleyball tourney, the panel hopes, would have some television  appeal. "Every time you turn the (cable) TV on, you see volleyball," Guerrero  said. "That would be a chance to showcase one of our strengths."  </P> <P> The committee also is looking into expanding the responsibilities of the  conference commissioner. Tom Morgan, a professor at Cal State Long Beach, is  now the CCAA commissioner, which carries part-time status.  </P> <P> "We're looking at increasing . . . the support base for the commissioner in  order to be more visible," Guerrero said.  </P> <P> One of the goals of the CCAA is to get more schools playing more sports.  Women's soccer, for example, is a relatively low-budget sport but is not played  at enough CCAA schools to set up a conference schedule. Hence, Dominguez Hills,  with one of the strongest teams in the country, needs to play an exceptionally  tough schedule and maintain a high national ranking to be considered for a  post-season berth. From the CCAA's standpoint -- and certainly Dominguez Hills'  -- it would be preferable to play a conference schedule with the winner getting  an automatic NCAA playoff berth.  </P> <P> "We've talked about providing something in the by-laws where each school must  have a certain number of sports," Guerrero said. "But that's preliminary. We  need to know our composition for that."  </P> <P> The one thing the committee knows for now is that in five years, the CCAA may  look considerably different, and the power center will have shifted away from  Northridge.  </P> <P> When it comes to volleyball, the West Coast Conference lives up to its name --  with a bit of a stretch. A scan of the eight conference rosters shows all but  about a dozen of the players coming from California, Oregon, Washington or  Arizona.  </P> <P> The curious stretch is that eight players come from Alaska, several of them  conference stars. Junior outside hitter Angie Rais, an Anchorage native at the  University of San Diego, led the WCC in hitting percentage last year, whereas  Sitka product Christy Martin, a senior middle blocker at Portland, and Palmer  native Erica Cordy, a junior setter at Gonzaga, earned all-WCC honors. Cordy is  one of three Alaska natives on Gonzaga.  </P> <P> Another Alaska product, freshman Karen Clapp, is red-shirting at Loyola. The  Lions also boast the WCC's only Hawaii resident, freshman Dana Bragado.  </P> <P> Pepperdine has the only East Coast native in the conference, all-WCC outside  hitter Tami Seidenberg, who hails from the New York City neighborhood of  Jamaica. Rare Midwest products include Pepperdine freshman Elaine Caraher from  Orchard Park, Ill., and San Diego freshman Andrea Bruns from Apple Valley,  Minn.  </P> <P> Jim Ellis, an assistant basketball coach to Paul Westhead at Loyola Marymount  for the past four seasons, is stepping up to the pros this year. Ellis, 35, has  been named a full-time assistant coach with the San Jose Jammers of the  Continental Basketball Assn. Ellis, a volunteer assistant at Loyola since  Westhead took over the program, was also a teacher in the Inglewood school  system and an assistant coach of the Inglewood High basketball team from 1980  to 1984.  </P> <P> College Notes: Loyola Marymount Athletic Director Brian Quinn will appear as a  guest panelist at 7:30 a.m. Sunday on KCBS-TV Channel 2's "At Issue." Quinn and  USC sports attorney Denise Speaks will discuss NCAA legislation, including  controversial Propositions 42 and 48, which deal with entrance requirements for  student-athletes.  </P> <P> The West Coast Conference begins volleyball play next week. A poll of coaches  foresees Pepperdine repeating as champ, followed by (in order) Gonzaga,  Portland, Santa Clara, Loyola Marymount, San Francisco, St. Mary's and San  Diego.  </P> <P> Loyola volleyball player Janeice Stimpfig , who missed several matches with a  knee injury, played briefly Tuesday night against Cal State Long Beach and  hopes to be ready for the Lions' conference opener next week.  </P> <P> Megan McAllister, the former Mira Costa High volleyball star, was voted most  valuable player in the Volleyball Monthly Invitational held at Texas-Arlington.  The USC hitter led the Trojans to the tournament title.  </P></p>

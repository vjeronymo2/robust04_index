			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Tampella slides further into red TAMPELLA, the troubled Finnish forestry and engineering group owned by the Bank of Finland, has reported a sharp deterioration in its financial performance, with a FM1.3bn (Dollars 298m) loss after financial items for 1991, compared with a FM600m deficit in 1990. Sales increased by 5 per cent, to around FM7.2bn from FM6.8bn. The result would have been worse but for a FM1.5bn loan write-off. A FM530m increase in capital after the Bank of Finland took control also helped to improve the company's balance sheet. Tampella believes interest costs will be cut by around FM200m in 1992 as a result of the measures taken to restructure operations. The 10,239-strong workforce is to be reduced by 1,473. Tampella said shareholders' equity and reserves at the end of last year totalled FM1.7bn. The solvency ratio was about 18 per cent. The company was saved by the Bank of Finland as part of the rescue of the country's main savings bank, SkopBank, last autumn. The bank's credit loss troubles were mainly caused by the outstanding debts accumulated by Tampella on loans totalling FM1.5bn. Tampella said although the recession in Finland appeared to have bottomed out, demand in the company's main markets would remain sluggish throughout this year. It said the recovery measures taken would lead to an improvement in performance and a considerable cut in losses.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telegram from Khieu Samphan to King Norodom Sihanouk; dated </F> 9 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] On 9 May, His Excellency Khieu Samphan, head of the  Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent another telegram to  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, stressing the PDK's position  on the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation.  Here is the content of the telegram:    Prompted by the spirit of genuine national reconciliation  and  unity to which the PDK has all along adhered, I would like to  inform Your Majesty that the PDK is happy and ready to attend  the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation  under the lofty chairmanship of Your Majesty in the (Kiang  Si-un) Palace [near Pyongyang]. In case this palace is not  convenient, the roundtable may be held at another neutral site.    I still believe that a roundtable is the first step for all  Cambodian factions to meet and have discussions so that they can  gradually agree upon and move toward an accommodation with the  aim of achieving national reconciliation under the shade of the  king and the throne.    Moreover, I have raised the issue of a neutral site with the  sole aim of ensuring security and providing equal conditions for  all parties attending the meeting.    All of this is to enable the roundtable meeting to be held  successfully in line with Your Majesty's desire and the profound  aspirations of our nation and every Cambodian in the  countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad who desires to achieve  the national reconciliation and unity of all forces under the  leadership of the king, thus enabling Cambodia to enjoy peace,  national unity, and territorial integrity.    Availing myself of this occasion, I would like to inform  Your  Majesty that I accept this new initiative for the participation  of the PDK in the government and the Army, and the preparation  of the election suggested by Your Majesty on 7 May 1994.</p>

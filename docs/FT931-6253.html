			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium smelters in 'poverty trap' LOSS-MAKING ALUMINIUM smelters in the West are caught in a poverty trap that prevents them from cutting production in spite of low prices and record stocks, according to a report from the Commodities Research Unit. The report estimates that more than half Western capacity is losing money on every tonne of production, while the flood of metal from the former Soviet Union shows no sign of abating. However, while Western production needs to be curbed to bolster prices, companies are entirely rational not to close even their higher cost and economically vulnerable smelters, the CRU asserts. 'Temporary or partial closures are not an attractive option because of the high proportion of fixed or unavoidable costs within total operating costs.' Permanent closure is also unattractive because in the current state of the market the liquidation value of a plant is small. In addition, any single closure would have little effect on the market, and the CRU believes it unlikely that producers will act collectively on a programme of closures. The CRU is forecasting only a slow improvement in the market balance as the surplus production is eroded by a gradual increase in demand. It predicts that investment in new capacity will be delayed to the extent that prices will move sharply higher towards the turn of the century when the surplus is finally worked off. Meanwhile, companies will be better off uprating and upgrading existing plant than investing in greenfield sites, the CRU suggests. Survival in Aluminium Smelting.

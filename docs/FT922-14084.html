			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / City faces glut of empty office space THE CITY of London might be left with 5m sq ft of virtually unlettable offices by 1995, representing more space than the Canary Wharf complex and 16 times that of the NatWest Tower, according to a leading property consultancy. The report by Herring Baker Harris Research says vacancy rates in the City are expected to remain at a record level of about 20 per cent until the end of this year. It will then gradually decline to about 14 per cent at the end of 1995, the report says. The levels of empty property in the City, which have provoked a steep decline in rents and capital values, result from a combination of the recession and the surge of new developments at the end of the last decade. During the 1980s, there was a 30 per cent increase in office stock and no increase in net employment. The report expects rental growth in some parts of the market, in spite of a long-term vacancy rate of between 12 and 15 per cent. Demand for high-quality offices will pick up by mid decade, leading to some growth in rental values. Top rents will not reach the levels they attained in 1989-90 until the next decade. About half the vacant space (6.15m sq ft) in the City is top-grade. Empty space is fairly evenly distributed between the core and fringe of the City. The report says that half the City's office stock will have been built between 1986 and 1993. The upgrading of the City's office stock combined with lower rents will be important in helping it to retain its dominant position in Europe as a financial centre. It judges that two significant threats to the City's tenant base have been removed. In the West End, little space is available and the cost advantage of Docklands has disappeared. The report predicts that office demand will be generated not by expansion but by restructuring. Companies will need new office space as a result of mergers and the need to improve productivity. The report says: 'Demand is more likely to be generated by recirculation than expansion in the 1990s, with a flow from poor to good space.' The balance of power between landlord and tenant will be more equitable in future, the report predicts. Leases are likely to become more flexible, lasting 15 years rather than 25 years as has been the case in recent decades. The tenant's position has been strengthened by high vacancy rates and the volume of prospective developments that may be started in the mid 1990s to respond to demand. In addition, occupiers are becoming more demanding, with expectations increasingly influenced by terms available in overseas markets. The survey highlights the steep drop in construction in the City. Less than 4m sq ft of City office development was under construction in December 1991, compared with 10.3m sq ft six months earlier. In 1992, 0.4m sq ft of developments will be started and 1.24m sq ft in 1993. Behind the Facade. Herring Baker Harris, 26-28 Sackville Street, London W1X 2QL. Pounds 25.</p>

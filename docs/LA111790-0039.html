			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S SO MARVELOUS ABOUT BERATING FANS?  </P> <P> Beware, USC fans: You have raised the ire of Mr. Marvin Marinovich, a.k.a.  "Robo Daddy," when you booed Todd.  </P> <P> If this action continues, "Robo Daddy" will make you walk home as he once did  "Robo Boy" when he had less than a perfect day.  </P> <P> But don't worry, the USC band could accompany you and play the two songs that  they know, alternating them every other block.  </P> <P> GRANT R. IRVIN  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

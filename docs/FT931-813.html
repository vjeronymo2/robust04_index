			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring shares I AM RETIRED with both state and employment pensions, sufficient for me to pay income tax. As I have a number of shares in my name, I would like to know the procedure for transferring these into my wife's name so that she will be able to reclaim the tax paid on dividends. Do I complete a stock transfer form to make this change? Yes, you should complete a stock transfer form for each shareholding (not forgetting to complete the stamp-duty exemption certificate on the back); your wife should then send the forms and share certificates to the registrars. Very few registrars make any charge for registering transfers. To prevent an attack under the anti-avoidance provisions, aimed at husbands who try to use their wives as mere puppets to obtain tax relief for their own benefit, we recommend that your wife have the dividends paid into an account in her sole name (to which you have no access). The basic principle is that your wife clearly must be free to spend the whole of the income and capital as she pleases without being in any way answerable to you as to where it has gone. Your wife might like to ask the local tax inspector's office for the free pamphlet IR110 (a guide for people with savings). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

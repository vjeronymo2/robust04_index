			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (10): State of neglect - Port of Luanda ALMOST every night short bursts of gunfire reverberate around the port of Luanda as thieves and security guards clash. The conflict's disastrous impact on the Angolan economy has encouraged the growth of a parallel economy whose most visible expression is the vast Roque Santeiro black market on the capital's outskirts, and where everything that cannot be found in government stores is on sale. Many of those goods have been stolen from the port, often with the complicity of port officials and police. Stealing from the port is a lucrative if dangerous business, with many of the spoils ending up in the vast Roque Santeiro black market on Luanda's outskirts. Security is not the only problem. The port, once considered one of the finest on the western coast of Africa, suffered from the war as exports collapsed - except for oil which is shipped almost entirely from the oil-producing province of Cabinda. Until independence, Luanda was the main port for agricultural exports including coffee, cotton, sugar, sisal, palm products, tobacco, rice, and maize. In 1973, total freight shipments in and out of Luanda, including trans-shipments of copper and iron and refined oil products, was 2.3m tonnes. By 1983, traffic had fallen to below 700,000 tonnes as a result of the disruption of road and rail links, the closure of mines and plantations, and foreign restrictions on imports - which now account for the bulk of freight traffic. Shippers currently estimate that 300-400 tonnes of general cargo, and about 120 containers, are unloaded daily. Behind the port's elegant colonial facade, installations have reached an advanced state of neglect which will need substantial investment to correct. Access roads and freight handling equipment are in a poor state, and most of the and electric cranes do not work. It is not uncommon for ships to use their own derricks to unload. Port regulations demand that shippers pay for the cranes regardless, so there has been no incentive for the port authorities to repair or replace damaged equipment. Many of the port's facilities were originally designed to handle large bulk exports and are inadequate for the type of imports now shipped. The port lacks appropriate warehouses and cold storage facilities. Rubbish and discarded equipment lies openly between run-down warehouses. Close to 6,000 containers, many of them damaged, wait to be emptied or shipped out, making them easy targets for thieves. The government has handed over the management of the piers to mixed state-private companies to improve efficiency, but they are handicapped by conditions in the rest of the port. Roll-on roll-off cargo has priority, so have food imports, but delays are common and ship's papers must be fully in order to avoid a long wait. 'If all cargo documents are sent to us at least two days before the ship arrives in Luanda, we can prepare the documentation and begin to organise things at this end to make sure goods are cleared as soon as they get here,' says Mr Antonio Fernandes, shipping manager for agents Hull Blyth.</p>

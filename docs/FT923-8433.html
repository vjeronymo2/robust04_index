			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Observer: Good shot The TSB's sponsorship of Roy of the Rovers, the cartoon football hero, has opened up a whole new field for sporting-business links. Melchester Rovers star Roy, who first appeared in the Tiger comic in 1954, has great attractions for a sponsor; unlike a real footballer, his private life is immune from sordid revelations in tabloid newspapers. So which comic book hero will be next to attract the sponsor's eye? Perhaps Pizzaland could back the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? And those loveable libertarians at the National Rifle Association would be an obvious sponsor for Bambi. And how about Rentokil sponsoring Mickey Mouse?</p>

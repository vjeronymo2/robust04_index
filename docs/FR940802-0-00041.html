			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA concludes that while increased ethanol use is likely in RFG sold from mid-October through late March, increased ethanol use resulting from this program will be essentially zero in May and will be minimal in April, late September, and early October. Furthermore, ethanol's commingling effect changes relatively little at ethanol market shares between 30 and 70 percent and decreases at higher market shares. As discussed in section III.F, a number of States in the Midwest and Northeast which will participate in the RFG program already have peak ethanol market shares approaching or even above 30 percent. In addition, experience with the winter oxygenated fuels program indicates that ethanol blends may well have represented 30 percent or more of the winter RFG demand in some RFG markets without today's rule (including some midwestern and northeastern RFG markets), suggesting that any increase in ethanol use which might occur during the shoulder season would cause little if any increase in commingling effects. Both of these factors suggest that emission impacts resulting from ethanol's vapor pressure boost and commingling effects during the shoulder season will be less than otherwise anticipated. Since ETBE use in summer RFG would likely reduce ethanol use in winter RFG, the extent of any ethanol-related VOC increase during the shoulder season is likely to decrease as ETBE capacity and usage increase. Finally, it should be noted that VOC emissions are unconstrained during the non-VOC control season under both the RFG and volatility control programs since such emissions are not associated with ozone exceedances because they do not occur outside the summer months in most of the country. Thus, today's rule is unlikely to result in increased VOC emissions during the period when such emissions are controlled under current EPA fuel programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. EPA Analysis of the Extent of the Shoulder Season Air Quality Problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In examining the shoulder season issue, EPA evaluated the extent of the air quality problem during the shoulder season. EPA has found that ozone violations outside the May 1 to September 15 period (the period during which all gasoline at terminals, and much of the gasoline at retail stations, is expected to be VOC-controlled) are minimal for those RFG areas outside of California and Texas. Ozone monitor exceedances during September 16&hyph;October 31 and the month of April in the Northeast comprised fewer than 4 percent of all such exceedances recorded in RFG areas in 1986&hyph;1988. More recent 1990&hyph;1992 data for the Northeast confirm the earlier results: less than 2 percent of all ozone monitor exceedances recorded in RFG areas occurred in the Northeast in April, late September, and October (and none in other winter months). Further examination of the 1990&hyph;1992 data revealed that the documented ozone violations involve just two distinct ozone episodes. These episodes (one in late April and one in mid-September) happened very near the time of year when much of the RFG sold at retail stations is expected to be VOC-controlled. The various control measures that apply year-round that will be implemented to attain the ozone standard on the highest exceedance days should reduce ozone concentrations below the National ambient air quality standard for ozone in the shoulder season. Furthermore, given the analysis of fuel turnover discussed previously, EPA believes that the renewable oxygenate program is unlikely to contribute to increased ozone exceedances or additional high ozone episodes in the Northeast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the 1990&hyph;1992 data also indicate that a substantial number of ozone violations occurred during the shoulder seasons in the reformulated gasoline areas in California and Texas. Violations appear to occur throughout the year in both states. However, the state of California has imposed additional fuel regulations within its borders to address air quality problems, and more stringent volatility requirements go into effect throughout the state of California in 1996. These controls will already cover the April&hyph;October time frame in southern California, and the state of California can extend this if they believe additional volatility controls during the period are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Texas did not submit comments to the Agency on this issue, the possibility does exist that the renewable oxygenate program may increase VOC emissions outside the high ozone season in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. To address this problem, EPA has considered further restricting the times during which ethanol would receive renewables credit in this rule. However, the year-round nature of Texas' current ozone exceedances could make such a solution impractical. Furthermore, EPA's analysis of ethanol production and blending capacity indicates that further restrictions on the times when ethanol would receive renewables credit could exacerbate the supply, distribution, and blending concerns for 1995 and 1996 discussed in section III.F. As a result, EPA does not believe at this time that revising the design of a national program (through such means as extending the period when alcohols do not receive credit toward the renewables requirement on a nationwide basis) is appropriate. Furthermore, EPA believes that revising the design of the program on less than a national basis (e.g., just for Texas and/or California), would be inappropriate at this point in time without taking into consideration the unique requirements within each State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

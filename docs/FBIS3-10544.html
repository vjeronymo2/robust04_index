			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez stated  yesterday that the Army is confident of the likelihood of the  signing of a human rights agreements in Mexico and expressed his  hope that the recent dynamite attack on a bridge on the Atlantic  route will not influence the talks.    "I expect the government delegation will adopt some  position,  which I believe it will relay to the insurgents in Mexico;  however, I expect it will not contribute to curtailing the  possibility of an agreement," the defense minister added in  referring to the issue.    He was very careful when he referred to the peace talks,  indicating that in a 10 January agreement, both sides agreed  that any statements referring to the talks would be made by UN  Moderator Jean Arnault.    "In any case, it should be up to the president or  [Presidential Adviser] Hector Rosada, but I would be making a  mistake in commenting on the issue. Even if I were aware of  what's going on, I would still be missing sufficient details to  explain the thing clearly and sincerely. Also, we would not  like to create confusion and distrust with respect to the  talks," he added.    Nevertheless, Enriquez did refer to statements by Commander  Pablo Monsanto of the Rebel Armed Forces [FAR], who remarked on  the possibility of an agreement during the talks. Enriquez also  alluded to the OAS Human Rights Commission resolution on  Guatemala and stated that not appointing a rapporteur is "a real  acknowledgement by the international community of the efforts  the government is making to ensure respect of fundamental  rights."    The defense minister acknowledged that in this respect there  are still problems, but that efforts have been made and now it  is impossible to say that there is a policy or systematic intent  to violate fundamental human rights, and that is why the Geneva  resolution was something to be happy about.    He also commented on recent statements by adviser Monica  Pinto and stated that "the Army influences political stability  because that has always been our intention, and there is  evidence of that."  <H5>  No Conditions for State of Exception </H5>   In referring to a possible state of exception in Guatemala,  the general indicated that so far conditions are not suitable  for such a measure although if it is ordered, the Armed Forces  will obey what corresponds, in accordance with the determined  degree.    He indicated that "it is a decision that corresponds to the  president and the Legislative Branch, we can only receive orders  according to the degree that is decided. If the decision is  made, well, there are degrees of prevention, calamity, war, and  siege."    On the other hand, he explained that the boats seen from the  Presidential Palace are some of the four boats assigned to the  Pacific and Atlantic naval bases. He, however, denied the boats  were armed. He did not explain the cost of the boats, but did  say that they were 27-foot, "Vigilant"-type speed boats to be  used in counternarcotics, rescue, and other Navy operations.  The defense minister concluded by stating that the "Navy is  poorly equipped because it has not received support for the past  20 years. Some equipment was purchased during the [Jorge]  Serrano administration, but Ramiro de Leon Carpio has so far not  even purchased a canoe."    [Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish on 8 March carries  on  page 3 a 240-word report in which Defense Minister Mario Rene  Enriquez "did not rule out the possibility that the urban rebel  commando groups may be the authors of the attack that completely  destroyed the foundations of the [San Juan River] bridge,  located 20 km from Guatemala City. He added this is a worrisome  situation."]</p>

In the presence of Osmany Cienfuegos, vice  president of the Council of State, these worker leaders will  assess how the subject of tourism was reflected during the  meetings at which this subject was discussed by the various  unions.    One of the demands of the Trade and Food Industry Workers  Union's membership is the need to designate a more flexible  manner in which each work group donates a portion of its tips to  indirect workers and public health.    During the afternoon, Sonia Rodriguez, [minister] president  of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply, will  be participating in the Parliament in the Workplace process of  the Trade and Food Industry Workers Union at the CTC.</p>

It is  being reported that Talabani, who reportedly returned to  southern [Iraqi] Kurdistan yesterday, held a meeting with PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Ocalan before his return.    It is being said that the foreign ministries of Turkey,  United States, and Britain were aware of Talabani's visit.    Sources close to Poised Hammer who are carefully following  Talabani's visit claimed that Ocalan is planning to announce a  cease-fire in the next six to nine months.</p>

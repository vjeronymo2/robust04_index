			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother leader Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi  delivered a speech at the opening of the sixth council session  of the Arab Maghreban Union [AMU]. [passage omitted] In his  address, Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi warned against the  dangers posed by challenges confronting the Arab nation,  indicating that they formed an obstacle toward achieving any  Arab integration, prosperity and progress. [passage omitted]    He added that one of the most prominent challenges facing us  and which the enemies are using to impede our unity and to  destroy our basic principles with deep-rooted crusade-like  rancor is the crisis fabricated more than two years ago by  Western states against the Great Jamahiriyah. The Western  states insist on continuing to use the so-called Security  Council to issue unjust mandatory resolutions which all the  world -- people and agencies -- have rejected.    Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said that the repeated threat  by the three Western states and their indifference to all  initiatives to find a peaceful solution to the crisis required  collective confrontation in line with the requirements of our  charters and pacts to prevent those countries from carrying on  implementing the same method they have been following, and to  work on lifting the unjust mandatory sanctions imposed on your  brothers in the Great Jamahiriyah, which have resulted in large  physical and material losses that have spread to the AMU.  [passage omitted]    Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said: We announce from this  podium, full self-confidence, that we are ready to hold direct  dialogue with Western states, on equal footing, without there  being room for any terrorism or encroachment. We also announce  that we are prepared to receive their judges, with grace and  honor, in line with recognized international rules.    Al-Khuwayldi al-Humaidi added: Your brothers in the  Jamahiriyah expect a decisive solution and practical steps to  lift injustice from them to emerge from this summit. Any  position which contradicts that will make Libyans feel the  futility of this union as being one political entity and will  leave them with a feeling of deep disppointment. [passage  omitted]</p>

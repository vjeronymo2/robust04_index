The incident, which occurred on 31  December at about 1100 PM in Mahotiere near Moron, erupted when  the deputy, while participating in a dance, was taken to task by  a group of opponents who were fired into action. The situation  degenerated and came to blows. Deputy Jacinthe drew his gun and  fired several shots. The young Rosemanette Jean-Louis, 16, candy  seller, fell dead from a gunshot wound in the neck. Two other  persons -- Celestin Lenet, 38, and Kettia Similien, 13 -- were  also injured. We have learned from hospital sources that  Celestin is in critical condition and will most likely not  survive.    Pursued by his detractors, Deputy Jacinthe took refuge in  the  Moron barracks. He was then transferred to Jeremie on 1 January.  He is allegedly under police protection at this time. A reliable  source, however, told us that the deputy was to enter  Port-au-Prince on the night of 3 January, but we have not yet  been able to verify this information.    Signal is following the situation closely. As soon as we  have  further information, we will let you know.</p>

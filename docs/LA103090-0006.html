			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE OF L  </P> <P> The mundane business of running a city provides few opportunities to make  declarations on human rights. Next week, however, Angelenos will get a rare  chance, when they vote on Charter Amendment L, the Anti-Apartheid Contracting  Policy.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Los Angeles adopted an historic law barring city contracts with  firms that do business with South Africa. That ordinance has since become a  model for other municipalities, and has been singled out for praise by  Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel peace laureate, and other leading figures in  the anti-apartheid movement.  </P> <P> Current provisions of the Charter, however, have put 90% of municipal contracts  beyond the reach of the original law. Those provisions require that all pacts  with a value in excess of $25,000 must be put out for competitive bid and  awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, contingent only on price and ability  to perform. No other factors may be considered.  </P> <P> Measure L would amend the Charter so that any bidder on any contract could be  disqualified if the firm does business with Pretoria's racist regime. A number  of carefully drawn exemptions are provided, including one for companies that  are the sole provider of an essential good or service. City officials say L  will have no impact on the quality or cost of contracts.  </P> <P> As a rule, city governments ought not to involve themselves with issues of  foreign policy, most of which are beyond the scope of their competence and  legal mandate. The inescapable moral challenge posed by apartheid's persistent  evil justifies an exception to that rule. Charter Amendment L gives Angelenos  of every race and persuasion an opportunity to declare their continued  solidarity with those South Africans who are so close to victory in their  struggle against racism.  </P> <P> Passage of L should not be read as a rebuff to the government of President  Frederik W. de Klerk, which has made significant strides toward dismantling the  system. It should be read as a reaffirmation that the people of Los Angeles  have no intention of diminishing their opposition to apartheid until that  crumbling system of racial oppression is ancient history.  </P></p>

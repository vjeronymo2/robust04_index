Apart from getting close to the people and  improving relations between the party and the masses, one of the  purposes of making the trips before and after Lunar New Year's  Day is to study and handle the new contradictions and problems  arising from reform.    According to informed sources, Li Ruihuan, Standing  Committee  member of the Political Bureau and chairman of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, arrived in Guangdong's Zhuhai yesterday and will  spend the new year in Guangdong. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji,  another Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau, is  currently inspecting Sichuan. Vice President Rong Yiren and Tian  Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress, yesterday attended the spring festival party  for the people and servicemen in the Guangzhou areas. CPC  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who is also state president, and  Premier Li Peng will stay in Beijing to "spend the new year."  Jiang and Li will attend a large-scale spring festival  get-together party organized by the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council, on 10 February (Lunar New Year Day) in the  Great Hall of the People.    Although rumors have recently circulated that CPC elder Deng  Xiaoping will come to Guangdong, an informed source said that  this year Deng Xiaoping will still follow his old habit and  spend the new year in Shanghai.    Informed sources pointed out that visits by senior CPC  leaders before and during the spring festival (Jiang Zemin went  to Shanxi, Li Peng went to Guangdong, Zhu Rongji went to Fujian  and Sichuan, and Li Ruihuan went to the Zhuhai and Shenzhen  Special Economic Zones) are related to the important reform  measures to be announced this year. The several reforms to be  launched will involve bold measures which will be announced  within a short period of time, and will touch on very  complicated relations; therefore, the senior level in Beijing  must study and grasp the new contradictions and problems which  are arising in large numbers from the process of reform, and it  also has to coordinate relations between the central and local  authorities after the implementation of the revenue-sharing  system. In particular, it has to soothe the local leaders a bit  and address the grievances among some "local lords."    The official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY yesterday verified an  exclusive report by this newspaper the previous day that Premier  Li Peng left Shenzhen for Huizhou for inspection. XINHUA said  that after cutting a ribbon to open the commercial operation of  No. 1 generator in Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, Li  Peng arrived in Huizhou for inspection, sending new year's  greetings to the masses.    XINHUA also quoted Li Peng's remarks that Guangdong is at  the  front of reform and opening up, and its various undertakings  have been developing rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, and he hopes Guangdong people,  encouraged by the spirit of the 14th party congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, score  new and bigger results in the new year.    Li Peng, accompanied by Ding Guangen, Fei Xie, and Zhu  Senlin, toured Huizhou City Industrial Products Exhibition, and  visited the teachers and students at Huizhou City No. 8 Middle  School.    According to another piece of information, on the afternoon  of 6 February in Chongqing, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is  currently on an inspection trip to Sichuan, convened a forum  which was attended by the factory heads and managers of nine  state-run enterprises which are plagued by difficulties. Zhu  Rongji pointed out that to build a modern system of enterprises,  the first thing to do is to separate the government from  enterprises, the government must not be allowed to dictate to  the enterprises at will, and enterprises must be allowed to make  their own decisions concerning operation and management, whereas  when a decision is proved erroneous, the factory manager must be  held responsible, and such a system must be formed so that staff  and workers can exercise supervision. The enterprises which  have debts larger than capital and which are unable to reverse  the process of making losses should go bankrupt on a trial  basis; then, reorganization of enterprises will be carried out  to give them a new life. He also pointed out that to smoothly  change mechanisms and to be able to maintain social stability,  it is necessary to carry out reform of the social insurance  system.    Zhu Rongji also said that the difficulties facing state-run  enterprises are temporary, state-run enterprises have a bright  future, and the temporary difficulties will surely be solved  step by step. The method to solve the difficulties rests on the  state's policy, but mainly rests on enterprises' self-reliance  and hard work. Enterprises must carry out market research,  develop new products, strengthen management and operation,  change operational mechanisms, look at themselves, and demand  more from themselves. At present, special attention must be  paid to the life of staff and workers, and efforts must be made  to protect their basic livelihood and social stability.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Top two US shipping lines seek to reflag The two biggest US commercial shipping lines have begun to request permission to reflag their ships in foreign countries to reduce the costs of their operations. American Presidential Lines has asked the US Maritime Administration to put six new container ships under foreign flags, and is expected to seek reflagging of part of its 16-ship fleet now under the US flag. Sea-Land Services yesterday was expected to notify the administration that it wants to reflag about half of its 25-ship fleet. It hopes to begin with five foreign-based ships. The reflagging is strongly opposed by maritime labour, which joined with shipping interests last year in a congressional drive to get a new Dollars 1bn maritime operating subsidy programme. Union officials say American Presidential Lines worked against the legislation and should not be rewarded with waivers which permit the reflagging. The Clinton administration had hoped to create 'a renaissance for the American shipbuilding industry' with more investment in new technology. Shipping lines agreed to hold off reflagging until Congress passed legislation on operating subsidies. Subsidies were approved twice in the House with bipartisan support but killed in the Senate. Congress did, however, pass legislation providing for shipyard modernisation and export subsidies. The number of US-flagged vessels has been declining for years. As of last February the US had 366 large ocean-going vessels under US flag. Of these, 340 were active. Without subsidies the US fleet is expected to dwindle to about 30 vessels after the year 2000. The willingness of shipowners to reflag reflects the lower cost of operations using foreign crews and lower taxes abroad. It also represents the devaluing of the protection granted by cabotage rules, which permit only US flagged ships to sail from one US port to another, as trade becomes increasingly global.</p>

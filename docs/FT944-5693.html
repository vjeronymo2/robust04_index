			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Guilty verdicts for 33 in fraud trials: Birmingham mortgage swindle raised Pounds 35m West Midlands police have secured the conviction of 33 people in a series of cases involving the fraudulent deception of building societies and banks to obtain Pounds 35m. Cases against 43 people were heard in a series of trials at the Birmingham Crown Court. The trials, which were subject to reporting restrictions, started in January and finished this week. The court hearings followed some of the most elaborate police investigations into mortgage fraud in the UK. Police operations, code-named Operation Trooper, started in November 1990 and involved 23 officers. 'Operation Trooper is certainly the longest and most complex fraud investigation ever conducted by us,' said Det Supt Tim Salt, head of West Midlands Fraud Squad. Police examined the buying and selling of 200 properties and identified 70 in the Sutton Coldfield and Erdington areas of north Birmingham as subject to mortgage fraud. The transactions took place at the peak of the residential property market, in and around 1988. The fraud system worked on the basis of inflating the value of a particular property. A member of the fraud ring would purchase a property legitimately with the idea of selling it on to another member of the ring. Once acquired, the property in question would have its value inflated and, with the assistance of a spurious valuation, an application would be made for a mortgage. The members of the ring covered their tracks by using false names and addresses on their mortgage applications. Once the mortgage funds were paid, they disappeared as far as the lender was concerned: the members of the fraud ring made no repayments. Funds by this system of fraud were obtained from some of the leading housing market lenders, including Abbey National, Birmingham Midshires, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Coventry and Leeds Permanent building societies, the Bank of Scotland and Barclays, Midland and National Westminster banks. Their losses, although covered by indemnity policies, go further than the amounts by which they were defrauded. The properties subject to the fraudulent mortgages were repossessed, but their values have declined in line with the downturn of the housing market. Police explained that the channel to the lenders was through The Mortgage Shop, Priory Queensway, Birmingham, whose principal was Mr Paul Fewtrell. The property valuations came from Mr Ian Bain and the conveyancing was done by Mr Stephen Hyde, a legal executive at Roger Lloyd and Company, a Birmingham firm of solicitors now defunct. The ringleader was Mr David William Harris of Monmouth Drive, Sutton Coldfield. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud. His sentence, the most severe of the penalties given to the 33 guilty, was later reduced to five years. At the first trial of the series, both Mr Bain and Mr Fewtrell were acquitted. However, two members of The Mortgage Shop management, Mr Dean Taylor and Mr Phillip Kieley, were found guilty and sentenced respectively to 12 months' imprisonment and 250 hours' community service. So far 30 of the 33 guilty have received sentences ranging from community service orders to spells of imprisonment. The remaining three will be sentenced next month. Meanwhile, West Midlands Fraud Squad has filed with the Crown Prosecution Service evidence which may lead to two prosecutions for commercial property fraud, this time involving trading estates in the Black Country.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bush hoping to hook Baker as campaign guru PRESIDENT George Bush and the Republican party have mostly let Governor Bill Clinton and the Democrats hold centre-stage this week, half in the hope that the opposition would revert to type and disembowel itself. That has not happened, which means that, when the Democrats leave New York, attention will turn again to the incumbent and his team. Campaign watchers wait to see what emerges from Mr Bush's two-day fishing trip, which began yesterday in Wyoming. At issue is not what Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, secretary of state, catch in the rivers, but whether the president can lure his old friend back into a leading role in his stuttering campaign. Four years ago, when the Democrats were nominating Mr Michael Dukakis in Atlanta, the two men also went fishing in Wyoming. Two weeks later, Mr Baker resigned as Treasury secretary to run the Bush campaign. He was considered instrumental in turning a double-digit deficit into a comfortable victory in November. Mr Bush, according to the polls, is faring better than he was then, but the likelihood is that Mr Clinton will prove a tougher nut to crack than Mr Dukakis, while Mr Ross Perot is still muddying the conservative waters. Moreover, it did not help Mr Bush that he was booed, albeit mildly, when he attended an all-star baseball game in San Diego on Tuesday night. More Americans were watching that game on television than were viewing the Democratic convention. One option is for Mr Baker to be brought back as a combined campaign and domestic policy supremo. This has been assiduously denied for weeks and it may be that he can exercise at least the campaign part of the role from his present perch at the State Department. There is expectation of a dirty campaign to come. The Republicans have disowned the activities of Mr Floyd Brown, now a renegade conservative activist but notorious for having been the producer of the scurrilous Willie Horton commercial four years ago which so damaged Mr Dukakis by playing on the fears of white Americans. Mr Brown has been digging into Mr Clinton's private life and is trying, among other dirty tricks, to activate a telephone hotline featuring alleged taped conversations between Mr Clinton and Ms Gennifer Flowers, a one-time night club singer. On Tuesday, the Bush campaign filed a formal complaint against Mr Brown with the Federal Election Commission. In one respect, the president has been consistent. He has always insisted the campaign proper will not begin until the Republican convention a month from now in Houston. Only then, he has argued, will the public mind concentrate on the alternatives.</p>

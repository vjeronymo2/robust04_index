Asked how he would react to a No victory, the president said  he would accept the people's will and added that he would also  obey the Constitutionality Court's resolution if an action  against the 30 January event is put forward. If, as a  consequence of such an action however, there are public  disorders prior to, during, or after the event, the president  said he would take the necessary legal and constitutional  actions to prevent the country from falling into the crisis  promoted by certain groups.    The president reported that he had ordered security  organizations to increase measures to control terrorist actions  such as the ones that occurred last week. "I am not willing to  allow actions of terrorism and intimidation against the  population, including media sources, to be repeated," he warned.    He emphasized that he will adopt the necessary  constitutional  and legal dispositions which will not affect the referendum or  its results. "I will act according to the powers the  Constitution grants me to counter acts of terrorism, people who  disrupt public order, and illegal demonstrations or actions," he  concluded.</p>

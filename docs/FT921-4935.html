			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Azeri leader defies critics over Nagorno-Karabakh AZERBAIJAN'S President Ayaz Mutalibov last night rounded on nationalist opponents demanding his resignation, saying they were using him as a scapegoat for the country's losses in fighting over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Baku. He told an emergency parliamentary session: 'You are making a special scenario to get rid of me.' Mr Mutalibov is accused by the nationalist opposition of failing to help Azeri fighters in the four-year-old conflict following recent gains by their Armenian foes. Nagorno-Karabakh is populated mostly by Armenians but administered by Azerbaijan since 1923.</p>

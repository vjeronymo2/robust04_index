			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry source at the Defense </F> Ministry on 5 May -- read by announcer]    [Excerpts] In continuation of the bloody events by the  adventurist gang of al-Ahmar family, this bloody gang exploded  the military situation in numerous areas and positions with the  aim of launching our people and their armed forces into a  crushing all-out war. This followed the iniquitous aggression  by the forces of the Republican Guard, the Central Security, and  the military police against the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp in  Dhamar town where this daring brigade confronted, with rare  heroism and outstanding bravery, the multitudes of these  aggressive forces and inflicted a crushing defeat on them.    At exactly 9 o'clock on 4 May, a unit of the Central  Security  carried out an act of aggression against Sawlaban Camp and an  attack on Aden international airport in an attempt to occupy it  or destroy it. However, this attempt quickly failed. Our  forces managed to settle the situation quickly in their favor,  and the battalion of military police refused to obey the orders  of Sanaa to fight against their brothers, the sons of all the  Yemeni people. All the battalion's members joined our forces.  [passage omitted]    And in a dangerous development of the military and political  situation, the adventurist gang in Sanaa resorted to using  military aircraft. The citizens of Aden this morning were  surprised by a pair of warplanes attacking Aden international  airport, but our vigilant air defenses confronted this attack  which did not achieve any success worth mentioning.    In response, our fighter aircraft attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz,  and  al-Hudaydah airport, paralyzing these airports to stop them from  being used by this (?reckless) gang in its bloody criminal acts  against our people. While the Defense Ministry decisively  confronts the adventurist acts of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar  family, it notes with extreme gratification that many members of  our armed forces and units who are under the control of the  Sanaa gang, have refused to fight against their brothers.  Another large number joined our forces who are defending unity  and democracy. [passage omitted]</p>

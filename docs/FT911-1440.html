			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Targeting tactic rewards Democrats IT HAS long been an article of the third party's faith that it invariably does better in local elections than its standing in national opinion polls suggests. Even so, Thursday's results were well beyond the Liberal Democrats' expectations. The party made unprecedented net gains of more than 500 seats, and not only kept control in their three councils, but won control of 17 others. Their victories came mostly from councils in the south and south-west such as Gosport in Hampshire, which had been under no overall control. Even so, six - including Lewes in East Sussex, Newbury in Berkshire, and Poole in Dorset - passed straight from the Tories. There were also more than 14 councils where the Liberal Democrats became the largest single party. The party's claim that 'Labour is not immune' from their advance was not, however, substantially borne out by the results. The Liberal Democrats gained only one council from Labour - Wear Valley in Durham - and in none of those where they became the largest party did they take that position from Labour. The Liberal Democrat campaign worked, party strategists believe, because it concentrated on key areas where the party has a base both in terms of local councils and in the challenge for the parliamentary constituency. Such a targeted approach meant good use of resources where it counted. Losses in areas where the party has been traditionally weak, as in some metropolitan councils, were more than offset by gains that tipped the balance of power. Apart from the targeting, which will also be a feature of the general election campaign, the party leadership believes that two other decisions were crucial to the success. The first was that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, should spend most of the campaign on tour in the target areas. Instead of being tied to Westminster press conferences that were unlikely to gain extensive media coverage, he generated local and regional media attention. Party officials concede that the tactic risked leaving the national campaign exposed, but say that one of the reasons it worked was the Tories' policy of not matching Labour's daily press conferences. The second decision was to differentiate the campaign from that of Labour and the Tories by concentrating on local issues, and accusing the two main parties of using the elections as just a dress rehearsal for the general election. Officials believe that focusing on local issues rather than the poll tax meant that the party's campaigning was not knocked off course by the announcement of a move to the council tax. Mr Ashdown acknowledged yesterday that the localised campaign might make it harder for Thursday's gains to be consistently reflected in a general election. However, he said Liberal Democrat parliamentary victories, such as those in his own seat of Yeovil in Somerset and the by-election win at Eastbourne in East Sussex, often followed local-government successes. The factor that led Liberal Democrats to do better locally than nationally was diminishing, he said. The Tories in particular will be trusting that he may be wrong.</p>

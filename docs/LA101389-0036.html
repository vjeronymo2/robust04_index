			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BLACKOUT' IN THE USUAL PSYCHO-THRILLER STEW  </P> <P> A clean, sunny, all-American town; a nubile blonde wandering distractedly  through the streets; her crazy relatives; her attentive old boyfriend. . . .  </P> <P> That's all part of the usual psycho-thriller stew in "Blackout" (at selected  theaters) and director Doug Adams doesn't handle it any more notably than  dozens of other copycats who have preceded him. Hitchcock set the rules of the  game and Roman Polanski, in "Repulsion," gave them baroque embellishments. But  the only real distinction of this sub-"Psycho," sub-"Marnie" lady-in-peril  pastiche lies in the fact that "Psycho's" original scenarist-adapter, Joseph  Stefano, was coaxed back into refashioning Adams' script.  </P> <P> Beyond that, it's one more dive into the skeleton closet of twisted sex,  voyeurism and murder. Here, Adams gives us yet another beautiful, disturbed  young woman -- Gail O'Grady as Carolyn Boyle, wandering through yet another  town crawling with guilty secrets.  </P> <P> Summoned by a letter from her long-missing father, Carolyn returns to her Santa  Paula hometown. She gets a great greeting: Her mom (Carol Lynley) points a  shotgun at her and tells her to get out of town; her smarmy Uncle Alan (Michael  Keys Hall) grins and fawns over her and pretties up her old room, and her old  boyfriend Luke (Joseph Gian) tags around like an obtuse puppy dog.  </P> <P> Santa Paula proves to be one of those mysteriously half-deserted places where  guilty secrets, violence and repressed desire lurk under a bucolic surface and  people stay taciturn unless they have an important plot development to  disclose.  </P> <P> Whatever is going on involves bloody screwdrivers and horrible flashbacks, sex,  slaughter and creepy memories -- and something vile that happened in Carolyn's  bedroom. People either get lost in enigmatic musings or wander up and down  staircases, paralyzed with dread. Peep-holes are drilled through the floors,  smudge-pots go up in the orange grove outside, mysterious deaths accumulate and  broad hints are dropped constantly about grisly goings-on in the attic.  </P> <P> Cliche after banality after questionable twist pours out of the movie's macabre  jack-in-the-box. There's no way to become more than passively interested in any  of it. "Blackout" (Times-rated Mature for sex, language, nudity and violence)  shows a commendable effort to convey menace through atmosphere and camera  movement rather than accelerating blood and gore. And Hall's smarmy uncle and  Joanna Miles' frightened old flame have a few good moments. Other than that,  you'd have to be in a 20-year blackout yourself not to guess what will happen  in the attic or to care very much when it does.  </P></p>

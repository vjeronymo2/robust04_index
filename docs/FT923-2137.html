			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (5): Lambeth walks a tightrope - How three City Challenge winners will spend the money EVER SINCE the 1981 city riots, which shook the British establishment, Brixton, in south London, has been synonymous with urban blight, deprivation and racial tension. Since Lambeth, its parent borough, also happens to be one of the two 'red Ls' which did so much to foster Tory hatred of local government in the 1980s (Liverpool being the other), the central/south London borough's success in winning Pounds 37.5m to redevelop central Brixton in this year's second round of City Challenge merits a note of its own. If City Challenge were a competition to find the 20 most run down areas in the country, Lambeth would win every time. It has a higher number of unemployed than any other London borough, and nearly a third of them live in central Brixton. The borough has the second highest proportion of lone parents in London, a quarter (5,000) of whom live in Brixton. Unemployment in Brixton is around 30 per cent (against 12 per cent for London as a whole). Barely one in eight of its residents are professional or managerial, and only one in four of its properties is owner occupied (against 58 per cent for England and Wales as a whole in 1981). That litany may paint too bleak a picture. The Brixton of 1981 was a whole lot more run-down than it is today. The area directly opposite Brixton station has been redeveloped and now looks much like any other south London high street, featuring a large Body Shop and an attractive shopping arcade. Relations between the police and the ethnic communities are also improved. As for Lambeth council, its glossy, pro-business, cross-party City Challenge would have been inconceivable in the days of 'Red Ted' Knight. Rumour has it that the borough's far left was waiting for the bid to fail to condemn its very attempt as a sell out; if so, its success can only strengthen the efforts of Mr Stephen Whaley, Lambeth's moderate leader, to bring Lambeth back into the Labour mainstream. Mr Whaley chaired the City Challenge steering group and made a persuasive presentation to Environment Department ministers. The area behind Brixton station is the focus of the City Challenge programme. The project's flagship is a P &amp; O Developments scheme to redevelop the 230,000sq ft zone into a mixed office, retail and market area, in conjunction with Lambeth and London Transport. Unlike so much so-called 'regeneration' in past decades, the plan builds on the existing community, preserving the street market and Electric Avenue's shopping arcade, and providing for a new retail centre, office space, a leisure centre, and a facelift for the shabby buildings and streets in the area. The aim, says the blurb, is 'to lift Brixton to a level where it can once again become a self-sustaining town centre which fully meets the needs of local people'. Whether any integral part of London needs to be fully 'self-sustaining' is debatable, but if the development brings more vitality and business, and a greater sense of safety, to the centre of Brixton it will have achieved enough. That one project accounts for half of the Pounds 80m budgeted to come from the private sector as a result of City Challenge. To match P &amp; O's Pounds 40m, City Challenge will put up Pounds 8m - without which, say P &amp; O, they could not have contemplated going ahead with the scheme for 'some time.' City Challenge has not just brought funding: it concentrated the council's mind on the planning aspect, and an outline planning consent has been granted. Mr Basil Winham, P &amp; O's deputy chairman, was a member of the City Challenge Steering Group, and closely involved in the submission. 'City Challenge has brought the council together with the private sector in an entirely new way,' says Ms Bernadette Mardram, an assistant director of Housing at Lambeth, seconded to manage the City Challenge bid. 'It's been a holistic process - a genuine coming together of businesses, the council, local schools, the police, traders and voluntary organisations.' Ms Mardram's office in Brixton's 'Enterprise Centre' is provided by BAT, the tobacco and insurance conglomerate, which has also seconded an employee full-time to work on the project. Mr Brian Hutchinson, of BAT, was a member of the steering group and went with Mr Whaley to press Lambeth's case before ministers. The police seconded an officer to help prepare the bid, and will give another for the implementation. For the rest, the programme is a compilation of 65 projects - some of them fairly definite development plans, others little more than pious aspirations. There is a strong emphasis on education and training: everything from an 'attendance improvement project' (City Challenge Pounds 215,000, council Pounds 50,000), under which teaching staff will be trained in methods to reduce truancy, to a new Careers and Employment Guidance Centre (City Challenge Pounds 200,000, council Pounds 2.3m, Training and Enterprise Council Pounds 400,000, Employment Service Pounds 1.3m), which will locate the local careers service and adult guidance project in single premises, together with the Employment Department's one-stop advice and benefits shop, and a TEC-funded Action Planning Service. Now comes the nitty gritty of producing an action plan and turning 'bare bones' schemes into formal contracts. The implementation of City Challenge will be managed by Brixton Challenge Limited, a 'hands-off' company set up for the purpose. Lambeth will appoint only three of the 14 directors of Brixton Challenge and, given the cross-party nature of the programme, even they will not simply be the voice of the ruling Labour group. Lambeth's City Challenge programme is dressed up like a corporate plan. It begins with a 'vision', specifies objectives, then outlines strategy with maps and statistics galore. The 'vision' is 2,000 jobs, 8,000 training places, and turning Brixton into 'the centre of multicultural entertainment and shopping in south London.' Watch this space.</p>

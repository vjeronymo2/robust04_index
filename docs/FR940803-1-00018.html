If a credit union provides one document for several types of accounts, members must be able to understand clearly which disclosures apply to their account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Consistent terminology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A credit union must use the same terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be disclosed. For example, if a credit union describes a monthly fee (regardless of account activity) as a ``monthly service fee'' in account opening disclosures, the same terminology must be used in its periodic statements and change-in-terms notices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->  (b) General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Terms and conditions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Credit unions are required to have disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the credit union and a member at the time the member opens the account. This provision does not impose any contract terms or supersede state or other laws that define how the legal obligations between a credit union and its membership are determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Specificity of legal obligation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A credit union may use the term ``monthly'' to describe its compounding or crediting policy when dividends are compounded or paid at the end of each calendar month or for twelve periods during the year even if actual days in each period vary between 28 and 33 days. Use of estimates is prohibited in TISA disclosures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Foreign language. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Disclosures may be made in any foreign language, if desired by the board of directors of a credit union. However, disclosures must also be provided in English, upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Relation to Regulation E <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation, such as when:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> A credit union changes a term that triggers a notice under Regulation E, and the timing and disclosure rules of Regulation E are used for sending change-in-terms notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A member adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the credit union provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation E, including disclosure of fees before the member receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR &sect;205.7.) If the credit union complies with the timing rules of Regulation E, fees related to electronic services (such as balance inquiry fees imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required to be disclosed by this regulation, but not by Regulation E, may also be provided at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A credit union relies on Regulation E's disclosure rules regarding limitations on the frequency and amount of electronic fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any limitation on the number of ``intra-institutional transfers'' from other accounts at the credit union during a given time period must be disclosed, even though those transfers are exempt from Regulation E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Multiple members <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  When an account has multiple natural person member accountholders, delivery of disclosures to any member accountholder or agent authorized by the accountholder satisfies the disclosure requirements of part 707. In the case of a joint account in a credit union, disclosures may be made to a nonmember holding a joint account with a member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

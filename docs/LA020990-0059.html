			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: THE COSTUME RERUNS  </P> <P> The Fashion Industry Friends of AIDS Project Los Angeles have been scurrying  around town begging and borrowing memorable movie costumes for their Feb. 23  benefit, "Fashion in Film -- the Hollywood Years." As a result, Scarlett's  barbecue dress, Jezebel's red satin ball gown, and Cleopatra's column of gold,  circa 1960, will all be on the runway that night, as will other originals by  Hollywood's legendary costumers -- Adrian, Edith Head and Jean Louis included.  Unfortunately, some of the greats got away. Audrey Hepburn's Ascot gown from  "My Fair Lady," stored in a plastic garbage bag in Baltimore, got pitched out  with the trash, explains costumer Donfeld, a consultant on the show. All the  more reason to see the treasures that have been unearthed intact. For ticket  information, call (213) 962-1600, Ext. 286.  </P> <P> MADONNA SIGHTING: On a recent Friday night at Club Louie, Madonna joined the  fashion crowd for a little dancing. Herb Ritts and Matthew Rolston were in  attendance as she jumped on the banquettes to do her solo go-go number. Doffing  her blouse to beat the heat she spent the rest of the evening wearing only her  black bra and mini skirt. Escort Warren Beatty spent his time looking bored and  jowly, sitting in the corner.  </P> <P> NEW FOR NECKS: The neck ornament for the new decade, joining the likes of peace  signs, ankhs and gold chains, may very well be the "1990 World." It's the  newest way to say "Have I shown the pictures of my grandchildren?" The sterling  silver orb opens to reveal an accordion of photo frames. The necklace was  conceived by Los Angeles jewelry designer Christina Solomon and comedian Jamie  Monroe. Bob Hope and Aaron Spelling have bought them and Monroe says Cher is  wearing one on her "Heart of Stone" album cover. They can be purchased by mere  mortals for $90 at Bullock's.  </P></p>

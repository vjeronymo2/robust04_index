			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received]--In an interview with a  UNIAN correspondent on 15 April, Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko,  deputy commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, pointed out:  "Practice shows that the Black Sea Fleet command is resorting to  a show of strength ever more often. In particular, on the eve  of the election of the president of Crimea, a large group of  ships put to sea without any agreement with the authorities of  Ukraine and Crimea and without them being aware of this. Yet  another proof of this is the fact that they put to sea on a mass  scale on 14-15 April, i.e. on the days when the Odessa incident  had not yet been settled, when the issue of the Black Sea Fleet  was to be considered at the meeting of the heads of state of CIS  in Moscow."    In connection with this, the rear admiral believes that,  proceeding from Ukrainian legislation and the norms of  international law on the territorial supremacy of the law, it  would be expedient that the Black Sea Fleet commander coordinate  all issues related to the use of the training ground by the  Black Sea Fleet forces with the commander of the Naval Forces of  Ukraine.    The latter, in Ryzhenko's opinion, should also give his  consent for the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels under the St.  Andrew flag and the state flag of the Russian Federation to  enter and leave the territorial internal waters and ports of  Ukraine. The redeployment of military units, movements of  military detachments, and transfer of military cargo within the  boundaries of Ukraine's territory must be carried out with the  consent of the chief of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed  Forces.    The rear admiral also believes that combat training  grounds--both sea- and land-based--located within the limits of  the state territory and in Ukraine's defined Black Sea  territorial waters, must be subordinated to the Naval Forces of  Ukraine, while it would be expedient to make Ukraine's Naval  Forces aviation commander responsible for air traffic control on  the territory of Crimea.</p>

Senior Lebanese Army  intelligence officers and a high-ranking U.S. diplomat received  the delegation at al-Masna' on the Lebanese-Syrian border.    The delegation began its mission with a visit to 'Ayta  al-Fakhkhar, where it met the mayor and the parish priest. The  delegation visited the town's cemetery and took a sample of  bones.    At 1315, the delegation left for al-Sultan Ya'qub for a  meeting with some of the town's inhabitants. The delegation  seeks to gather information about the fate of missing Israeli  soldiers in Lebanon.    Hizballah's Consultative Council member Nabil Qawuq today  held a news conference in which he called for the release of all  the Lebanese, Palestinian, and Arab detainees in Israel in  return for the release of an Israeli soldier held by Hizballah.  He reiterated Hizballah's refusal to negotiate with the U.S.  Congressional delegation.</p>

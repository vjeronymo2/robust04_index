			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT FREES 4 JAILED IN BRITISH PUB BOMBINGS  </P> <P> In a landmark decision, a British appellate court Thursday exonerated three  Irishmen and an Englishwoman serving life sentences for terrorist pub bombings  near London in 1974 that killed eight people and injured 90.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel acted after an attorney representing the government said  the convictions of the so-called Guildford Four were based on evidence  "concocted" by police investigators.  </P> <P> The decision touched off calls for reviews of other cases of terrorist activity  on behalf of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which opposes British rule in  Northern Ireland. It also spurred demands for new legal procedures that would  give greater protection to accused criminals, particularly in cases that hinge  on confessions.  </P> <P> The Guildford Four, so called because the most lethal of the bombings took  place in a town by that name southwest of London, originally confessed but then  -- at their 1975 trial -- recanted and accused the police of coercion.  Prosecutors offered no corroborating physical evidence.  </P> <P> The convictions were upheld in 1977 even after three other people, all IRA  members, confessed to the attacks.  </P> <P> The four defendants were set free after Thursday's hearing. However, one of  them, Paul Hill, 35, was immediately rearrested in connection with a life  sentence he is serving concurrently for the murder of a British soldier in  Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> The appellate court's action followed a long campaign on behalf of the four by  such prominent groups and individuals as Amnesty International, two former home  secretaries and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The British news media said it  was the first time that an IRA terrorist conviction has been reversed in  England.  </P> <P> Defendant Gerard Conlon, 35, was the first to emerge from the courtroom.  Shaking with emotion and flanked by his two sisters, Conlon shouted: "I've been  in prison for 15 years for something I didn't do, for something I didn't know  anything about."  </P> <P> Patrick Armstrong, 39, and Carole Richardson, 32, were also released but  avoided reporters.  </P></p>

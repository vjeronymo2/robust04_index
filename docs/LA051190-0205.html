			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RUHLMANN AFTER ANOTHER BIG STAKES WIN  </P> <P> Ruhlmann is named for an interior designer in Germany who did exquisite work  for the horse's owners, Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss, and he does exquisite work on  the race track when he is at his best.  </P> <P> "When he runs a big race," trainer Charles Whittingham said, "it is very, very  big. When he puts in a bad one, it is bad."  </P> <P> Coming off two huge stakes victories at Santa Anita, Ruhlmann is the 5-2  favorite in the $1-million Pimlico Special Saturday.  </P> <P> In a 10-horse field where With Approval, the Canadian Triple Crown winner, is  sixth choice at 10-1, Ruhlmann is eligible to be beaten. But that is never  really easy.  </P> <P> Calumet's Criminal Type (8-1 Saturday) ran Ruhlmann down in the 9-furlong San  Antonio the last time he was beaten, but he had to shadow him through a  half-mile in :45 2/5 and three-quarters in 1:09 4/5.  </P> <P> Whittingham was asked which of the field he thought might "go with" Ruhlmann's  speed. "If there is any (early speed)," the 77-year-old trainer said, "they  won't go with him for very long."  </P> <P> Ruhlmann, by Mr. Leader, was a relative bargain for the Mosses (he founded  A&amp;M records and the A is for Alpert). Trainer Bobby Frankel picked him,  sight unseen, out of the Keeneland yearling sale for $40,000 and he has won  $1,564,353. But it wasn't simple.  </P> <P> As a 3-year-old, Ruhlmann was scary, and Whittingham thinks he might have  scared himself as well as his owners, trainer and the competition.  </P> <P> Ruhlmann made everybody nervous when Frankel brought him to the 1988 Florida  Derby. In his only race that year he had run away in the El Camino Real at Bay  Meadows. Made the 9-5 favorite, he bled and ran eighth.  </P> <P> Given the appropriate medication, Ruhlmann went in the California Derby at  Golden Gate in April. He was on the lead in the stretch when a horse clipped  heels from behind. A third horse joined the collision and the winner, All Thee  Power, was fatally injured when he went down after the wire.  </P> <P> Ruhlmann's injuries weren't serious but the accident aggravated a bone chip in  his knee. After arthroscopic surgery he came back to the track in August. On  Oct. 2 he won the Jamaica Handicap in New York, where medication is not  permitted.  </P> <P> "He's still hyper sometimes," Whittingham said. "That was a bad crash he had,  and horses don't forget things like that.  </P></p>

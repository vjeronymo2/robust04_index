			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Alexandra slips into overall deficit Alexandra Workwear, Europe's largest workwear supplier, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 500,000 over the 12 months to February 1. The outcome - struck after exceptional rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.5m incurred in the first half - compared with a profit of Pounds 5.3m last time, a figure restated from Pounds 6.6m to reclassify extraordinary items above the line. The group has now completed a three-year capital investment programme. Mr John Prior, chairman and chief executive, said this would allow it to expand its customer base, sales and services. Turnover declined to Pounds 57.2m (Pounds 63.1m). Interest charges increased to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.3m). Gearing stood at 73 per cent (69 per cent) at the year-end. Losses per share emerged at 0.8p (earnings of 10.8p). The final dividend is cut to 1.8p bringing the total for the year to 3.6p (5p).</p>

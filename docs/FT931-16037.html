			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Partial peace pact signed in Somalia SOMALI warlords and faction leaders signed a partial peace agreement last night which fell far short of offering lasting peace to the country. Diplomats observing the signing of the hastily-drafted pact by all 15 warlords and faction leaders in Addis Ababa said the peace commitment of Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, the dominant warlord, was still uncertain. The signing occurred hours after one of the factions - the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, which controls a large swathe of northeastern Somalia - said it had fought off a heavy attack by Gen Aideed's gunmen yesterday morning, and captured 10 tanks. In the accord the 15 signatories agreed to hold a national reconciliation conference in Addis Ababa on March 15, in the middle of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The conference would aim to establish an interim assembly and executive authority which could pave the way for reconstruction and democratic elections. The Somalis also agreed on an immediate and binding ceasefire and cessation of hostile propaganda, and pledged to promote further dialogue and the free movement of Somalis inside the country. However, three critical issues were left to be decided by the factions over the weekend. Failure to agree on the three remaining points - the procedure for implementing a ceasefire and disarmament, the agenda and list of participants for the conference - could yet scupper the tentative agreement signed yesterday. Observers said the breakthrough after five days of talks came suddenly, as Gen Aideed, who had been blocking agreement, realised he was isolated both among Somalis and internationally after a US attack in Mogadishu on Thursday in which seven of his men died. They said he suddenly demanded a March date during Ramadan, after having consistently said the conference could not be convened before June. Political analysts say the signatories have no real political legitimacy and the power base of Gen Aideed and other warlords will quickly crumble as they lose their monopoly over food aid and guns. Many Somalis say it is in the warlords' interests to convene a national reconciliation conference quickly to hold on to their rapidly evaporating authority. US Marines in Mogadishu yesterday continued their policy of unofficial disarmament, confiscating weapons at a gun market and handing out food to other Somalis who turned in their rifles voluntarily.</p>

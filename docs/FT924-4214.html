			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provisions put Porter Pounds 5m in loss PROVISIONS amounting to Pounds 7.05m forced Porter Chadburn, the packaging and consumer products group, into pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.26m in the six months to October 2. The disposal of Gola, the sports equipment concern, was the main source of the charges which caused the turnround from profits of Pounds 2.87m last time. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.85p. The consumer products side, which includes the Head sports equipment brand, Adam Leisure, and fishing tackle distribution, was hit by a lack of consumer confidence and problems with creditworthiness in some smaller customers. Operating profits in the division's continuing businesses declined to Pounds 719,000 (Pounds 2.35m) on increased sales of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.5m). Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman, said there would be no further fall-out from the Gola disposal. Gola was sold to William Lamb (Holdings) in September, though Porter retains the Gola name for three years, in which time it is paid royalties. Lamb can buy the brand for Pounds 1.35m cash within the term and Porter can require that Lamb buy it for Pounds 800,000 at the end of the term. Sales in the packaging division grew to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 15.2m) and operating profits to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 1.42m). Lancer Labels, which was acquired for Pounds 14.9m in March, contributed Pounds 4.8m to sales and Pounds 600,000 to profits. Mr Dinkin said that the subsidiary, making 'long-run' labels for the food and drinks industry, lifted sales by 20 per cent and profits by more. Profits from specialist distribution fell to Pounds 379,000 (Pounds 576,000) on sales of Pounds 8.13m (Pounds 8.67m). Group operating profits fell to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 3.86m). But, said Mr Dinkin, the figure would have been Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.3m) after adjusting for Gola's losses prior to disposal. Losses per share were 5.52p (earnings 2.95p).</p>

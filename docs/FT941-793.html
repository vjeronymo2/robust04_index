			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Congress budget office puts the squeeze on Nasa US space officials breathed a sigh of relief when Congress last year spared the life of the space station by a single vote. Their hopes that the vote would be the last hurdle for the redesigned station are, however, turning out to have been premature. Fitting the space station into the overall budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is once again proving to be a hard task. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress's independent fiscal watchdog, warned last week that Nasa faces certain failure in its efforts to fund the space station within a budget that has been trimmed to Dollars 14.3bn for next fiscal year and is scheduled to stay below Dollars 14.6bn until the end of the century. 'The attempt to fit a programme that was projected to cost more than Dollars 20bn a year in the late 1990s into an annual budget of Dollars 14bn risks delay, mission failure and the loss of anticipated benefits,' the budget office said. The office suggested that Nasa could live on a Dollars 14.3bn budget if it concentrated only on manned space flight, including the space station and planning for eventual piloted missions to the moon and Mars. That would mean slashing back astronomy and physics missions, including the Hubble space telescope and the planned Earth Observation System. Alternatively, the budget office suggested an Dollars 11bn-a-year programme that would still conduct four shuttle flights a year, but concentrate on robot missions, eliminating the space station and moon projects. Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa's head, slammed the budget office report as 'defeatist,' saying it would destroy the essential balance between space flight, science and aeronautics in the agency's missions. But even some staunch Nasa supporters in Congress have been pushed to the brink. Congressman George Brown of California, chairman of the House of Representatives science, space and technology committee, warned that the space programme was 'in serious trouble'. He warned that if Nasa's budget were cut any further below the Dollars 14.3bn sought by the administration, he would be compelled to vote against the space station. Mr Brown is also concerned that the new space station plans may depend too much on a contribution from Russia. 'I'm in favour of co-operating with the Russians. But I don't favour co-operating with them to the extent that they could endanger the whole project by failing to meet their commitments,' he said. European partners in the space station, meanwhile, are extremely hesitant about committing more resources to the project, because of the repeated changes in US plans. 'European confidence in the US-led space station is at an all-time low,' Congressman James Sensenbrenner, the senior Republican spokesman on space issues, said after a tour of European space centres.</p>

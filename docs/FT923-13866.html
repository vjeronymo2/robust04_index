			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Arts: Reactions to vintage Verdi - Exhibition The way Europe looked at the start of 1867, it was taking a risk to designate the Universal Exhibition in Paris a symbol of peace and harmony. On July 1, prize-giving day, Napoleon III received the news he dreaded: Emperor Maximilian of Mexico had been shot by a firing squad. How one staunch republican reacted to the news is the theme of a highly original exhibition at the National Gallery: Manet: The Execution of Maximilian. Maximilian's story reads like vintage Verdi. He was an under-employed young Habsburg who, disastrously, agreed to let a French expedition install him in Mexico. The French army pulled out when the Americans turned menacing and the republicans, led by Benito Juarez, too strong to smash. The emperor's wife, Charlotte, begged for perfidious Napoleon's help, then went mad. She was shut up in a castle in Belgium and died in 1927. Maximilian's troops were overwhelmed, he was tried, then shot at the Hill of Bells with Generals Miramon and Meja. The whole of Europe was enthralled by the tragedy. For Edouard Manet, it suggested a painting which would pull in the crowds at his one-man exhibition which still had months to run. At once he started a monumental canvas showing the instant when the bullets found their mark. In fact, as he learnt, the wretched Emperor needed to be finished off with a double coup de grace from the figure Manet shows waiting on the right. As more and more such details of the execution appeared in the newspapers, Manet started afresh. In the end, he painted three versions. These now hang together for the first time this century: the first version from Boston, the National Gallery's own fragmentary second version which was rescued by Degas after Manet's death, and the completed version from the Stadtische Kunsthalle in Mannheim, where the exhibition will also be seen. One change was to replace the Mexicans' sombreros and flared trousers with the correct, French-style uniforms. The emperor was shown grasping the Indian general's hand, and in the Mannheim version the execution takes place by a cemetery wall, over which peek a crowd of grieving Indians. Sunlight floods the scene and behind the mourning cypresses the sky is a brilliant blue: Maximilian reportedly said: 'I always hoped to die on a day such as this.' However, Manet's realism did not mean that he felt bound to produce a substitute for a non-existent photograph. Juliette Wilson-Bareau's fascinating exhibition book, (National Gallery, Pounds 12.95) brings out still more clearly the wilful discrepancies in the Mannheim version. The generals were shot in the back as traitors. Maximilian did not stand, Christ-like, in between them. Mexican soldiers did not wear spats, but Manet's composition needed the slashes of white against black. How strongly the bold simplicity of military uniforms appealed to Manet's eye, we see from his famous portrait of the boy fife-player, lent by the Musee d'Orsay. Another of the exhibition's themes is political censorship. As usual, the censors were inconsistent and ineffectual. Whereas the press were allowed to churn out heart-rending accounts of the Mexican disaster, the censors in advance banned both Manet's painting and his superb lithograph. However, they were defeated by a bizarre craze for cartes de visite photographs showing the firing-squad, Maximilian's mummified corpse, and his bullet-shredded shirt. For Manet's circle, the accessible version of his masterpiece was the intensely dramatic oil-sketch, on loan for the show from Copenhagen. He gave it to his last mistress, Mery Laurent, who hung it behind her piano. Lithographs and a remarkable watercolour from Copenhagen show Manet's anguished response to the Paris Commune of 1871. It is a little uncomfortable to discover Manet actually went to watch a military execution of Communards. But then, it is the triumph of this exhibition to present a Manet who is not the dandy, strolling about Paris in search of 'the heroism of modern life', in Baudelaire's famous phrase. Here instead, is a painter of popular icons of heroism. Although it is somewhat diluted in Manet's portraits of left-wing politicians, old-fashioned heroism is at full strength in his scene of the naval battle between the English and the Americans and in The Escape of Rochefort, the 'red' aristocrat and journalist. Bravery in fancy dress made the bullring irresistable to Manet, even before he visited Spain. His Dead Toreador from Washington is immaculate in black and white, a trickle of dark blood under his shoulder. Yet another coup de theatre is for this famous painting to be seen beside a little-known 17th-Century Italian painting, The Dead Soldier. This extraordinarily haunting work has been in the National Gallery since 1865. Previously, it was in a Paris collection, where Manet could have seen it and - given that it was considered to be by Velazquez - he almost certainly did. As one critic pointed out at the time, the two corpses look remarkably alike. Yet we also learn from the artists' very different intentions. The soldier is a vanitas image, meant to make viewers reflect on the futility of worldly ambition. Manet's painting belongs to a secular age: what counts is the gaze of the public, not that of the Deity. In the bullring, as on the Hill of Bells, it took a mere split-second to end a man's life. The artist could take that instant and, through the magic of his brush edit it into an enduring monument to the nobility of the human spirit. National Gallery, London. Manet runs to 27 September.

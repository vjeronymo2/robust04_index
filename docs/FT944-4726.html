			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance funding flaws Sir, Despite the enthusiasm voiced by Training and Enterprise Councils for greater performance-related funding for government schemes (The Budget: 'Tecs hail funding change as boost for unemployed', December 1) those organisations which actually deliver training for the unemployed are less convinced. Performance-related funding is already set at 40 per cent for most such organisations. Those which support the most disadvantaged among the unemployed report that this system forces them to think increasingly selectively about who they can afford to take on. Tecs will no doubt insist that they now weight payments to take account of this. But their definition of 'special needs' can often be a narrow one. Essentially, performance-related funding assumes the unemployed are making rational decisions in a rational labour market. No allowance is made for trainees who fail an exam, for those who simply walk away before completing a course, or for the possibility that there simply may be no job vacancies at the end. Training providers have to pay the price for this fantasy, knowing there is a perfectly justifiable case for paying them on the training weeks they deliver on behalf of Tecs. Ian Brown, enterprise &amp; training officer, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, 18-19 Claremont Crescent, Edinburgh EH7 4QD</p>

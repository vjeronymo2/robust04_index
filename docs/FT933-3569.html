			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dresdner, BNP open joint bank in Russia DRESDNER BANK and Banque Nationale de Paris have opened a joint subsidiary in St Petersburg in the first inauguration of a bank wholly-owned by foreigners in Russia since the Bolshevik revolution. Set in the former German embassy in St Petersburg, BNP-Dresdner Bank (Rossija) has a capital of Dollars 10m and a staff of 80. However, a cloud was cast on the opening by the Russian parliament's proposed ban on foreign banks dealing with Russian customers. It is due to decide on Friday whether to finally enact this restriction, which would go into force next January and last until 1996. The law confining foreign banks to dealing with foreign clients has been pushed through parliament by powerful Russian commercial banks fearing foreign competition. It is opposed by President Boris Yeltsin, the government, the central bank, and parliament's own sub-committee on banking. They see foreign banks, five of which have already received full banking licences, as a source of western banking expertise and foreign investment. One central bank official said yesterday he feared last-minute lobbying by the government and the central bank would fail to prevent parliament from going ahead with the law. Another, however, was quoted as saying the central bank would ignore any parliamentary ban. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg mayor who wants to restore the city to its pre-revolutionary role as Russia's banking centre, hailed 'the courage and wisdom of the two banks in braving the risks to set up their bank'.</p>

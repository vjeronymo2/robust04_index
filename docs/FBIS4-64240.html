			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic: "Air </F> Strikes -- United Nations Must Act"]    [Text] Europe also becomes guilty of the genocide in  Bosnia-Herzegovina because it allows the Belgrade government to  pursue its plan of a greater Serbian empire unimpeded.    We call on the community of peoples to make it unmistakably  clear to the Belgrade regime that it cannot keep the towns and  villages that it conquered with brute force, and that the state  borders must not be changed. The United Nations must no longer  act as a neutral mediator, it must act and carry out air strikes  against those who violate the UN resolutions. The Belgrade  government must know that it can no longer attack UN protected  areas unpunished and fetch its heavy weapons from UN depots at  will to continue the genocide somewhere else -- in Brcko  probably.    I appeal to Chancellor Kohl to help us. Aggression must not  be rewarded. It must not be allowed that somebody who attacks a  home and kills the people living there can keep the house as a  reward. We call on the international community to convene a  large world peace conference.    Those who do not help in Bosnia-Herzegovina are putting a  fuse to a powder keg that may set Europe aflame. We want our  civilization to survive where laws and moral principles should  prevail and not murder and violence.</p>

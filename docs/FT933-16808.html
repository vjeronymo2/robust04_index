			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study reveals wide range of UK farm earnings THE TOP 25 per cent of arable farms in East Anglia, the UK's main grain-growing region, earn 176 per cent more per hectare than average farms in the same area. The latest government figures show that the average East Anglian combinable cropping farm had a net income of Pounds 131 a hectare and a gross margin of Pounds 592, according to a report to be launched at the Royal Agricultural Show this weekend. The top farms earned Pounds 362 a hectare on a gross margin Pounds 832. The report - Competing in Changing Markets - has been put together by Adas, the farming consultants and an executive agency of the Agriculture Ministry. It describes the gap between the high and average earners in the arable sector as 'startling'. 'We are seeing the introduction of more open market conditions in agriculture,' says Mr David Hall, Adas marketing director. This was beginning to highlight the difference between entrepeneurial and traditional farmers. 'The entrepreneurs are constantly looking for ways of reducing costs and opening up new opportunities for growth,' says Mr Hall. 'Some farmers appear less willing to do so, either through complacency or simply because they are happy with a lower return. 'But it is not certain how much longer they will be able to earn a living from a lower return,' he warns. On arable farms in the north of the country, average net income per hectare was Pounds 92 while the top farms earned Pounds 256, or 178 per cent more. In the south the average was Pounds 107, compared with Pounds 224 at the top farms. In the more controlled dairy sector, the difference between top and average performers was much narrower - between 8 and 13 per cent. Mr Hall argues that in order to survive, farmers will have to develop their business acumen and adopt a more market-led approach. 'We are entering an age of stiffening competition in which the safety net of EC support is wearing thin and the market is becoming increasingly global for UK Farming plc.' UK producers should capitalise on their high standards of hygiene, environmental friendliness and animal welfare, he suggests. They should also start to add value by processing their production, and collaborate with others in marketing. He points out that consumers last year spent Pounds 70bn on food, while UK agriculture's share was only Pounds 14bn. 'There is a massive opportunity for our farmers and growers - in the UK market alone - to seize a bigger share of consumer spend by moving up the food chain,' says Mr Hall.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Umar al-Muntasir, secretary of the Libyan </F> General People's Committee for External Liaison and  International Cooperation (foreign minister), by Sawsan  Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] Abu-Husayn: Do you believe there are  on the horizon encouraging signs of a peaceful solution to the  Lockerbie crisis?    Al-Muntasir: The Lockerbie crisis will be  resolved peacefully. There is no alternative. It is difficult  to set a date for that now. But we are seeking to achieve it as  soon as possible. What remains now is to agree on the  foundations for a solution with the Western parties within the  framework of some points proposed by the Arab League. I spoke  with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on  the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] conference and  agreed that the seven-member committee should convene after the  African summit scheduled to be held in Tunis within days. We  will discuss the two resolutions adopted by the NAM and the  African conference and ways of implementing them, especially as  NAM ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance of Security Council  Resolution 731 and stressed the need for the parties concerned  to secure a just settlement that safeguards all interests in  accordance with international law and the principles of the UN  Charter. Furthermore, the international community and its  organizations are showing solidarity with us vis-a-vis the  negative results caused by the embargo imposed on the country.  This is why there is an inclination to urge the Security  Council to take account of the Arab League's new proposal.    Abu-Husayn: On what basis are the Western parties  responding to a peaceful solution with Libya?    Al-Muntasir: There is a Western inclination to  ignore a peaceful solution with Libya, especially as its  moderate policy no longer threatens world security and peace.  It is always trying to find a just way out that meets  commitment to international laws. Best proof of this is Libya's  full withdrawal from the Aozou strip [Chad], even though this is  not in Libya's interests. That is, we lost the legal case but  preferred to fully respect the court's decision, while we see  the major states advocating international legitimacy and yet  they refuse to comply with it in numerous cases. [passage  omitted]    Abu-Husayn: What about the Security Council?  Will it take account of this commitment by Libya and thus allow  the gradual lifting of the embargo imposed on your country,  especially as it allowed UN observers to use planes to travel to  the Aozou strip?    Al-Muntasir: That step is regarded as a good  precedent in the United Nations, and we hope it will be a good  gesture and a good start for further steps toward lifting the  embargo on Libya. I personally am optimistic in this connection.  [passage omitted]</p>

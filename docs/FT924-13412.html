			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Forte Doubtless Sir Anthony Tennant and Sir Paul Girolami are not joining the Forte board simply to make up the numbers. The presence of such heavyweights should help develop a more coherent strategy. But if Forte thinks it is enough to restore its fortunes, then it could be in for a disappointment. The worrying side to yesterday's announcement was that Mr Rocco Forte will combine the position of chairman and chief executive. While retiring as chairman, Lord Forte will remain on the board. All the signs are that the family is determined to keep a grip just when outside help is badly needed. The dividend is uncovered. First-half profits fell 43 per cent on a 1991 period which was itself hit by the Gulf war. The company has failed to sell its Gardner Merchant contract catering business and appears to be dithering over expansion in Europe. In the absence of robust economic recovery, it is difficult to see how Forte can avoid some agonising decisions. It might have to consider a dividend cut. If Forte does sell Gardner Merchant and ploughs the proceeds into European hotel expansion, it will be shedding a cash-generative business for one which, in the initial stages, will not offer much by way of cash return. Perhaps the new non-executive directors will persuade Forte to swallow any necessary medicine. But even so, the short-run consequences for the share price may be negative. At 150p, Forte is trading on a historic multiple of 25. The market is making demands that are unlikely to be fulfilled.</p>

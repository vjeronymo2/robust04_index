			<p>BFN     KERM RECOMMENDS LAWS: The Council of Ministers' Economic  Commission (KERM) made a decision to recommend to the government  the following draft laws: concerning the sugar market's  regulation and ownership transformations in the sugar industry;  concerning amendments to the maritime code; concerning a law on  insurance for export contracts; and concerning a law on tasks  referred over to gminas (small administrative units) associated  with organizing and implementing agricultural reports. If the  draft laws become effective, the price of sugar may rise by 7  percent, shipyards will find it easier to finance shipbuilding,  while exporters will find it easier to export merchandise to the  countries of the former COMECON.

According to some calculations, a four-member family living in  a 60 square meters household will pay 161,200 zlotys more for  thermal energy in April than in March. Subsequent price  increases have been planned for: 1 July (by 15 percent), and 1  October (by 20 percent). (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I  Rynek Supplement) in Polish 29 Mar 94 p 7)    POPULAR PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM: The Ownership Transformations  Ministry informed during a press conference that the Popular  Privatization Program currently covers 367 enterprises and  companies, with a list of another 110 enterprises being prepared  and to be debated by the Council of Ministers' Economic  Commission after Easter. Six enterprises are on the list of  units excluded from the program. The program is of an open  nature so it will be possible to include more companies in it,  or -- if the program is successful -- repeat it in the future.  (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish  30 Mar 94 p 7)    TIRE FACTORY REPORT: The Olsztyn-based Stomil SA Tire  Factory  achieved the kind of economic results last year which are a good  indicator for the company's future. The company's net profit  was over 240 billion zlotys whereas the average salary among the  3,400-person employee crew was 6.2 million zlotys per month.  The company exports 25 percent of its products to 10 countries  around the world and it has invested $30 million in  redevelopment and modernization of production of supplementary  types of tires (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek  Supplement) in Polish 30 Mar 94 p 9)    SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES: According to Deputy Industry and  Trade Minister Edward Nowak, during its session on 30 March, the  Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted  the idea of establishing economic zones in line with the concept  of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. A special team will  prepare the final bill by 15 April. The special economic zones  are supposed to be established particularly in regions  characterized by high unemployment and by economic potential  that is not being used (Mielec). KERM recommends that such  zones also be established in areas close to the state's borders.  Among other things, the bill will ensure maximum tax allowances  and exemptions for companies which set up business there. This  solution would be initially treated as an experiment and only  three or four zones would be established within the next two or  three years (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement)  in Polish 31 Mar p 5)    EXPORTS DECREASING: According to Professor Urszula Plowiec,  the balance sheet of the economic policies of the consecutive  governments from 1989 is positive because it resulted in a rapid  economic growth, overcoming the recession, curbing inflation,  and stabilizing the unemployment level; however, all this  occurred at the cost of the development of exports. The authors  of the report believe that the fact that the share of exports in  the Polish Gross Domestic Product in recent years has been on  the wane results first of all from one fact: the Polish economy  was not adjusted to the requirements of foreign markets and  could not be changed before the economy was stabilized. Contrary  to optimistic forecasts by the government, this trend will be  maintained this year as well. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia  I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 31 Mar p 5)    MINISTER RETURNS FROM CHINA: Transportation Minister  Boguslaw  Liberadzki returned from a trip to China where he was heading a  Polish delegation. The seventh session of a Polish-Chinese  governmental commission resulted in an announcement that the  trade ties between the two countries in the year 2000 should  reach the level from 1986, that is over $1 billion. The current  negative trade balance will be eliminated by the end of 1994.  The Chinese owe Poland several dozen million Swiss francs which  they will pay back by supplying merchandise (Warsaw GAZETA  WYBORCZA in Polish 2-4 April 94 p 21)    BANK STOCKBROKERING PROFIT: In 1993, Bank Zachodni SA  reached  a profit of 18 billion zlotys on its stockbrokering activities  for the first time. The amount constitutes 2 percent of the  entire profit earned by the bank last year. This year, the bank  will make 30 billion zlotys worth of investments in order to  develop its stockbrokering services. The money will be spent  primarily on increasing the volume of technical equipment  (communications, computer network) and also on extending the  premises to cover additional sites. Currently, the bank has 60  branches throughout Poland but just 23 stockbrokering services  units (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 5 April 94 p 17)    FINANCIAL MOOD IMPROVING: The Main Commercial School's  Institute for Economic Development reports in its most recent  survey that optimism among Polish families regarding their  financial situation and moods, is clearly increasing. The  number of families whose situation did not deteriorate in the  last three months, is also on the increase. Polish families are  still mostly concerned with the big impact of price increases on  their situation, despite the fact that according to data by the  Main Statistical Office, price increases this year have been  much slower than last year. For the first time in many months,  a substantial portion of families reported an improvement in the  level of consumption of food products. The increase of optimism  was as much as over 10 percentage points compared with the  previous quarter. Factors shaping the situation of family  households are considered to be mainly associated with income  levels, savings levels, and optimism level with regard to the  future (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 5 April 94 p 14)    MARCH ECONOMIC INDICATORS: The indicator of the country's  economic situation increased by 2 percentage points in March  compared with February. It seems that trends of an economic  growth are becoming stable, as demonstrated by an increase in  both domestic and export-bound orders, an increase in the  productivity indicator (including with regard to export-bound  production), a fall in the reserves of ready-made products, and  also a decrease in the rate of price increases. (Warsaw  RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 6 Apr 94  p 7 )    PRICES INCREASES SLOW: According to the Finance Ministry,  prices on merchandise and services increased by 1.6 percent in  March. Food prices increased by 1.4 percent, alcohol prices --  by 4.4 percent, and prices on services -- by 1.7 percent. The  ministry predicts that throughout April, prices on consumption  items will increase by 2.1 percent even despite the fact that  this year's budget contained a 2.3-percent increase. (Warsaw  GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17)    PHONE EMPLOYEES RAISES: Employees of "Telekomunikacja Polska  SA" will receive 1.345 million- per-person raises before the end  of the year. This will cost the company about 1 trillion  zlotys. The first installment will take effect as soon as  April. The company's spokesman denied allegations by Sejm  Deputy Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party, that the raises  will be implemented at the cost of investment expenditures.  (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17)    HIGHWAY COMMISSION SESSION: A working inter-ministry group  for highway construction has held its first session. Individual  ministers and local governors have quite a lot of comments on a  draft law which is to be debated by the government in May and by  the Sejm in June. The program envisages construction of about  2,600 kilometers of highways by the year 2007. In order to  implement the program, apart from money, appropriate legislative  acts are also needed which would regulate the construction works  and the subsequent usage of the highways. With that goal in  mind, the Council of Minister's Economic Committee established  an inter-ministry group at the end of January, whose task is to  come up with all the necessary legal provisions. (Warsaw ZYCIE  WARSZAWY in Polish 8 Apr p 10)    CHANGES IN ECONOMIC POLICIES: During a meeting at the  American Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Trade Minister Marek  Pol announced a widening of the scale of state interventionist  policies. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was an  unofficial guest during the meeting. The minister's speech at  the Chamber is widely perceived as very important as a majority  of those present took it to be a sign of changes to come in  Polish economic policies. Minister Pol said that the branches  where restructuring will take place the soonest, are the  shipyard industry, steel works, the energy, fuel, and defense  industries. Plans for restructuring these ministries have  already been prepared. Minister Pol noted that the state will  only deal with the restructuring of the most important branches  while the others will have to find their own best ways for the  future. American businessmen were informed that the Polish  Government will not hesitate to introduce protectionist  measures, especially in those branches which will be subjected  to the restructuring process. Pol also said that he can see no  obstacles for foreign investors in Poland and he described the  requirement of prior Internal Affairs Ministry approval for  purchasing land in Poland -- which has been criticized by  American businessmen -- as a "normal procedure and also a  protection for the state against awkward situations."

The  pool's capabilities will make it possible to conduct oil  excavation for a period of 12 years, with an efficiency rate of  500,000 tons per year -- this according to Jan Kurek,  "Petrobaltic"s manager. The company is not just interested in  the Polish shelf. Currently, it is the only oil company in the  Baltic Sea which has the right equipment, experience, and  personnel to conduct oil exploration and excavation. Talks are  in progress regarding "Petrobaltic"s possible involvement at a  site near Kaliningrad. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 14 Apr 94  p 3)    TRADE WITH CROATIA: Croatian Economy Minister Nadan  Vidosevic  paid a visit to Warsaw where he stated that despite low levels  of trade exchange with Poland up to now, the situation is  getting back to normal. Vidosevic said that one can travel and  conduct business without any fear on about 75 percent of  Croatian territory, with trade restrictions being in effect only  in those regions of Croatia which are supervised by UN troops.  During the Warsaw talks, both sides agreed that there are  possibilities of increasing trade ties between the two countries  in areas like the tourist, textile, agricultural food,  electrotechnical, chemical, and petrochemical industries. Four  years ago, Croatia occupied the second place among the Yugoslav  republics, on the list of countries involved in trade exchange  with Poland. In 1993, the volume of exchange between the two  countries fell by 30 percent compared with 1990. (Warsaw NOWA  EUROPA in Polish 8-10 Apr 94 p 4)    ENVIRONMENT PACT WITH GERMANY: Polish and German Ministers  Stanislaw Zelichowski and Klaus Topfer signed an agreement in  Schwerin concerning cooperation in environmental protection.  Both sides will be exchanging information concerning the  location of environment-sensitive investments in the border  area. Minister Zelichowski said promises contained in the  German unification treaty concerning adaptation of East German  power stations to European Union standards by July 1996, will  not be met. Germany intends to build two new power stations in  the vicinity of the border with Poland. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY  in Polish 9-10 Apr 94 p 10)    AGENCY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: ARG is a partnership which  is entirely owned by the Treasury. On 16 March the state  contributed 4.567 trillion zlotys to ARG -- in the form of  shares of Universal (2,628,000), Export Development Bank (BRE)  (270,000 shares), and Elektrim (1,080,000); the agency will have  to pay dividends to the Treasury. In the future, the main  source of income for ARG will be economic activity (the  government will not give the agency any budget money). The  partnership is going to participate in undertakings requiring  the investment of substantial capital (construction of highways,  development of border-area infrastructure, restructurization of  the shipyard industry, or construction of the transit gas  pipeline running through Poland). In line with the economic  strategy adopted by the government, ARG intends to focus its  activity on the promotion of Polish exports. The company wants  to wage advertising-promotion campaigns and support small  private firms on foreign markets, and share profits with them.  (RZECZPOSPOLITA, 12 Mar 94 p 7)    MARCH PRODUCTION: Production rose by 16.6 per cent in March  as compared with February and it was higher by 12.3 per cent  than in 1993, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on  Monday. Also, building and assembly enterprises obtained better  results in March 1994 than in the previous month, with their  output rising by 15.6 per cent throughout last March. The  greatest production growth, by 19.4 per cent, was achieved last  March by a group of factories manufacturing food, clothes,  timber, paper and metal products, machines and installations as  well as furniture, medical tools and radio and tv sets.  Comparing results in March 1994 with 1993, production increased  in enterprises producing food and clothes by 14.8 per cent and  in plants supplying factories and private customers with water,  gas and electricity - by 2.2 per cent and in building and  assembly firms - by 7.6 per cent. In March 1994, mines achieved  better results than in 1993 by 4.8 per cent. (Warsaw PAP in  English 1558 GMT 18 Apr 94)    PARIS CLUB AGREES TO REDUCE DEBT: On Thursday, 14 April, the  Paris Club finally accepted a 50-percent reduction of the Polish  debt. This decision resolved the problem of the greatest part  of the Polish foreign debt, which in 1991 amounted to $33  billion. Until 2009, Poland will pay approximately $1 billion  less in annual interest; decreased will also be the amount of  basic capital. In April 1991, a 30-percent reduction was  confirmed; on Thursday, an additional 20-percent reduction was  discussed. This agreement was possible because Poland satisfied  the conditions made by the Paris Club. Nonetheless, it is  stressed in the press communique issued after the session that  the Paris Club reserves the right to change its decision,  depending on the implementation of the initial agreement with  the London Club. Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki  says that such a clause has only theoretical significance. It  also concerns other conditions of the agreement, that is,  Poland's continuing with market reforms and meeting its  obligations. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1)    MARCH INFLATION HIGHER: The Central Office of Statistics  reported on 15 March that prices of consumer goods and services  went up in March by an average of 2 percent -- the Finance  Ministry had estimated the March inflation rate at 1.6 percent.  In January, the monthly inflation rate was 1.6 percent, in  February -- 1.1 percent. Prices in March of this year were 30.2  percent higher that prices in March last year. The consumer  inflation rate in February was 29.9 percent. The March price  increase was caused, first of all, by prices of non-food goods,  which went up by 2.2 percent. The increase in food prices in  March was lower than the inflation index -- by 1.8 percent.  Prices for services increased by an average 1.8 percent. It  was first of all the result of increases in the official prices  for gas and electricity, which were originally scheduled for  February but deferred until March. The increase in prices for  services was limited by the 10-percent decrease in telephone  prices in March. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar went up  by 77 zlotys (at the National Bank of Poland) and by 44 zlotys  at exchange houses. The Finance Ministry predicts that in April  prices will increase by an average of 2.1 percent, or even less  because of the deferred increase in gasoline prices. (Warsaw  RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1)    KERM ACCEPTS PROGRAM: The Economic Committee of the Council  of Ministers (KERM) 1994-1997 accepted the socioeconomic program  as prepared by the Central Planning Administration (CUP). KERM  accepted the main points of economic development included in the  third basic option, recommended by CUP; state policy is aimed at  stimulating investment and export activity, and within the next  three years we will witness high, lasting, and balanced economic  growth. This option should result in increasing investments,  exports, and work efficiency, which, in turn, ought to restrict  unemployment and improve living standards. KERM proposed that  the Council of Ministers authorize CUP to submit the final  version of the program by 15 May; the report should take into  account the proposals of the various ministries as well as  remarks submitted at the committee's session on Friday, 15  April. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 5)    WAGES INCREASING: Even though in March the popiwek -- tax on  wage increases -- was still in force, before-tax wages, not  including dividends paid from company profits, were 8.8 percent  higher in February, it was reported on 16 April by the Central  Office of Statistics (GUS). Along with the profit dividends,  before-tax wages were 14.8-percent higher. The average wage  before taxes in the enterprise sector was 5,418,500 zlotys  (along with profits) and 4,993,700 zlotys (without the profit  dividends and balance surplus). Real wages (without the profit  dividends) increased in March by at least 6 percent. In  comparison with March 1993, before-tax wages were higher this  March by 37.1 percent, without the profit dividends -- by 35.9  percent. The prices for consumer goods and services increased  in the same period by 30.2 percent. The data suggest that the  Finance Ministry's forecast that consumer goods and services  will increase by only 2.1 percent in April is not very probable.  (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 18 Apr pp 1, 5)    TOLL ROAD CONSTRUCTION: At the beginning of next year, the  first licenses will be granted for the construction and  maintenance of five toll roads which, within a period of 15  years, will form a 2,571-km network in Poland of modern  high-speed highways of great domestic and international  importance -- this according to Andrzej Palatas, director of the  Polish Highways Agency. Highways mean not just better  transportation but also improvements in the general economic  situation and in employment, especially in areas adjacent to  them. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 15-17 Apr p 4)    TOBACCO PRIVATIZATION OBSTACLES: According to Ownership  Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, privatization of the  very profitable tobacco industry is made difficult by a need to  very thoroughly assess the value of the companies involved.  During a meeting with businessmen at the Krakow Industrial-  Commercial Chamber, Kaczmarek also said that the process  includes not just machinery and investment capital, but also a  large segment of the consumer market. Bogdan Pek, chairman of  the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission, announced during  the meeting that if the ministry officially proposes the sale of  the tobacco industry, then he will demand that the ministry's  leadership be dismissed (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 18 Apr p  3)    FOREIGN INVESTMENTS INCREASING: In 1993, foreign capital  investment in Poland exceeded $3 billion. The amount was lower  by more than 50 percent from a year ago -- this according to the  Institute of Foreign Trade Economic Situations and Prices. The  Americans have invested the most -- around $1 billion, and they  promise another billion in the future. The Italians occupy  second place on the list, with about $270 million (they promise  $970 million). The Germans, Austrians, Dutch, and Belgians are  also in the top ten. The Japanese are last on the list, with  about $9 million. This situation is bound to change since  Matsushita Battery Co. and the Dutch Philips Co. have just  signed an agreement to construct a battery plant in Gniezno.  The value of the project is estimated at over $35 million.  (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 19)    LOT SEEKS PARTNER: For over a year now, Lot Polish Airlines  has been looking for a strategic partner, which would strengthen  its position on transatlantic routes and which would help it  survive competition in the skies. All signs are that an  alliance will be concluded with one of two big U.S. carriers --  Delta, or American Airlines. To this day, it is not known which  one of them will eventually be LOT's partner, and because of new  proposals from both U.S. airlines, the talks have continued for  longer than expected. Transportation Minister Boguslaw  Liberadzki says that selling part of LOT is out of the question;  all that is being planned is a close alliance. An alliance with  a U.S. partner would create opportunities for LOT to increase  the volume of passengers flown across the Atlantic as well as  secure access to the huge U.S. market. Right now, LOT has  regular connections with only New York and Chicago. (Warsaw  GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 18 Apr p 14)    "GRAY ZONE" 20 PERCENT OF GDP: According to an independent  study released on Monday, April 18, Poland's unaccounted-for  business activity (also known as the "gray zone") stood at about  20 percent of official GDP in 1993, producing about 340 trillion  zlotys ($15 billion) in revenues. The revenue compared with 460  trillion zlotys ($20.5 billion) in official state budget  revenues and the GDP of 1,600 trillion zlotys ($71 billion).  The Main Statistical Office (GUS) and the Polish Academy of  Sciences (PAN) said the relatively high level of activity in the  "gray zone" followed rapid political and economic liberalization  and the accompanying recession since reforms began in 1989.  "The gray economy...is a normal element of any system, but its  role increases in times of political transition or economic  downfall," GUS and PAN have said. The report also said several  hundred thousand Poles work illegally and that the real number  of unemployed was considerably lower than the official figure of  close to 3 million. It is also estimated that illegal imports  reduced budget revenues by $1 billion a year because of unpaid  customs duties and taxes. The report also said 30 percent of  revenue in the "gray zone" was produced by totally unregistered  activity. The remainder was produced by registered companies  which did not completely account for their business. (Warsaw  NOWA EUROPA in English 19 Apr p 24)    BUSINESSMEN SUPPORT BUDGET: Businessmen who are members of  the Business Center Club (BCC) held a meeting on 18 April during  which they commented on the impact of events of the last few  months on the economic situation. "In our view, the restrictive  tax system and the increasing fiscal burdens, cannot be the only  source of revenue for the state" -- BCC representatives stated.  Despite these reservations, the businessmen support the budget  as a compromise solution and they are happy that the president  decided to sign it. They regard the lack of a deputy prime  minister for economic affairs and finance minister, as  unacceptable in a situation where reforms of the tax system and  a restructuring of enterprises are pending. According to the  businessmen, it is too soon to abandon popiwek (tax on excessive  wage increases) at this stage. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in  Polish 19 Apr p 13)    BUTTER EXPORTS: Poland received permission from GATT to  export 67,000 tons of butter to the countries of the former  USSR. According to the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry,  Poland is entitled to sell this much butter at any price,  without having to observe GATT minimum prices. The deadline for  applications to be submitted to the ministry is the end of May,  while the deadline for exports to be terminated is the end of  August. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 22 Apr p 17)    BALANCE OF PAYMENTS: National Bank of Poland (NBP) reports  that after two months this year, the deficit of current turnover  of the payment balance is $107 million. Last year it was over  three times larger -- $372 million. Only in February, was a  surplus of $84 million registered in the current turnover, and  exports exceeded imports by $50 million. According to NBP,  however, this may be accidental -- the dates of the  implementation of trade contracts may have coincided and  therefore, it is too early to say that this trend is lasting.  In the first two months of 1994, the receipts from exports  reached the level of $2.127 billion (20.4 percent more than in  1993); imports of goods, after two months, amounted to $2.227  billion, and compared to the same period last year, it increased  by 7.9 percent. Thus, after two months, the deficit of  commodity payments is $150 million. Compared to last year, the  geographic structure of the commodity exchange slightly changed:  the share of the developed countries, both in our exports and  imports, increased while the share of Central and Eastern Europe  dropped. The positive balance of services after two months was  $80 million, and increased significantly in comparison with the  same period last year (a surplus of only $2 million then). The  negative balance of interest payments was at the level of $133  million (a deficit of $112 million last year). Official gross  reserves after two months were $4.4 billion, which means an  increase of $87 million in comparison with January of this year.  (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 18 Apr p 13)    REGIONAL POLICY: This year it will be possible to spend  approximately 4 trillion zlotys on regional policy, not counting  other financial resources envisioned in the budget for various  purpose funds related to the restructuring of gminas (smallest  administrative units) and voivodships. The Economic Committee of  the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted the Principles of the  State's Regional Policy, prepared by the Central Planning  Administration (CUP), which envisions a more active regional  policy. According to Marcin Rybicki, under secretary of state  in CUP, some of the regions will not cope with their problems  without the aid of the state. Priorities of the regional policy  of European states are convergent with those of Polish regional  policy. This creates good conditions for cooperation in this  area with highly developed states. This cooperation will also  make it possible to use the financial resources of the European  Union earmarked for this purpose -- on the condition that our  budget must also allocate money for regional policy. This  condition is met. The 1994 Budget Law envisions a reserve of  297.2 trillion zlotys for restructuring programs and 573.5  trillion zlotys for infrastructure investments in regions  threatened with high unemployment; there will also be money for  supporting sector programs in industry; the restructuring is  supported by the Labor Fund as well. Aid from abroad includes,  first of all, the PHARE (Poland and Hungary Action for  Restructuring the Economy) STRUDER [not further identified] --  60 million ECU and the PHARE of Transfrontier Cooperation  program -- 55 million ECU. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 19  Apr p 8)    MINISTER ON CHINA VISIT: "Poland will widen its economic  cooperation with China. We can count on export contracts in  mining, the chemical industry, the energy industry, and the  aircraft industry," said Industry Minister Marek Pol on his  return from a visit to China. Due to its rate of economic  development and an absorbent market, China has been becoming an  attractive partner even for the biggest industrial powers.  Minister Pol's visit was intended to widen the contacts and to  strengthen Poland's position in the Chinese market. The visit  took place right after the seventh session by a joint  Polish-Chinese commercial commission. According to the  commission, the current volume of trade exchange with China is  $400 million. Poland also wants to join the program of Chinese  economic reforms. Prices can be one of our assets -- they are  lower than in the West, with a comparable quality of equipment.  The visit initiated talks on a contract for supplying light  aircraft and helicopters. "There is a possibility for providing  machinery for the mining industry. China has been building 50  new mines recently," Minister Pol stated. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY  in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 12)    COUNCIL TO DEBATE PRIVATIZATION: The State Treasury still  has  5,300 enterprises at its disposal. This huge wealth is not  uniform since apart from enterprises with good future prospects  and those that need to be rectified, there are also companies  that should be immediately dissolved. Disputes among different  ministries have also emerged regarding their different powers in  the area of ownership transformations. These problems will be  addressed by a program of commercialization of companies which  will be debated at the next Council of Ministers' session.  Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister Andrzej Zebrowski said  in an interview with a PAP journalist, that one-time  transformations of state-owned enterprises into companies are  not called for since many of those enterprises do not meet the  requirements of the Commercial Code. A review and a selection  process are necessary, after which a "privatization map" would  be drawn. It would include three main groups: Enterprises that  should be privatized as soon as possible would be in one group;  the second one would include those state- owned enterprises that  could be commercialized; whereas the third group would comprise  those enterprises which have been qualified as to be covered by  managerial contracts. State-owned enterprises in need of  rectification and those destined to be dissolved, would also be  distinguished.

Half of the real  estate brokers' offices are located in Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz,  Wroclaw, and Poznan, and out of that amount, one-fourth is in  Warsaw but only 8 percent in Krakow which is second on the list.  On average, just two people are employed per agency, with only  rare instances of offices employing more than 10 or even 20  people -- these are located in the biggest cities. Slightly  over 40 percent of the offices also provide legal services, tax  counselling, keeping commercial books and accounts, or dealing  in wholesale trade. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 25 Apr 94  p 14)    LOT TO LEASE AIRCRAFT: More aircraft that will complement  the fleet of Lot Polish Airlines will arrive before the end of  the year. A sixth Boeing 737-500 will come in May, and well as  an ATR-72. Since passenger traffic is characterized by a very  high "seasonality factor," many carriers try to lease aircraft  from other companies for the summer season. For a few years  now, Lot Polish Airlines has been cooperating with Air New  Zealand, taking advantage of the fact that traffic reaches a  maximum level in New Zealand precisely at a point in time when  it reaches a seasonal low in Poland. An Air New Zealand Boeing  767-200 will complement Lot's fleet also this year. There are  also plans to lease another long-distance aircraft, mainly in  order to service the trans-Atlantic route. According to Piotr  Ikanowicz of Lot's management, despite increases of expenditures  to finance the new fleet, profit from using the modern aircraft  fully justifies purchases planned for the next few years. It is  still not known though what will happen to Soviet-made Tupolevs  which have been withdrawn from service.

It concerned the sale of 75  percent of the shares of this Cement and Lime Company to the  German strategic investor -- Polen Zement  Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH. The Treasury received 10 million  German marks (DM) for the shares on the day the agreement was  concluded. The German company committed itself to implement a  DM30 million investment program within five years. The  employment level is to be maintained for three years, the social  benefits will still be paid, and wages will go up. The Warta  Cement Mill is going through financial problems due to its high  debts and overdue credits, which it obtained in the 1980's. The  new owner of the company is supposed to help resolve the  problems. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 5)    PRIVATIZATION SLOWS: The number of new privatization  processes has recently decreased, which could be seen already in  January and February. There are many cases, however, of  completing the processes that have already been started.  According to the preliminary estimates by the Ministry of  Ownership Transformations (the final data will be published in  the "Dynamics of Privatization"), in the first quarter of the  year 20 state-run enterprises were transformed into one-person  Treasury partnerships. It is more than in any quarter of 1993.  In all, in late March there were 547 one-person Treasury  partnerships. There also appeared partnerships transformed not  only on the basis of Articles 5 and 6 of the privatization law,  but also on the basis of Article 17 of the law on financial  restructurization of companies and banks. In the first quarter  of this year three such partnerships were established. Three  partnerships were sold to strategic investors (in 1993, 47  partnerships were privatized on the capital road). In line with  preliminary data, on the basis of Article 37 of the  Privatization Law the privatization of 21 companies was started  in the first quarter, which is also less than in any quarter of  the previous year. On the basis of Article 16 of the law on  state-run enterprises, 43 liquidation processes were begun and  that is also less than in any quarter of 1993. Fifty one  liquidations for privatization were completed -- just as many as  a year ago, but fewer than in any of the 1993 quarters. The  bankruptcy liquidation is still slow, but something is changing  -- 31 processes were completed in the last three months, which  is more than in the individual quarters of 1993. (Warsaw  RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 7)    QUARTERLY ECONOMIC RESULTS: It has been known for a few days  now that the economic results of the first quarter of the year  were very good. This was confirmed by the Central Planning  Administration (CUP), which estimates the increase in industrial  production in the first three months at 10.5 percent, and the  increase in construction production at 7.5 percent. This is  accompanied by lower inflation -- from almost 10 percent last  year (level of the prices in March in comparison with December)  to 5 percent this year. This is the lowest inflation in eight  years. The financial situation of enterprises improved; the  foreign exchange reserves of banks increased (by nearly 9  percent); the revenues of the state budget are growing faster  than expected. Banks are granting more credits. Increasingly  more people save their money in zlotys, rather than in foreign  currencies. In February, for the first time in almost two years  we achieved a positive balance in the commodity turnover in  trade. All this occurred despite many unfavorable phenomena in  politics ('Solidarity' strikes, Belvedere's actions). On the  other hand, however, it is only just the beginning of the road  to overcoming the recession. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 23-24  April 94 p 4)    MARCH ACTIVITY: According to GUS, in March an increase in  the  economic activity, especially in industry, construction, and  trade, was observed; the decrease in employment was curbed and  the number of unemployed decreased slightly. The average  employment in enterprises was 0.1 percent higher than a month  ago, and 3.2 percent lower than a year ago. The number of  unemployed persons dropped by 19,400. The greatest number of  unemployed persons (from October) was crossed off the registers  (152,000). The average wage, along with profit payments,  increased by 14.8 percent; the real wage increased by 12.3  percent and was 3.8 percent higher than a year ago. The prices  of consumer goods and services increased in March by 2 percent.  The sold production of the industry increased by 16.2 percent  and was 12.3 percent higher than a year ago. In the first  quarter production was 10.6 percent greater than a year ago. It  increased from 23 to 29 divisions of industry -- in 17 by more  than 10 percent. The greatest increase was noted in the  following industries: cellulose-paper (by 28.7 percent), food  (27.9 percent), clothing (21.6 percent), furniture (by 20  percent), rubber and plastics (by 19.4 percent), products of  other non-metal raw materials (cement, lime, and plaster) (by  17.5 percent), coke and oil products (by 17.8 percent). The  financial results of enterprises improved. In January and  February they noted a gross financial result of 18.3 trillion  zlotys (10.4 trillion a year ago); earning capacity was 5  percent (3.4 percent a year ago), and profitability (per each  1,000 zlotys of production sold) -- plus 12 zlotys (a year ago  -- minus 1 zloty). After three months the state deficit was  19.2 trillion zlotys. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 4)    EMPLOYEE-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS: The transformation of state-run  enterprises into employee-owned partnerships turned out to be  the most frequently used way to privatization. Almost 1,000  such companies are already operating on the market in Poland and  most of them achieve relatively good economic results, although  they are not as good as in private companies. Employee-owned  partnerships satisfy two main requirements in privatization:  They still exist, they are much more independent and  self-reliable, and they are able to pay higher wages to  employees. Social relations are much better than in state-owned  enterprises (practically no strikes). The ownership structure  is not uniform. The average gross earning capacity is  relatively high -- approximately 8 percent, which is two and a  half times as much as in the entire economy. The highest  earning capacity is achieved by the smallest partnerships,  followed by medium-sized and big companies. Favorable are also  relations between the net profits and the size of the revenues  -- the profitability index is 43 zlotys per each 1,000 zlotys of  revenues. These partnerships display considerable activeness in  adjusting to the requirements of the market; they use the  so-called shallow reserves which do not call for investments.  Lack of money for investments is the most fundamental problem  of these companies. Another serious problem is that access to  credits is very limited (lack of security -- the property that  is at the companies' disposal does not yet belong to them).  Thus, external capital is becoming increasingly important.  Participation of foreign investors in employee-owned  partnerships is still an open issue. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in  Polish 27 Apr 94 p 5)    DRAFT REPRIVATIZATION LAW: On 26 April, the Council of  Ministers debated a draft law on reprivatization which has been  initiated by Sejm deputies. The ministers decided they want to  have their own draft law. The chief of the Ownership  Transformations Ministry has committed himself to presenting  such a draft before 11 May. The government view is that  budgetary capabilities need to be taken into account in the  process. Once the two draft laws -- one coming from Sejm  deputies, and the other from the government -- are compared, the  choice will be made as to which option the Council of Ministers  will eventually support, Minister Kaczmarek explained. He added  that a possibility is being considered of holding a referendum  which would not deal with whether reprivatization is to be  implemented or not, but to define instead reprivatization's  scope and extent, and also the way claims by former owners  should be satisfied. According to the minister's calculations,  the governmental draft will take into account claims by people  whose property was nationalized illegally in the 1944-58 period,  as well as claims regarding property beyond the Bug River.  Compensations would not be paid out in cash since the budget  would not be able to bear the burden which is four times the  current budget deficit. That is why the possibility of  returning the property in its natural form is being considered  in cases where that is possible; awarding substitution property,  or awarding compensation in the form of securities is also being  considered. The minister said he is aware that such measures  will definitely not satisfy everyone. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in  Polish 27 Apr 94 p 10)    BANK ANNIVERSARY: The Polish National Bank (NBP) is getting  ready for the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of Bank Polski.  The current wave of strikes and the uncertain situation with  popiwek (salary-controlling legislation) prevent NBP from  commemorating the anniversary with a lowering of interest rates.  "We will have to suspend the decision on a possible decrease of  interest rates until May or even June," NBP Chairwoman Hanna  Gronkiewicz-Waltz told journalists on 27 April. Even though NBP  was established by a decree of 15 January 1945, it considers  itself an heir to Bank Polski which was set up 70 years ago and  that is why NBP has plans for widescale celebrations on the  occasion.

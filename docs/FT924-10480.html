			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sara Lee to expand capital expenditure SARA LEE, the international consumer products group, expects its capital expenditures in the 1993 fiscal year to exceed Dollars 700m, up from Dollars 509m in 1992, according to Mr John Bryan, chairman, Reuter reports from Chicago. Mr Bryan said after Sara Lee's annual meeting that most of the increase would go toward vertical integration of manufacturing capacity for its personal products. It would also increase manufacturing capacity for products including knitwear, which saw a 13 per cent unit volume growth in the first quarter ended September 26. Sara Lee's capital spending would exceed its previous peak of Dollars 593m posted in 1990, he said. Sara Lee is in negotiations in Mexico and Europe to expand its packaged meat business overseas. The move could come through acquisitions or joint ventures, he said.</p>

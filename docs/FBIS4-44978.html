			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, May 4.    Yielding to pressure from Opposition as well as ruling party  members in Parliament, the Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan  Singh, has announced some more concessions for the small-scale  sector. He, however, stuck to his stand on not to reintroduce  general excise exemption for this sector. The reliefs were  announced by the Minister while piloting the Finance Bill 1994  in the Lok Sabha today. The Bill is expected to be passed on  Friday.    Lower excise on vehicles catering to the rural population, a  lower excise on split air conditioners for tourist buses, a  reduction in customs duty on medical equipment and some changes  in presumptive tax on transport operators are among the reliefs  extended by the Minister for the automobile sector. Dr. Singh  has also changed the dates for furnishing returns in the case of  companies and non-corporate assessees. Though the Minister did  not give the quantum of revenue, loss on account of the  concessions, sources indicated that the loss would be marginal  and below Rs. 50 crores.    He also announced the constitution of a group to collect  district-wise data from States in order to arrive at a uniform  national set of criteria for industrial backwardness and to  identify districts which are extremely backward. On the basis of  the new criteria, the question of providing tax holiday for new  industrial units in backward districts would be considered.  <H5>  Product-specific Exemptions </H5>   Recounting the measures taken by him to remove the  difficulties faced by the small sector, the Minister told the  House that removal of the product-specific exemptions and  extension of the general small scale industries (SSIs) scheme  for excise concession would give the small sector a real  competitive edge vis-a-vis the larger units. This was because  under a general excise exemption, both the large and small units  were treated at par whereas under excise, the small units could  get the benefit of concessional rates.    Having said that, Dr. Singh went on to announce complete  exemption from excise in the case of soap made without the aid  of power. Similarly, umbrellas have been exempted from excise  duty as well as corrugated boxes and cartons since these are  mostly made in the unorganised sector.    For the automobile sector, the Minister has said that excise  duty on vehicles with gross vehicle weight of less than 2,700  kg. which was proposed to be levied at the rate of 40 per cent,  will now attract 25 per cent duty. This has been done because  vehicles satisfying this criterion had been designed to cater to  the needs of rural transport and should not attract 40 per cent  duty which is the rate for cars as well.    Furthermore, he said that in view of the administrative  difficulties faced by utensil manufacturers, he was exempting  the circles used captively in the manufacture of such utensils.  He also proposed the extension of proforma credit of yarn duty  to manufacturers of narrow woven fabrics as well as proforma  credit of woollen yarn duty to woollen fabrics. On knitted and  crocheted fabrics, he proposed a uniform duty of 10 per cent  against the rates of 5, 10 or 20 per cent depending on value.    On split air conditioners, Dr. Singh had proposed in his  Budget a shift from specific to ad valorem rates. He said he had  received representations that imposition of 60 per cent ad  valorem duty on split air conditioners for buses had resulted in  a sharp increase in the incidence of duty and as this would go  against the interests of the tourism industry, the ad valorem  duty was being reduced to 30 per cent.    Similarly, on representations from members of Parliament,  the  Finance Minister has enlarged the list of imported life-saving  medical equipment exempt from payment of customs duty. The list  of goods attracting 15 per cent customs duty was also being  enlarged. Spare parts for such medical equipment which attract  15 per cent plus nil countervailing duty (CV) and 40 per cent  with CV duty would now generally attract a uniform rate of 15  per cent plus CV duty. (The CV will be equivalent to excise duty  on domestic producers). Similarly, excise duty on medical  furniture which were to attract 20 per cent duty will now  attract 5 per cent only. Dr. Singh also promised to look into  representations seeking enlargement of the list of life-saving  drugs which do not attract any duty.    In the case of direct taxes, the Minister has reduced the  estimated income in case of truck operators from Rs. 2,000 to  Rs. 1,800 per truck per month for light and medium commercial  vehicles and from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 2,000 per truck per month in  the case of heavy trucks.    In response to another demand, the Minister has now  indicated  that the due date for filing returns for companies would be  November 30 instead of the earlier proposed date of October 31.  Likewise, for non-corporate assessees who are required to get  their accounts audited or are required to furnish an  accountant's report in support of claims for certain deductions,  the due date will continue to be October 31 and will not be  changed to August 31. This has been done in view of the  complaints that changes in dates would result in bunching and  heavy pressure of work on the audit profession. Besides, the  amendments would have created difficulties in the case of  non-corporate assessees who claim deduction under Section 80 HHC  and 80 HHD, since they are allowed to bring in the export  proceeds in foreign exchange by September 30 and thereafter  furnish evidence of such remittance.</p>

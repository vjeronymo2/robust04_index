			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs hit Andrews Sykes Restructuring will continue to depress Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services group which yesterday announced a fall into the red for the year to end-March. Exceptional items of Pounds 4.12m, half of which related to the disposal of non-core businesses, resulted in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.74m, against profits of Pounds 1.27m. Mr Eric Hook, appointed chief executive on May 12 following a boardroom coup, said further rationalisation and reorganisation costs 'will adversely affect the results for the year to March 1995'. Turnover fell 6 per cent, from Pounds 56.2m to Pounds 52.9m. Operating profits dropped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 1.2m; only Pounds 200,000 of this was generated in the UK, compared with Pounds 3.4m the previous year. Exceptional losses on the disposal of two subsidiaries - Centahire, the small tool hire business based in the north-east, and Kocoverk, the 51 per cent owned Swedish group - amounted to Pounds 2.05m. Other exceptional items included redundancy costs of Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 844,000); a property write-down of Pounds 891,000; a stock and other asset write-off of Pounds 367,000 and other exceptional costs of Pounds 140,000. Mr Hook said further asset disposals and a cost reduction programme would be necessary to reduce year-end gearing of 256 per cent. Since then the company has closed a centralised pump repair facility in Tipton, West Midlands, and withdrawn from Hungary. 'There is now a need to refocus management attention on the group's core activities of pumping, heating and air-conditioning and, in particular, the UK-based hire business,' he said. Losses per share were 40.6p (0.5p), and no final dividend is proposed (3p, totalling 4.4p for the year). Although the group was able in May to pay arrears of dividend on the convertible preference shares of 7p per share, payment due in June was again deferred.</p>

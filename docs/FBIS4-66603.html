			<p>CSO     [Text] Bahrain, February 14--The Prime Minister, Mr P.V.  Narasimha Rao, has said that India attached top priority to  improving its relations with Pakistan and denied that New Delhi  was trying to play the role of a policeman in the region, PTI  reports.    However, Pakistan's support, encouragement and abetment of  terrorism directed against India "is a matter of deep concern...  We find this support totally unacceptable and believe that it is  the basic cause of bilateral tensions and regional disquiet," he  said in an interview with Saudi Arabia's leading Arabic daily,  OKAZ.    "India attaches high priority in its foreign policy to  improving relations with the neighbours, including Pakistan," Mr  Rao said. The Prime Minister said India was keen to resolve all  differences with Pakistan peacefully through bilateral  negotiations, in accordance with the Shimla agreement.    As a result, Mr Rao said, the foreign secretaries of the two  countries met in Islamabad in the beginning of the year.    Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Rao  said:  "The assistance to terrorism by Pakistan is at the heart of the  problem." He denied that the security forces in Kashmir were  using excessive force and said: "We have gone to great lengths  to ensure that our security forces use the minimum possible  force against cilivians."    Side by side, Mr Rao said, attempts were on to revive the  political process in the state. "This process is understandably  slow, because of the intimidatory tactics of the militants," he  added.    In reply to a question, the Prime Minister denied that India  ever "sought to play the role of a policeman in the region." On  India's growing ties with Israel, Mr Rao said it had no  strategic or security dimension. "There is no question of its  being directed against any third country," he added.    Referring to the demolition of Babri Masjid he said he was  aware of the reverberations abroad on the incident and mentioned  his government's prompt action in dismissing the state  government responsible for it.    He said while the government was prosecuting those involved  in the demolition, it had referred the matter to the supreme  court and would abide by its decision.</p>

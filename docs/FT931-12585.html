			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Council employee wins Pounds 15,000 over passive smoking A COUNCIL employee has won Pounds 15,000 compensation for the alleged effects of passive smoking at work, in what is believed to be the first such case in the UK. As an out of court settlement, the case does not set a legal precedent, but Action on Smoking and Health, the anti-smoking campaign, said there would be a flood of similar claims from passive smoking victims. Nalgo, the white-collar local government union, which backed the worker's case, said the award should be 'a warning shot across the bows to all employers who ignore the risks of smoking to non-smokers'. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, yesterday reiterated that the government would consider legislation to outlaw smoking in public places and at work if voluntary bans did not succeed. The government's aim is for 80 per cent of public places to be smoke-free by 1994, with smoking banned for most employees by the year after. Ms Veronica Bland, a 36-year-old non-smoker, who still works for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, claims that between July 1988 and September 1989 she worked close to seven employees who smoked continually. She estimates that she inhaled smoke from at least 150 cigarettes each working day. Ms Bland developed chronic bronchitis and alleges that, until the council introduced a no-smoking policy in 1990, she suffered from persistent coughs, sore throats, catarrh and eye irritations. She also says her singing voice - she is a member of a choir - has deteriorated. Stockport said yesterday that the settlement of Ms Bland's claim by the council's insurers was made without any admission of liability. It added that the council was one of the first local authorities in the country to implement a scheme which establishes employees' right to work in smoke-free offices. The Association of British Insurers said the settlement was 'in no way a precedent'. There was nothing legally or morally binding about it and there would be 'no softening of the position of the insurance industry in fighting this sort of case'. Stockport's insurers had decided it was less costly to settle with Ms Bland than investigate and pursue the case in court, said the ABI. The industry was still waiting for a suitable test case. Mr John Cridland, Confederation of British Industry director of environmental affairs, said Ms Bland's case would 'certainly strengthen the trend' towards smoke-free working environments. However, he said he did not think the award was a 'huge step in itself' because it was a voluntary out-of-court settlement. Emphasising that the CBI did not favour a legal obligation for employers to ban smoking, Mr Cridland added that 'many employers, certainly those who care, as most do, about having a healthy and motivated workforce, are already well down the road to voluntary policies'.

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Government to consider safeguards for cheap BR fares THE GOVERNMENT last night hinted it might agree legal safeguards for concessionary rail fares in order to avoid a Commons defeat at the hands of Conservative backbench rebels. With the British Rail privatisation bill returning to the House of Commons today for its report stage, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he was willing to look at possible statutory protection for railcards. But Mr MacGregor indicated the government would not yield to a separate demand by some Tory MPs that BR be allowed to compete for service franchises once the railways are thrown open to private competition. The two-day debate on the bill's report stage threatens to be stormy with concern among the government's supporters about the political impact of privatisation underpinned by evidence of overwhelming public opposition. Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, pledged the opposition to return the rail network to the public sector if it won the next general election. A Gallup poll last week suggested that more than two-thirds of commuters opposed the privatisation of services. Yesterday a report commissioned by the public transport pressure group Transport 2000 said fares would have to increase sharply and rural services shut to meet a Pounds 500m 'bill' for privatisation. Legal guarantees for the concessionary fares enjoyed by the elderly and students have been demanded by about a dozen Conservative backbenchers, threatening the government's 18-seat majority in the Commons. Mr MacGregor had suggested that they could be protected in agreements reached between the new franchise authority and private sector operators. But Sir Keith Speed, the MP for Ashford who is leading Tory calls for tighter safeguards, said that the government risked defeat unless it was prepared to enshrine the principle of concessionary fares in the legislation. That brought a statement from Mr MacGregor: 'If we can find a way of meeting some of the concerns obviously I will do so because . . . I am well aware of the importance of railcards.' The Tory rebels now expect the government to table its own amendment to protect the cheap fares. Mr MacGregor refused to offer a comparable olive branch to the rebels on their demands that BR should be able to compete equally with private sector companies in bidding for franchises.

Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing  Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon), made a congratulatory speech at the meeting.    He said the formation of the association was of great  significance not only in upholding the great leader  Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim  Chong-il with loyalty and defending and exalting the  anthropocentric socialist homeland of chuche but also in  developing the patriotic movement of Chongnyon to defend and  expand the rights and life of Koreans in Japan by bringing  together their legal and economic knowhow and technologies.    Solidarity greetings were made by Japanese figures who were  present at the meeting as observers.    A letter to Generalissimo Kim Il-song was adopted at the  meeting.</p>

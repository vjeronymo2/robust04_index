			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed G.V.L.: "Fisheries Agreement Opens EU Port </F> for Norwegians"]    [Text] Norway and the other three candidates for EU  [European Union] membership will probably have to stay in the  waiting room a little longer. The Twelve must first come to a  mutual agreement on how decisions are to be made in a Europe  with 16 members. After that, their accession must also be  approved by the European Parliament [EP], the national  parliaments, and the people in the intended new member states.  The biggest obstacle is still the veto issue and the  intransigent attitude of Spain, and especially Great Britain, on  this matter. These two countries are threatening to raise the  blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes. Doing so, it would  become more difficult for two large countries and one small  country to block measures. The Council discussed the veto issue  until 0400 [Belgian time] Wednesday [16 March] morning, but the  foreign ministers went home empty-handed. A new, extraordinary  meeting on general affairs is scheduled for next Tuesday in the  Council. Until this meeting is held, the matter of enlargement  will remain stuck in an impasse. British Chancellor Kenneth  Clark said yesterday on BBC radio that "large countries, such as  ourselves, cannot reconcile themselves to a system in which 60  percent of the European population -- represented by a group of  small countries -- can vote us down on important issues."  Clarke said that he welcomed the accession of Austria, Norway,  Sweden, and Finland, but that it "it must be a union in which  large countries, such as Great Britain, can block issues which  I, as a pro-European conservative, do not want to see happen."  The anti-European conservatives -- the so-called Euroskeptics  -- in the British Parliament, expressed still stronger views.  "I am delighted that Minister Hurd has adopted such a  determined position," said Sir Teddy Taylor. "What causes me  concern is that the Commission is trying to use the accession of  new countries as an excuse to gain more power for itself. It is  kind of blackmail." Upon his return from Brussels Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said only that Great Britain would  continue to strive for a "fair and sensible" compromise on the  veto question. However, in the meantime, Great Britain has  continued to reject all compromises. The proposal to raise the  blocking minority to 27 votes -- but to reserve the possibility  of 23 votes on the condition that they are comprised by three  countries -- has not made much of an impression.  <H5>  Greek Proposal </H5>   Tuesday evening, the Greek Presidency also came up with a  compromise in the Council. The Greek representative,  Kranidiotis, reported the compromise yesterday morning to the  European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs. "The Greek  Presidency has proposed to set up a committee in which experts  from the national governments, the Commission, and the  Parliament would prepare a report on the institutional reforms  in anticipation of the intergovernmental summit in 1996," said  Kranidiotis yesterday before leaving for Greece. "In  anticipation of the creation of this committee -- no earlier  than the Corfu summit in June -- the blocking majority would be  raised from 23 to 27 votes. The Greek view is that the number  of votes must end up at 27 anyway. We are proposing, however,  to do that on a temporary basis. In the meantime, the committee  of wise men can already debate the institutional reforms."    The committee members did not seem to be under this  impression. The committee was introduced as a committee of wise  men, but is actually nothing more than an ad hoc committee of  government representatives, they said. Taken literally,  Kranidiotis said that the committee should take inspiration from  the work of Parliament. President Enrique Baron Crespo let his  displeasure show over the fact that "the Council needs the  Parliament in order to approve the enlargement, but does not  feel it necessary to keep us informed."    "The European Parliament is not a counter serving merely to  rubber-stamp documents," Crespo said.  <H5>  Parliament </H5>   The European Parliament is not against EU enlargement, but  demands that it go hand in hand with institutional reforms which  go further than just determining the number of votes needed for  a blocking minority. Parliament is advocating what is known in  jargon as a "super-qualified majority." "Such a majority would  replace the current unanimity and would mean in fact, the end of  the veto right," said Therese Lepoutre-Dumoulin, department head  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    An possible agreement on the veto issue would not settle the  conflict between the Council and the Parliament. "We were  promised that the enlargement would be accompanied by  institutional reforms. That has not been the case. The only  thing they are doing now is mathematically extrapolating the  blocking minority to apply to a Europe with 16 members."    Parliament feels that a blocking minority of 27 votes is a  minimum requirement. It will accept nothing short of that. "If  they say it is going to be 23 then Parliament will never give  its approval to enlargement. And without Parliament's  agreement, the enlargement cannot proceed."</p>

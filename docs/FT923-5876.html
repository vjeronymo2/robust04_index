			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Efim's syndicated loans breakdown THE VOLUNTARY liquidation last month of Efim, the Italian state holding company, has left many bankers wondering whether their loans will be repaid in full. The table below shows the international syndicated credits taken out by Efim and by its wholly-owned subsidiaries. These include Agusta, its helicopters division, Safim (the finance subsidiary which was renamed Nuova Safim), and Breda Construzioni Ferroviarie (BCF), a railway equipment subsidiary. Efim has total debts of L8,500bn, of which about L3,500bn was lent by foreign banks. The international syndicated credits shown below are the ones which were publicly announced, according to data provided by Euromoney Loanware. However, these figures do not include privately arranged credits and bilateral loans taken out by Efim and its subsidiaries. Six agent banks - Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank, Chase, Citicorp, Mitsubishi and SG Warburg - are representing the interests of the foreign banks in the international syndicates when it comes to negotiations with the Italian authorities. The bankers are due to meet with Italian treasury officials in early September to discuss further developments. There are other groups of banks which lent to Efim, including Italian and foreign banks which provided funds for Efim domestically rather than in the international market. Efim and its subsidiaries borrowed in a range of currencies and maturities. The table shows the margins at which they borrowed (usually quoted as the margin over the London interbank offered rate) and the fees due to bankers. Commitment fees are those paid by a borrower on the undrawn part of a loan. A facility fee is the annual fee paid on the total amount of a committed standby facility, regardless of whether that facility is drawn. A participation fee is the amount paid either on signing the loan or on the first drawdown. A utilisation fee is the fee paid by a borrower if more than a certain part of the loan is drawn.</p>

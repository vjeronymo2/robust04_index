			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taunton and Molson in US cider deal Americans used to the traditional autumnal tipple of apple cider may find something rather more exotic on offer this year with the announcement yesterday that Taunton Cider has clinched a distribution deal with the specialist drinks importer, Molson USA. Taunton is aiming at the up market drinker, including the 'working woman who wants to stay in control'. She will be able to enjoy products such as Fres, which is what Taunton calls a low alcohol product at just 4 per cent. Other ciders to be introduced are Diamond White and Red Rock. Taunton said yesterday it planned to introduce six of its brands in four states from May through Molson's distribution network. After an initial trial period, one or two brands would be chosen for sale throughout the US. The group is moving into the US as trading in the UK appears to have become increasingly difficult. Taunton also announced that competition from the supermarket economy brands continued to affect trading. A substantial marketing programme had been launched which would result in a lower average selling price for the second half. As a result, Taunton said sales and operating profits were expected to be largely in line with last year's Pounds 129.9m and Pounds 19.7m respectively. However, Mr Nick Pearch, finance director, said there was likely to be some benefit at the pre-tax level from lower interest rates. The US deal was not expected to show a return for some time. All proceeds from the first year's shipment would be reinvested in marketing. Mr Pearch said the US potential was enormous, with the beer market some five times bigger than in the UK.</p>

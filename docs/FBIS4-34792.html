			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The first meeting for peace and reconciliation was  held on 22 June at the Central American Parliament. President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio attended the ceremony. During his speech,  the president referred to the importance of the event:    [Begin de Leon recording] This meeting clearly exemplifies  the existence of a general, spontaneous movement to achieve a  united criteria, links in the chain of progress toward a better  Guatemala in all aspects. Upon seeing all of you gathered here,  I am moved to finally see the initial fruits of an action  favoring the signing of peace.    I invite you to do everything within your reach to make this  first meeting for peace and reconciliation precisely that: the  first of a series of similar meetings in which a group of  brothers will seek the best for their fellow human beings and  for themselves. I ask you not to be deterred by fear in the face  of a situation to which we are not accustomed, because we have  been immersed for so long in a fratricidal war. I also ask you  not to listen to those who do not believe in, disqualify, and  label as a betrayal the act of participating in this peace  process in Guatemala.    In these meetings, I ask you to face the new Guatemalan  reality with enthusiasm and dedication. Peace depends on the  political resolve of the parties that are directly involved.  That resolve exists with total certainty on the part of the  government, over which I am honored to preside. That political  resolve, allow me to say, has been totally confirmed and proven  in the past months, in the past hours, and in the past minutes  in Oslo. This has been confirmed not only on the part of the  friendly countries of the process but, in general, by the entire  international community. That is why I dare say the government  is more concerned that that peace, which for us is and should be  irreversible, should be a lasting peace. That is why we must  all prepare for it, to fight the causes that might generate new  outbreaks of groups that are discontent not for ideological  reasons but, rather, for economic or social reasons.    We must attempt to achieve the total and absolute respect of  Guatemalans' human rights, not just individual rights because we  are on that path, but also, and especially, economic, social,  and cultural rights.

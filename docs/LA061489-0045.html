			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THEY'RE WATCHING US';  </P> <P> TERROR FELT IN HOMELAND SPREADS TO U.S.  </P> <P> Two days after 18,000 demonstrators rallied outside the United Nations and the  Chinese Consulate in New York in support of the pro-democracy movement in  China, the consulate's education officer showed up at a dormitory at the State  University of New York at Stony Brook. He began questioning Chinese exchange  students.  </P> <P> The diplomat wanted to know who might have participated in the demonstration.  He also questioned Chinese graduate students in an apartment complex on campus.  For many of the 400 Chinese nationals on temporary visas at the university, the  reaction was fear and anxiety.  </P> <P> The Sunday night visit by the Chinese official demonstrated how the terror felt  in China in the wake of the government's violent suppression of the student  movement has begun spreading to the United States.  </P> <P> Chinese diplomats have videotaped demonstrators in San Francisco, Los Angeles  and Washington, protesters said. Threatening phone calls and warnings not to  take part in future rallies also have been reported, inspiring fear among the  students for their own futures and for their families at home.  </P> <P> "They are watching us," said Qi Anming, a student leader at UC Berkeley. "I am  not afraid, but others are."  </P> <P> "The best way to silence the people is to give them a sense of fear," added Yu  Maochun, a student at the same university. "Fear is the traditional way in  China of controlling people."  </P> <P> Yu quoted an old Chinese saying: "Kill the chicken to frighten the monkey." In  today's context, it means intimidating the masses by attacking just a few, he  explained.  </P> <P> Qi said students are worried that their involvement in protests in the United  States will bring hardship to their families in China. Many are concerned that  their parents will lose their jobs, be harassed by government officials or face  arrest.  </P> <P> The students wonder if they could face the same fate as their classmates in  China should they return. "In the eyes of the Chinese government, we are  counterrevolutionaries. It means they can do anything to us," Qi said.  </P> <P> At Stony Brook, some students quickly complained to Lynn King Morris, the  university's director of foreign student affairs. "They (the exchange students)  said it was disturbing to have the consul there," she said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A Chinese student at Columbia University, who helped coordinate the massive  Manhattan rally on Friday, said that during the march, other protesters warned  him that there were Chinese people with a videotape camera.  </P> <P> "They told me those were people with the consulate," said the student, who  declined to give his name. He said students at Columbia believe that Chinese  intelligence officials also have been reviewing newspaper photographs and local  and national television coverage of the New York rally in an effort to identify  individuals.  </P> <P> Fueling the fear is the widespread rumor that over the years the Chinese  Communist government has been able to plant informers among exchange students.  At Stony Brook, Morris said it was unclear whether the consulate official  showed up on his own or had been invited by student sympathizers.  </P> <P> At Harvard, Prof. Ezra F. Vogel, a China specialist, said that some Chinese  students are viewed with suspicion by others. "There is distrust and fear," he  said, "a feeling that there are people (here) who are presumed to convey  responses (back to China) and are in a position to do this."  </P> <P> Wang Shaohua, a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, denied  any attempts to intimidate students in the United States. He said the consulate  has taken no pictures and is compiling no blacklist.  </P> <P> "This is entirely unfounded and a fabrication," Wang said.  </P> <P> But student leaders throughout the country said they recognize their  government's methods of intimidation since most of them were teen-agers during  the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when many intellectuals were jailed, tortured  or executed.  </P> <P> Many Chinese students say they will continue to protest the massacre in  Beijing. But among many willing to risk exposure, there is a recognition that  their actions may haunt them for years.  </P> <P> Qi, the student leader at Berkeley, said that students who have participated in  demonstrations in the Bay Area are certain that they have been filmed by  consular officials on the roof or from windows. At first, he said, the students  paid little attention, even when officials they recognized walked with cameras  into the crowd of protesters.  </P> <P> But since the June 4 massacre in Tian An Men Square and the arrest of hundreds  of student leaders in China, the photographing has been seen as an ominous  threat.  </P> <P> "Clearly, they know our names," Qi said. "There is no way I would return to  China now."  </P> <P> Wang Haitao, an editor of the recently created Freedom Press Herald in  Alhambra, said the newspaper has received two threatening phone calls -- one to  the newspaper's office and another to an editor's home. He said one anonymous  caller simply said, "Be careful, your future is not good."  </P> <P> In Canada, a group of Chinese students who gathered at a Chinese Baptist church  in Toronto said they fear arrest upon their return home. Jim Karygiannis, a  Liberal opposition member of Parliament who organized the session, said some  students have told him that their families in China have been placed under  "house detention" because of pictures and news sent from Canada.  </P> <P> Canada's minister of external affairs, Joe Clark, announced last week that the  4,000 Chinese students in Canada will be allowed to stay on until the situation  in China is resolved.  </P> <P> About 40,000 Chinese students are in the United States on temporary educational  visas that President Bush extended for one year in light of the turmoil in  China.  </P> <P> Xu Xiannian, a leader of the Chinese students at UC Davis, said that regardless  of the consequences, he and others believe that the risks are worth taking.  </P> <P> "Thousands of people have been killed at Tian An Men," Xu said. "When I  eventually return to China, people would ask me, 'What did you do?' How could I  possibly answer?"  </P> <P> Goldman reported from New York and Dunn from Los Angeles. Elizabeth Lu in Los  Angeles, Valarie Basheda in San Francisco and Charles Hirshberg in New York  also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Literal Democrat case to start The Liberal Democrats will tomorrow launch a High Court challenge to overturn the result of the European parliamentary election in Devon and East Plymouth. The party, which narrowly lost the seat to the Conservatives, claims voters were misled by the appearance on the ballot paper of a Literal Democrat candidate. Mr Richard Huggett, the retired headteacher who stood as the Literal Democrat candidate, polled 10,203 votes in spite of not campaigning or putting out any campaign literature. The seat was won by the Conservative candidate Mr Giles Chichester, who polled 74,953 votes, only 700 more than Mr Adrian Sanders, the Liberal Democrat candidate. The Liberal Democrats attempted to stop Mr Huggett from standing before the election by seeking a judicial review of the returning officer's decision to accept his nomination. The petition to be lodged with the election court tomorrow will ask for the election result to be declared void and for the poll to be re-run. The election court of two High Court judges is expected to sit in London to hear legal issues but may decide to sit in Exeter to hear evidence from the electorate. The Liberal Democrats intend to present sworn affidavits from 'several hundred' voters who say they were misled into voting Literal Democrat instead of Liberal Democrat. Also at issue will be the number of spoilt ballot papers which resulted from the confusion over names. The hearing of the case is not expected until August. This will be the first time that the issue of confusing names on the ballot has been tested by the courts. No action was taken after a man changed his name to Roy Jenkins to run against Lord - then Roy - Jenkins in the Hillhead by-election in 1982. However, the courts have shown a willingness to intervene where there is evidence of voter confusion.</p>

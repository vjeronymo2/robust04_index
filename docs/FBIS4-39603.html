			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Ivanov incorporating interview with </F> Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief  of the Russian Air Defense Forces: "Russia's Skies Are Not a  Passageway. Air Defense Forces Forced American Plane To Land"  -- date, place of interview not given]    [Text] There have been increasingly frequent instances  recently of foreign aircraft ignoring the procedure for crossing  the state border and for the use of airspace, penetrating deep  into Russian territory and refusing to fulfill the demands of  air traffic control organs. In the past two months alone, there  have been seven such instances. The Air Defense Forces are  obliged to take resolute measures against the violators.    And that is what happened on 7 June this year. At 1354 hours  a Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the U.S. airline "Rapid  Aerotrans" entered Russia's 25-km border zone. It has emerged  that the plane was on a flight from Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi  and had not filed the appropriate application.    The integrated air traffic control system's Main Center  forbade the violator plane to fly over Russian Federation  territory, but the Lockheed's crew ignored this order and  penetrated 80 km into our airspace. Two Su-27 patrol fighters  then took off from the Krymsk military airfield. But they did  not get within 50 km of the target. On learning that the patrol  forces had taken off, the U.S. violator plane declared its  readiness to land at the nearest airport, and 16 minutes later  it made a landing at Adler.    Our correspondent asked Colonel General of Aviation Viktor  Prudnikov, commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, to  comment on the situation.    "Certain regions have emerged," the commander in chief  stressed, "where violations of rules for the use of airspace  have become frequent. First and foremost this is true of the  North Caucasus. It is surprising, because everyone knows that  before crossing a border, a plane must make contact with the  relevant air traffic control organs and confirm its intention to  enter the country's airspace. And that can only be done with  permission. It is also well known that the appropriate  applications have to be filed the day before the flight in  accordance with the established procedure.    "The cases that have been occurring recently indicate that  nobody is notifying anyone and that random incursions into  Russia's airspace are taking place."    [Ivanov] What are the reasons why foreign aircraft fail to  carry out the orders of the air traffic control services?    [Prudnikov] Some people have the impression that the former  Union has broken up into independent states which are not yet  quite ready to exercise proper control of their airspace. There  are also elements of contempt for the existing rules. People  sometimes think it will all pass off with impunity. So that  nobody forms the desire to test our air borders or behave like  hooligans in the air, I will say that these opinions should be  refuted by actions. In some regions recently, where the  situation so requires, we have stepped up our monitoring of the  air. In order to establish visual contact with a violator plane  we are obliged to bring our fighters to within a short distance  of it, which could lead to complications regarding compliance  with safety measures. I hope that appropriate measures will be  adopted in the near future, first and foremost in the CIS  countries, to prevent violations of the laws and ensure safe  flights for all the aircraft using our airspace.    [Ivanov] In the present situation our state has to count  every kopek. Additional measures by patrol forces against  violators are costly. Is it not time to demand compensation for  the economic loss sustained due to unlawful actions in Russia's  skies?    [Prudnikov] Bringing in additional resources and sending up  patrol fighters is certainly costly. We do the calculations and  draw up an account for payment. But at a certain stage,  apparently, there is insufficient insistence on the payment of  compensation. I suppose if our state organs took a firmer  stance on this, not so many people would be willing to commit  violations. After all, intercepting every such flight costs the  Air Defense Forces tens of millions of rubles. [interview ends]    [Ivanov] So the Air Defense Forces have shown that nobody  can violate Russia's air borders with impunity. Defense  Minister Army General Pavel Grachev has given a high appraisal  of their patrol crews' actions.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mother knows best MY MOTHER owns the freehold of her house in which she and her husband, my stepfather, currently live. She has told me that in her will, the house will be left to my stepfather, but on his death it will revert to me. Is it possible to do this legally? If the house becomes the property of my stepfather (who is some years younger than my mother) what is to stop him from making a will leaving the house to his children and not to me? My mother assures me that the will is valid, and that her wishes for the house to go to me on my stepfather's death will be carried out. However, should my stepfather and I lose touch with each other following my mother's death, how will I be informed of my inheritance? I know that the solicitor my mother used to draw up her will does not know my present address, because I moved after the will was made. I do not have a copy of the will. My mother does not like to discuss this matter with me, as she is certain that my stepfather would carry out her wishes as regards the house. If I push the matter, it looks as though I am mercenary. It is perfectly possible to do what your mother wants while still preventing your stepfather from alienating the house during the period of his survivorship. This is done by a gift to him for life (or during his life) with remainder to you absolutely; the effect is to set up a trust in which you would have a vested interest immediately on the death of your mother, even though your enjoyment of the use of the house is postponed during your step-father's lifetime. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

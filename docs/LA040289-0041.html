			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S AN EXTRA HOUR TO BANK ON  </P> <P> Starting today, most Americans will be able to enjoy more evening golf,  cookouts or other events, thanks to an extra hour of daylight first instituted  as a wartime measure but now used primarily for recreation.  </P> <P> That's right -- it's time to spring forward to daylight-saving time.  </P> <P> The change takes effect at 2 a.m. today, although most people will set their  clocks ahead before retiring on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Those who don't will be an hour late for church or other appointments.  </P> <P> Daylight-saving time was introduced during World War I in an effort to save  fuel by reducing the need for lights in the evening.  </P></p>

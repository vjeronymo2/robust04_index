			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: US offshoot wipes out profits at Kalamazoo KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, saw half yearly pre-tax profits wiped out by losses at a US subsidiary, which has been sold. But the company earned enough at the attributable level to pay shareholders a slightly increased interim dividend. The group incurred a loss of Pounds 212,000 in the six months to January 31, against profits of Pounds 1.03m last time. But if discontinued activities are stripped out of the overall figures, there was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 860,000, slightly down on the Pounds 939,000 of the comparable period. In January, the group disposed of Great American Software which, in the previous six months, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.07m. The disposal resulted in an extraordinary gain of Pounds 720,000 which both covered the net loss for the half year and led to attributable profits of Pounds 224,000. From this Pounds 200,000 is being taken to fund an interim dividend of 0.525p (0.5p). Mr Peter Harrop, chairman, noted that with the exception of a New Zealand company, which is for sale, the disposal of Great American Software signified the final unscrambling of an unsuccessful diversification programme undertaken by previous management. Henceforth, Kalamazoo would expand in Europe but only in its core business areas. The group will next announce figures for the eight months to end-March 1992; it is changing its year end from July 31 to March 31.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: The grubby versus the prissy - Television The contortions achieved by BBC television in its determination on the one hand to stay with the tabloid newspapers in covering royal scandals, while on the other hand desperately trying to avoid being lumped in with them, are wonderful to behold. Its technique brings to mind that of the tabloids in years gone by when they found a juicy story about some eminent actress having appeared in blue movies during her youth. Thunderous condemnations of the disgusting nature of the films would be accompanied by entire double spreads packed with stills from the scenes in question: 'Isn't it disgusting? And here's some more]' The BBC's ploy is to pretend that while it remains aloof from royal scuttlebut and would never concern itself with whether Princess Diana really has been making nuisance phone calls to an art dealer acquaintance - good heavens, this is the BBC you know, miles above that sort of thing - it is, however, duty bound in the public interest to report on the way that the tabloid press hounds the poor old royals. Of course it so happens that in the process the entire story is conveyed in detail to the viewers but, well, the BBC can hardly help that, can it? This pose of disdainful superiority towards the popular papers with their royalty watchers would carry more weight if BBC reports did not invariably include material from the BBC's own royalty watcher, Jenny Bond. The notion of a lily white BBC, operating way above the level of the ordinary, grubby mass media, would be less laughable if they did not screen programmes such as Jonathan Ross Presents David Copperfield. No doubt Mr Copperfield is an outstanding illusionist - that was certainly the impression given by this programme which went out at 8pm on Friday evening on the BBC's more popular channel - but it is clearly no coincidence that he is about to bring his act to London. For him this programme served as a 50-minute commercial, not least because Ross obligingly announced the venue and dates and declared that he would be there. It would be interesting to know precisely who paid what to whom to get this little lot on the air; licence payers might feel that Mr Copperfield should have been paying the BBC. And where did Mr Ross's own television production company fit in? When we began the Edinburgh Television Festival in the 1970s it was meant, at least partly, as a thorn in the side of the broadcasting establishment, and for a couple of years it worked. Then that very establishment (which, to be fair, had always supplied the money) took over, and for most of the 1980s it became a rather boring event. Scores of indie producers spent days trying to get a word with Jeremy or Melvyn in the bar of the George. The most memorable moment occurred when Jeremy (Isaacs, that is) gave the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture and enthused so much over the forthcoming Channel 4 that he was credited with delivering the MacTaggart Memorial Job Application. But mostly it was dull. This year matters seem to have perked up considerably with a good squib delivered by MacTaggart lecturer Greg Dyke, until recently chief executive of London Weekend TV. The Isaacs 'job application' worked, as we know, and you have to wonder whether Mr Dyke was following suit. Since he now has millions of pounds from his LWT share options he scarcely needs another job, yet he would be an ideal person to head the government broadcasting commission which he declared the next Labour administration should set up to look at new ways of choosing those who run British broadcasting. His main concern seems to be one that has been expressed many times in this column: that - unlike the newspapermen who went to prison in the long fight to win the freedom of the press - those who run commercial television are not chiefly concerned with freedom of speech or with journalism at all, but with profits. And those who run the BBC depend upon the government for their very existence. Consequently they are all far too cosy with politicians. What with Michael Grade then lamming into the prissy old busybodies who are allowed to gag and hobble dramatists, journalists and entertainers in Britain via a network of organisations set up in response to 'the Mary Whitehouse tendency', it really does seem as though the Edinburgh Television Festival has put itself right back on the agenda. It was very much Grade's weekend because on the Saturday he appeared on BBC2 interviewing his famous uncle, Lew, in The Persuader: The TV Times Of Lord Lew Grade. Given Lord Grade's age and the pleasure so many of his series - from Sunday Night At The London Palladium to Jesus Of Nazareth - have given so many viewers, it was right that this should be a fond and indulgent programme. But however fashionable retro-telly may have become, we should remember that most of Lord Grade's series (The Buccaneers, The Persuaders, The Adventures Of Robin Hood, The Adventures Of William Tell, The Saint and more, many of them revived on BBC2 this week) were deeply undemanding, unchallenging and unoriginal. There were two extraordinary exceptions: The Prisoner and The Muppet Show. What a pity that, while championing those, Lew did his own spot of gagging and hobbling by suppressing for 20 years Kenneth Griffith's bold and eye-opening documentary Hang Up Your Brightest Colours, about the IRA leader Michael Collins. Once in a while comes a programme which jerks you back in your chair with news of some imminent major change in the world. A BBC report on the microchip, which predicted pretty well everything that has subsequently occurred, sticks in the memory, and now Channel 4's Equinox has shown how electronic road tolls are likely to become the norm soon. Given that it cost Pounds 5 to travel from London to Norwich on the toll roads in 1789, about Pounds 300 at today's rates according to the programme, we should probably not be too full of foreboding . . . and yet, some of the proposals for extending roadside electronic monitoring to the point where drivers become superfluous did make you think about Big Brother.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    GENEVA, 27 Apr -- Russia and France believe that a  quadripartite meeting of ministers from the Russian Federation,  the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations  could be held in the very near future. This was announced here  by Andrey Kozyrev and Alain Juppe after they had held an hour  and a half of talks.    The opportunity for real cooperation is now better than ever  before, the Russian minister told journalists. It is now  extremely important to take this opportunity. The contact group  which the four have set up to prepare a full report on the  situation as regarding a Bosnian settlement could now be given  one week rather than two. This would "avoid missing the chance  for positive development" and make it possible to move on to  ministerial talks on preparation of a summit meeting.    Speaking after his Russian counterpart, Juppe recalled that  France supports the idea of a "summit" on Bosnia. He said that  agreement could be reached quite quickly on the venue and date  for the ministerial discussions. It is important that the  contact group work correspondingly fast, he said.</p>

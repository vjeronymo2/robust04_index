			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Property services grow by 15.5% The UK market for property services grew by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 974m last year, following two years of contraction, according to a report on chartered surveyors by the Economic Development Briefing, a research group. The chartered surveyors' survey reports that almost 10 per cent of clients expect to make more use of chartered surveyors and estate agents in the next 12 months, while 5.5 per cent foresee a reduced need for outside property advice. Demand is expected to increase most sharply for investment deals, building surveying, lettings, developments and planning advice. More moderate increases are forecast for rating, investment and funding advice, property management and project management. The demand for portfolio management is likely to remain static, while plant and machinery services may see a slight fall in demand. The survey found that the most highly recommended surveying firms were DTZ Debenham Thorpe, followed by Chesterton and King Sturge. The survey involved 907 companies, which last year paid out Pounds 300.5m in fees and commission. In a separate report, the Economic Development Briefing estimates that the value of all property services provided for and by the public sector was Pounds 120m last year. Employment in public sector property departments has declined by more than 10 per cent in the past year and is expected to fall by another 10 per cent by the middle of next year. The government's requirements to put property-related services out to tender should help professional firms gain a larger share of the public sector property services market.

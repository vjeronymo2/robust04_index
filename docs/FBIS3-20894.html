			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The reduction to the base funding of the TNO  [Applied Netherlands Research Center] will, to a large extent,  no longer be implemented. The TNO's subsidy from the Ministry  of Science and Education originally was supposed to have been  reduced from one percent in 1994 to five percent in 1998. The  one percent reduction slated for 1994 will be implemented.  However, State Secretary Cohen is willing to look for other  financial means to offset the reduced subsidies slated for 1995  to 1998 as follows: 1995, 1.335 million guilders (G); 1996,  G2.671 million; 1997, G4.006 million; and 1998, G5.342 million.    All of this was communicated in the annual subsidy letter,  which explains the base subsidies as well as the target  subsidies the TNO receives from different departments. The  reduction was the result of a cabinet decision to diminish the  number of subsidies. During the budget negotiations, the second  Chamber made it clear that in this case the effect -- less  investment in knowledge infrastructure -- would differ from the  goal -- a reduction in subsidies.</p>

"Nothing like such a group has been revealed, and no one has  been arrested," the officer said. "Sobchak is under no threat.  By the way, he is out of the city at the moment."    "I regret that some of your colleagues work with so little  responsibility," the counterintelligence officer told INTERFAX.</p>

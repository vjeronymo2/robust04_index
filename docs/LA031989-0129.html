			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: GOOD OLD BULLY BO IS AT IT AGAIN  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M made a move on University of Michigan football Coach Bo  Schembechler a few years back, offering him a whole bunch of money. Bo said no.  </P> <P> But first, he thought it over. He considered what was best for himself and for  his family. Michigan sweetened Schembechler's pot to help him make up his mind,  and the owner of the Detroit Tigers even forked over the deed to a pizza  franchise in, of all places, Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Had Schembechler left, it wouldn't have been the first time a coach ever  abandoned a university for a better offer. Were that not true, Schembechler  would still be coaching Miami of Ohio.  </P> <P> Bill Frieder found himself in a delicate situation last week. Arizona State  wanted a new basketball coach -- and wanted him now. ASU officials offered the  job to the Michigan coach but said they needed his answer immediately. Now or  never.  </P> <P> Frieder said now.  </P> <P> He expected to hop right back on a jet and return to his Michigan team, which  had an appointment to play Xavier a couple of days later in the first round of  the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. Frieder's Wolverines were  given, by some, a shot at winning the national championship.  </P> <P> The self-righteous Schembechler promptly decided that if they were to take the  championship, they would have to take it without Frieder. From his seat as  athletic director, Schembechler stripped Frieder of his command, like  Eisenhower taking the Third Army away from Patton.  </P> <P> "A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan," decreed Gen. Schembechler, who put  assistant coach Steve Fisher in charge for postseason play.  </P> <P> Schembechler has had heart problems in recent years, and now you can see why.  It's hard for doctors to find.  </P> <P> Schembechler says he wants "a Michigan man" to coach Michigan. Bill Frieder  attended the University of Michigan, which is more than Bo Schembechler can  say.  </P> <P> Schembechler presumably wants his adopted school's basketball squad to have the  best possible shot at the national championship, because such shots do not come  along very often. Then he refuses to allow the team's head coach to run the  team in the tournament.  </P> <P> Schembechler insinuates that Frieder deserted or even betrayed his basketball  players. Michigan has those basketball players because Frieder is the kind of  guy who goes recruiting night and day, day and night, until these kids see more  of him than they do of their relatives.  </P> <P> The least Schembechler might have done is consider the players' feelings. He  should have asked them if they felt seduced and abandoned. He would have gotten  responses like the one from Loy Vaught, who said that Frieder did not get a  fair shake.  </P> <P> Contrary to public opinion, college basketball players can think. And most of  them know that Frieder was not exactly slapping them across the face by leaving  for what he believed to be a better job. They respected the right of an  individual to choose a new life for himself -- geographically, economically,  whatever.  </P> <P> If you follow Schembechler's reasoning, Frieder should have risked losing a  position that appealed greatly to him by demanding that his new employers make  their decision when he wanted it made.  </P> <P> See, that's how Schembechler thinks, because this is a man to whom no one ever  talks back. Schembechler is a professional bully. Nobody can tell him what to  do, and everybody must do what he says. He is entrenched. He is popular on  campus and off -- as popular as Frieder was not -- because being victorious on  the field makes him appear both formidable and indispensable.  </P> <P> Our favorite Schembechler-related moment occurred after the coach had ordered  his football players to stop talking to the press. One day, running back Butch  Woolfolk granted an interview but first was asked if it might get him into  trouble.  </P> <P> "Hey," Woolfolk said, "I'm not 8 years old. Nobody tells me when and where I  can talk."  </P> <P> Bill Frieder gave his heart and soul to his basketball players. While other Big  Ten schools labored to land quality athletes, Frieder lassoed them into Ann  Arbor, provided Michigan audiences with winning records, first-division  finishes and regular tournament appearances.  </P> <P> As a reward, some of Michigan's own fans this season jeered him and unfurled  crude, cruel banners insulting him. Do you know what Michigan's home record  under Frieder was? Ninety-four victories and 10 defeats.  </P> <P> Some flop this guy was.  </P> <P> Those very Michigan followers who abused and criticized him probably are among  those today who are knocking him for not demonstrating to them any loyalty.  </P> <P> Frieder is taking most of the heat in his home state this week, and probably  would have gotten the blame if Xavier had defeated Michigan Friday, even though  the coach had to purchase a ticket just to get into the gym.  </P> <P> We will continue to wish Michigan well in its endeavors, including interim  coach Steve Fisher, a swell fellow who we happen to have known for more than 20  years.  </P> <P> What amuses us most is the scuttlebutt that Bo Schembechler intends to -- in  his own words -- "seek the greatest basketball coach in America to coach this  team," including a call on Indiana's Bob Knight for recommendations.  </P> <P> We have this adorable scenario in mind in which the greatest coach in America  leaves his current university for Ann Arbor, whereupon Schembechler tries to  explain to the coach's former employers that business is strictly business.  </P></p>

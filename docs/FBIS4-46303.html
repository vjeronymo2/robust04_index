			<p>BFN     [Text] Five copies of a leaflet signed by a group calling  itself "The Armed Group for the Proletarian Revolution -- The  New Walter Alasia Column" have been found in the city of Genoa.  The leaflets contained threats against President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini  [secretary of the National Alliance], Achille Occhetto  [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left], and Bruno  Trentin [general secretary of the CGIL confederated trades  union].    According to police sources, the leaflets call for the  resumption of the fight against capitalism and the traditional  parties, and even against other extreme left-wing groups, which  are defined as being "incapable of leading the class struggle."    The investigators are examining the reliability of the  leaflet and the group's symbol, which is unknown.</p>

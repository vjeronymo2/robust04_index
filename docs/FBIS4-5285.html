			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Resignation of Hosokawa Cabinet and </F> Expectations of the Successor Cabinet"]    [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa suddenly announced  his resignation as prime minister. He did this to assume  responsibility for a Diet deadlock caused by suspicions  surrounding his receipt of political funds which has prevented  the discussion of the fiscal year 1994 budget for one month.  However, nothing was clarified at a news conference regarding  the suspicions themselves, which are a vital point and the  direct cause of his resignation.    Prime Minister Hosokawa, who called for politics that were  fresh and easy to understand and who pledged to promote  political reform, entered the political arena by obtaining  overwhelming support from the Japanese people. It is ironic  that he had to resign only eight months after he became prime  minister due to suspicions concerning his political funds. It  is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] launched a  strong campaign designed to undermine the Hosokawa  administration. However, the prime minister became a target of  suspicions concerning his political funds, and he was unable to  give adequate explanations. Because of this, it turned out that  his credibility was damaged. This was a fatal blow to the  administration, whose primary goal was to realize political  reform.    We have pointed out repeatedly the fact that deliberations  on  and the subsequent approval of the fiscal year 1994 budget were  of vital importance to the current economic situation. We have  been urging the prime minister to break the deadlock by allowing  his former secretary to testify before the Diet as a witness and  by actively disclosing documents to clarify suspicions over such  issues as the 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group.  We did this because we felt that the aforementioned  countermeasures were the first step that the prime minister, who  sought to realize politics that is open and easy to understand,  should have taken.  <H5>  Resignation Announcement Was Sudden, Lacked Explanations </H5>   However, the prime minister maintained a firm stand. The  fact that Hosokawa suddenly announced, without adequate  explanations regarding the suspicions, his resignation was an  action by a prime minister who likes doing unexpected things.  However, we have to say that the announcement was too abrupt.  Logically speaking, the prime minister could have decided to  resign after paving the way for deliberations on the budget,  which is closely linked to the people's livelihood, or in  exchange for normalizing the Diet situation. Because of its  hastiness, however, the recent abrupt announcement gives us the  impression that suspicions still exist.    In a way, by giving up deliberations on the budget, the  prime  minister's sudden announcement appears to the people to be an  irresponsible act. The prime minister should have explained in  clear terms what created the circumstances under which he was  forced to resign. Now the people's distrust of politics will  increase. Also, it leaves a bad precedent in which a prime  minister of a nation was replaced without clarifying the truth.  We just cannot understand why the prime minister maintained his  cold stand from start to finish, in refusing to shed light on  the suspicions.    We expected that Japanese politics would be refreshed and  become capable of settling problems by regaining the people's  trust. In this sense, we welcomed the birth of the Hosokawa  administration, which put an end to the LDP's one-party  domination. The vices of the Hosokawa administration --  including discord within the coalition government, a lack of  leadership, and reliance on bureaucrats -- stood out. However,  it is regrettable that the curtain descended on the Hosokawa  administration all too soon. It is regrettable because we  believe that one of preconditions for getting rid of the ill  effects of the money-mad politics -- which is known for the  collusive ties between politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen  and zoku Diet members [influential Diet members concerned with  specific issues] -- is to have a non-LDP administration for a  while.    The birth of the Hosokawa administration changed in one  stroke the postwar political system--in which the LDP, which  benefited from the 1955 regime of Japanese politics, and the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] played central roles.  It drove both parties into a de facto dissolution and started  the realignment of the political world. The eight-month rule of  the Hosokawa administration was of great significance in that  the politics of the LDP collapsed and that the realignment of  the political world actually began. The realization of  political reform, which was the Hosokawa administration's  greatest task, and the liberalization of the rice market are the  coalition government's achievements which symbolize the end of  postwar politics.    Conversely, however, the fact is that the political reform  measures were approved after twists and turns weakened the  centripetal force that had united the Hosokawa administration.  This brought the divided opinions--which existed within the  coalition government over fundamental policies such as tax  reform and other important tasks, including the realignment of  the political world and the adoption of measures concerning  general elections--to the attention of the public. Disputes  over the concept of a national welfare tax, the formation of a  new new party, and other issues weakened the foundation of the  Hosokawa administration and became the causes of Hosokawa's  resignation.  <H5>  The Possibility of Reorganizing the Coalition by Attaching </H5> Importance to Policies    Because of the unexpected announcement of the prime  minister's resignation, the government has to settle two issues  in a hurry. First, the government has to start Diet  deliberations on the 1994 budget and approve it as soon as  possible. Although a tentative budget which is good for 50 days  was approved, the approval of the 1994 budget, which contains  economic measures, is a matter of urgency. Needless to say,  Prime Minister Hosokawa should clarify the truth about the 100  billion yen loan and other matters that hampered Diet  deliberations on the 1994 budget. But the LDP no longer needs  to insist on linking these issues to budget discussions. The  LDP bears the responsibility of immediately starting budget  deliberations.    Second, following Prime Minister Hosokawa's decision to step  down, the coalition is faced with the task of selecting the next  prime minister and his cabinet members. During the LDP's  domination, which continued for many years, a prime minister (or  LDP president) was selected in rotation from different LDP  factions because that party had the majority of seats in the  Diet. However, the next prime minister will be chosen from the  coalition parties. Will the coalition parties be able to  maintain the coalition government? Will they return power to  the LDP? Will a new coalition group form the next  administration by inviting the LDP to join it? Forming the  framework of the next administration is a precondition which  needs to be clarified prior to answering these questions.    The Hosokawa administration was not necessarily able to meet  the people's expectations when it was formed because the  coalition parties did not share common views on important  policies except for political reform. In this sense, the  parties that will form the next cabinet need to have similar  policies, characteristics, and political lines. It is wrong for  the coalition parties to attempt to maintain the coalition  government or for the LDP to aim to recapture political power  merely for the sake of taking power. If they did that, the  realignment of the political world will be nothing but an  attempt to gain enough numbers or enough seats in the Diet.    The formation of the next administration will have a major  impact on the future of Japan. The situation should be settled  by attaching importance to policies and the opinions of the  people. Who will become the next prime minister is a secondary  issue. The task of political parties and political leaders is  to clearly explain to the people what kind of policies they will  promote. They also need to come up with an ideal combination of  political parties to promote their policies as a coalition  group. It is a good opportunity for political parties to get  rid of the framework of the coalition versus the LDP and thereby  to form a coalition government by attaching importance to policy  issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, January 7 (XINHUA) -- British officials  denied today that there has been any proposal which would have  set a fixed timetable for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) to admit East European countries.    However, the Western Alliance has come to the conclusion  that  NATO should open up a perspective of eventual extension of its  membership but not try to determine criteria, timetables or  candidates.    The NATO summit next Monday [19 January] and Tuesday in  Brussels is expected to approve the partnership for peace plan,  which offers East European states closer military links with  NATO but no security guarantee or the full membership they want.    All Central and East European countries including Russia  will  be invited to join the program which will enable them to develop  military cooperation individually with NATO.    The partnership for peace will take place as part of an  evolutionary process enabling some of the former Soviet Bloc  states to become full members of NATO in the future, a British  Foreign Office official said.    It will allow these countries to consult with NATO whenever  they face a threat.    "Such a right of consultation and opportunity for  consultation is not of course a security guarantee... it is not,  of course, an automatic obligation on existing NATO members to  go to war on their behalf but it is an indication of a degree of  security concern on the part of NATO about these countries,"  said the official.    The NATO, faced with complaints from some East European  countries such as Poland for refusing them early membership and  opposition to its eastward expansion from Russia, will send a  signal that it is committed to enhancing security to all those  countries, including Russia, the official said.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THIS SOVIET STAKES HER CLAIM IN VANCOUVER SUPERMARKET  </P> <P> How is life in the West for Soviet players in the National Hockey League and  their wives?  </P> <P> Robert Fachet of the Washington Post writes: "Lena Larionov, whose husband,  Igor, is a center for the Vancouver Canucks, was returning from an outing with  Jennifer Smyl, wife of Vancouver captain Stan, when they stopped at a  supermarket to buy milk.  </P> <P> "Lena, accustomed to food shortages in Moscow, saw the meat cabinets and began  to fill her shopping cart with beef. She told the bewildered Jennifer, 'You  must buy it while it's here.' It took a lot of persuasion before she believed  it would still be there the next day.  </P> <P> "Left wing Vladimir Krutov participated in his first practice with Vancouver  and, when the 90-minute session ended, he asked Coach Bob McCammon what was  next. Told the team was through for the day, Krutov thought he was being teased  and said, 'No, I can't believe that.'  </P> <P> "McCammon said: 'One of the big adjustments for them is all the free time they  find themselves with. In the Soviet Union, everything was regimented. They rose  at 8, brushed their teeth, ate breakfast, practiced, watched videos, ate lunch,  practiced, had conditioning drills, ate supper, had an hour to call their wives  and went to bed. That was for 11 months of the year.' "  </P> <P> Add Soviets: Said Philadelphia Flyer General Manager Bobby Clarke of the Soviet  players: "They don't belong here . . . they shouldn't be playing in our league.  It's ridiculous. It's absolutely stupid. I'm totally against having them in our  league. Why should Russians come over here, get paid a lot of money and take  away jobs from Canadian and American players?"  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who were the only two World Series managers who never lost a game?  </P> <P> No-basis oasis: Burt Grossman of the Chargers on playing in the heat against  the Cardinals in Phoenix: "In the two-minute drill, I got so tired that I  started seeing mirages. I remember I saw a swimming pool with a bunch of beer  on ice -- no lie -- right about the 50."  </P> <P> The dome curse: Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun on the Herschel Walker  trade: "The Vikings with Walker might not be much different than the Vikings  without Walker -- a contending team, but not a Super Bowl team.  </P> <P> "But the Vikings have two things going against them in that quest. The first is  that they don't have a great quarterback. Neither Wade Wilson nor Tommy Kramer  qualifies. The second is that they play in a domed stadium and a dome team has  yet to get to the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Add trade: Pro Football Weekly's Jerry Magee: "When you have (Viking General  Manager) Mike Lynn matched against (Cowboy owner) Jerry Jones, you have to make  Lynn odds-on.  </P> <P> "Back up that turnip truck that Jones must have ridden in on. Jerry's going for  another ride, courtesy of Mike Lynn."  </P> <P> Last add trade: Lynn on selling Walker and his wife on living in Minnesota:  "They really didn't know anything about this state and, like most Americans,  think this is Siberia."  </P> <P> The Fitchburg State watch: The Falcons' emotional letdown apparently continued  as Framingham State rolled to a 37-16 victory Saturday. Fitchburg State is 1-7.  </P> <P> There ought to be a law: During an interview on WHYY-FM in Philadelphia, Terry  Gross asked Oakland Athletic Manager Tony La Russa if having a law degree  helped when La Russa argued with umpires. Said La Russa: "Nothing comes in  handy when you're arguing with an umpire."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Hank Bauer (4-0) guided the Baltimore Orioles to a sweep of the  Dodgers in 1966. George Stallings (4-0) led the Boston Braves' sweep of the  Philadelphia Athletics in 1914.  </P> <P> Quotebook: New York Ranger goaltender Mike Richter, after beating the Hartford  Whalers in his first NHL start: "The guys were unbelievably supportive. I think  my mom could have played the third period." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] While addressing the third working meeting of the  Ninth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on  27 June, Chilean President Eduardo Frei stated: "The lessons  learned in Chile from its traumatic recent past have taught us  that democracy is an absolute, indivisible value that cannot be  minimized."    The Chilean president added that there may be "different  ways  to organize a state from the institutional viewpoint, but there  cannot be different types of democracies for different types of  societies. Democracy, in essence, cannot be upgraded or  downgraded."    Frei continued: "We believe democracy exists when free,  secret, and informed elections are held. We believe democracy  exists when institutions and state branches are respected. We  believe democracy exists when there is a Congress that  functions, when there is an opposition force to supervise  government actions. We believe democracy exists when there is an  independent judicial branch to uphold the due process of law,"  and when "there is freedom of expression with communications  media, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly."    Frei added that world "politicians and political leaders are  harshly criticized; many say they are not politicians. Those of  us seated here--heads of state are political leaders--are very  proud to be politicians."    He added that if we want to rescue politics we have to  address "two basic concepts. First, a basic ethical and moral  concept and, second, a political leader must have a close  relationship with the people. We must be concerned about every  citizen, no matter how modest and humble."    The Chilean president said: "We must seek broad agreements  within our countries. When a president seeks agreements and  consensus within his country, the people say that he is weak,  that he lacks power, and authority. I believe it is quite the  opposite; those of us who seek great agreements and consensus  bring stability to the countries, bring grandeur to labor." We  respect power and authority "but at the same time we believe  power to be impersonal, we believe the law is superior, and we  believe in respect for the people."    President Frei met yesterday with his Bolivian counterpart  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. It was later disclosed that in  September the foreign ministries of the two countries will  disclose a proposal to step up bilateral relations. Frei denied  that these talks will imply yielding territory to Bolivia,  adding that "the subject is not on the agenda." Frei admitted,  however, that the subject was raised by the Bolivian chief of  state.    Frei commented on his meeting with Sanchez de Lozada,  stating  that it is important to meet with the various chiefs of state to  assess relationships and determine how to improve them.    Frei will meet today with Cuban President Fidel Castro.    Although he did not disclose the subjects they will address,  Frei said he upholds the proposal made at the summit: "We want  democracy and want to consolidate it," just as we want "respect  for human rights." He added: "Practically every country has  asked Cuba for a gesture. We want Cuba in the Latin American  system, but the next move is basically up to them."</p>

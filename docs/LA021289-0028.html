			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KLAN GIG  </P> <P> Even though rapper and ex-gang member Tone Loc lectures at schools, I find it  hard to believe anyone would consider him a role model to ghetto youngsters  ("Tone Loc: A 'Wild Thing' in the World of Rap," Jan. 29).  </P> <P> Dennis Hunt quotes him as saying, "For the right money, I'd play a Ku Klux Klan  rally." Tone exhibits a common social disorder known as greed. I doubt he has  ever been serious about anything, including gang membership.  </P> <P> SUSAN BLAIR  </P> <P> Wilmington  </P></p>

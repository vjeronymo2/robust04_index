			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER SUPPLIER FIRST TO TEST QUALITY WITH OWN LAB  </P> <P> Holding the test tube to the light, Dawn White flicks the sample of well water,  checking for cloudiness or gases that may have been emitted during the tube's  two days in an incubator.  </P> <P> The water, which has been mixed in a broth that supports bacterial growth, is  clear, indicating it is free of coliforms. If these harmless bacteria had been  detected, their presence would have been a clue that pathogens, dangerous  bacteria that could cause intestinal problems, might be lurking in the water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bulk of Workload  </P> <P> With 500 samples a month from California-American Water Co.'s 29 wells and  distribution systems in the San Gabriel Valley, coliform-testing is the bulk of  the workload for White, water quality supervisor at the firm's new laboratory  in Rosemead. Cal-Am supplies about 20 million gallons of water daily to  communities in Rosemead, El Monte, San Gabriel, Duarte, Bradbury, San Marino,  Temple City and Baldwin Hills, White said.  </P> <P> Most chemical contaminants, such as oil or fertilizers, enter the underground  water supply after being dumped by businesses and individuals. Bacterial  contamination often results when underground water is exposed to airborne  bacteria through corroded pipes or other problems. About 70 wells in the valley  have been shut down because of contaminants found in water samples, according  to Bob Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water  District.  </P> <P> The Main San Gabriel Basin, which supplies water to about 1 million residents,  has been designated a Superfund cleanup site by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Cal-Am is the only one of the more than 40 private water suppliers in the  valley with an in-house water-testing facility, Berlien said. The laboratory,  which will also test supplies delivered to residents of Coronado, Newbury Park  and parts of Camarillo, was dedicated Friday.  </P> <P> Most water companies contract with three major commercial laboratories in the  area to meet testing requirements set by the state Department of Health  Services, Berlien said.  </P> <P> "The cost of outside (commercial) testing is phenomenal," said David  Stephenson, Cal-Am director of rates and revenues. If all the company's testing  were contracted out to private labs, the price would be nearly $129,000,  according to Jim McVeigh, Cal-Am director of water quality.  </P> <P> Even with the $250,000 lab in Rosemead, Cal-Am will still mail samples to its  laboratory in Monterey, Calif., for more complicated tests for metals and  organic and inorganic compounds, he said.  </P> <P> The firm's customers will pay less than $1 more per year to offset the costs of  the lab, Stephenson said.  </P> <P> Coliform samples must be collected weekly because bacteriological conditions  can change so quickly, White said. State law requires that one sample be tested  for every 1,000 "services" the company supplies. A service could refer to a  single home or an entire apartment complex.  </P> <P> If coliforms are found, the affected piping system would be flushed, and  increased amounts of chlorine would be added to kill the bacteria, she said.  Bacteria-free water from underground wells is routinely treated with low levels  of chlorine to protect it from bacterial growth as it travel to the customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aid for Maintenance  </P> <P> Test results also help with maintenance. "If the numbers (of bacteria) are  high, it might indicate a growth in the pipes, which would lead to problems  like corrosion," White said.  </P> <P> She also checks the levels of nitrates and fluorides. "A lot of the work we do  is very routine because our wells are very clean," she said. Water from some  Cal-Am wells in the San Marino-Pasadena area is blended with water purchased  from the Metropolitan Water District to reduce high levels of nitrates.  </P> <P> "You do what you have to do to keep the system safe," she said.  </P> <P> Cal-Am decided to build the lab in Los Angeles because of the increasing number  of compounds the state requires water companies to test for, McVeigh said.  </P> <P> The Department of Health Services will add at least 25 more compounds to the  list this year, according to Susan Nielson, Pasadena's civil engineer in charge  of water quality. Pasadena spends $30,000 a year for water-testing at  commercial labs, although an in-house facility checks for particular  contaminants.  </P> <P> The city, which supplies nearly 37,000 services from its own wells and water  purchased from the Metropolitan Water District, is studying a lab expansion  because of the expected increases in workload.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In-House Lab a Luxury  </P> <P> But most cities that supply their own water cannot afford the luxury of an  in-house lab.  </P> <P> Arcadia, which pays $30,000 a year to send out all its samples for testing,  still finds that cheaper than conducting its own tests, said Rita Kurth,  administrative assistant for the city's water department. "We couldn't run a  lab for $30,000 a year," she said.  </P> <P> Nels Palm, director of public works in Monterey Park called the equipment  necessary for testing "completely out-of-sight, cost-wise." The city supplies  more than 12,000 services from its own wells and will pay a lab more than  $35,000 this year for testing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMON CONTAMINANTS IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY WATER  </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> Trichloroethylene (TCE)  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Solvent, degreaser  </P> <P> Health effectsPossible carcinogen, causes liver and lung tumors  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> Perchloroethylene (PCE)  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Solvent, degreaser  </P> <P> Health effects  </P> <P> Possible carcinogen, causes liver tumors and possibly leukemia  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> 1,1-Dichloroethylene  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Used in the manufacture  </P> <P> Health effects  </P> <P> Liver and kidney toxicant of plastic wrap  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> 1,2-Dichlorothane  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Used in the manufacture of pesticides and gasoline  </P> <P> Health effects  </P> <P> Possible carcinogen  </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> 1,1,1-Trichloroethane  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Used in the manufacture of food wrappings  </P> <P> Health effects  </P> <P> Central nervous system, reproductive organs and liver toxicant  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> Nitrates  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Fertilizers  </P> <P> Health effects  </P> <P> Causes "blue-baby" syndrome in babies up to 6 months old by depriving lungs of  oxygen  </P> <P> Contaminant  </P> <P> Fluoride  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Naturally occurring  </P> <P> Source or use  </P> <P> Strengthens teeth and bones, but turns teeth black at excessive levels  </P> <P> Source: state Department of Health Services  </P></p>

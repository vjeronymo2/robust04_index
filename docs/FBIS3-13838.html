			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jerusalem Which They Have Let Down!"] </F>   [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that it was a  mistake and a serious matter to introduce Jerusalem into the  draft resolution pertaining to the Ramadan massacre in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque. This introduction resulted in compensating  the Zionist enemy for an incomplete condemnation of the massacre  with a new and serious U.S. position on the occupation of  Jerusalem. Washington abstained on an article of the draft  resolution that considers Jerusalem as an occupied territory.  This is a tragic position that needs an open U.S. explanation.    His majesty's statements to AFP stressed his disappointment  and great fears about the shift in the U.S. position. Despite  all the efforts his majesty made before the vote on the draft  resolution, the United States maintained its position because  the Palestinian-U.S. dialogue, which other Arabs did not join,  led to this devastating result and placed the entire Arab nation  at a serious turning point concerning the occupation of  Jerusalem. This requires an explanation by the PLO first, and  also by other Arabs, particularly those who have always stressed  their determination to perform prayers in Jerusalem!    Resolution 904 is one of the bitter fruits and devastating  results of the Arab situation. Certain people are eager to  maintain Arab estrangement and differences. At a time when  these people are encouraging capitulation to the Zionist enemy  and giving material and moral bribes to each party that shows  readiness for this capitulation, we find out that these people  continue to pay such bribes in order to maintain Arab  fragmentation, grudges, and weakness. This tempted others into  destroying us during the Gulf catastrophe, and is now tempting  them into bringing about further destruction and humiliation.    King Husayn's statement was replete with bitterness and  disappointment. To his majesty and to all genuine Arabs and  Muslims, Jerusalem is our spiritual capital, so any position  hostile to its Arab and Islamic character will evoke the king's  anger and indignation.    Resolution 904 was another opportunity for the Arab nation  to  identify those who really care for both Jerusalem and every inch  of our holy places, and also to identify those who do not  hesitate to sell out both Jerusalem and these holy places.  Meanwhile, we have not seen or heard a move designed to condemn  the attempt to legitimatize the occupation of Jerusalem.  Instead, we have seen people reversing all their bargaining  chips and standing alongside the enemy, despite the fact that  the Arabs denied the United States neither funds nor  subservience, but rather kept serving the United States.  Naturally, we are referring here to those Arabs who were not  shocked by the serious U.S. position and who did not make  efforts to crystallize an Arab or Islamic position that would  enable us to confront this situation. Moreover, these people  demonstrated grudges, bad manners, and rancor to their brethren  whereas they demonstrated love, cordiality, and good treatment  to the enemy!</p>

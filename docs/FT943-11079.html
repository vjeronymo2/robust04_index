			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Equipment sales seen to rise Sales of construction equipment in Europe will rise by 2 per cent this year to more than 90,000 units, and climb a further 6 per cent next year, according to a forecast to be published by London-based analysts Corporate Intelligence Group. The forecast is significantly more optimistic than its prediction in the spring, when it thought sales would fall by 5 per cent this year before recovering by 7 per cent in 1995. The better outlook is partly due to a slower than expected decline in the biggest market, Germany, where the post-reunification boom in sales has ended. A 9 per cent decline in the German market is foreseen this year, compared with the 15 per cent predicted in the spring. The German market is likely to account for 41 per cent of total European sales this year. Elsewhere the group says some 'major changes' are taking place: the UK is enjoying very strong growth, Spain and France are recovering well, and Scandinavia is showing signs of returning to life. The overall sales forecast this year, 90,121 units, is still 10 per cent down on the level of 1991, and 16 per cent down on the peak of demand in 1989-1990.</p>

If a marketing agency has guaranteed a minimum sales price for the wool or mohair, is unable to sell the wool or mohair for a higher price, and therefore settles with the producer on the basis of such guaranteed minimum price, the sales document shall be on the basis of guaranteed minimum price, regardless of a lower price at which the agency may sell the wool or mohair. In such a case, the marketing agency shall indicate on the sales document that the price is the guaranteed minimum sales price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

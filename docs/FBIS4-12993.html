			<p>BFN     [Text] The rally of solidarity with the Netzarim  settlement has ended in the Qatif Bloc. Approximately 10,000  people from every part of Israel participated in the rally and  the preceding marches.    Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the rally was  addressed by right-wing Knesset members, including Ari'el  Sharon, Beni Begin, and Rehav'am Ze'evi. Ari'el Sharon told our  correspondent that the settlers must resist settlement  evacuation nonviolently.    Approximately 2,000 of the participants in the Qatif Bloc  events marched to Netzarim, violating a High Court of Justice  ruling and understandings with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],  and the Army was forced to escort the marchers.</p>

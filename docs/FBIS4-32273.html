			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gary Byrd: "Government Doing an Environmental </F> Balancing Act"]    [Text] The Czech government is walking an environmental  tightrope between hindering the country's industrial  productivity and making noticeable improvements in its neglected  ecology.    Industrial giants and government ministries have relied on  environmental consultants to gather information that will answer  vexing questions on the state of the Czech environment. Some of  these companies appear on THE PRAGUE POST list of largest  environmental consulting firms.    "The government is still debating the laws it passed in  1992," said Roman Vyhnanek, director of Czech Environment  Management Center. "The problem is they don't want to talk to  industries."    The Ministry of Environment is in the process of defining  and  creating new environmental laws, but companies complain that  current requirements are stiff and impose a financial burden  they cannot afford if they are to remain competitive.    One step in the privatization process for companies is to  outline methods of waste management that are in compliance with  the Environment Ministry's standards. Current pollution  reduction in Czech cities is directly related to these recently  privatized companies, according to Minister Frantisek Benda.    Industry watchers, however, said that the slowdown in  industrial production in the last several years is the primary  cause of the slightly cleaner air.    Consultants and government officials agree that air  pollution  in the cities is the most dangerous short-term environmental  hazard the country faces. And the brown coal mined in northwest  Bohemia is one of the most serious pollutants.    "The greatest problem is that almost every large power plant  in the Czech Republic burns tons and tons of coal," said Jiri  Herstus, director of Aplikovana geotechnika a ekologie (AGE).  "With the use of desulfurization stations, pollution wouldn't be  nearly as bad."    AGE, like many environmental consulting firms, works  primarily in the mining industry, assessing the impact of coal  mining on groundwater, air and soil. Herstus said CEZ, the  national energy company, is looking for alternatives to mining,  but meanwhile much land is being spoiled.    Even though the problem is well-defined, solutions remain  elusive.    The current Czech government must reach deep into its  coffers  to find the cash to pay for four decades of neglect. In its 1994  budget, the government allocated 1.2 billion Kc ($41.4 million),  about 3 percent of the overall budget, for environmental  projects. Cleaning up the Czech environment will cost much more  than that.    "There are still big holes in the environmental solution,"  said Herstus.    Communists chose factory locations for their accessibility  to  raw materials, without regard to effects on local environments.  Industrial waste contaminated rivers and groundwater, polluted  the air and fouled the land. Environmental laws existed under  the former regime, but fines were minimal and violations were  often overlooked.    Consultants on this week's list work primarily with giant  industrial companies, such as CEZ and the automaker Skoda, or  with departments within the government. These large  organizations have the funds to implement cleaner operations;  and, in many cases, the larger firms are the worst environmental  offenders.    Much consulting work is in the form of surveys and  fact-finding efforts, since there is little reliable information  on the Czech environment. Once a body of research has been built  up, the government will be able to assess better the magnitude  of the problem.    Municipalities and factories hire companies to explain the  current environmental laws and suggest ways to remain within  governmental standards while maximizing output. Consultants must  stay atop all environmental legislation because clients'  concerns run the gamut--waste management, groundwater  contamination, soil contamination, air pollution and overall  environmental impact.    Environmental laws today differ from their communist  predecessors "because before there were laws but no governmental  agency to enforce them," said Denisa Kratochvilova, a consultant  with KZT. "Now we have the Czech Environmental Inspection  Agency."    Kratochvilova added that it is natural for companies to  change only when threatened with substantial fines from the  government. The trick is to sway companies to comply with the  environmental laws without breaking their backs.</p>

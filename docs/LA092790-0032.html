			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> TEAMSTERS DISCOVER THE BALLOT;  </P> <P> THE UNION BEST KNOWN FOR CORRUPTION IS GETTING A TASTE OF DEMOCRACY. IT IS THE  MOST PUBLIC LOOK YET INSIDE THE POLITICS OF ORGANIZED LABOR.  </P> <P> Liberals regularly gather in the living room of economist and publisher Stanley  Sheinbaum's Brentwood home to raise money for "progressive" causes.  </P> <P> So why on Earth was the guest of honor on a recent Saturday night the first  announced candidate for the presidency of the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters?  </P> <P> This is, after all, the union that endorsed Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan.  This is the union that has seen three of its international presidents jailed on  federal charges since the 1950s and had a fourth die under indictment. This is  the union whose relationship with organized crime was called "a great American  scandal" by the Justice Department two years ago. This is the union that pays  150 of its top officials more than $100,000 a year.  </P> <P> This is the union that Ron Carey -- by all accounts one of the most humble and  squeaky-clean labor leaders in the United States -- wants to run and reform.  </P> <P> The fact that Carey, 54, the longtime head of a Teamster parcel-drivers local  in New York, would be welcomed to Sheinbaum's home is indicative of the unusual  support he is enlisting in an unprecedented rank-and-file campaign to become  international president of the 1.6 million-member Teamsters union, the nation's  largest trade union.  </P> <P> Carey's long-odds effort became plausible only after the Teamster leadership  agreed last year to place the union under federal supervision to settle a  government racketeering lawsuit.  </P> <P> The special federal rules, which include the first direct election of a  Teamster president in the union's history in 1991, have created the most public  exhibition of union politics in the history of organized labor.  </P> <P> In addition to Carey's campaign, loud disagreements have already broken out  between 71-year-old Teamster President William McCarthy and his top  lieutenants, one or more of whom may also challenge McCarthy next year.  </P> <P> "It's like watching a Byzantine empire cracking open," said a California labor  lawyer who represents several Teamster locals and spoke on the condition of  anonymity.  </P> <P> "It's a little like watching the inside of a corporation, and it's a little bit  like what's going on in Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R.," he said. "You've had  this archaic, frozen system in place for 50 years, where a little group of  power brokers at the top wheel and deal and run the joint, and now nobody knows  what's going to happen. The more people know about this (government-supervised)  process, the less they're willing to predict anything."  </P> <P> The supervised election "provides the union's membership with their first real  opportunity to clean up their union for themselves," said Michael Goldberg, a  Delaware law professor who recently completed a study of union reform lawsuits.  </P> <P> As Carey's campaign moves into its second year, the contrast between the  union's do-as-we-please history and his outspoken criticism is bringing him  national media attention as a rare breed of labor spokesman: articulate enough  to make a case for organized labor to the public at large, rooted solidly  enough in working-class culture to maintain credibility with his members.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of being a Teamster," says Carey, an ex-Marine and son of a  Teamster, who earns $45,000 a year as president of Local 804 in Long Island.  "And yet I hide from it. If my wife and I are in a social situation, I refrain  from talking about it because I know what follows: 'What about the Mafia?' The  first thing that comes out of people is: 'Teamster: mobster. Out for  themselves.' And that's true."  </P> <P> Traditionally, the Teamsters have chosen their president and 16 vice presidents  at a convention of handpicked delegates.  </P> <P> Now, however, the rules governing the union say those delegates have to be  elected by members of each local, and that the national candidates those  delegates nominate at the June, 1991, convention must compete in a  secret-ballot membership election late next year.  </P> <P> How this will play is anybody's guess.  </P> <P> Direct national union elections are rare in the first place. Among major  unions, only the United Mine Workers and the United Steelworkers of America use  them. In the case of the Teamsters, unknowns range from the level of membership  interest to the question of whether Carey, whose name recognition among the  membership is still extremely low, can raise the hundreds of thousands of  dollars needed to send campaign mail to the home of each Teamster.  </P> <P> The new rules stem from a Justice Department lawsuit in 1988 that charged the  union's 18-member executive board with depriving its membership of their right  to a democratically run union and honestly negotiated contracts through a  pattern of racketeering -- including a "campaign of fear," 20 murders, a number  of shootings, bombings and beatings.  </P> <P> Convictions could have led to a court order stripping union leaders of their  jobs and pension benefits. To avert that, the union's executive board last year  agreed to allow a three-member, court-appointed panel to oversee the  organization's affairs. In return the government withdrew its suit.  </P> <P> A flurry of activity -- significantly more than Teamster leaders expected when  they settled the suit -- followed:  </P> <P>  -- Charles Carberry, a former federal prosecutor who acts as investigations  officer under the government oversight program, has moved to expel more than 20  national and local Teamster leaders from the union on grounds of misconduct,  most of it stemming from associations with organized crime bosses. In moving to  expel union leaders, Carberry can cite any abuse of the union's own  constitution and bylaws, such as misuse of union funds or kickbacks from  employers.  </P> <P>  -- U.S. District Judge David Edelstein of New York, who approved the federal  oversight agreement, this summer strengthened the original rules governing next  year's election. In response to complaints from Teamster dissidents, Edelstein  ruled that elections of convention delegates in each of the 650 Teamster locals  must be overseen by federal monitors rather than union officials.  </P> <P>  -- Coincidentally, within some Teamster locals, a decade of efforts by the  prime group of dissidents, the 10,000-member Teamsters for a Democratic Union,  has begun to pay off. In elections of local presidents from San Diego to New  Jersey, reformers have defeated half a dozen incumbent local officers.  </P> <P> Carey is not a member of TDU, but he was quickly adopted by the organization,  which has provided a base of operations. Early this year Carey hired as his  campaign manager longtime United Mine Workers staff member Ed Burke, a veteran  of a rank-and-file reform movement within the coal union in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> The new rules say that to run for Teamster president, a candidate must be  "certified" by gathering 38,000 members' signatures on petitions. Carey's  campaign recruited hundreds of petition coordinators and obtained nearly 60,000  signatures in 38 states, becoming the first -- and so far the only -- certified  campaign.  </P> <P> The timing was critical. Certification assured Carey of campaign advertising  space in the October and February issues of the Teamster magazine that is sent  to all members, and which in this month's edition carried more  government-mandated pages about litigation surrounding the new rules than  Teamster-generated pages about day-to-day union affairs.  </P> <P> "That was a very impressive petition drive. That in itself is a mass movement,"  said Eric Mann, a former auto worker and now director of a Van Nuys-based labor  think tank who was among the guests who heard Carey speak in Brentwood.  </P> <P> To be nominated as a candidate on the national ballot, Carey needs the support  of 98 of the 1,957 delegates to the Teamster convention. "I sleep with those  numbers," campaign manager Burke says.  </P> <P> Carey is likely to get that far. How many votes he would receive from Teamster  members in the actual rank-and-file election would depend on how well Carey  could sell the notion of drastic change.  </P> <P> Michael J. Riley, president of Teamster Joint Council 42, which covers 165,000  Southland Teamsters, said he thought there would be few new convention  delegates elected as a result of Carey's campaign.  </P> <P> Riley said he regards Carey as lacking the experience to direct a union as  diverse as the Teamsters, which includes industries from construction to  airlines to freight to food.  </P> <P> "At meetings he has been in here in Southern California, members have  questioned him on issues and he was not knowledgeable," Riley said.  </P> <P> Carey, a short, intense, sad-eyed man, became a Teamster 35 years ago when he  went to work as a driver for United Parcel Service. He has headed 7,000-member  Local 804, the biggest UPS local in the Teamsters, for the last 23 years and  has been highly critical of the national union leadership for approving what he  calls concessionary contracts. Three years ago, Carey was among a number of  Teamster dissidents who were so upset by the national UPS contract negotiated  by the Teamsters that they successfully campaigned for rank-and-file rejection.  Carey's supporters boast of his modest lifestyle, noting he has lived in the  same house for 30 years and makes less than the chef who works at Teamster  headquarters in Washington. Members of his local have provided most of the  $150,000 that has so far funded his campaign.  </P> <P> Carey usually speaks only in general terms about what he would do as Teamster  president. He would, he says, improve pensions, bargain more aggressively with  employers, fire officials he found lacking integrity and eliminate the  multiple-salary policy that allows executives of the union to draw paychecks  for each of the positions they hold. It is not unusual for a Teamster leader to  draw salaries from the international office, a regional office and his local.  </P> <P> "What we have today is corporate unionism," Carey told his audience in  Sheinbaum's house, alluding to persistent criticisms from Teamster dissidents  that the leadership is detached from the rank and file. "We have to get back to  having a union that's a union . . . they (Teamster leaders) have nothing in  common with working people . . . we've got to get the bums out."  </P> <P> Teamster leaders, having battled these accusations for generations, dismiss  them as applicable only in a handful of unfortunate cases. McCarthy himself  rarely grants interviews. He wrote in the Teamster magazine earlier this year  that he had "consistently opposed any settlement (of the government's  corruption case), maintaining from the outset that the government's entire case  was groundless and politically motivated to embarrass the Teamsters."  </P> <P> Carey attempts to juggle his duties in Long Island with campaign efforts like  his recent trip to California. A few days before his appearance at Sheinbaum's  home, he flew from San Diego to Los Angeles, slept three hours and awoke at 2  in the morning. In a van driven by Steve MacDonald, a Teamster from a small  town outside Sacramento who had taken a week's vacation to help the campaign,  Carey and a few other supporters headed to Barstow to make the rounds of  freight company employees on their break.  </P> <P> By the middle of the afternoon, in 92-degree heat, Carey was standing in the  parking lot of an Alpha Beta warehouse in La Habra, flagging down delivery  drivers, trying to introduce himself.  </P> <P> "They don't know what the (election) process is, or how I fit into the  picture," he acknowledged.  </P> <P> Mike Moya, an Alpha Beta driver, stopped his rig. He and Carey chatted.  </P> <P> "We've got to change it (the union leadership), Mike," Carey said urgently.  "It's going down the tubes."  </P> <P> Moya had heard of Carey and was glad to add his address to the list of about  8,000 Teamsters who now receive Carey mailings.  </P> <P> "I think we need a lot of help," Moya said after Carey had walked away.  "Changes in the pension plan, corruption. I'd like to get involved."  </P> <P> Does Carey have a chance?  </P> <P> "I feel he has a chance," Moya said. "If the election's on the up and up."  </P></p>

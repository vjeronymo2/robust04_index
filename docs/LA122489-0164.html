			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAREWELL TO LARGENT IS SPOILED;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: SEAHAWKS LOSE, 29-0, TO REDSKINS IN RECEIVER'S LAST GAME. HIS  TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION RECORD REMAINS AT 100.  </P> <P> Among Steve Largent's receiving records is most touchdowns. In his NFL finale,  it was one record he couldn't add on to.  </P> <P> Largent, 35, caught two passes for 41 yards Saturday to extend his  consecutive-game reception record to 177, but the Washington Redskins, behind  the passing of Mark Rypien and the running of Earnest Byner, beat the Seahawks,  29-0.  </P> <P> "It was an emotional time for me," said Largent, who completed his 14-year NFL  career. "But I'm pretty disgusted with the way we played."  </P> <P> Still, Largent tried to look at the positive side.  </P> <P> "After the game, I said (to his teammates), 'I don't want anyone feeling bad  for me because of the game or the score. I've had so many good things happen in  my career, this game was really inconsequential.' "  </P> <P> The Redskins applauded Largent, who finished his career with 819 catches,  13,089 receiving yards and 100 touchdown receptions.  </P> <P> "Largent's career is a fantastic testimony to what's good in the NFL," Redskin  Coach Joe Gibbs said. "Everybody in the NFL will miss him."  </P> <P> The Redskins (10-6) won their fifth consecutive game as Rypien completed 22 of  31 passes for 290 yards. Gary Clark caught nine for 149 yards, including a  44-yard touchdown in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Byner scored on runs of two and eight yards.  </P> <P> Washington was eliminated from the playoffs -- for the second consecutive  season after winning Super Bowl XXII -- last week.  </P> <P> "You're not satisfied when you don't make the playoffs. But the way we finished  makes me eager for the start of next year," Byner said.  </P> <P> The Seahawks (7-9) were eliminated from the playoffs when Buffalo beat the New  York Jets, 37-0, earlier Saturday.  </P> <P> "I don't really think that had any effect on the way we played," Largent said.  </P> <P> The Seahawks, whose three-game winning streak ended, had their first losing  season in seven years under Coach Chuck Knox.  </P> <P> Seattle quarterback Dave Krieg set an NFL record for fumbles in a single  season, 18. He broke the record of 17 set by Houston Oiler quarterback Dan  Pastorini in 1973 and tied by Oiler quarterback Warren Moon in 1984.  </P> <P> "Mistakes hurt us this season," Krieg said. "I wish it was easily correctable,  but we just kept making them."  </P> <P> Krieg was sacked in the end zone by Fred Stokes for a safety in the third  quarter, one of four times he was sacked for losses totaling 37 yards, and also  threw his 20th interception of the season.  </P> <P> Stokes wanted to talk about what might have been for the NFC Redskins.  </P> <P> "It's kind of depressing when you look at the AFC and see the teams in the  playoffs with records worse than ours," he said. "Yes, we feel kind of  cheated."  </P> <P> The Seahawks were shut out for the first time since losing, 37-0, to the  Raiders in the Kingdome Dec. 8, 1982, a span of 48 regular-season games.  </P> <P> Chip Lohmiller kicked field goals of 29 and 27 yards in the first half as the  Redskins took a 13-0 lead. They scored 16 points in the third quarter and gave  up a chance to score a touchdown at the end of the game when they downed the  ball three consecutive times inside the Seattle 10.  </P></p>

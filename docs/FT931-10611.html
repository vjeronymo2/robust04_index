			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (13): Understanding the problem - Salman Rushdie ON February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a 'fatwa', or religious decree, that the author of the book Satanic Verses, Mr Salman Rushdie, had been sentenced to death. The announcement caused a storm of international protest and continues to bedevil Iran's relations with other countries, particularly Britain. Mr Javad Larijani, special adviser on foreign affairs to President Rafsanjani, explained the Iran's attitude to the issue: 'In order to solve this problem you first must really understand it. That is the key. The Rushdie case has parallels with all the religions in the world. It is an issue of blasphemy of the prophets. 'In Judaism and Christianity the verdict is much harsher than in Islam. What Imam Khomeini conveyed is simply what Islam thinks about a man who is guilty of blasphemy. So why blame Iran when that is how Islam thinks about a particular case? It is like blaming Jesus Christ for the way in which Christianity deals with blasphemy. In the 19th century there were cases in Rome and other places when they burned the man who had blasphemed the prophet. 'If we understand the heart of this matter, then no politician in London would ask an Iranian politician to disown the fatwa because it would be like disowning Islam and the Koran. This is not the sort of condition which British politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite unreasonable. The only condition put on relations between two countries should be mutual interest and respect. 'I think in this case perhaps the government in London is being manipulated. British politicians are wise enough to know all the tricks of politics. I do not find it easy to see what benefit there is for London by getting into such a game with Iran. I think they still do not fully understand in the west what the meaning of a fatwa is. 'Politicians in London should not teach us how to understand Islam, in the same way as we should not teach them how to understand the Leviathan of Hobbes. Instead we should get down to business, into those areas of mutual and converging interests in the economic and political spheres that do exist between us. Let us capitalise on the areas where we converge, rather than where we diverge. 'The issue of Salman Rushie is sometimes inflated by circles connected to Israel. They are very unhappy with relations between the west and Iran. I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but I cannot ignore that Israel does have a good apparatus for making some issues known to public opinion. They are strong at that. 'But, anyhow, it is the perceptions which are so different. The west considers the case like this: the head of a government is pointing his finger at a man in a foreign country and saying that this man should be executed because he wrote a book. If this is the type of picture being presented then it will be not very tolerable for the west. 'From our side the picture is quite different. We consider him (Rushdie) as a man who tried to betray Islam, to downgrade Islam and to downgrade the sentiments of more than a billion Moslems. So we said only what Islam expects for that man: that he does not deserve to exist. It's like, for example, you pointing your finger at Hitler when he was alive and saying that this man should be tried and executed a hundred times. This does not mean that you are sending paratroops to execute him. 'The main barrier, if we are to have an honest debate of this issue, is cultural, and the very deep emotion which blocks real understanding. The key is to understand the case objectively. Perhaps some debates between intellectuals, writers and thinkers could be very helpful. But this does not rest only on our shoulders. This should be done from both sides. It is not right for Britain to put all the blame on Iran.'</p>

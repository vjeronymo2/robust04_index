			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: 'Aladdin' pushes Walt Disney ahead 34% in first quarter Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, yesterday reported a 34 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, powered by strong US video sales of its hit cartoon film Aladdin. However, the results excluded its 49 per cent investment in Euro Disney, the loss-making theme park near Paris which is about to start full-scale negotiations with its banks over an emergency re-financing package. Walt Disney said it had not included Euro Disney because it took a Dollars 350m charge last November to reserve fully against receivables due to it from the park and its provision of limited and temporary funding to the business until the end of March. The treatment underscores Wall Street expectations that Walt Disney will take a tough line in negotiations with Euro Disney's creditors and will insist it will not provide funding beyond March 31. If a refinancing were not agreed by then, the park could close. Walt Disney reported net income of Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share, compared with Dollars 275m, or 50 cents, before accounting changes in the first quarter of last year. Revenues rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Operating income was up 26 per cent at Dollars 624.4m. The best performance came from the filmed entertainment business, which saw operating income rise 45 per cent to Dollars 340m on revenues 18 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.4bn. This was due mainly to the success of the film Aladdin in video cassette form in the US market, and in cinemas in international markets. Another factor was the international home video release of Jungle Book. Disney's theme parks saw operating income rise only 1 per cent to Dollars 138m, on revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 769m. The company said an increase in occupied room nights at its Florida resorts and a growth in per capita spending had contributed to the higher results, but these had been partly offset by slightly lower theme park attendance, due to the softness in international tourism. The consumer products segment saw operating income rise 17 per cent to Dollars 146m on revenues 22 per cent ahead ahead at Dollars 532m.</p>

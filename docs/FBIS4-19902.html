			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 22 (A.A.) -- Parliament Speaker  Husamettin Cindoruk described today the crisis in Turkey, being  a political one, rather than economic. `To eliminate the great  diversity in the country's politics, people should be united  around principles, not persons,' Cindoruk said. `If they call me  to duty, because of my 40-year experience in politics, then I  may resign from my position as parliament speaker, to unite  them.'    In an interview to be aired Saturday [23 April] on TRT-2,  Cindoruk said that today's problems in Turkey were similar to a  solar eclipse.    The Parliament's public relations office said today that  during the interview, Cindoruk said Turkey's future will  `certainly be bright.'    `I share the opinion of citizens that there is an excess of  political parties and this prevents democracy from being  genuine,' he said. `Mergers among right and left wing parties  would prevent a political extravagance.'    There are 25 political parties registered in Turkey. Of  these, 11 have seats in parliament.</p>

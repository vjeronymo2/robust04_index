			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Lufthansa's take-off helps Germany to overfly Europe FOR MOST of the third quarter, continental Europe was the place to invest big money, though its gains were checked in September. During July and August, the summer holiday 'lull' was not in evidence. European share prices, measured by the FT-A Europe ex-UK index, showed a rise of 10.7 per cent in sterling terms for the three months to September 30, compared with gains of just 1.7 per cent in the US, and 3.7 per cent in Japan. On figures compiled by NatWest Securities, bourse turnover (including the UK) followed a 20.3 per cent month-by-month gain in June with one of 20.8 per cent in July, and a further 5 per cent in August. Germany's equity market showed share price gains of 16.7 per cent over the three-month period. There was a surge of international investment enthusiasm for the Continent, and for Germany in particular. The slow descent in Germany's inflation and interest-rate trends did not always move shares when it was expected to do so; but, along with a perceived need for institutions to increase their market weighting in the country, it defended the market against disillusion and formed a background for special situation stories which lifted a number of market leaders. Among the top performing constituents in Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index, Lufthansa, up 37.1 per cent in D-Mark terms, rose on its privatisation prospects and on effective domestic political support. This produced an air pact between the US and Germany, and saw Lufthansa announce, in the early days of this month, a co-operation deal with United Airlines. Other German leaders included: Schering, up 23.6 per cent on prospects for Betaseron, a new drug to treat multiple sclerosis; Viag, the energy-based conglomerate, facing what looked like a highly profitable merger with Bayernwerk, the third biggest German utility; and Daimler-Benz, in its approach to the New York share price quotation, which allowed it to disclose earlier this year that up to DM4bn of profits, hidden away in provisions, were due to be unveiled. The general market enthusiasm did not continue into September. German equities rose again, but only by 0.5 per cent in sterling terms. France fell by 1.4 per cent in September and Italy by 6 per cent, while the Europe ex-UK index fell by 0.5 per cent, resisting still-powerful performances from Switzerland, and the Nordic bloc. Hoare Govett, in an October, 1993 review, says that profit-taking was much in evidence between July and September, along with interim reports focusing investors' attention on corporate fundamentals  - which often meant losses at a time of deep recession. Germany, in tandem, was troubled by a weaker US dollar, threatening the profit-margins and recovery prospects of its powerful exporting companies, and by concern over events in Moscow. France was aware of the upcoming BNP privatisation issue, and a spate of rights issues; indeed, the combination of governments raising money by selling their stakes in major companies, and companies raising money by rights issues, was beginning to haunt strategists at the end of the quarter. Italy had seen a L5,000bn (over Pounds 2bn) cash-raising package from Fiat, mostly in the shape of rights issues which, together with Mediobanca and Italmobiliare share capital operations, represented the drainage of 'massive liquidity' from the Milan equity market. The December quarter opened just after the German metal industries employers organisation had cancelled wage contracts for 1994 and provoked strike threats from the labour union, IG Metall. At the same time, divisions of the Russian army rolled into Moscow to put down the uprising, and gave bourses the excuse to rise again. However, there were still doubts. Most global strategists still favoured some part of Europe at the end of September, and most of these liked France; but Marcus Grubb, of Salomon Brothers, cast doubt on the French selection; and Nicholas Knight, of Nomura, was moving his followers at the same time into Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea and the Philippines.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of </F> the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date  not given: "I Am Seeking the Conditions for a Balanced  Coalition"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] What do you think  of the view that to take on a governmental role automatically  means the end for a liberal party because it is only possible to  draw up and properly construct a liberal ideology in opposition?    [Kuncze] I do not believe that the government's role is to  create ideologies, at least, it will not be the task of the  government led by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. In my  view, the electors are expecting us to put the economy in order  at last. The SZDSZ and the other liberal parties have the  necessary program to do this. Therefore, if we form a  government, this will mean the end of something else, namely of  the unfounded accusations.    [Pinter] In your view, to what extent have the parties of  the liberal alliance remained together?    [Kuncze] A cooperation agreement is in force between the  SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Liberal  Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian  Federation, which does not actually cement these parties  together but makes it likely that these parties wish to work  together even in the period after the elections. However, it is  still possible that a liberal party may not participate in a  possible government coalition even if its election results made  it eligible for government. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Many people see the intention of the SZDSZ and the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to participate in the same  government coalition as a fact. Is this justified?    [Kuncze] The MSZP's economic policy carries Laszlo Bekesi's  name, however, even the MSZP's current leadership cannot tell  whether this concept will be accepted by the majority of the  MSZP's membership and the future parliamentary group. If it is  not accepted then we have nothing to talk about. We have to  wait for the final results of the elections, and we have to see  to what extent the various parties are able to assert their  ideas in the coalition talks. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] To what extent can the voters view the SZDSZ's  ideas that have so far been made public as a government program?    [Kuncze] We are disseminating a version of the program that  is easy to understand, so it is accessible for everyone. On the  last page of our election program, we printed the following:  "Keep this booklet because you will be able to question the  SZDSZ's politicians on whether they have implemented what they  promised." If we did not honestly believe that we could  implement our plans when we are in government then we would not  have written this sentence here. We assessed the tasks months  ago, and we now precisely know what the first measures will have  to be in governmental position. The first draft bills will soon  be ready, we are now working on the texts. We also know what  kind of amendments we will propose in the operation of  Parliament and the government. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In your personal experience, what changes do the  SZDSZ sympathizers expect you to introduce?    [Kuncze] People are very well aware that we are facing  difficult years to come and a real economic boom still has to  wait. Therefore, first of all, they want honesty and sincerity  from the politicians. They want to be treated as human beings,  and they want their problems to be understood, in other words,  the country first of all wants a change of style: a new style  of politics, a new style in building relations with society, a  new style in cooperation with the opposition, and a new style in  the mechanisms of interest coordination. The electors expect  the establishment of new workplaces to be at the forefront in  the implementation of the economic policy, and we agree with  this: Our proposals to increase investments, to attract more  foreign capital, and to accelerate privatization are aimed at  this goal. It is possible to establish the conditions for  economic growth and this will be the basis for increasing living  standards.    Both the SZDSZ and the electors believe that the  relationship  between the government and the local governments has to be  changed. We have to recognize the fact that everyone is living  in a local government area. The operation of the local  governments largely influences people's feelings about living in  this country. The government and the local governments should  be working by assisting each other, rather than opposing each  other. We also want to implement in other areas, too, the kind  of politics where antagonism decreases and cooperation increases.    [Pinter] These goals are impossible to implement without a  broad political consensus. Can you see any chance of this?    [Kuncze] Yes, under an SZDSZ government. The next  government will even have to agree to limit its own sphere of  operation if this can make the consensus more solid. We are  prepared for this. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] The SZDSZ rejected with visible annoyance the idea  that the elections will actually be decided by a duel between  the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Has your  protest had any effect?    [Kuncze] These two parties are playing the game of  strengthening each other. Everyone who does not like the MDF  should go to the MSZP and everyone who is afraid of the MSZP  should support the MDF. Through this, the two parties show what  they are most afraid of. Their claims are not true on the basic  level of facts, either. As for [Prime Minister] Boross's  statement that they are still in the competition, it is  contradicted by all public opinion polls. The electors have  long decided who has to leave. The question is, who should  come. I am certain that the electors do not just want to swap  their tulips for carnations [the MDF and MSZP symbols] and keep  all else the same. I am seeking the conditions for a balanced  coalition. However, we will not achieve any change if the MSZP  becomes very strong.    The MDF's fate shows that the electors did not like the  concealed one-party system any more than the open one before.  This is why we are asking the electors to vote for us. A  strong SZDSZ is a guarantee that the practice of the past four  years will not be continued and, at the same time, there will  not be a return to the practice of the past four decades, either.    [Pinter] The SZDSZ has a completely different attitude to  the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. What is this to  indicate?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is an party open to all democratic  directions, therefore, we have not excluded the possibility of  cooperation with the KDNP, either. However, we are not  conducting talks with the KDNP to strengthen our relations.  [passage omitted]</p>

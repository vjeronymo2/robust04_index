			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.63(a) would have the reference to &sect;1.51(a)(2) replaced with a reference to &sect;1.51(a)(1)(ii) in order to conform with the proposed changes in &sect;1.51. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.67(b) would have the reference to &sect;1.53(d) replaced with a reference to &sect;1.53(d)(1) in order to conform with the proposed changes in &sect;1.53. Furthermore, the references to &sect;&sect;1.53(b) and 1.118 would be deleted to make clear that the new matter exclusion applies to all applications including those filed under &sect;1.62. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.78(a)(1) and (a)(2) would specifically preclude a provisional application from claiming the benefit of an earlier filing date of a prior copending application filed in the United States under &sect;1.53(b)(1) or &sect;1.62. S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 amend 35 U.S.C. 111 to provide that a provisional application is not entitled to the benefit of an earlier filing date in the United States under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c). Furthermore, the reference in &sect;1.78(a)(1) to the processing and retention fee required in existing &sect;1.53(d) would be deleted. The use of serial number and filing date in &sect;1.78(a)(2) as an identifier for a prior application would be eliminated to avoid any confusion as to whether an application identified by its serial number and filing date is an application filed under proposed &sect;1.53(b)(1) or &sect;1.62 or a design application since there is a different series code assigned to each of these types of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, new subparagraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) would be added to &sect;1.78 to set forth the procedures for claiming the benefit of an earlier filing date based on a prior filed copending provisional application. The later filed application must be an application other than for a design patent and must be copending with the provisional application, which will be abandoned by operation of law no later than 12 months after filing. There must be a common inventor named in both the prior provisional application and the later filed application. The prior provisional application must be complete as set forth in proposed &sect;1.51(a)(2), or entitled to a filing date as set forth in proposed &sect;1.53(b)(2) and include the basic filing fee. Newly added subparagraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) parallel the existing requirements set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) for other than a provisional application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.83 would have current paragraph (a) redesignated as subparagraph (a)(1) and would clarify that this paragraph relates to the content of the drawings in applications other than provisional applications. A new subparagraph (a)(2) would set forth the required content of the drawings filed in a provisional application. Since claims would not be required in a provisional application, the drawings filed in a provisional application would be required to show every feature of the invention disclosed in the description, rather than specified in the claims as in subparagraph (a)(1), where necessary to understand the subject matter of the invention. In addition, the reference to paragraph (a) in &sect;1.83(c) would be replaced by a reference to paragraph (a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.97(d) would have the reference to &sect;1.17(i)(1) replaced with a reference to &sect;1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to &sect;1.17. No substantive change is intended by this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

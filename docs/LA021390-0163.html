			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REFEREE DEFENDS DISPUTED LONG COUNT OVER DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Referee Octavio Meyran today defended his handling of the eighth-round count  over James (Buster) Douglas in his heavyweight title bout with Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> Meyran said there was no need to refer to the timekeeper in that situation.  </P> <P> "He won the championship fair and square," Meyran said of Douglas in an  interview with the Mexican television network Televisa.  </P> <P> Douglas knocked out Tyson in the 10th round in Tokyo on Sunday in a stunning  upset, but promoter Don King and Tyson argued that Douglas was saved by a long  count when he was floored in the eighth round.  </P> <P> "Douglas was felled by a punch, and what I did was make the count without  looking to the timekeeper outside the ring. With 22 years of experience and 30  world title fights, I think I have the ability to do that," Meyran said. "I  prefer not to depend on someone at the edge of the ring who is only doing a  count."  </P> <P> "The rules don't say you have to look to the timekeeper. Of course, you can  look for his help."  </P> <P> King withdrew his protest Monday night but again said Meyran made a mistake.  Meyran said there was no error.  </P> <P> "At the count of eight, Douglas started to get up and I saw that he knew what  was going on. He lifted his head, hit the canvas in a sign of disgust, which  told me he was ready to continue the fight," Mey-ran said  </P> <P> "The time was up and possibly Tyson would have won, but Douglas demonstrated  that he was well-prepared in the next round.  </P> <P> "Douglas was well-prepared physically. His punches were always good and he  stood up to everything Tyson threw."  </P></p>

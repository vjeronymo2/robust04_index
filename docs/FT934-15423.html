			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / The patter of tiny ideas The hot-air balloon launched by the Conservatives at Blackpool last week must be shot down before it reaches Whitehall. The blather of right-wing quackery is dangerous. The spectacle of ministers who know better ranting against picayune enemies, real and imagined, is demeaning. Worse, it confirms that the government has run out of serious ideas. I am not disputing the political force of attacks on foreigners, welfare cheats, criminals, pornographers, single parents, and trendy teachers. Adverse comments on classroom practice have even appeared in this space. Elderly voters do like to hear about the regrettable tendency of society to deteriorate since we moved films of it from black-and-white to technicolour. But rhetoric of the Blackpool kind is too easy. It is practised on the soap boxes at Hyde Park corner. Any taxi-driver can do it. The only difference is that the average cabbie's patter has more intellectual coherence than some of the calculated demagoguery of Messrs Michael Howard, Peter Lilley, John Patten and, regrettably, Sir George Young - not to mention the prime minister. There is, however, no justice. The trick may work. We have learned from the United States that an appeal to the ill-informed emotional sensibilities of the 'moral majority' - Mr Michael Portillo calls it the 'decent majority' - can be a powerful weapon in populist hands. More to the point, many of the propositions advanced at Blackpool contain a kernel of validity. When Mr Portillo gives them support by arguing in favour of individual responsibility they sound cogent. No wonder the Stupid Party was swept along. The whole is, however, less than the sum of the parts. If the social policy promises of Blackpool were to be delivered, little difference would be made to the lives of most people in the United Kingdom. The Tories would merely have cemented their core vote by inflicting unhappiness on a few miscreants or unfortunates, some of whom may deserve such a fate, and many who would not. Meanwhile attention would be diverted from the real problems of fostering employment, stimulating a competitive economy, and trying to avoid the destruction of the upper atmosphere. For example, the secretary for social security, Mr Peter Lilley blasted out in pure tabloidese that 'it made my blood boil this summer to read of foreign drug addicts feeding their habit by milking our benefits'. This sounded like the prelude to something big. Mr Lilley's actual rule-change, promulgated on August 2, may affect 10,000 foreign visitors, an unknown proportion of whom are drug addicts. There are some 5m British recipients of income support. The cash saving is put at Pounds 17m a year. Another rule-change, on housing benefit, is expected to save Pounds 50m; a delay to benefits applications by EC nationals will save an unspecified further amount. Set against a social security budget of Pounds 70bn these are marginal sums. They may help but the facts do not justify their use as a smokescreen for the government's failure to resolve larger issues, such as the future of indigenous social support. Next, law and order. 'I am going to take action. Tough action,' boasted Mr Howard. It is hard to name one of the home secretary's 27 announcements that will reduce the number of crimes committed. He himself would demur if asked to estimate the likely effect of his package on the spectacular rise in indictable offences. Punishing criminals, which is the essence of his approach, is a tiny niche in the crime control market. The official British crime survey suggests that close to 10m misdemeanours were committed in 1991. Half were reported to the police, who recorded 60 per cent of those reported. In England and Wales the police found some evidence against the perpetrators of fewer than a third of the crimes they recorded. The number of offenders 'dealt with' - formally cautioned, fined or imprisoned - constituted a tiny fraction, about a sixtieth, of the number of offences. The Home Office expects the prison population to grow from around 47,000 now to some 60,000 at the turn of the century. Mr Howard should set the latter figure against 10m crimes and rising. Perhaps he will then stop pretending that the success of his policies will be determined by the growth in the number of persons incarcerated. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, has the superior slogan: 'Tough on crime, and tough on the causes of crime.' The Tory right will admit of no social cause of wrong-doing beyond the absence of fathers. Mr Howard delivered a second, less rabble-rousing, speech in Blackpool. He argued, more closely than he might have done in the conference hall, for the superiority of the two-parent family. 'Does anyone seriously believe that a bit more cash - even if we could afford it - could even remotely make up for no father?' he asked. Every minister had his bit to do to reinforce a sense of responsibility in individuals. Along came the usually thoughtful minister of housing, Sir George Young, to ask: 'How do we explain to the young couple . . . who want to wait for a home before they start a family . . . that they cannot be rehoused ahead of the unmarried teenager expecting her first, probably unplanned child?' Perhaps by acknowledging, first, that whatever the young mother's motives, the child now exists and needs housing, and, second, that the problem, though real, has been greatly exaggerated. The Institute of Housing, which represents managers of local authority and housing association properties, published survey results last week which indicated that only two out of 30 housing authorities questioned reported a high incidence of homeless teenage mothers. You can tell if anyone speaking about family policy is serious by noting whether care is taken to separate the divorced, formerly-partnered and widowed majority of one-parent households from those in which there never has been a stable relationship. Even then, ask how many teenage mothers stay home with their parents. In short, these matters, important in themselves, are not significant aspects of a national policy. Exciting a crowd of ignorant pensioners in a Blackpool hall is no substitute for a programme of government action. Conservatives will continue to dodge the really important questions until they enjoy a spell of opposition.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Khatuntsev: "Peter, How Do You See Me?"] </F>   [Text] The first fiber optic communications line in Russia  has been placed into operation between Moscow and St.  Petersburg. This marks the beginning of the development of this  high capacity and reliably protected network, which makes it  possible to significantly expand information exchange.    In order to give a more complete visual representation, the  first, premiere, communications session was set up between two  audiences which had gathered in these two cities. Greeting his  colleague, Anatoliy Sobchak, Moscow Mayor Yuriy luzhkov noted  that a current market is unthinkable without a well-regulated  communications infrastructure, particularly since this is  vitally important for both of the Russian megalopoli. There were  no distortions in the "live picture" from Petersburg, and the  mayors agreed that now it is fully possible to hold joint  planning sessions of the two city administrations.    The new digital network owes its existence to the  cooperation  of the Makomnet, Metracom and Raskom companies with our railroad  and metro builders. Installers laid 688 kilometers of cable  along the Oktyabrskiy Railroad line, without interrupting train  traffic.    "The new communications line will make it possible to  increase safety and expand the possibility of automation," said  First Deputy Minister of Railways Oleg Moshenko. "This is a good  groundwork for building a high-speed Moscow-St. Petersburg line.  Now we anticipate developing the network to Vladivostok and  Novorossiysk. And for our rather overloaded metro trains, the  expansion in the range of communications will make it possible  to increase the rhythmic movement and effectiveness of  information."    The Moscow mayor's office has already allocated 24 billion  rubles (R) for building a high-speed line, which has been  conditionally named the Novonikolayevskiy line. Meanwhile,  Petersburg builders have demonstrated the model of a new  electric locomotive which will soon undergo route testing. The  new route will make it possible to employ millions of people in  the development of the adjoining territories. Understandably,  the two capitals will have to act in close cooperation. This  cooperation has already been quite successfully tested in  developing this country's suburban electric railway. Thirty-two  enterprises have been involved in this work, and the assembly of  trains is in full swing at the plant in Torzhok.</p>

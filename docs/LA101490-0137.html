			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOHL AIDE 'SATISFACTORY' AFTER SURGERY REMOVES BULLET;  </P> <P> GERMANY: AN EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED DRUG ABUSER IS HELD IN THE SHOOTING OF THE  INTERIOR MINISTER.  </P> <P> Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, key negotiator of German unification, was  reported in satisfactory condition Saturday after surgeons removed a would-be  assassin's bullet lodged near his spine.  </P> <P> A 37-year-old man described by police as an emotionally disturbed drug abuser  was being held in connection with the shooting Friday night at a campaign rally  in the Black Forest town of Oppenau.  </P> <P> The man, identified by German media as Dieter Kaufmann, "felt the state was  constantly following him and that Schaeuble therefore was responsible," said  Horst Knoepfler, a spokesman at the state Interior Ministry in Baden-  Wuerttemberg.  </P> <P> "The assailant at this point is considered psychiatrically disturbed, and the  attack had nothing to do with terrorism," Knoepfler said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> Peter Raisch, spokesman for the State Criminal Office, confirmed that Kaufmann  believed he was being persecuted and "was of the opinion that if he killed  Schaeuble, his torment would end."  </P> <P> Schaeuble, 48, had stopped to sign autographs while leaving the tavern where he  spoke about German unity when the gunman jumped up from a nearby table, pulled  out a .38-caliber revolver and fired three or four shots, police said.  </P> <P> A bodyguard was shot in the stomach trying to protect Schaeuble, who was struck  in the jaw and chest, authorities said. Schaeuble's 19-year-old daughter  witnessed the attack.  </P> <P> The assailant was immediately overpowered.  </P> <P> Neurosurgeons operated on Schaeuble for five hours Saturday to remove the  bullet lodged near his spinal column. A statement issued by Schaeuble's  ministry said he was in "satisfactory and stable" condition.  </P> <P> The bodyguard was expected to be released from the hospital today.  </P> <P> Knoepfler said Kaufmann apparently got the revolver from his father's gun case,  where it was kept with hunting rifles.  </P> <P> Kaufmann had a history of drug-related offenses, according to police. He  reportedly served three years in prison for a 1983 drug felony and was also  arrested for attempting to break into a pharmacy, Knoepfler said.  </P> <P> It was the third assassination attempt against a German politician in six  months.  </P> <P> Opposition chancellor candidate Oskar Lafontaine survived being stabbed in the  throat by a deranged woman at a campaign rally last April. Three months later,  the leftist guerrilla Red Army Faction planted a car bomb in an unsuccessful  attempt to kill Schaeuble's top anti-terrorism expert, Hans Neusel, who escaped  with minor cuts.  </P> <P> A woman who witnessed the attack against Schaeuble told German Radio that he  was conscious immediately after the shooting.  </P> <P> "I saw Mr. Schaeuble lying on the ground, with a shot here in the back and here  near the ears," she said. "I told him, 'You must not die.' He raised his head  to me, looked at me and said he couldn't feel his feet. He had no sensation in  his feet."  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew to Freiburg on Saturday to visit his longtime  associate at the Albert-Ludwig University Clinic.  </P> <P> Schaeuble, a former speech writer for Kohl, entered Parliament 18 years ago and  was catapulted into the limelight shortly after being named interior minister  in April, 1989.  </P> <P> He became the key negotiator of the historic treaty between East and West  Germany that resulted in their unification Oct. 3.  </P></p>

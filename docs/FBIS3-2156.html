Duchateau made the comment at a meeting reviewing the  progress of the three-year project, which began in 1988, and  making arrangements to strive for a similar second-phase aid  project.    The E.C.-sponsored dairy products operation is the largest  aid project that China has ever accepted in the agricultural  field. As a result, the supply of dairy products in 20 major  Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and  Guangzhou, has shown marked improvement.    Ambassador Duchateau described the project as having made  the  ties of E.C.-China cooperation closer and having laid a sound  foundation for a second-phase aid project in the same field,  which he believed will continue.</p>

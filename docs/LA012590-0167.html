			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GROWING JAPAN EXPORT: NEWS;  </P> <P> MEDIA: THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE JAPAN TIMES IS EXPANDING AND REVAMPING ITS OVERSEAS  EDITION.  </P> <P> Will Americans buy news and views about Japan from a Japanese paper when the  country already is the subject of extensive scrutiny in the U.S. press?  </P> <P> The Japan Times is banking on the idea. The largest and oldest English-language  daily in Japan is revamping its weekly overseas edition, beginning next month.  </P> <P> Gone will be the old black-and-white format on extra-thin paper. In its place  will be a tabloid-size, full-color weekly that reaches beyond political news  into business and other general-interest subjects such as art, food, life style  and books.  </P> <P> The Japan Times is moving aggressively to be the international purveyor and  interpreter of news about Japan. The expansion comes, perhaps not  coincidentally, at a time Japanese officials and executives express continued  frustration at what they call "Japan bashing" in the U.S. media.  </P> <P> "We're hoping to bridge the perception gap that exists between America and  Japan, which is particularly evident in the area of the trade issue," Toshiaki  Ogasawara, chairman and publisher of the Japan Times, said in a telephone  interview from his Tokyo offices.  </P> <P> "The paper will address issues from a Japanese perspective. The aim is to  correct the mistaken perceptions Americans have of Japan," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if the Japanese government is involved, Ogasawara said: "Some people  think the Japan Times is the mouthpiece for government. That is absolutely  nonsense. They do not own a cent" of the company's stock.  </P> <P> The newspaper is expanding as other publishing companies, both American and  Japanese, are moving across the Pacific Ocean to capitalize on the growing  demand for news about U.S.-Japanese relations. Japanese-language newspapers  such as Asahi, Yomiuri and the Japan Economic Journal are beamed by satellite  daily into the United States for distribution to Japanese nationals. Business  Tokyo, an English-language monthly in Japan, recently opened a New York bureau.  </P> <P> Moving in the opposite direction, USA Today has begun distribution in Japan.  The New York Times has announced plans for a fax paper in Tokyo, and the Los  Angeles Times is studying a similar product. The Asian Wall Street Journal and  the International Herald Tribune have been circulated in Japan for years.  </P> <P> Although the Japan Times dates to 1897 as the first English-language paper in  Japan, its big growth in circulation -- to 64,835 paid subscriptions -- has  come only in the past few years with the big influx of foreigners into Japan.  </P> <P> The overseas Japan Times Weekly, started in 1961, has a worldwide circulation  of "only 4,000 to 5,000," of which half goes to North America, according to  Ogasawara, who acquired a majority interest in the paper in 1984.  </P> <P> The Japan Times is investing $1 million in the expansion, said Ogasawara, who  also heads the company he founded, Nifco Inc., a manufacturer of industrial  fasteners, which has annual sales of about $300 million.  </P> <P> Ogasawara said he has been studying an expansion for two years and decided to  go ahead now because of interest in Japan's emerging role in the world and its  changing relationship with the United States.  </P> <P> "As tensions tighten, our market becomes more important," explained Philip J.  LaForge, general manager of Japan Times Weekly.  </P> <P> "All people hear about is trade and Japan-bashing on both sides," LaForge said  at the paper's new Wilshire Boulevard offices. He explained that the weekly  will be "a culturally unfiltered source of news about Japan. . . . It will be  completely edited in Tokyo," where it has a staff of 120.  </P> <P> The new, 24-page version of the weekly, which will debut the week of Feb. 5, is  twice as large as the previous version. It will be printed in Los Angeles from  pages sent overnight from Tokyo. Previously, the weekly was printed in Japan  and sent by mail to U.S. subscribers.  </P> <P> The Japan Times, whose current U.S. readership is composed mostly of  politicians and academics, is seeking to broaden its readership in Los Angeles,  New York and Washington because of their high concentration of Japan watchers.  It also is targeting San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Chicago.  </P> <P> The revamped Japan Times will have an initial printing of 20,000 and  subscription rate of $105 a year. Ogasawara would like to see a circulation of  50,000 to 60,000. La Forge says he has a personal goal of 70,000. To help the  effort along, the publication has hired circulation manager Michael Fisher,  formerly circulation manager at the Christian Science Monitor in Boston. The  Japan Times plans to sell ads in Japan and the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILIES IN JAPAN  </P> <P> JAPANESE-OWNED  </P> <P> Asahi Evening News  </P> <P> Japan Times  </P> <P> Mainichi Daily News  </P> <P> The Daily Yomiuri  </P> <P> FOREIGN-OWNED  </P> <P> Asian Wall Street Journal  </P> <P> International Herald Tribune  </P> <P> Pacific Stars &amp; Stripes  </P> <P> USA Today  </P></p>

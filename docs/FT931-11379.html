			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Exporters warned of payment delays UK EXPORTERS to other parts of Europe 'are facing very seriously increased risks', according to NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading private-sector export-credit insurer. Overdue accounts rose by more than a third in 1992 as recession and bankruptcies led to defaults in countries once regarded as virtually risk-free, the insurer said. Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's chief executive, said: 'The environment is very dangerous. It is important that people should realise that doing business in Europe involves increasing risks.' The warnings come just two weeks after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, his deputy, launched a broad-ranging initiative to boost exports across the EC called Business in Europe. The value of overdue accounts in the EC last year amounted to Pounds 72m, up from Pounds 53m in 1991, the company reports. Veiling actual numbers for reasons of business confidentiality, NCM says losses reported on exports to Portugal have soared 27-fold between 1987 and 1992. Losses reported for Spain have risen by 805 per cent, those for Belgium by 530 per cent. Even Germany was up 300 per cent. The company provided export credit insurance for exports worth Pounds 14bn last year, involving 6,000 companies and accounting for 80 per cent of the policies written for UK exporters.</p>

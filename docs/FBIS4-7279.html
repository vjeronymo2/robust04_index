			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa by Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo </F> University professor; moderated by Shoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI  SHIMBUN political bureau chief]    [Text] Demolishing the "Village Society" of Politics    [Oikawa] Now that the political reform bill has been passed,  with that in mind, I'd like to hear your views on several broad  topics, such as the sort of politics you would like to see in  the future, and the problems that Japan faces.    First, I'd like to discuss Mr. Hosokawa's performance at the  Japan-U.S. summit. For previous summits, the issues were worked  out at the administrative level in advance, and then the heads  of state would then formally agree on them. But this time the  talks ended without an agreement because a dispute over specific  quantitative targets. This was an unprecedented development. For  the first time, Japan unequivocally said "no" to a U.S. demand.  Since you have always attached a great deal of importance to  Japan-U.S. relations, we would like to hear your evaluation of  the recent talks.    [Ozawa] With the changing current of history, the end of the  Cold War, and the necessity for a new world order, the  Japan-U.S. relationship is bound to change. Therefore, given  that Japan must now become more independent, we are in a much  more difficult position than we were during the Cold War. Japan  must transform itself from a baby safely ensconced in a cradle  to a full-fledged adult with the ability to make decisions and  to act independently and responsibly.    But I notice that some elements in the mass media suggest  that saying "no" was a good thing. Perhaps the Japanese people  also derive some satisfaction from that, but they should not.  After all, a normal relationship involves saying "no" sometimes,  and saying "yes" at other times.    What I'm concerned about is that our relationship of trust  might crumble because of this, and that would be unfortunate. I  have learned from experience that, since the United States is a  nation that values principles, the Americans will understand if  we tell them that their demands are illogical. They think that  it is perfectly all right for us to say "no," or to express our  opinions. They understand. But when we're asked, as a member of  the international community, if we're doing our best to solve  the domestic market and national security problems, and other  problems, we can't respond with confidence that, "Yes, we are."  That's the current state of affairs in Japan.    Shouldn't we establish a system that will allow us to answer  "yes" to those questions? If the Americans get the impression  that we're not doing enough, that we're saying "no" to avoid  inconveniencing ourselves, and dodging our responsibilities,  then the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S. will  be destroyed.    [Sasaki] Along those lines, the media seem to be insinuating  that we should be pleased that Japan said "no," and also that  we're being asked to shoulder an extremely heavy responsibility,  without distinguishing between the two concepts. It is my belief  that we have taken on an extremely heavy responsibility. The  economic problems have remained unsolved for several years.  These problems appear to be the same now as they were around the  time of the "bubble." But the positions of both nations and the  climate in both nations have been changing. What are your views  on those trends?    [Ozawa] As far as politics is concerned, the coalition has  been likened to stained glass or a mosaic, but I think it is  much more flexible than Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  governments ever were, and that Hosokawa can now demonstrate  quite a bit of leadership. Strange as it may seem, a coalition  government is more effective than government by one powerful  party. The people are unhappy with postwar politics or, rather,  LDP politics, and they sense that its usefulness has ended. Once  you sense that public sentiment is on your side, then it's time  to make drastic changes in politics. I think that Hosokawa fully  shares that sentiment, and that it is the driving force behind  his efforts. The fact that he said "no" at the Japan-U.S. talks,  and that he was the first one to do so, gives those talks an  import beyond that of previous summits.    Also, as far as the economic situation is concerned, it is  true for many reasons that there isn't much leeway now. But it  was the business community that got carried away and created the  bubble, and now it has to face the consequences. It would be  inexcusable for corporations, which must accept the  responsibility for what they have done, to attempt to get  taxpayers to foot the bill. But that aside, we need to find a  way to reactivate the economy by using more innovative methods  and by allowing more freedom in economic activity, and in other  areas as well. We cannot build the stable economic society that  we will need in the future with our stifling, regulated,  bureaucratic society.    Nor can we, when we make changes, let it seem as though we  are making them because the United States is demanding that we  open our markets. This is Japan's own problem. Of course, I'm  not saying that we should emulate American society and have  totally free competition. To maintain a certain amount of  fairness, we need regulations to protect the weak. But there are  far too many regulations. Neither individuals nor corporations  understand independence, and it doesn't occur to anyone to take  responsibility for his own actions. This is just an example, but  the banks made loan after loan, creating the "bubble," and now  they want their debts to be paid with the government's--the  taxpayers'--money. How selfish can you get? Therefore, if we're  going to have situations like this, how can we expect Japan to  have a prosperous, stable economy in the next half-century, the  21st century? Japan must voluntarily decide to reduce the number  of regulations, and to allow more freedom in economic activity,  and more individual freedom. Basically, that is the course we  must choose.    [Oikawa] The United States has given particular emphasis to  these problems, and has referred to Japan's bureaucracy as a  "cancer."  <H5>  Make Better Use of the Bureaucrats </H5>   [Ozawa] You have to expect resistance when you try to change  a system that has existed for a long time. But the real problem  isn't a matter of the bureaucrats' resistance. I think it's  wrong to say that their recalcitrance prevents us from making  any changes. The problem is that the livelihoods of so many  ordinary people depend on these regulations.    For instance, automobile inspection costs a lot of money. If  we simply eliminated automobile inspection stations, aside from  the safety issue, the people they employ would suffer. Or, if we  simplified the distribution system, those who make a living from  it would really be in trouble. Problems like that are much more  serious than bureaucratic resistance.    During the Cold War, there was no need for either  politicians  or bureaucrats to make substantive political decisions. For all  practical purposes, their work consisted solely of preparing  budgets and making allocations as fairly as possible. For the  most part, all they needed to do was to go along with decisions  made by the United States. In that sense, what they were doing  was not politics. The same could be said of the bureaucrats.  They devoted all their time to elaborate regulations and  subsidies.    So, when we propose deregulation, pure and simple, the  bureaucrats object because their work would be taken away from  them. Here we have a group of talented people who have studied  hard to pass the government examinations. I think we can solve  this problem by having the bureaucrats use their talents in  other ways, such as to work on major political problems, and to  determine Japan's future role in the international community.    [Sasaki] In the area of foreign policy, the details of  discussions at the Japan-U.S. summit about the problem of  nuclear weapons in North Korea have not been disclosed. However,  is it reasonable to assume that a great deal of progress was  made through the prime minister's recent visit to the United  States?    [Ozawa] Yes. If we focus only on the comprehensive talks on  economic problems, what everyone seems to be saying is that they  didn't go well or, in contrast, that Japan finally said "no,"  which was a good thing. But I think the fact that at those  talks, Japan and the U.S. came to an agreement about their basic  positions on the North Korean problem, is of extreme importance.  Wasn't that the first time that Japan's prime minister clearly  stated his position on an issue like this one?    [Sasaki] I realize that you're thinking about how to change  the ways policies and decisions are made, practices that arose  under the 1955 system, and are still with us. However, I would  very much like you to comment on the policymaking mechanism.  Perhaps the recent political reform measures might be viewed as  "input." The way in which the voters express their opinions  about politics has changed to some degree. But what happens once  they have expressed their opinions, and how do they benefit from  that process? We still have no idea to what extent the problems  of the Diet, first of all, and of the cabinet, the  administration, and the administrative system will be resolved.  In some ways, it seems that we still have the status quo.    First, I would like to ask you about how the Diet is run.  There must be a difference between the way it has been run since  the change of government and the way it was run during one-party  rule.  <H5>  Leave Diet Debates to the Politicians </H5>   [Ozawa] Well, I really shouldn't criticize others, but  politicians still cling to the 1955 system, to the postwar  system mentality. Therefore, the LDP, which ran the government  for a half-century, is a more unyielding opposition party than  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] ever was. On the  other hand, the coalition parties, the ruling parties, which  were formerly in the opposition, still haven't realized that  they are now in a position of leadership. There are remnants of  the postwar system on both sides. This situation will not change  overnight, but I think politicians' thinking is changing very  quickly. For that reason as well, I believe that the coalition  was a good idea.    If we were still working under the 1955 system, then we  couldn't have resolved any of the problems we have, such as the  Uruguay Round, political reform, or the recent tax cuts. Even if  the LDP had had an absolute majority, it still couldn't have  done these things. We've been witnessing great changes,  substantial ones, and there will be more to come.    There is a lot of talk about a dual power structure, but the  reason for that, in my personal opinion, is the divide between  the ruling party and the administration. Traditionally, the  bureaucrats have written all the scenarios and all the scripts.  Officially, at least, we had the LDP's policymaking organization  on one side, and the administration on the other. It was hard to  tell which was which but somehow, the system worked. Since the  ruling party normally supplies the heads of all government  ministries and agencies, who are almost always ruling party  politicians, the ruling party should take responsibility for  both politics and administration.    In the Diet, monitoring should be done by the opposition.  The  ruling party has an administrative staff in possession of a  wealth of information and reference materials, so it is the  opposition that should check up on the government. The Diet  should make better use of that monitoring function.    If the ruling coalition approved, the administrative staff  could be abolished. But I really think that politicians should  be the ones to conduct Diet debates. If they did, the Diet would  be reborn in the voters' eyes and, most important of all, if  politicians devoted more of their time to study and to improving  their knowledge, the bureaucrats would certainly become more  malleable. Politicians are looked down on because they talk  nonsense.    Therefore, political parties could assume some of the burden  of election-related activities, thus saving 20 or 30 percent of  the energy politicians expend on them. I would like to see  politicians doing more independent study, at least when they are  in Tokyo. Then, they would be able to engage in debates with the  bureaucrats; and debates between the ruling party and the  opposition could be held in the Diet.    [Oikawa] Could you say specifically when and how you plan to  make these things happen?    [Ozawa] I sincerely hope that we can get started at the next  Diet session.  <H5>  Diet Debates: Opposition Versus Bureaucrats </H5>   [Sasaki] It does seem that debates between political parties  are actually taking place in the Diet, but I get the impression  that the debates are between the bureaucrats and the opposition.  Japan's Diet debates involve a tremendous amount of detail,  don't they.    [Ozawa] And all they talk about are trivial matters.    [Sasaki] The administration is the focus in these  question-and-answer sessions.    [Ozawa] Normally, the opposition is supposed to monitor the  ruling party. But the traditional mindset of the Japanese people  lumps the ruling and opposition party in the same category, and  views the bureaucrats as the real authorities. That is why both  the opposition and ruling parties want to hear what the  bureaucrats have to say. I'm saying that this sort of mentality  is unacceptable. I don't object to the bureaucrats' having the  bulk of authority. But the idea behind politics is that the  politicians chosen by the people should have the ultimate  responsibility. If everyone is content with listening to the  bureaucrats' explanations, then what we have is not politics.  Therefore, I am anxious to shift to a system within which the  politicians and the political parties chosen by the voters  accept responsibility.    [Sasaki] In other words, we have the bureaucracy, and the  political parties form another group. Conflict between the  ruling party and the opposition seems to be extremely fragmented  and peripheral. That's what you'd like to change.    [Ozawa] Yes. The bureaucrats constitute a large government,  and the political parties and politicians remind me of a noisy,  argumentative, disorderly mob. It's ridiculous for the ruling  party to be submitting questions to the bureaucrats. It's the  ruling party's government, after all.    [Sasaki] There is a great deal of public interest in  decentralization. Exactly where will this issue be debated? No  matter what the central government does, we're never going to  see decentralization if someone doesn't get the local  authorities moving.  <H5>  Clinging to a Regulated Society </H5>   [Ozawa] The Japanese say that they want deregulation, but I  doubt that most of them really do. Life is easier in a regulated  society. Local governments feel the same way. They complain  about the inconvenience of petitioning, but they would be scared  to death if we said, "Here's the authority, here's the money.  Now you handle everything." This fear permeates all of Japanese  society. People talk about decentralization, and it's true that  the central bureaucracy doesn't want to give up any of its  authority, but local governments don't really want  decentralization.    In that sense, a deregulated, independent society would  present difficulties for everyone. The business world complains  about the annoyances and inconveniences of bureaucratic control.  Its members complain to us, too. But when they come upon hard  times, they run to the authorities, begging to be bailed out. If  they declared that they didn't need the help of the bureaucracy,  then nobody would argue with them. But as soon as they have a  problem, they rush to the bureaucrats. That's why the  bureaucrats shout at them. This mentality prevails in the  business world, and that includes its top-ranking members as  well.    So, if politicians and bureaucrats were able to concentrate  on more important assignments, many of the details could be  entrusted to local government.    [Oikawa] These ideas have been discussed in various settings  for some time, but nothing seems to come of them. Even the  reports issued by the Council for Administrative Reform have  been limited to topics that the bureaucracy finds acceptable.    [Ozawa] Without question, making reforms in the manner which  I have suggested will be extremely difficult as long as things  are running smoothly. For instance, no one is going to think  seriously about the tax burden for welfare as long as things are  going well. Recently, when we were addressing the problem of a  Citizens' Welfare Tax, we were asked, "Why this, all of a  sudden?" But our society is aging rapidly. If we told people  that Japan's economy is in serious trouble, then they would  start thinking seriously about this problem. If you ask people  to think calmly about the problem of the tax burden, you will  find that more than 50 percent agree with us.    Both politicians and administrators were bewildered by the  sudden outbreak of the Gulf war. But in the future, our  politicians will face an increasing number of problems that  require them to make decisions. When those problems arise, they  will have to be considered seriously. Then, I think politicians  and bureaucrats will be forced to change. And for that change to  take place as smoothly as possible, politicians must become  aware of the necessity to change. You can write out a schedule  and convince yourself that it will work, but, I assure you, it  won't. At least, that's what I think.    [Oikawa] The Hosokawa cabinet came into power with political  reform as its main mission. A political reform bill was finally  passed, The Uruguay Round was brought to a successful  conclusion. Now the cabinet is attempting to overhaul the tax  system, and it looks as though that problem will be resolved,  too. There are many policy problems that need to be addressed.  Which do you think should be given priority?  <H5>  Responsiveness to International Situations </H5>   [Ozawa] There are domestic problems that need attention. But  basically, since the international community is in a tumultuous  state of transition, the first thing we should do is to  establish a system that can respond to these changes. In a  sense, that too is political reform. The electoral system reform  bill, which should be concluded soon, may provide an impetus.  Once that has been done, we should act quickly to reform  politics. That means setting up a system within which politics  gives rise to responsible decisions, which are then implemented.  In order to accomplish that we need to form at least two groups  capable of governing the nation. I wouldn't even mind if there  were three of them. An international crisis may arise that  ignites domestic problems. The sooner we create such a system,  the greater the likelihood of our being able to respond to such  crises with agility. That is our most pressing task.    How will we do it? What should our priorities be, and how  will we decide? Those questions can be answered by whoever is  running the government at the time. If the voters cannot accept  what that government does, they can vote in people who support  their views. That's how democracy is supposed to work. With  Japanese-style democracy, no decisions get made, but we cannot  go on this way.    [Oikawa] In other words, the first priority is to establish  a  political system within which decisions get made.    [Ozawa] Yes, and I cannot emphasize this enough. Other  problems can be dealt with individually, through discussion.    [Oikawa] I would like to move on to political  reorganization.  I am convinced that the implementation of the new electoral  system will trigger another political reorganization. The  possibilities are numerous. Could you tell us your thoughts  about that? Also, I've heard that Hosokawa may make a move,  perhaps even during the current Diet session. Could you discuss  that as well?  <H5>  Political Reorganization Will Happen Quickly </H5>   [Ozawa] I am in general agreement with Prime Minister  Hosokawa's perspective on this subject. We now have 300 small  electoral districts. This plan was previously proposed by the  government. Everyone has gotten used to that scheme, so when the  Diet passes it, everyone's thoughts will focus on the new  district system. Every politician will be thinking about  strategy -- what district he should run from, and how he can  win. Therefore, I think political reorganization will proceed  more quickly than the media has predicted.    [Oikawa] Your comment about political reorganization  proceeding more quickly than the media predicted is very  interesting, but I would like you to say a little more about the  process.    [Ozawa] At this point, I have no idea about what the process  will be. I am surprised that the situation is moving forward  much faster than I thought it would.    However, if you're asking about the main factor involved in  political reorganization, it will certainly be the elections,  since elections are the arena where every politician must fight  his battles. There's no other way to put it. At the same time,  what will be completely different from old-style politics is  that Japan must assume more independence to keep abreast of the  tumultuous changes in the international situation. We must  decide for ourselves what to do and what not to do. The  difference in opinions on this subject may be another factor.  When there are people in the same party who are at opposite  poles on an issue, it will be very difficult for that group to  remain intact.    Traditionally, the LDP has included people with a wide range  of views, from leftists to rightists. One might characterize the  coalition in the same way, but the point I am trying to make is  that the current configuration, with the coalition on one side  and the LDP on the other, is by no means the final one. I have a  feeling that there will be more upheaval.    [Oikawa] So, you're saying that the end result is not going  to be the current LDP versus non-LDP configuration, and even if  that remains the key configuration, some will leave the non-LDP  side, and some LDP members may join it....    [Ozawa] Probably. The media has an easy time of it--to them,  everything is LDP or non-LDP, black or white, yes or no, but  that's not what's really happening. I think there will be new  determining factors, factors that play a much more important  role than the traditional ones in establishing the new order.    [Oikawa] The LDP versus non-LDP concept is a leftover from  the 1955 system, isn't it.    [Ozawa] Yes, that's right.    [Sasaki] Another subject that looms large in the mind of the  public is our living standard and, in particular, economic  problems. The 1955 system has been linked with one type of  economic structure or system. Deregulation will certainly be a  factor, but in a more general sense, changing Japan's economic  structure will lead to a conflict between those who favor the  status quo and those who want politicians to show leadership by  making major changes. How much will that conflict affect  political reorganization?  <H5>  Developing New Industries </H5>   [Ozawa] To put it simply, I think that the business world  and  politicians who specialize in economic policy will divide into  two opposing camps--those who wish to retain the system we have  now, and those who want to change it. Positions will be  determined by opinions, and there will be a conflict between  those who want to respond to the changing times and those whose  view is, well, more historical.    During the postwar years, Japan resurrected its economy and  succeeded in achieving significant economic growth, but the  limits of that process have been reached. From now on, it will  be difficult to achieve economic prosperity through quantitative  expansion. Therefore, unless we generate a technological  revolution and use the intelligence and expertise of the  Japanese people to produce high-value-added products, Japan will  not be able to survive.    But corporations, lacking foresight, invested huge amounts  of  money in facilities and are now struggling to survive. Their  facilities are capable of producing twice the current demand.  They are carrying 10 percent more employees than they need. They  are at a loss as to how to solve these problems. They can  abandon their facilities, but not their employees. So, we have  to find an economic structure, a standard of living, that will  allow a mature society to survive without the quantitative  expansion that has been taking place.    Since, as I mentioned earlier, industry is saddled with a  10-percent personnel surplus, it must develop new industries and  technologies. The government should become actively involved in  this problem. Corporations must, of course, also restructure.    "Experts" on economics make irresponsible pronouncements  like, "Japan leads the world in high technology," but that's not  true at all. Japan leads the world only in applied technology.  Very little basic research is being done here. We are far behind  the United States. We must change our way of thinking and create  a system which allows Japan to take its rightful place in the  world by using our own inventiveness to create high-value-added  products, and by undergoing a continual technological  revolution. The government must support these endeavors.    Furthermore, if economic growth remains at a low level even  after corporate restructuring, the economy will, for a time,  cease to function smoothly. Then, the government will have to  tackle structural problems by, for instance, providing housing  in major metropolitan areas, and social capital in other  regions. It's not just hammers we need--Japan's investments in  information, culture, education (whole areas like those) are  lagging far behind other nations. So, while we establish a  stable society, the government needs to increase its investment  in these areas in order to create overall demand. By doing so,  Japan will increase its assets to the level enjoyed by Europe  and the United States. During this period, it will probably have  to borrow money by issuing government construction bonds. We  should get started on this project with a clear vision in mind.    While the government is working on these two projects, it  will also have to address three other major issues: how to  manage a welfare state on its way to becoming an aging society,  how to select the appropriate welfare system to adopt, and how  to determine the taxpayers' burden.    [Sasaki] Which segments of society will help you lay the  foundations when the time comes? Which ones will support these  ideas?  <H5>  Freedom With Fairness </H5>   [Ozawa] With the establishment of the present government,  the  traditional Japanese voting patterns have ceased to exist.  Previously, labor unions supported the opposition, and  non-unionists the ruling party. Urban residents supported the  opposition, and agricultural and rural districts the ruling  party. I think that from now on our citizens will vote for  politicians who share their views on issues that affect them  directly. Some will want our regulated society to stay the way  it is, and others will want more freedom. These will probably be  the major trends.    Our regulated society was designed with fairness and balance  in mind. For instance, currently we have the problem of general  contractors and their methods for bidding on construction  projects. Why did Japan adopt a designated bidding system?  Because if we hadn't, the big corporations would underbid  midsized and small companies, and the latter would be ruined.  The United States has had free competition ever since its  founding. There, the winners survive. That's how it's always  been. This is a political philosophy. Americans claim that  Japanese society is totally controlled by regulations and by  bid-rigging.    I'm not suggesting that we should have total freedom like  the  Americans. We have to maintain fairness. But we must have a  little more freedom in the areas where we compete  internationally. That will, in a way, lead to the opening of our  markets. The point I wish to make is that we should allow open  competition in areas that warrant our doing so, without  violating the principle of fairness. If there is more freedom,  we will see more innovation. If we don't do that, we won't be  able to compete. The Japanese must first get used to that idea  and then give it serious consideration. I also think that we  should deregulate as long as we are not compromising fairness  and equality, and by that I mean we should encourage people to  act independently and responsibly.    [Sasaki] May we assume then, that, in other words, when  political groups are formed, a sort of social reform could be  considered a unifying factor?    [Ozawa] Yes. The same idea applies to national security and  international relations. Freedom means independence. When we're  given freedom, that means that we have to act responsibly. So,  we must become independent as a nation, and as individuals and  corporations, too. We have to allow a little more autonomy. The  difference between this philosophy and the one that maintains  that we can manage quite well with the present system will  influence political alignment.    [Oikawa] Specifically, how will these ideas influence the  politics of the future? If the 1955 system is to be dismantled,  and more freedom is allowed, as you just described, how will  that affect the reorganization of political parties?    [Ozawa] Both the LDP and the opposition have become  complacent in our regulated society. The more regulated a  society is, the more susceptible it is to structural corruption  and collusion. It is better not to have regulations. The  disadvantage of regulations, which are devices used to ensure  fairness and equality, is that they become entangled with power,  and can easily be a breeding ground for collusion and  corruption. These problems can be corrected. Contemplating a  more serious problem, what to do about Japan's future, might  open people's eyes to the regulation problem; and this is a  problem of political reform.    [Oikawa] So, you're saying that opinions on Japan's national  goals and its role in the international community will diverge,  and that the view that Japan should become self-sufficient  within a new, constantly changing, international situation, will  have advocates and opponents, and both will influence political  reorganization?    [Ozawa] Yes. Future reorganization will be based on policy  considerations like these. What kind of policies do we want?  What kind of nation do we want? What kind of politics do we  want? What sort of international contribution should we make?  Differences in views on these subjects will play a much more  important role in reorganization than they have in the past.    [Oikawa] I understand that you favor a basic security law  which would include provisions for Japan's international  contribution. Would you like to mention specific suggestions for  such a law?  <H5>  The Need for a Basic Security Law </H5>   [Ozawa] Even if two groups with differing philosophies are  formed, we need to have total agreement between them, arrived at  after thorough discussion between the two about international  relations, especially national security. When our Constitution  was drafted, the need to include these subjects was not  anticipated. Therefore, we must declare Japan's desire to be a  peaceful nation and to support and abide by UN policies, by  drafting a basic security law, in order to make these things  absolutely clear to all our citizens. There will have to be  agreement between political parties on these issues, since they  are of vital importance. We cannot be in conflict over these  matters.    [Oikawa] With the establishment of a new electoral system,  questions have arisen about how elections are to be conducted,  such as whether two or more parties can join in supporting one  candidate, or whether a candidate can be backed by only one  party.  <H5>  No More Multiparty Backing </H5>   [Ozawa] Apparently quite a few politicians and Diet members  don't understand the new election law. The public doesn't  understand it either. With the revision of the election law,  political parties will designate candidates, both in the small  electoral and proportional representation districts. Therefore,  multiparty backing or cooperation, the idea of the "recognized  group," will cease to exist, although some people don't seem to  be aware of that fact. Candidates must be supported by one  party. Candidates supported by Shinseito or the SDPJ will remain  Shinseito or SDPJ candidates, and that's that. Of course,  unaffiliated candidates may run for office.    If, under the new system, we were to obtain the support of,  for instance, the SDPJ, the DSP [Democratic Socialist Party],  Komeito, and Rengo, then that would give us an advantage. We  would win. But even if members of the SDPJ, Komeito, and the DSP  ran under that sort of banner, that is, even if they had  multiparty support, they couldn't win one-to-one against the  LDP. At least, that's what I think. Therefore, we have to fight  the election battle as one political party, and not depend on  cooperation or multiparty backing. I don't mind if Shinseito,  Komeito, and SDPJ continue to exist as separate parties, and I'm  not saying that it is a bad idea. But if we don't change our  ways in the next election and put all our efforts into the  election as one party, then we're not going to be able to win.  On the contrary, if we do manage to accomplish this and do a  good job of it, I think that it will be very easy for us to  obtain the approval of the voters.    [Sasaki] I, too, think that ultimately what we need is a  changing of the guard. When new people enter the world of  politics, the approach to politics and the decisionmaking  process will change. Could you tell us about your views on  candidacy?    [Ozawa] This is an idea I got from Great Britain. I would  like politicians to seek public subscription. I'm a  second-generation politician, and I've heard a lot of criticism  about politicians' backgrounds. Second-generation politicians  and former bureaucrats seem to be special targets for criticism.  If politicians take a test and pass it, then that sort of  criticism will disappear. If it is acceptable to everyone, I'd  like to have a system where, when a new group is formed, it  seeks public subscription and can survive by doing that. When  that happens, politicians currently in office will beg to be  exempted from the examination. It would be terrible if they all  failed (laughter).    [Oikawa] Currently, the members of the ruling coalition, the  SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, Japan New Party, DSP, and Sakigake  have significantly different views on the direction this nation  should take. Various rumors have been spread, among them that  the Shinseito and Komeito have formed a bloc, that the Japan New  Party probably won't join it, and that Sakigake might not,  either.    [Ozawa] I don't see any need to think about which party is  good and which isn't, or which politicians are good and which  aren't. For instance, I'm satisfied with Hosokawa as the  captain, even if a new group is formed. I have no idea how  others feel, but what is wrong with his supporters forming a  group?    There are basic philosophical differences within the  coalition, but those exist within the LDP as well. I think that  if a new group is formed within the coalition, no matter which  party it turns out to be, that the coalition can be run without  serious dissension.    [Sasaki] You have been active for a long time in postwar  politics. What praise or criticism do you have for that era, and  what do you think your role has been as a participant in postwar  politics?  <H5>  Conservatism Means Changing With the Times </H5>   [Ozawa] The basic philosophy of postwar politics is often  referred to as the "Yoshida Doctrine." But my interpretation of  that doctrine is different from that of most LDP members,  particularly those who preceded me. I view the Yoshida Doctrine  as a plan that was established to ensure Japan's survival as a  nation after its defeat. Therefore, I think that the idea that  the Yoshida Doctrine should be followed through all eternity,  and that it should remain the governing philosophy of the LDP or  of conservative politics, is wrong.    Given the choices we had at that time and later, during the  Cold War, the Yoshida Doctrine was the appropriate policy for  Japan's revival and future growth. Today, when major changes are  occurring, those who believe that the Yoshida Doctrine should be  followed to the letter, and the changing situation should be  ignored, are not really conservative politicians.    Conservatism does not mean preserving longstanding abuses.  It  is even stated in the Five-Point Imperial Covenant that the  principles of true conservatism are responding to the changes  that occur over time, making needed reforms for the benefit of  the people, and doing away with the abuses of the past.    Don't misunderstand me when I use the word "conservative."  The word took on another connotation during the postwar era,  when we had conservatives versus reformists. I'm talking about  the true meaning of conservatism, in a broad sense. The time has  come for us to change politics.    During the past 40-odd years, the old way of thinking served  its purpose. Politicians emerged in response to the needs of  that era and, as I said before, there was no need for them to  concern themselves with international politics or extraneous  matters. They needed to concentrate only on economic recovery,  and were able to rely on the United States in all matters  concerning national security. They endeavored to distribute the  nation's wealth equitably. Politicians who were able to  accomplish such goals came onto the scene. That was good enough.  So, it is not their performance that is at issue.    But if the question is, "Can we go on this way?" then I'd  have to say no. The old system just won't work any more. The  Japanese have a special talent for working out a consensus --  the best possible solution for the majority. Wealth should be  fairly distributed. The idea behind democracy is for those with  divergent interests to reach a consensus, and we still need that  aspect of democracy. But we must turn our thoughts to the living  standard of our citizens, our economic activity, and the  survival of our nation. It is those issues that politicians must  address. We have entered an age in which politicians need a  great deal of foresight.    [Sasaki] Is Prime Minister Hosokawa's position on these  issues very close to yours?    [Ozawa] Yes, in that is he an advocate of responsible  reform.  I, too, have called for responsible reform, and worked to  achieve it. Hosokawa has a good grasp of the times and of the  tasks that he must accomplish.    [Sasaki] In Hosokawa's writings, I sense his strong  commitment to his political activities. Perhaps, one might call  that leadership. Are leadership and responsibility the most  important requisites for a leader?  <H5>  The Need for Leadership </H5>   [Ozawa] I've said many times that Japan's politicians have  managed quite well in the past without making any decisions. But  from now on, there will be an increasing need for Japan to make  responsible, independent decisions. Therefore, we will need  prime ministers and other high-ranking officials who can  demonstrate leadership and accept responsibility for their words  and actions.    When I speak about my philosophy on this subject, the media  and others accuse me of wanting to create a powerful nation, but  they are completely wrong. That's the sort of argument you hear  from people who haven't divested themselves of Japan's "village  society" mentality.    What are we going to do if our prime minister doesn't make  any decisions, doesn't say anything? Japanese society will be  ruined. The prime minister must make responsible decisions  independently and implement them. If he makes a mistake or if he  loses voter support, then he'll just have to resign. The person  who replaces him will do what he thinks is best. That is what  democracy is about. It is not about simply accepting the  position and making no decisions whatsoever, which is what the  arguments of those who object to this way of thinking imply.    [Oikawa] Another thing, is there a possibility of a tie-up  between the ruling coalition and part of the LDP?  <H5>  No Tie-Up With the LDP </H5>   [Ozawa] The philosophy behind the reforms we've been working  for, in other words, the reform of postwar politics,  parliamentary politics, is based on creating a system within  which two or more groups capable of assuming the government vie  for power, which alternates between them. Such a system would  bring an atmosphere of tension to politics, and would bring  about democracy in the true sense of the word. In parliamentary  politics, it is natural for the ruling party and the opposition  to talk to each other, and I have no objection to that. But that  is not what I'm talking about. Parties should be formed for  political reasons. This tie-up could not possibly happen. Why  did we go to the trouble to form another key group? Our efforts  would become meaningless. If that's what we had wanted, we could  have stayed in the LDP.    Therefore, I think it's fine to cooperate with the LDP and  to  hold discussions with its members, and I think we should do  that. But they will remain our rivals. We should compete with  the LDP for control of the government, but I cannot envision a  political tie-up or coalition with the LDP. In terms of the  cabinet it would be a coalition, I guess.    [Oikawa] In the March issue of THIS IS YOMIURI, we carried a  discussion between Michio Watanabe and Jun Eto. A  save-the-nation coalition cabinet which would include Watanabe  was proposed. What is your impression of Watanabe?    [Ozawa] I think that Watanabe has a good grasp of the trends  within the mainstream of the LDP. His views on the electoral  system differ slightly from mine. But I find myself in agreement  with his views on dealing with the international community,  Japan's future direction, and his belief that the taxpayers  should bear an appropriate share of the burden for supporting  our aging society.    [Oikawa] In conclusion, I'd like to hear your analysis of  your own career. Earlier, you emphasized the qualities that a  leader should possess: leadership and responsibility. Do you  envision yourself in a position of leadership, in the cabinet,  that is?    The reason I ask this question is that, in Tanaka and  Takeshita-style politics, the person who controlled the largest  faction didn't become prime minister. He would exert his  influence by supporting suitable faction members. That's the way  LDP politics was run at the end of the party's reign. Now that  you are secretary general of Shinseito, an extremely influential  position, some people interpret that as a dual power structure.  Would you comment on that?  [Ozawa] Whoever heads the administration must demonstrate  leadership. At the same time, such leadership can be exercised  to advantage only after the public recognizes it. Therefore,  Hosokawa is an appropriate leader for these times. I don't think  that I am suited for such a position and have no ambitions in  that direction.    But since you mentioned Tanaka and Takeshita, let me say  that  my present position differs from theirs. I'm not hiding behind  the scenes, I'm the secretary general [daihyo kanji] of  Shinseito. That corresponds to the secretary general [kanji-cho]  of the LDP. Since I have been asked to take care of the party's  personnel matters, I intend to do just that as long as I'm  wearing this badge, no matter what.    For instance, Tanaka wasn't personally involved in party  personnel matters, nor was Takeshita. Since I officially hold a  position of responsibility in this organization, I find this  comparison strange.    [Oikawa] You've been described as aggressive, and even as a  fascist by one group in the LDP. What is your response to such  comments?    [Ozawa] I make a habit of saying and doing what I think is  right but, in Japan's village society, no one speaks out. No one  in a prominent position speaks or acts responsibly. Through the  years, everyone has sought consensus and safety in numbers. In  that light, what I say and do is unusual. I do not enjoy being  the target of criticism, but if the Japanese and Japanese  society don't change, we won't be able to survive in this new  era. Since the voters have elected me, I owe it to them to speak  responsibly, as must anyone in my position, secretary general.    Let me use a figure of speech, or an example, to illustrate  what I mean. Minobe [former governor of Tokyo Prefecture] once  said, "If even one person is opposed, I can't decide anything."  This is the same thing we hear all the time--from the LDP, from  everybody. How in the world are we going to make any progress?  There are 120 million people in this country. What is going to  happen if we say that we won't do anything if even one person is  against it? Anyone in a position of responsibility must make  decisions. I encourage exchanges of opinions, of course. It is  impossible to avoid decisions simply because there is  opposition. If I'm accused of going against the traditions of  Japan's village society, then I can't deny that, nor can I  behave otherwise. The voters will be my judges.    [Oikawa] Thank you for giving us so much of your time.</p>

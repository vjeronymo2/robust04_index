			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Anger in town halls as projects hit delays: Authorities complain that government is blocking Brussels funds LOCAL authorities in depressed areas throughout England and Wales are strongly backing the European Commission in its row with the UK government over the allocation of EC aid. Anger and frustration is growing in town halls because of the risk that up to Pounds 1bn in EC aid could be lost to projects in the country's worst-hit regions because of the long-running conflict over distribution of the cash from Brussels. At the heart of the dispute is whether the various EC funds are additional to member states' regional spending or whether governments - the UK in particular - are using them to reduce the cost of capital programmes by curbing local authority spending. Mr Bruce Millan, the EC commissioner responsible for regional policy, is becoming increasingly convinced, following protests from local authorities, that the legal conditions for the distribution of aid are still not being met. The EC money should co-finance projects which would not otherwise go ahead, and which should have 'a genuine additional impact in the regions concerned'. Thus the long-running row is about what in EC jargon is called 'additionality'. In its efforts to curb public spending the government has reduced council borrowing levels in the relevant categories from Pounds 286m in the current financial year to Pounds 208m in 1993-94, a cut of 27 per cent. 'What this means is that the government is reducing what local authorities can borrow on other fronts in order that they can take up the European money. This is what Mr Millan is so concerned about,' said the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities. A broad range of councils and projects is affected. Cornwall County Council is building a 2 1/2 -mile road at a cost of Pounds 10m with a 50 per cent grant from the UK government, 25 per cent from the EC and the remaining 25 per cent funded by local taxpayers. However, it learned when the project was under way that half the EC allocation was not being forwarded by the government. At the other end of the country Barnsley Borough Council in South Yorkshire has seen its environmental and industrial development projects repeatedly delayed by the wrangles. Mr Richard Davies, director of economic development, said: 'We have had the silly situation where we have had to cram three-year projects into a few weeks because it has taken so long for the funding to come through.' He added bitterly: 'The bottom line is that the Treasury has been taking away the money from local authorities.' One initiative which has been particularly hard hit is the Coalfields Community Campaign - part of a three-year Europe-wide project known as Rechar which provides aid for the regeneration of mining areas. Although Britain was initially allocated Pounds 110m, nearly half the European budget for the programme, its start was delayed for nearly two years in Britain because the government failed to match the EC grant. Ms Barbara Edwards, deputy director of the project, said: 'Everywhere else in Europe they're powering ahead - the government accepts that they have to pay up. But here nothing happened for over a year because the funds were blocked.' She believes that the continuing rows could also delay the stage of the project due to start next year. Mansfield District Council, Nottinghamshire, which is also involved in the Rechar project, added: 'We are three quarters of the way through the programme, but the government is still talking about issuing guidance.' A similar saga of confusion unfolds in the Midlands, where plans to develop a railway line, backed by a 1992 EC grant, were held up by a lack of funds to match potential EC grants, local officials said. Enough money has been put together to start the line running north from Nottingham, but not enough to take it to Mansfield and Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Although the line is supported by the EC, the authorities involved are not sure if the stations on it are eligible for grants. The government turned down a grant for the line, thus, it was suggested, obstructing the arrangement of matching funds.</p>

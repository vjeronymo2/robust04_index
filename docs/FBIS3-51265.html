The spokesperson made the announcement  during a phone call to Radio Cadena Nacional studios in  Medellin, Colombia's second largest city.    An explosive charge was detonated as Hommes' vehicle drove  past, causing damage to the car. The minister was unhurt, but  one of his escorts was slightly injured.    A man who identified himself as a member of the ELN said  that  the attack was a consequence of the economic policies that have  brought poverty and unemployment to the country.    Hommes, who is one of President Cesar Gaviria's closest  supporters, has held his current post since 7 August 1990.</p>

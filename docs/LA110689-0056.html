			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 4 MEN DIE, WOMAN WOUNDED IN WEEKEND STREET VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The Sunday morning discovery of a man's body in a gutter has shocked many  residents on Belle Porte Avenue in Harbor City at a time when some say they  have been feeling a new sense of security in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Police had no suspects or motive in the death of a 27-year-old man who,  coroner's officials said, died of "blunt trauma to the head." The victim's name  was not released because his relatives have not been notified, police said.  </P> <P> On Sunday afternoon, a handful of residents stood on the sidewalk at Belle  Porte and 251st Street, talking of the slaying and staring at the droplets of  blood in the gutter and a single black thong, a rubber sandal that they believe  had been worn by the dead man.  </P> <P> "How can someone kill another like that?" asked Olivia Lugo, 19, whose  apartment faces the scene. "The body was right next to my dad's car. It's  frightening for everyone."  </P> <P> Area residents have long complained about day laborers, sometimes as many as  150, who sought work near the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Belle Porte,  loitering on their front lawns and porches, sometimes harassing passers-by.  </P> <P> But a week ago nearly all of the men left the area when Los Angeles city  officials opened a hiring hall -- the first of its kind in the city -- at a  nearby park,  </P> <P> "Just when we are starting to feel a little better, now we have this," said  Debbie Shipman, 31. "It's getting harder and harder to make our house quiet and  safe."  </P> <P> Police said they had little information on the 2:30 a.m. killing and would not  say if the man was a neighborhood resident, had a gang affiliation, or had been  known to seek day labor in the area.  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, Miguel Sanchez, 19, of Cerritos was beaten to death by five  baseball bat-wielding youths, one of whom was arrested Sunday afternoon, a Los  Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said.  </P> <P> At 1:20 a.m., Sanchez stopped his car at Vickie Avenue and Artesia Boulevard in  Cerritos and was confronted by the youths who shouted gang slogans and  challenged him to a fight. When Sanchez left his car, he was severely beaten on  the head, said Deputy Bill Wehner. He died Sunday afternoon at Pioneer Hospital  in Artesia.  </P> <P> Deputies arrested one suspect, Joffrey Deleon Lagadia, 18, at his home in Yorba  Linda, in Orange County, late Sunday afternoon on suspicion of murder. He was  being held without bail at the Lakewood Sheriff's Station, Wehner said.  </P> <P> Detectives were seeking more suspects.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Los Angeles police were investigating two gang-related drive-by  shootings that left two men dead in the city's Vermont and Lincoln Heights  districts. In both cases gang slogans were exchanged and then gunshots rang out  from passing cars, killing bystanders.  </P> <P> Rick Hutchins, 27, died in front of a house in the 1200 block of 102nd Street  shortly after midnight, police said.  </P> <P> In Lincoln Heights, a San Gabriel man was killed and a woman companion was  wounded in a shooting at 11:40 p.m. Saturday, police said.  </P> <P> Ralph Lopez, 24, was standing in a parking lot on the 2900 block of North  Broadway when he was shot. The woman, who was not identified, was in stable  condition at Huntington Memorial Hospital, police said.  </P></p>

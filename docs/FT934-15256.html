			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Coal peace discussions resume in Washington NEGOTIATORS for the United Mine Workers of America and coal company representatives resume talks in Washington today, amid hopes that the long-running US coal strike may be near its end. The talks are being led by Mr William Usery, who was appointed by the White House as a mediator in the dispute in September. Mr Usery met the union and coal companies separately yesterday in preparation for today's discussions. Both sides are returning to negotiations after a week-long recess for consultations. A spokesman for Mr Usery said: 'We are hopeful for a resolution by this weekend. That is our objective.' The union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the coal companies negotiating group, would not comment on the talks. The UMWA called a selective strike against the US's largest coal companies in early May, after working without a contract since February. Since then, more than 14,000 coalworkers have joined the picket lines. Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of UK-based Hanson, has estimated the strike has cost about Dollars 1m a day in lost profits.</p>

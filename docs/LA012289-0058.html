			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIMIZED BY COMMENTS IN THE SEXUAL ABUSE STORY  </P> <P> The article in the View section, "Sexual Abuse: When Men Are the Victims" (by  Kathleen Doheny, Jan. 10) was informative and no doubt served to broaden the  scope of thought and understanding concerning this sensitive issue.  </P> <P> However, there were comments made in the article that I found to be  irresponsible, (coming as they did from members of professions devoted to  assisting the healing of sexually abused people) and which were offensive to me  as a woman.  </P> <P> In reference to the assertion that sexual abuse has a greater effect on men  (than women), social worker Peter Dimock is quoted as saying, "Abuse of women  doesn't call into question their femininity." What ideal does Dimock apply to  femininity, I wonder?  </P> <P> Being feminine embraces qualities of strength, bravery and self-protection that  are surely called into question when abuse has occurred. Questions such as  "What could I have done to prevent the encounter?" or "Why did I let this  happen to me?" are all possible responses from one who is feminine.  </P> <P> Mike Lew, a Boston therapist says, "We have a place in our culture for women as  victims." I find this statement appalling. Lew seems to have overlooked the  fact that more than half the members of our culture happen to be female. Does  it make sense to think that we, as females, would provide ourselves with a  place in which we are victims in our culture?  </P> <P> CATE M. FITZMAURICE  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 6,500 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS MAY STRIKE  </P> <P> About 6,500 teachers in two California cities prepared Sunday to join 3,500 of  their brethren on strike in six other states in what has become an annual  end-of-summer rite.  </P> <P> More than 5,000 teachers are threatening to strike the Sacramento-area school  districts and there were plans for a walkout by 1,500 teachers in the San Jose  Unified School District. Walkouts in those jurisdictions would affect about  120,000 students.  </P> <P> About 3,500 teachers are already on picket lines in Ohio, Montana, Michigan,  Illinois, Pennsylvania and Idaho, affecting more than 60,000 students.  </P> <P> The disputes involve wages, fringe benefits and classroom issues.  </P> <P> In San Jose, year-old talks broke off Saturday and no new sessions were  scheduled. A strike there would affect 29,000 students when classes resume this  week. San Jose teachers have worked without a contract since June 30, 1988, and  are angry because they were not offered a raise.  </P> <P> School officials began contacting substitute teachers and advising parents to  make day-care plans in the event a strike closed schools. Teachers plan to  gather at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday before hitting the picket lines.  </P> <P> "It's truly disappointing," said district schools Supt. James Baughman. "We are  going to attempt, in some way or form, to keep the schools open."  </P> <P> Contract talks were stalled in the Sacramento City Unified School District and  the suburban San Juan School District northeast of Sacramento. Although  negotiations were expected to resume, a teachers' spokesman said, "We are still  looking at a work stoppage Tuesday."  </P> <P> San Francisco school officials and representatives of 2,800 teachers are in  negotiations but an agreement was predicted by today..  </P> <P> Around the country, teachers called strikes in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Quincy,  Ill.; Great Falls, Mont., and in several districts in Michigan, Pennsylvania  and Ohio.  </P></p>

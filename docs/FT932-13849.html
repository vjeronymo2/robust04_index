			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Russian economic reforms begin to see results Russia's economic reforms are beginning to bear fruit, with evidence of a fall in inflation, a reduction of credit expansion and a stabilisation of production, according to the Centre for Economic Performance run by the Russian Centre for Economic Reform and Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The figures show a fall in the monthly inflation rate from a high of around 27 per cent in January to 21 per cent in March. Production continues to run at levels between 10 and 15 per cent below those of last year, but the fall has stopped and there is a very modest evidence of a rise. Professor Layard said that there was 'an opportunity for further inmprovements in the economy' following an agreement between the central bank and the government to keep the increase in credits down to 10 per cent a month, and because of money promised by the Group of Seven. Foreign assistance coming into Russia in the second half of the year, he said, would amount to 20 per cent of its national income.</p>

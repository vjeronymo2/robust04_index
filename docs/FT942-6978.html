			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Big companies do pay up Sir, I refer to the problem of late payments to UK companies. I am financial director of a medium-sized business, and I have also worked in credit control in large and small companies. My experience is that the perception that it is large well-established organisations which hold back payments to small business is by and large mistaken. This makes good press. But the problem is usually one of the slow-paying smaller customer, sometimes operating on the margins of solvency. This being the case, I am sceptical that much would be achieved by legislation. Reasonably prompt and regular payment can normally be expected from the large customer, providing its invoicing requirements are followed. It is in this area that the small business, having less skilled office staff and without the help of a computer system, is often deficient.

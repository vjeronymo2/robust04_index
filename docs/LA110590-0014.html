			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER GIVES LIFT TO VIKINGS;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: FLEA-FLICKER HELPS VIKINGS DEFEAT DENVER, 27-22. BRONCOS BLOW  16-0 FIRST-HALF LEAD AFTER ELWAY LEAVES WITH FOOT INJURY.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Vikings spent the last month and a half waiting for a big play.  Sunday night, Anthony Carter and Rich Gannon made one happen.  </P> <P> Carter jumped over Alton Montgomery to catch a long touchdown pass from Gannon  with 14:04 left as Vikings halted a five-game losing streak with a 27-22  victory over the Denver Broncos.  </P> <P> The Vikings had the ball on their own 44-yard line when Gannon handed the ball  off to Herschel Walker, who took a step toward the line and pitched it back to  Gannon. Gannon threw the ball high and deep even though Montgomery had tight  coverage on Carter.  </P> <P> "I just thought, 'What the heck?' and threw it up for A.C. to make the play,"  Gannon said. "I knew Anthony could go up and get it."  </P> <P> Carter leaped to take the ball away from Montgomery at the 10, avoided Dennis  Smith to stay in bounds, and trotted in for the score to complete the 56-yard  play.  </P> <P> Carter was one of many big-name players to be criticized as Minnesota (2-6),  the defending NFC Central champion, got off to its worst start since 1961. A  dropped pass by Carter led directly to a loss to Tampa Bay, and he also dropped  two passes in last week's loss to Green Bay.  </P> <P> But Sunday he caught five passes for 146 yards, and came up with the biggest  play of the game.  </P> <P> Just the fact that the Vikings won was amazing. The fact that the Broncos blew  another big lead wasn't. Denver has led at halftime in all eight games but is  3-5. The Broncos have been outscored, 135-59, after halftime this season.  </P> <P> The AFC's Super Bowl representative last season, Denver lost for the fourth  time in five games and is off to its worst start in a non-strike season since  1975. John Elway hurt his toe and arch after leading the Broncos to a 16-0  first-half lead and backup quarterback Gary Kubiak was intercepted three times,  once for a touchdown by Joey Browner.  </P> <P> Did Elway's absence change the complexion of the game?  </P> <P> "That's a crazy question," receiver Mark Jackson said. "Of course it did."  </P> <P> "If you're a backup quarterback in this league, it's your job," Kubiak said.  "You have to handle it."  </P> <P> He didn't. Gannon, meanwhile, won for the first time in five starts in relief  of Wade Wilson, who is out with a thumb injury.  </P></p>

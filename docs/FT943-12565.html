			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Press Review: European parliament prompts pain and pleasure EUROPE The distinctive aspect of the French press and political establishment's reaction to last week's installation of the new European parliament has not been their direct comment about Strasbourg's new powers. French newspapers and politicians have joined those of other European countries in making the commonplace assessment that the narrow vote of approval for Mr Jacques Santer as the next Commission president shows the new MEPs intend to use to the maximum their powers under the Maastricht treaty. Despite the low standing that parliaments in general, and the European one in particular, have traditionally in the French mind, the feeling is that a strong Euro-parliament is inevitable, and, maybe now, even desirable. The real French moan is about the splintering of France's 87 MEPs into no fewer than seven groups at Strasbourg, and the possibility that this dispersal means that France will not be able to make its voice heard. Most of the fragmentation was a consequence of the proportional system that France uses for European elections. But there was a hope among some on the government side that the 29 MEPs who won election on the government's RPR-UDF coalition ticket would sit in the same Christian Democrat group of the European Peoples Party. In the event, only 13 UDF made it to the EPP, one stayed behind with the Liberals, and the 14 Gaullists decided to keep some Irish nationalists company, for fear the EPP might be too federalist for them. So, the UDF turned to the press to express its anger. Its leader, ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, complained to Liberation that, with only 13 French members in it, there could not possibly be a French candidate for the parliament's presidency which will be filled by someone from the EPP in two and a half years' time. In Le Figaro Mr Jean-Francois Poncet contrasted this with the way that German MEPs were concentrated in Strasbourg's two big groups, the EPP and the Socialists. The result, he said, would be that a German Christian Democrat would in 1997 succeed the new German socialist president of the parliament. 'French cacophony, German pre-eminence,' he commented. There was no such disgruntled comment from the German press. The liberal Frankfurter Rundschau described the debate over Mr Santer's confirmation as 'a great moment in Strasbourg.' The new deputies, the newspaper argued, gave 'a warning to Brussels, its bureaucrats, and European governments that it can no longer be taken for granted. Strasbourg has demanded more democracy from European governments' and must continue to strengthen the European parliament. Handelsblatt, the economic and business daily, went further, arguing that the 'system of consensus' for electing the president of the European Commission must be changed, implying that in the end Strasbourg had been faced with a compromise candidate thanks to Britain's veto. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the conservative daily, and firm supporter of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's original candidate for the top EU post, believed another positive aspect emerged from Strasbourg. It showed that Germany's governing conservatives and opposition social democrats could transcend party loyalties and work together to secure the election of Mr Santer. However, it too warned that Brussels will have to face the European parliamentarians next December when the deputies scrutinise the credentials of the new commissioners. The European parliament is the 'Cinderella' who is now 'knocking at the door', said El Pas, Spain's leading newspaper, in an editorial welcoming the assembly's close vote over the appointment of Mr Santer. The newspaper said that there were now three powers on the EU horizon: 'a Council of Ministers that seems to want to control institutional democracy; a Commission that has to redefine somewhat its role but which would do well not to consider itself a mere executive appendix to the Council; and a Parliament that we now know has no intention of letting itself be treated as the Cinderella of European institutions.'</p>

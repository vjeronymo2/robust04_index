			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop maintains recovery with Pounds 29.7m Body Shop International continued its profits recovery, yesterday reporting a rise at the pre-tax level for the year to end-February from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 29.7m, more than reversing the decline of the previous 12 months. The shares rose 20p to 234p. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the current year had started well with 'strong growth in all of our major markets'. He also said the group planned to change its Memorandum of Association 'to crystallise the principles and values of our business'. He said this would mean that if the company was run at some future date by people with different business ethics shareholders would 'have a hook to hang them on'. He stressed this did not mean he and Mrs Anita Roddick, managing director, had any less commitment to remaining with Body Shop. The figures went some way to allaying investors' fears that Body Shop was failing to counter competitive pressure in its home market. Comparable store sales in the UK were level in the year, after a fall of 6 per cent last time. Further, the growth in international profits reduced the UK's contribution to group operating profits to under 38 per cent. During the year the group opened 6 shops in the UK, taking the total to 239, out of a group-wide increase of 153 to 1,053 shops. Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 195.4m, while total retail sales, including franchisees' sales, were 18 per cent higher at Pounds 438.2m. Operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 24.3m) and there was also a Pounds 1.1m profit on the sale of the 65.6 per cent stake in Eastwick Trading, which operates shops in the Benelux countries and Austria. Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 1.5m as debt was reduced from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 11.8m, giving gearing of 12 per cent. Operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.4m. In the US, profits were ahead from Pounds 2.1m, a figure depressed by the Pounds 1.3m cost of moving the head office, to Pounds 6.2m. The rest of the American region was flat at Pounds 2.4m. In Europe profits rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 5.9m, while Asia, improved from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.4m. Profits from Australia and New Zealand were ahead from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.8m. Earnings per share, excluding the profit on the Eastwick sale, were 36 per cent higher at 10.1p. A final dividend of 1.25p is proposed to give a total of 2p (1.7p). COMMENT These results should have confounded some of Body Shop's critics. True, UK profits are unlikely to grow more than pedestrianly in future, but the rise in US profits, for instance, shows what the group can achieve overseas when it reaches the desired 'critical mass'. Further, Body Shop's revamped management team has tightened up the business, and the investment in recent years in new production facilities is beginning to pay off. On a forecast of Pounds 33.5m pre-tax this year, the prospective p/e is just under 20. The rating is nothing like it has been at times in the group's 10 year stock market history, but is justified by current growth prospects.</p>

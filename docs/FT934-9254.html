			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / News Corp lifted 21% with help from BSkyB and Ansett NEWS Corporation, the media, film and publishing group run by Mr Rupert Murdoch, yesterday reported a 21.4 per cent increase in third-quarter profits after tax to ADollars 262.3m (Pounds 120m). After abnormal items, profits rose to ADollars 246m from ADollars 193.7m. Progress was mainly due to a doubled contribution of ADollars 73.9m from associated companies, including BSkyB - in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has an interest - and Ansett Airlines, and to reduced interest charges of ADollars 173.6m, against ADollars 206.2m. Operating profits from the main group fell almost 5 per cent to ADollars 412.2m. News Corp said this reflected the cost of the newspaper price war in the UK - where newspaper profits fell 15 per cent - and reduced earnings from the 'free-standing insert' division. In the US, the filmed entertainment division saw operating profits advance from ADollars 15.8m to ADollars 42.5m, helped by releases such as Rookie of the Year, Robin Hood - Men in Tights and Rising Sun. However, the HarperCollins publishing business saw weaker earnings. Book publishing overall contributed ADollars 75.9m, compared with ADollars 82m. The release of the results coincided with publication of the Australian Stock Exchange's discussion paper on Mr Murdoch's controversial plan to create a new class of shares with 'super' voting rights, which would be issued on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders. The plan - seen as a means of reinforcing Mr Murdoch's control - has run into criticism from institutions. Looking at arguments for allowing differential voting rights, the ASX said it could encourage management commitment, counter short-termism by investors and induce companies to issue equity rather than debt securities. It also noted that share schemes should be a matter for shareholders, not the exchange. Conversely, the ASX said such shares could be seen to 'en-trench' management; increase the opportunity for the abuse of minority shareholders; and deprive shareholders of a potential takeover premium. The ASX asked interested parties to submit answers to 26 questions by November 29. Lex, Page 20</p>

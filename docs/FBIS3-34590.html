			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by an IRNA correspondent from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha  stressed Iran's role and importance in the region and the need  to broaden bilateral cooperation in economic, cultural, and  other fields.    During his interview with IRNA's correspondent in Moscow,  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha elaborated: We don't  even have the slightest difference with the Islamic Republic of  Iran hampering mutual cooperation. Asked about the Russian  Government's view of foreign policy, he said: In view of its  geographic position in Europe and Asia, Russia should have equal  political and economic relations with all countries based on  reciprocal interests.    Zaveryukha stressed that unilateral tendencies usually have  dangerous and negative consequences for countries such as  Russia, so there must be multilateral cooperation with countries  such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and  Pakistan.    He added: The "insane ramblings" of individuals such as  Zhirinovskiy regarding neighboring countries are not at all  representative of the opinions or will of the Russian  Administration or people.    On the prospects for cooperation between Iran and Russia and  the cordial relations between Iran and the former Soviet Union,  the Russian deputy prime minister added: In the Persian Gulf  region, Iran is bestowed with all kinds of capabilities, so we  should establish extensive cooperation in the cultural and  economic fields.    On the upcoming conference of the Caspian Sea littoral  countries, he stated: Iran's participation in this conference  along with the CIS member countries is necessary and imperative.</p>

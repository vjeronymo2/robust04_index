			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Briefing the National  People's Congress [NPC] on "China's 21st Century Agenda" today,  Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission  Deng Nan called for the final solution of environmental  problems, adding that the economy must develop on a long-term  basis, but if environmental problems are ignored in the process  of development, economic development will be seriously hampered.    "China's 21st Century Agenda" is "The White Paper on China's  Population, Environment, and Development in the 21st Century."  "China's 21st Centuray Agenda," completed after one and a half  years since its drafting began in August 1992, was compiled in  line with China's national conditions. It echoes the United  Nations' "21st Century Agenda." This volume of policy guidance  documents, compiled like an encyclopedia and approved by the  Chinese Government, expounds the strategy for sustained  development in China and will certainly serve as guidance for  drawing up long- and medium-range economic and social  development plans for China.    Deng Nan said: China has entered a stage in which its  economy is developing rapidly. This has brought about an  opportunity for us to solve environmental problems, but it has  also brought us challenges. The development of the economy and  technology has made it possible for us to increase investment to  deal with environmental problems, but economic development in  China at present is basically resource-oriented. Therefore, it  is possible that development will bring about destruction of the  ecology and worsening of the environment. Deng Nan said: We  should foster an outlook for the comprehensive development of  the population, the economy, society, resources, and the  environment, and find a path for sustained development for China  in accordance with its national conditions.    Deng Nan said: The formulation and implementation of  "China's 21st Century Agenda," as a document to privide guidance  for the drafting of national economic and social development,  will make it possible for us to solve the past problem of  economic development divorced from environmental protection. At  present, we have drawn up the first batch of priority plans for  the implementation of the "China's 21st Century Agenda."  Sixty-two projects in nine areas are included in these plans.  Of these projects, those that we have successfully striven to  turn into projects of international cooperation will be included  in the state's long- and medium-range plans. These projects  will be developed according to our needs.    Deng Nan pointed out: In drawing up their programs for the  year 2010 and their Ninth Five-Year Plan, various areas and  departments should pay attention to embodying the idea and  contents of "China's 21st Century Agenda." Meanwhile, they  should do a good job in running comprehensive social development  experimental zones and set up training centers which can train  international personnel on a sustained basis. We should  strengthen propaganda and further mobilize and encourage the  masses to participate in our projects. We should further advance  the implementation of "China's 21st Century Agenda" by relying  on science and technology. We should extensively launch  international cooperation so as to lead China onto the path of  sustained and sound development.</p>

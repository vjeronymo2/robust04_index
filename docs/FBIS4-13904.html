			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho talks, has affirmed  that the Palestinian side is ready during the current round of  negotiations to reach an agreement on the outstanding points  concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He added that agreement  would depend on whether the Israeli side intends to finalize the  remaining issues this week.    Speaking to reporters today before the start of the  Palestinian-Israeli round of talks, Sha'th noted that a date for  signing the documents on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement  cannot be set before we find out what the Israeli delegation is  bringing with it and whether or not it is really ready to  finalize the outstanding issues. Sha'th pointed out that among  the issues still under discussion by the Palestinian and Israeli  sides are security-related issues such as the legal jurisdiction  over Gaza and Jericho, and he noted that the two sides had  previously reached a verbal agreement on this matter. He added:  We are waiting to see the draft the Israeli delegation is  bringing regarding this issue. Sha'th pointed out that there  are some paragraphs in the "general agreement" that need to be  revised, and the same applies to the question of the release of  the Palestinian detainees from Israeli prisons.    Sha'th noted that should the Palestinian and Israeli sides  reach an agreement during this week's talks, the date for  signing the agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement  will be announced next week. He stressed that all this is  contingent on the intentions of the Israeli side. He referred  in this regard to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks  in which he said that the agreement would be signed on 15 May.    Sha'th added that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will  meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo at  the end of this week. He noted that 'Arafat's meeting with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is not confirmed.    Sha'th stressed that no one can pressure the Palestinian  side  into giving up its rights, even if this means another year of  negotiations. He added: If the Israeli side is ready to sign  an agreement next week, the Palestinians are ready too. He  added: The Israelis must not believe that we are prepared to  abandon our rights to meet a specific deadline.    On the recent agreement between Fatah and Hamas, Sha'th said  it will open the door for national unity so that a Palestinian  national authority can be established on Palestinian territory  and an inter-Palestinian peace can be achieved.    Concerning the number of Palestinian detainees to be  released  by Israel, Sha'th said that this will be discussed with the  Israeli delegation in today's meetings.</p>

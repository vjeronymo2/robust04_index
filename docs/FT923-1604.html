			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: More feelers out for international syndicated loans / Assessing European states' options for supporting their currencies if market turbulence persists CONTINUED tension within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System may force some European countries to follow the example of the UK and Sweden, both of which tapped the international syndicated loans market earlier this month to support their domestic currencies. Following the turbulence in the financial markets last week, other sovereign borrowers are understood to be looking at ways of raising finance at short notice in case further bouts of currency speculation occur. Since Sunday's referendum in France on economic and monetary union, some European currencies have come under pressure again in the foreign exchange markets. The French franc, Irish punt and Italian lira (which has been suspended from the ERM) came under most pressure, with the Spanish peseta and Danish krone suffering more modestly yesterday. On September 3, the UK government announced plans to borrow Ecu10bn in D-Marks and a range of other currencies, using the money to support sterling and to fund government spending. The Ecu10bn consists of an Ecu5bn three-year multi-currency revolving credit facility and a longer-term multi-currency note issue programme. It is expected that the first tranche  -the Ecu5bn revolving credit facility  - will be fully drawn within the next few days. A week after the UK announcement, Sweden arranged an Ecu8bn syndicated credit as part of the central bank's Ecu16bn programme to bolster the krona and crush rumours that the Swedish currency was about to be devalued, while Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the central bank, pushed the marginal lending rate up to 500 per cent to halt currency speculation. The syndicated facility consists of an Ecu3bn 364-day loan and an Ecu5bn three-year multi-currency revolving credit. Bankers cite Italy, Spain, France, Denmark and Ireland  - whose currencies have all come under pressure in recent days  - as the obvious candidates for such borrowings. Of them, Spain is understood to have fairly substantial foreign exchange reserves which have not been too depleted by recent market turmoil. Spain launched a Dollars 1.5bn seven-year Eurobond last week which is expected to be be priced today. The borrowing is part of Spain's general borrowing programme to fund its public sector deficit, but the proceeds will help to build up Spain's foreign currency reserves. France, whose currency came under further pressure yesterday, had foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 30.5bn in June, the most recent figures available. Mr Jim O'Neill, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, points out that France would probably be more likely to use the combination of intervention and higher interest rates to protect the currency than a syndicated credit facility. 'Even if the French did choose the loan route, they would want to keep it quiet after seeing how dreadfully it backfired with the UK,' he said. In his view, the countries most likely to want to use the loan route to raise funds for intervention are Italy and Ireland. Italy's foreign exchange reserves were thought to be almost depleted last week when the lira was taken out of the ERM of the EMS. Ironically, Italy is probably least likely to receive support from the international banking community. Many international banks were furious about Italy's handling of the situation with Efim, the state holding company which was put into voluntary liquidation in July. Lenders are still trying to negotiate the terms of repayment on Efim's substantial debts. Ireland, which according to IMF figures had foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 4.97bn in July, could also consider a loan to help replenish reserves, especially if the currency comes under further pressure. However, Mr O'Neill believes Ireland would be more likely to raise interest rates to support the currency. 'There is a lot of talk of other potential borrowers in the loans market,' according to a senior banker at one of the big US houses which specialises in sovereign borrowing. He emphasised, though, that at this stage the enquiries have mainly been concerned with which market to use if borrowing were to prove necessary. Some bankers warn that European sovereign names could find it difficult to persuade banks to lend them the money. One banker said: 'Even though they are zero risk-weighted names (from the point of capital adequacy requirements) the return is not that good, so you have to have good business reasons for doing such a deal.' Most banks who participate in such deals would hope to compensate for the low return by winning other business. For example, banks which participated in the loan to Sweden may hope to further their business interests by playing a role in the government's privatisation programme. Borrowing in the syndicated loans market tends to be more expensive than in the bond market. However, it has the advantage of allowing more flexibility on when the loan is drawn, and a borrower can usually raise a larger amount and at shorter notice. While European sovereign borrowers appear at this stage only to be making initial enquiries about raising funds, some may be deterred by the UK's experience. The announcement of an Ecu10bn borrowing certainly helped to instill confidence in sterling at the time  - but the effect was embarrassingly short-lived.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 18 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront  [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] has decided to implement its  transitional authority in Pretoria on January 29 to lead the  Afrikaner to freedom, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg announced on Tuesday night. The decision was taken  by the AVF on Tuesday, Dr Hartzenberg told a public meeting in  Pretoria.    Representatives of the Afrikaner volk [people] across the  country would be invited to attend the occasion to sanction the  body to plan and take decisions for the Afrikaner and to mandate  it to "achieve our freedom before the April 27 elections", he  said.    Dr Hartzenberg said although the Freedom Alliance, the  government and the African National Congress [ANC] would be  meeting on Wednesday "we don't expect much to come from the  talks". He added that it did not matter what they (the  government and the ANC) decided, the Afrikaner was marching to  freedom and self-determination.    Dr Hartzenberg warned that the Afrikaner should not be  forced  to become the enemy of those who wanted to force an unjust  dispensation on them. Accusing the media of trying to drive a  wedge between him and AVF leader Constand Viljoen, Dr  Hartzenberg said they had a "hearty" relationship.    The implementation of the AVF's own transitional authority  was proof that the Afrikaner was determinedly on the way to  freedom and would not be ruled by the communist-dominated ANC,  he said. Surveys showed the ANC would get most votes in seven  of the nine provinces, which meant the Afrikaner would be  dominated on central, provincial and local levels, he added.    An Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] could still secure a  peaceful solution "at this late hour" and amendments to the  constitution could be made before the end of the month, Dr  Hartzenberg said. A plebiscite could be held to determine who  wanted to be included in the homeland. This could be completed  in March so that elections could take place in the volkstaat  while the rest of the people voted in the general elections, he  said.    In Pretoria, earmarked as the capital of the proposed  volkstaat, more than half of the residents had indicated they  wanted to be included in the volkstaat, he claimed.    Dr Hartzenberg also called on the city's thousands of civil  servants to make themselves available for the volkstaat because  they had been "cheated" out of their job security and pensions  by State President F W de Klerk.    Pretoria City Council CP leader Paul Fouche called on  supporters to a gathering at the downtown municipal offices on  January 25 to protest against the new joint non-racial local  government dispensation. Pamphlets would be distributed in  Pretoria to call supporters to "drastic but non-violent" action  to protest the 50/50 dispensation, he said.</p>

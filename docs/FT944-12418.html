			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Scotland exports reach Pounds 11.5bn Manufactured exports from Scotland rose 19 per cent at current prices in the 1993-94 financial year to reach Pounds 11.5bn, accounting for 10.3 per cent of the UK's manufactured exports. Exports by Scotland's big electronics sector grew 41.5 per cent while whisky exports rose 7 per cent. Growth in sales to North America, the European Free Trade Association and the Far East far outstripped exports to the European Union, although Scotland's single biggest export market was France. The statistics show that Scottish exports have grown faster in the past two years than in the previous six. The figures are based on a survey carried out by the Scottish Council Development and Industry.</p>

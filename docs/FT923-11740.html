			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Union Pacific surges 35% in second quarter UNION PACIFIC, the US transportation company, yesterday reported a 35 per cent rise in second-quarter profits, at Dollars 206m after tax. The advance lifted net profits for the first months to Dollars 351m, compared with Dollars 286m in the same period of 1991. At the operating level, Union Pacific's second-quarter figures improved more modestly - profits were up 15 per cent at Dollars 376m - but the company said there had been 'strong gains' in all its businesses. The railroad division pushed up earnings by almost 9 per cent at Dollars 158m and, despite a two-day shutdown in June, car loadings rose by 2 per cent. The strongest growth, said the company, came from cars, metals and minerals and grain. Union Pacific shares rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 on the news.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The government has  decided to cooperate closely with the United States and Japan so  that a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for sanctions  against North Korea can be adopted next week or thereafter.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will discuss the sanctions  issue during meetings with U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter  Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. Tarnoff  and Kakizawa will come to Seoul on Friday and Saturday,  respectively.    The government's decision was made Friday morning at a  meeting to coordinate national unification and security policy  held at the South-North dialogue secretariat in Samchong-dong.  The meeting was presided over by Vice Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku, who is national unification minister.    After the meeting, Yi said through his spokesman Kim  Hyong-ki  that the government hoped to persuade the U.N. Security Council  to adopt a resolution on sanctions against Pyongyang as soon as  possible through consultations with related countries, including  the United States.    The spokesman said sanctions should be adopted soon as the  cooling period for spent fuel rods taken recently from North  Korea's 5-megawatt reactor is only three months, disclosing that  "the government position is to have the council adopt sanctions  next week at the earliest."    Yi emphasized the sanctions' ultimate goal is securing the  transparency of North Korea's nuclear program, adding the  government plans to leave the dialogue channel open at every  stage in the course of imposing sanctions against Pyongyang.    He said that "dialogue with North Korea is only possible  when  it is prepared to show sincerity so the international suspicion  over its nuclear adventure is eliminated completely,"  reaffirming that sanctions are inevitable unless Pyongyang  changes its attitude.    As to the "sincere measures" by North Korea, the spokesman  cited as an example the North's acceptance of special  inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites and the opening of  records on its nuclear reactor.</p>

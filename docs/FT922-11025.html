			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Investments prove something of a mystery to puzzled Czechoslovaks: A mass privatisation scheme MR JOSEF MACHACEK scratches his head, picks up his pen, ponders for a while, puts it down and sighs. 'It's like falling into a black hole,' says the 51-year-old repairman from his small iron chair in Prague's crowded central post office. 'You have no information, and you just don't know what to do.' Holding a small yellow booklet of vouchers, which he bought recently, as did 8m other Czechoslovaks to participate in the mass privatisation scheme launched by the government this year, he peers anxiously around the room. On both sides of him, people are forming long queues to register their booklets with one of the 500 private investment funds which have mushroomed in the country to benefit from privatisation. Sunday was the last day for citizens to decide whether they would invest their vouchers directly in companies or subscribe to an investment fund. Under the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, more than 2,000 enterprises will distribute the bulk of their equity this spring to those people who paid a small fee to buy their voucher books. However, with little information available on individual companies, and only three more weeks available to bid for them singly, Czechs and Slovaks hurried to post offices last week to register with one of the investment funds which offer to help investors choose. Officials predict that at least half of the investors will subscribe to a fund rather than try to invest their vouchers directly. Then again, the choice of a fund often remains arbitrary. At the central post office in Prague, most admit to last-minute decisions. 'I found this advertising leaflet in my mail this morning,' says Ms Jindra Justova, a 50-year-old mathematical analyst. 'It's a lottery anyway. Even if you were given information on enterprises and chose to invest your vouchers yourself, do you really think you could trust this information?' she asks before joining the queue. For weeks now, the government has promised to give future investors the financial details of enterprises so as to facilitate choice. Some information has been published in the press in recent months, showing companies' income figures and privatisation plans - but these are only a fraction of the 2,000 enterprises involved in the voucher scheme. A complete list of them, recently published by the privatisation ministry in the Czech republic, is nowhere to be found. 'It's sold out - sold out in one day,' explains the post office clerk. Even at the ministry, the list cannot be obtained. When Mr Jaroslav Lizner, an official at the federal finance ministry finally found a copy for the Financial Times, all it showed was a list of enterprise names and their asset values. 'Its like a sport,' reckons Mr Jiri Sladek, an army technician. 'I just decided to put all my vouchers into a fund set up by a major bank. That should be safe.' Behind him, Mr Jiri Davidek, a 55-year-old actor, adds with an amused look in his eyes: 'I put them in a fund called the Fund for Retired People. At least that's one thing I am sure of - I'll retire soon.' Investment funds set up by main banks are attracting the most voucher holders, but the wide array of funds offers plenty of choice for anyone who likes a gamble. The Srejber Tennis Investment Fund, set up by an old Davis Cup player, shows in its advertising brochure a picture of Srejber himself next to Ronald and Nancy Reagan. On the radio, the Bonton Investment Fund blares advertising songs. Set up by Michael Kocab, a former rock star turned MP after the anti-communist revolution and founder of the Prague Millionaires' Club, the Bonton appeals to young people. 'Michael Kocab made a fortune in the last two years, so he should be able to make me rich in the next two,' says Frantisek Houska, a 23-year-old student in jeans and leather who received his voucher book as a Christmas present from his parents. Winking, he opens it at the page where, next to a series of numbers, he has pencilled the code name of the Bonton. One letter in each box spells TREND.</p>

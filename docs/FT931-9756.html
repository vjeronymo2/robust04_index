			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ford follows GM with introduction of credit cards FORD Motor, in partnership with Citibank, yesterday followed rival General Motors and launched consumer credit cards offering customers substantial discounts on the purchase of Ford vehicles. The move will intensify competition in the US credit-card market, where traditional bank issuers are being challenged by new entrants such as GM and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, offering rebates on goods and services. Ford's introduction of Visa and MasterCards comes six months after the launch of the GM MasterCard - the most successful US credit-card introduction ever, attracting more than 4.5m cardholders. Ford said yesterday it aimed to top GM, but gave no forecasts. For Ford, and GM before it, the cards are an attempt to build brand loyalty through a new form of customer rebate. GM's share of the US car market dipped from 35.9 per cent in 1991 to 34.9 per cent last year, while Ford's rose 1.7 per cent to 21.8 per cent. For Citibank, the leading issuer of credit cards in the US, the Ford tie-up could mean a sizeable increase in its card-holder base at a time when its account growth has been slowing. 'This is an effort to grow the business,' said Mr James Bailey, who heads north American consumer banking. The bank already has similar partnerships with other major US corporations, notably one with American Airlines which allows cardholders to earn points towards free travel. Ford's card allows customers to earn rebates, equal to 5 per cent of their purchases, of up to Dollars 700 a year for five years, and then get a rebate of Dollars 3,500 on the purchase of a vehicle. Ford claimed its card was superior to GM's in that it offered a Dollars 3,500 rebate over five years, rather than seven; a lower rate of interest on outstanding balances; and the advantages of a link-up with Citibank, which offers card-holders fringe benefits. GM's card is administered by Household Credit Services, the ninth largest US card issuer. Ford's card charges a Dollars 20 annual fee, while GM's has none. However, the fee will be waived for the first year and payment thereafter will qualify holders for an annual, additional Dollars 50 rebate when they buy a Ford vehicle.</p>

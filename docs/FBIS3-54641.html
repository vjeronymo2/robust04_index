He  denounced the separatist ambitions of the leaders in Tiraspol  and reaffirmed his determination to ensure the territorial  integrity of the state. We will not tolerate blackmail,  pressure, and interference from outside, President Snegur also  said.    Recalling the dependence on suppliers of material resources,  especially energy resources, and the acute problem of markets  for the sale of products, Mircea Snegur affirmed that these  factors have raised, first and foremost, the need for adherence  to the CIS economic union. He added, however: Our position is  a single one, namely that Moldova will participate solely in the  activity of the economic structures of the CIS. I have also  reaffirmed this position at the recent meeting in Ashgabat.    President Snegur also talked about the elimination of the  consequences of totalitarianism, the democratization of the  entire public activity, the promotion of political and economic  reforms, and about the transition to a market economy.</p>

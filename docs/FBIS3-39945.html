			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Greek Public Order Minister Stilianos </F> Papathemelis by Maria Gilda Lyghounis; place and date not given:  "Embittered Macedonia"--first two paragraphs are L'EUROPEO  introduction]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] One of the Greek politicians  most inflexible on the Macedonian question is Stilianos  Papathemelis, public order minister in Andreas Papandreou's new  Socialist government. It is no coincidence that he was born in  Salonika, the capital of Greek Macedonia, and was minister for  Northern Greece in the eighties. EUROPEO asked him his opinion  of Italy's recent initiative for the recognition of Macedonia.    "It is a serious mistake. A move that cannot be considered  an expression of the solidarity that should exist between two  member states of the European Union. And I do not think that it  favors your country's real interests."    [Lyghounis] Are you referring to another boycott of our  spaghetti, as happened before, three years ago?    [Papathemelis] The Greek Government does not encourage such  initiatives. But we cannot prevent the people's reactions from  influencing trends in consumption.    [Lyghounis] What is your grievance with Italy?    [Papathemelis] Its failure to understand that the key to  everything lies in the name, "Macedonia." The population of  Skopje are Slavic and have every right to give themselves a name  that relates to their own history. But they cannot appropriate  a name that has belonged to the Greek region of Salonika for  thousands of years. Especially since the place name, Macedonia,  was adopted by Stalin and Tito for the Skopje region with the  clear intention of destabilizing Greece! As a politician, I  think that vital interests of the Greek people are in jeopardy.    [Lyghounis] And as a Macedonian?    [Papathemelis] I feel insulted. This, because Skopje's  official ideology is irredentist: They are supposedly the "free  Macedonians" who have territory and enslaved brothers in Greece.  That must be liberated as soon as possible. How can we accept  this? And how can Italy recognize a government that has such an  ideology?</p>

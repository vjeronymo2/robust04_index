			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by interview with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat by </F> Gerhard Konzelmann in Stuttgart, in English with superimposed  German translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Konzelmann] During his visit to Stuttgart, Yasir  'Arafat answered questions about the future development of the  peace process in the Middle East. I asked him whether the  irritation and the delaying tactics have now come to an end.  Are the doors of Jericho now open for 'Arafat?    ['Arafat] During the next 48 hours, all problems will be  settled. The Jericho-Gaza agreement will be signed on Wednesday  [4 May]. This date has been set by President Mubarak.    [Konzelmann] My next question referred to Syria, which is  still causing problems. 'Arafat stressed that the Syrians must  realize that he does not want to conclude a separate peace  agreement with Israel. He is thinking of a comprehensive peace  for Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, and Lebanese. Asked  about the attitude of Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad, 'Arafat  stated:    ['Arafat] His excellency had a very good conversation with  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher.    [Konzelmann] 'Arafat sees the more distant future in the  following way:    ['Arafat] The Israelis will withdraw their troops from the  entire West Bank, from Jericho, Gaza, Nablus.    [Konzelmann] When I asked him whether Nablus will also be  under his control, he replied: Yes, after four months. Then he  will meet with me in Jerusalem.    Numerous Palestinians were very disappointed in the past few  weeks.    ['Arafat] They were right. Nothing had happened.    [Konzelmann] Asked what he is doing with the radical Muslims  of Hamas, 'Arafat stressed that he is optimistic. Many have  declared that they will participate in the peace process and in  free elections in Palestine.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Hachette shares suspended THE shares of Hachette, the French publishing empire, and Matra, the electronics and defence group, were yesterday suspended on the French stock market pending the announcement next Tuesday of their proposed merger. Hachette also announced yesterday a higher than expected loss of FFr1.93bn (Pounds 195.2m) for 1991, compared with net profits of FFr492m in 1990. Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine, is trying to recapitalise after making heavy losses on its ill-fated investment in La Cinq, the bankrupt French television station. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, who controls Hachette and Matra through MMB, his family holding company, stunned the Paris stock market in January by announcing that he planned to merge the two groups. The news was received with scepticism by French analysts as Hachette and Matra are in very different areas of activity and both businesses are performing poorly. The shares of Matra, Hachette and Publications Filipacchi, another company associated with MMB, will remain suspended until the merger terms are disclosed on Tuesday morning. Mr Jean-Jacques Limage, an analyst at James Capel in Paris, said it was 'crazy to talk about the merger until Hachette's refinancing is over'. The merger would probably require the consent of Matra's shareholders, as MMB does not have a majority interest. There has been speculation that Mr Lagardere might agree to cede some of Matra's peripheral businesses to its industrial investors to finance the deal. Matra announced on Wednesday that it was cutting its dividend after a sharp fall in profits from FFr606m to FFr252m last year. Hachette's position is more precarious. It lost FFr1.79bn on La Cinq in 1991, bringing the total losses on its 18-month-long investment to FFr3.5bn. This brought Hachette into a net loss, after operating profits fell from FFr779m to FFr636m in 1991 on static sales of FFr30.41bn. The company is still in talks with its banks over its financing which could involve a recapitalisation of FFr2.8bn. The refinancing may force MMB to reduce its 52 per cent holding, thus leading Mr Lagardere to lose control of Hachette.</p>

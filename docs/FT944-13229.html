			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Leading the WTO Regionalism and protectionism are the greatest threats to the multilateral trading system. Inevitably, they are also creating the chief dangers to ratification of the Uruguay Round outcome, and to selection of a suitable first head of the World Trade Organisation. Ratification has not proved as easy as was hoped when the round was finished in Marrakesh last April. So far only 30 nations have ratified. The decision to set December 8 as the date for the formal implementation conference rests on the assumption that the US, the European Union and Japan at least will have done so by then. In the US, however, the lame-duck Congress will have to return for a special session after November's midterm elections. But Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has already called for delay, while protectionists of left and right are on the attack. Meanwhile, EU ratification has been delayed by a dispute over the powers of the European Commission to speak for member states, to be resolved by the European Court of Justice on November 15. The US administration believes that a possibly bitter international dispute over who should lead the WTO could threaten ratification. If so, ratification must come first, since failure could mark an end to commercial diplomacy at a global level. That said, selection of the head of the WTO should ideally happen this year, if the organisation is to get off to a good start next January. Unfortunately, however, an inter-regional combat has now emerged between President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and South Korea's trade minister, Mr Kim Chul-su. This is a destructive way to proceed, as has been demonstrated by the stalemate over who should be the next secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. One problem with so public a combat is that, in the absence of an accepted electoral procedure, any one region will find it humiliating to abandon its own candidate for the candidate of another. Consequently, compromise will become difficult, if not impossible. More important, however, is the fact that the regional origin of the new head is quite unimportant. Or do the combatants fear that Mr Ruggiero would be more sympathetic to the European Union, Mr Salinas more friendly towards the US, or Mr Kim more supportive of Japan? If that were indeed so, a quasi-judicial body like the WTO would be dead. What is required is a person dedicated to global liberal trade, who also possesses high intellectual attainments and diplomatic skills. After ratification, the major players should get together quietly to decide who would make the best job of the WTO (and they need not restrict themselves to one of the three candidates). They have the best possible reason for doing so as objectively as possible. The WTO is their baby. They should want it to succeed.</p>

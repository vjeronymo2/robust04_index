			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / As they say in Europe: Republics of gloom and malice JOURNALISM in the former communist countries generally disappoints those who expected a sudden irruption of fresh, innocent talent. Only the Russians, whatever side they are on, have a gift for the vivid phrase, the articulation of deeply-held prejudices, and pure malice. They also have the ability to impart it in measured terms. Many could easily find jobs on British tabloids where these gifts are prized. Last Sunday in Moscow a number of old-time communists and unsavoury nationalists were badly beaten up by the militia, the OMON. Unreconstructed elements in the media had a fine time. The army daily, Krasnaya Zvezda, wrote: 'On February 23 the fatherland traditionally hails the military achievements of its defenders. The Moscow government marked the day in the spirit of the new times - with the fists and batons of OMON troops who cracked down on old warriors, Afghan veterans, servicemen who 'dared' place wreaths on the tomb of the unknown soldier.' Sovietskaya Rossiya said political leaders were able to place wreaths on the tomb but ordinary Muscovites could not. 'Approaching the tomb . . . they were met with democratic truncheons.' An on-the-spot report continued, 'From a distance of 200 metres it is hard to hear what people are shouting. A rubber truncheon goes up - an OMON trooper strikes an elderly invalid who tries to defend himself with a crutch. The steady hum of the crowd turns into an uproar. The chains of OMON and police provoke the masses trying to get to the Lenin Mausoleum and the tomb of the unknown soldier. Blood is shed and dozens of people hospitalised.' Nezavismaya Gazeta is the standard bearer of the liberals, the reformers, the good guys. So what did it make of this act of repression in the name of democracy? It was relaxed to the point of insouciance: 'The authorities are probably resorting to truncheons, not because they are afraid, but to convince society that there is a red-brown (communist-fascist) threat. Following the disintegration of the Communist party, the post of 'internal enemy' has become vacant.' Pravda disagreed. 'What does the use of truncheons and tear gas against demonstrators on a public holiday mean?' it asked. The answer was that the government was afraid of the people 'who had actively rejected the reforms.' The one-time communist party daily sneakily quoted the chairman of the stock exchange: 'Do not hinder the government,' the President of Russian Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange, Konstantin Borovoi, was quoted as saying. 'This is the first government in seven and a half decades which has the courage to do something. It faces the task of not only destroying the command economy system but first and foremost creating a new economy, new relations between people.' It balanced that by also quoting the socialist Boris Kagarlitsky: 'Stop before it is too late. We are threatened with a complete destruction of the country's modern industrial potential, the country becoming a backward and poor backwater of the western world, and the loss of national independence.' So there is a cross-section of media, and public, opinion in a country with no democratic traditions, where the state has disintegrated and where daily life verges on the catastrophic. The French press seems to believe its readers are similarly placed but lacks the clarity and coherence of the Russian. And it is even more biased. Poor economic figures published last week led the Quotidien de Paris to remark: 'All the policies adopted for 15 years to strengthen the competitiveness of the French economy have ended in negative growth . . .' That was on the basis of a bad final quarter of 1991. It was a relief to read Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Le Figaro: 'Certainly, in spite of the debt and the deficits, France's economic situation is not the most desperate, far from it, on the European continent.' The press gave itself plenty to feed on: from the poor performance of French skiers at the Winter Olympics to the impending collapse of the Fifth Republic. In the by-election in Nice last weekend the Socialist party had already been eliminated and the National Front nearly won against the orthodox right. France-Soir wrote, 'The Fifth Republic was bi-polar for a third of a century, now it is no longer. The strategy of government founded on the clash of bloc against bloc has no sense now that one citizen in two does not vote and one in three can't see himself in the the parties which bring together the right and the left.' It should be possible to explain how in Russia the papers maintain a certain sang froid in the face of disaster while in boring old France they seem quite barmy.

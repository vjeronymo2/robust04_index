			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Government leaders and  politicians reacted with anger and dismay Saturday to the report  that Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and  National Security Affairs Kim Chong-hwi has applied for  permanent U.S. residentship.    Sharp criticism and disgust had been levelled against him  when he fled the country for the United States as President Kim  Yong-sam's anti-corruption campaign reached the once untouchable  military buildup projects known as the Yulgok program.    Kim has come under suspicion of receiving bribes by  allegedly  peddling influence as a trusted aide to President No Tae-u.    Officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] received the  news with stunned disbelief as the reports said Kim might be  seeking a political asylum in the United States.    "How could he, once a prominent public servant, sell himself  out to a foreign country just because he is being pursued by the  law of his country as a criminal?" asked one Chongwadae  official said, requesting anonymity. [sentence as received]    Political asylum is usually asked by those whose life is  threatened by dictators or by other colonial overlords. It is  not something given by a foreign country to a criminal on the  run, he said.    It was being reported Saturday that the Seoul government is  considering using diplomatic channels to the United States to  ask the U.S. Government to reject Kim's application for  permanent residentship.    "Kim Chong-hwi had pretended that he was a clean official,"  said another Chongwadae official. "He never even bought a cup of  coffee for other officials.    "If he is that clean, why doesn't he come home and answer  the  charges?"    Aides to former President No were also expressing their  disgust, calling Kim a "disgrace to the Sixth Republic."    Since he once commanded the nation's foreign and security  policy from a prestigous and exulted position, he should have  come home when his mother died and buried her and answered  questions by the prosecution, rather than abusing his former  position and seeking political asylum in another country, they  said.    Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party [DLP], told reporters: "It is big trouble.    "All politicians are responsible for their country. How  could the man act like that? I simply couldn't understand his  mentality."    "I cannot help doubting about the stability of his mind,"  said Rep. So Chong-hwa. "If he is really seeking political  asylum, it's a mind-boggling thing to do."    There have been a lot of "problems" with the previous  administration but this case aptly and glaringly illustrates the  real character of the No government, another DLP lawmaker said.    The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, is  trying to make a political issue out of the affair.    The DP defined it as a product of the current  administration's "unfair and unbalanced" prosecution of corrupt  officials.    In an official commentary, DP Deputy Spokesman Kwon Il-sun  said that there had been suggestions the current administration  could have helped Kim escape to the United States even though he  had been the main player in irregularities in connection with  the selection of the mainstay fighter aircraft.    Noting that the U.S. Government should not grant political  asylum to Kim Chong-hwi, he said, "the Seoul government should  recall Kim at any cost following talks with the U.S. Government  through diplomatic channels."</p>

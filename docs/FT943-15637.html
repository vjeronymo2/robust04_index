			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Hurd tames plans for civil service Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has warned ministerial colleagues that reform of the civil service must be accompanied by respect for its core values. As officials yesterday disclosed that he had prevented radical moves to privatise services in the forthcoming Cabinet Office white paper, Mr Hurd said ministers should accept the valuable service they receive from civil servants. He told the FDA top civil servants union this week: 'The Conservative government should not regard the civil service either as some hidden enemy, or as a body of partisan supporters.' He said loyalty could only work in both directions. Just as the civil service would have to accept reform of its working practices, so ministers would have to accept that the civil service remained an essential element of Britain's constitution. Ms Elizabeth Symons, the FDA general secretary, yesterday said: 'Senior civil servants were so relieved to hear a minister praising the civil service instead of attacking it.' The white paper is expected to propose an end to centralised pay bargaining in Whitehall but to reject some of the more radical moves to privatise services supported by Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister. Mr Hurd made it clear that he wanted to reaffirm the civil service's values of integrity, impartiality and selection and promotion on merit.</p>

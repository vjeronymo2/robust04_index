			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Bidders join Channel 5 licence queue The Independent Television Commission will formally advertise the licence for Channel 5 on Tuesday as interest appears to be growing in a service that has taken years to get off the ground. The ITC confirmed yesterday that it would have to advertise two separate propositions for the channel - one which would reach just over half the UK population, and the other nearly three-quarters. The reason for the uncertainty is that the ITC is still applying for international permission to use extra frequencies for Channel 5. The new permissions are necessary because the government set aside frequencies previously allotted for the new channel for the possible future development of digital terrestrial television. But in spite of the uncertainty there is considerable interest. Mr Izzy Asper, chairman and chief executive of CanWest Global Communications, the Canadian broadcaster with television interests in New Zealand, Australia and Chile, said he would bid for the channel 'as long as there are no nasty surprises' in next week's ITC announcement. Mr Asper, who has been negotiating with a number of big UK media and leisure companies, would plan to broadcast a high proportion of British-made programmes if he won the Channel 5 franchise. CanWest usually works closely with independent producers - allowing them to retain international distribution rights to their programmes. White Rose, the consortium that tried to unseat Yorkshire Television in the last ITV franchise round, is also interested in bidding. Mr William Lewisham, a director of White Rose, a consortium which includes RTE, the Irish national broadcaster, and City financial interests, said yesterday that the prospects were interesting as long as the channel could reach more than 60 per cent of the population. Mr Ward Thomas, the chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, has found considerable interest in the channel from potential US partners. The other big groups expressing interest range from Channel 5 Broadcasting, which brings together Time Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, a grouping led by NBC, the US network, and Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group. But the number of bids will probably depend on the fine print of the ITC document and how optimistic Sir George Russell, the ITC chairman, is about getting permission to use new frequencies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- Former Soviet President  Mikhail Gorbachev compared his "perestroyka" which was aimed to  reform the Soviet totalitarian system to the liberalisation of  his predecessor Nikita Khrushchev, often called as the "thaw",  which exposed and condemned the personality cult of Joseph  Stalin and introduced limited freedom in the country. Gorbachev  also admitted that he knew he could be ousted like Khrushchev.  Khrushchev was toppled in 1964 after his reformist plans caused  a major opposition from hard-line communist party nomenklatura.    "We remembered the experience of Khrushchev, but we  underestimated the reactionary forces of the past", Gorbachev  said addressing a conference devoted to the 100th birth  anniversary of Khrushchev which opened in the Gorbachev  Foundation on Monday. He added that yet in 1987, two years  after perestroyka began, "the people who started the  transformations realised that the fate of Khrushchev was in  store for them". Gorbachev had to step down after his communist  elite staged a coup against him in August 1991 which resulted in  the collapse of the Soviet Union.    The former Soviet leader stressed that Khrushchev had a  great  influence on all the Soviet reformers. He compared his  perestroyka to Khrushchev's "thaw" and said that the latter  failed because the new policy was implemented by old methods.  "Problems of immense historic importance cannot be solved by  Bolshevik methods", Gorbachev said.</p>

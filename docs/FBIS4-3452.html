			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's central bank will retain strict control  over credit this year as it battles to slow inflation, running  at more than 20 per cent, says a senior bank official.  Inflation was showing no sign of improvement and urgent action  was needed to combat soaring prices, the People's Bank of China  Vice Governor Dai Xianglong said at a national financial  conference in Shanghai. Investment in fixed assets, seen as a  primary cause of China's continuing high inflation rate, was  still too large, Mr Dai said. He said the bank would tighten its  control over credit in this area.    However, the vice-governor emphasised that the bank would  continue to provide loss-making, state-run enterprises with  operating funds to ensure they would survive the credit crunch.  "As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing  financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational  funds on a case-by-case basis," Mr Dai was quoted by Xinhua (the  New China News Agency) as saying.    Figures released by the State Statistical Bureau this week  showed that 49.6 per cent of all state-run enterprises are  losing money, with losses in the first quarter totalling 15.7  billion yuan (about HK$13.89 billion). Factors contributing to  the struggles of the state-owned enterprises include tightened  investment and reduced supply of materials, Mr Dai said.  Another factor was that state-owned enterprises which have been  transformed into stock-holding or joint venture companies ceased  to have their production included in state-sector statistics.  "We must remain cool-headed," he was quoted as saying, adding  that the bank would continue to focus on currency stabilisation  to ensure an appropriate rate of economic growth.    Western financial analysts said the People's Bank would face  a difficult balancing act if it was to restrict credit but still  provide enough money to bail out state enterprises. "I think  they have adopted the right approach in clamping down on loans  to fixed-asset investment projects but still an awful lot of new  credit will be needed to keep these loss-making enterprises  afloat," said the manager of a Western bank in Shanghai. "There  is also the risk that loans made for operational funds will get  diverted into risky investment projects," the banker said. "The  central bank unfortunately still has very little control of  where loans eventually end up," he said.    Analysts pointed out that even though the economic  austerity,  or rectification programme, had been in place for nearly a year,  economic growth was still in double figures and inflation had  continued to rise, almost on a monthly basis. Inflation in some  key cities is already at more than 30 per cent and the  government is clearly concerned that if prices continue to rise  it could be faced with a renewed bout of social unrest.    Control of prices has been made the top priority and  municipal officials have been ordered to regularly check the  prices of food, services and other daily necessities to ensure  inflation does not get any worse. However, analysts consider  the actions so far by the government could be too little, too  late.</p>

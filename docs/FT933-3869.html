			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Complex 16-month talks clock up over Pounds 14m fees THE 16 MONTHS of negotiations culminating in yesterday's restructuring proposals for Canary Wharf were among the most arduous and complex in any insolvency to date. Officials from central government, local authorities, the London Docklands Development Corporation, London Regional Transport, the Docklands Light Railway and existing tenants were involved in discussions co-ordinated by Mr Nigel Hamilton, Mr Stephen Adamson and Mr Alan Bloom, the administrators from accountants Ernst &amp; Young. Mr Peter Totty, a partner at Allen &amp; Overy who drafted the voluntary arrangement document circulated yesterday, said: 'The only case we've ever had is that something is better than nothing.' He said several important decisions were resolved only in the last few days, including agreements by tenants not to sue and the agreement of Canadian administrators. 'It's been quite a cliffhanger,' he said. The collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the parent company, required negotiations to reconcile English insolvency law with the equivalents in Canada and the US, where the group had property develop-ments. Lawyers and accountants have clocked up thousands of hours during the process and are likely to receive more than Pounds 14m by the end of the process - regardless of the eventual outcome. 'It has been a succession of meetings going on almost since day one,' said Mr Hamilton. 'The biggest difficulty was recognising the aspirations of each sub-group. We spent many long hours persuading, cajoling. We sat till 4am on more occasions than I care to think about.' Many of the most important negotiations took place between the dozen banks supporting Canary Wharf in New York, Toronto, London and Luxembourg. They came from different countries, with varying regulatory structures, tax demands and requirements for provisions on losses. Their loan exposures varied widely and each had bilateral loans with Olympia &amp; York, rather than a single syndicated loan which would have made co-ordination more simple. Mr Iain Cheyne of Lloyds Bank co-ordinated the bankers. He likened discussions to pushing a jelly, and said he had held more than 40 meetings with London Transport alone. The bankers did not have things all their own way. The government refused to allow them repayment of all the money they put up under the so-called 'drop-dead agreement' if the Jubilee line was not completed on time. He said there had been no victory parties by those involved so far, but added that if the agreement is approved after the end of next month: 'There will no doubt be the odd celebration or two.'</p>

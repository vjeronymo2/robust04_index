			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Life details level of its non-performing loans Sumitomo Life Insurance Corporation, Japan's third largest life insurer, has indicated that about half of the Y1,400bn (Dollars 13.2bn) it has advanced in loans may be non-performing. The news comes as company sources say that its chairman will resign, the latest victim of the country's economic downturn. The sources said that Mr Yasuhiko Uewama would step down, probably today, in acknowledgment of his own responsibility for the company's performance in the last few years. Sumitomo, which has total assets of Y20,000bn, has a huge exposure to bad debts incurred by its six affiliated non-bank financial institutions. In the late 1980s, spurred by soaring asset prices in Japan's booming financial markets, Sumitomo Life, under the personal direction of Mr Uewama, advanced Y1,400bn in loans to the affiliates, mainly mortgage and lending companies. The company has indicated that around half of the total loans advanced are now non-performing, a staggeringly high total even by the standards of Japan's recent financial excesses. All of Japan's leading life insurers, which are due to report their annual results today, have been severely hit in recent years by falling asset values, such as equities. Several have seen their profits decline by more than 20 per cent between 1991 and 1993; in Sumitomo's case the figure is 30 per cent. In the next three years, Sumitomo plans to write off at least Y400bn of the problem loans, a charge that will further hit earnings. Mr Uewama's resignation is expected to be approved at a directors' meeting on July 5, when the current vice-chairman, Mr Tadaoki Haraguchi, will assume the chairmanship. The new boss will immediately feel the cost of the company's difficulties. Sumitomo Life has decided to cut the remuneration of its directors, eliminating bonuses and reducing salaries by as much as 10 per cent.</p>

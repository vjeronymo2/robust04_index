			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: Angst in America - Theatre At first sight, Marvin's Room offers little to laugh at. It is a drama about leukaemia written by Scott McPherson, who died of Aids at 33 last year. But this fine American play, now at the Hampstead Theatre, can be extremely funny. It also enhances the Theatre's growing expertise in north American drama. It tells the story of Bessie, a middle-aged Floridian pushed to the side of her own life by her father's stroke and her aunt's general malaise. Then Bessie discovers she has leukaemia; her estranged sister Lee is summoned from Ohio, with her sons Hank (an institutionalised psychotic) and Charlie (an intractable nerd), in hopes of a bone marrow transplant. At this point, the play is poised to become a 1990s chromosome comedy. But the play's outcome is dislocated and truncated, a botched autopsy. In the end, none of Bessie's family can donate bone marrow; Marvin, Bessie's father, continues to twitch in the room at the back of the stage; and the greatest wisdom the play can offer, in its final lines, is 'There's nothing to be afraid of.' The early Florida medical scenes are, however, a treat: 'I am going to give you a local anaesthetic, and I am going to remove some bone marrow from your hip . . . There may be a crunching sound, but it sounds worse than it is, OK?' oozes Dr Wally. Bessie has a seizure during the family trip to Disney World. She comes round in the Lost Children Hut on a 'baby bear' bed, where she finds a moment of rare sororal intimacy, and also connects with Hank for the first time. David Petrarca's direction, wonderfully punctuated by Rob Milburn's pastiche musical arrangements (played by Cafe Noire), addresses the fact that McPherson's scenes never complete themselves. They border on the truth, never reaching it. Intimacies are shared through things, a soda, a photograph, or Lee offering to style her sister's wig. Alison Steadman plays Bessie superbly as a model of misapplied devotion opposite the excellent Phyllis Logan as her hard-as-nails sister Lee. They have a fine, contrasting rapport, with Steadman slightly frumpy and Logan slightly tarty but never resorting to stereotypes. Carmel McSharry as the aunt dosing up on multivitamins and daytime soaps manages to assemble a character out of the traits written for her. Ian Gelder as Dr Wally is developing his accomplished playing of Americans, and is a joy to watch. The play has an unsettling effect, somewhere losing control of itself and heading into chaos. Its message is a muted version of the 1980s clarion call 'You are where you are because you want to be there.' As Bessie learns the hopelessness of her own illness, she backs into her father's room to die with him. Neither has much choice. Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage, NW3 (071 722 9301).</p>

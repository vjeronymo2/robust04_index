			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nicaraguan Environmental Movement Executive </F> Director Pedro Gamboa]    [Text] The increasing environmental deterioration of  Nicaragua's natural resources and the severe water and soil  pollution caused by the irrational use of pesticides and  indiscriminate discharge of toxic chemical and industrial wastes  make it essential to control and regulate the nation's economic  activities.    Various publications and reports--even government  reports--presented by reputable persons with well-known  environmental credentials have provided us with information that  is truly alarming regarding the nation's future development.    One example is the deforestation rate--150,000 hectares a  year--in areas used for agriculture. Deforestation is creating a  crisis, and in 15 years we will have no woods, as Nicaragua's  present forested area is approximately 3.5 million hectares.    Water is another critical case. Here the crisis has two  aspects:    a) The small quantity of resources left.    b) The quality of the resources we are using.  <H5>  Institutional Regulation </H5>   In the first case, we have learned recently that over 40  rivers in the central Pacific region have dried up. Secondly, a  large part of our rivers, lakes, and ponds are badly polluted.  In Managua, we are now dependent for water for human consumption  on Asososca Lake and underground wells.    This situation demands the improvement of institutional  management, the rationalization of our use of natural resources,  and the people's organized and conscious involvement in  protecting our natural resources and preserving the quality of  the environment.    These factors are the qualitative aspects which the MAN  [Nicaraguan Environmental Movement] is proposing for Nicaraguan  society in the General Environmental Bill.    This bill's most important features are:    1. Assigning environmental management duties and functions  to  each government agency in a coherent and orderly manner.    2. Allowing the people to exercise control of the natural  resources of their area, through the use of administrative,  civil, or criminal actions against those who violate the law.    3. Requiring an environmental impact study before any  economic project is undertaken.  <H5>  Toxic Wastes Prohibited </H5>   4. Giving producers, through fiscal, tax, and credit  policies, incentives for investments or other efforts that will  lead to the restoration and preservation of their area or  territory.    5. Requiring students to perform 100 hours of environmental  work in their area, as a graduation requirement.    6. Barring imports of toxic wastes and chemical products  prohibited in their country of origin; the discharge or storage  of trash in parks or public areas; spraying pesticides in urban  areas and rural villages; and the execution of projects that  disturb or alter the natural balance of an ecosystem.    7. Forming support groups for government agencies and  municipalities (watershed committees and environmental  protection boards).%8. Improving the transfer of financial  resources so that municipalities are able to handle duties of  importance for the territorial and local administration and  management of natural resources.    In summary, this bill is designed to create an instrument  that, while far from being a panacea solving our many  environmental problems, will provide a general framework for the  operation of the state and civil society, and will implement a  national strategy for sustainable development with justice and  social equity.</p>

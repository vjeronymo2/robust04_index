			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: Daiichi creditors forego payments LEADING creditors of Daiichi, the Japanese real estate company facing financial difficulties, have agreed to forego interest on loans to aid the restructuring of the group. Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking, Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Nippon Credit Bank, and Chuo Trust &amp; Banking will waive until March 1995 the 3 per cent interest on total debts of Y300bn (Dollars 2.8bn). The waiver is expected to ease Daiichi's debt burden by about Y9bn a year. The move will hit the banks, which face mounting bad loans. In March last year, the four banks lowered interest rates on loans to Daiichi, which has some Y550bn in total debt. Daiichi plans to ask other creditors to lower interest to 0.5 per cent.</p>

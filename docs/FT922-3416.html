			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / BCCI creditors 'not troublesome' CREDITORS who rejected the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 929m) deal negotiated by the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International with the Abu Dhabi government were not a 'troublesome and vocal minority spoiling for a fight', Mr David Hunt QC told the High Court yesterday. He was speaking on the third day of the hearing in which BCCI's UK liquidators, Touche Ross, are asking the court to sanction a deal which they say offers creditors the prospect of a 30 per cent to 40 per cent return of the money they lost. The hearing continues. Batace, a company controlled by Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman named by the US Federal Reserve as a front man for BCCI in the purchase of stakes in US banks, was compulsorily wound-up by the High Court yesterday.</p>

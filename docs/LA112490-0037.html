			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM ARIZONA VOTE  </P> <P> I am utterly confused by Cal's reaction to the current controversy in Arizona.  Cal, a campus widely known for its liberalism and advocacy of civil rights, has  let its athletic department totally reverse that reputation.  </P> <P> This once again stresses the point that some athletes live in their own little  world, sheltered from the real world. They can't believe when the outside world  questions their actions.  </P> <P> The comment by a Cal wide receiver, "Martin Luther King had a dream and I have  a dream: to play in a bowl game," portrays his team as being even worse than  first expected. Every NCAA player dreams about playing in a bowl game or in the  NCAA tournament, yet we must realize that sports is not everything. There are  much greater issues facing the country, and the actions of the Cal football  team just give athletes an even worse reputation.  </P> <P> Officials believe that an emblem on a helmet or a half time show dedicated to  King should be more than enough to calm the opposition. In fact, though, this  does the opposite by trivializing the whole subject.  </P> <P> Black players especially, but not exclusively, should particularly value what  Martin Luther King did for this country. Any act of disrespect towards him  should be met with severe criticism. Cal should follow the lead of other NCAA  teams who refused to play in Arizona and decline the bowl invitation.  </P> <P> MATT BRIGHAM, La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Scargill claims pits 'cover-up' MR ARTHUR SCARGILL, pres-ident of the National Union of Mineworkers, yesterday accused the government of a 'Matrix Churchill-type cover-up' of the facts surrounding the decision to close 31 mines. His accusation to the Commons employment committee came as the Trades Union Congress designated December 9 a National Day of Recovery - part of a series of events aimed at keeping pressure on the government over the closures. Mr Scargill said that British Coal was refusing to supply information to the NUM, to both committees of MPs investigating the closures, and to the High Court. British Coal's lawyers, he said, had told the NUM that disclosure of all the documents it requested would 'give rise to questions of public interest immunity'. Mr Scargill promised to supply the documents to the committee. He submitted a copy of a letter from Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, in which Mr Clarke admitted that it was 'exasperatingly difficult' to acquire clear and reliable information about the pit closures. The NUM leader claimed five of the 10 pits British Coal said were loss-making were in profit, and two others were set to move into profit. The TUC said that on December 9 workers were not being asked to take industrial action, but it wanted trade unionists to raise the issues of job security and employment creation with employers. The TUC's general council will meet in Doncaster next week - the first time it has met outside London - and members are expected to visit threatened pits. A further 40 rallies are being planned between now and the end of the year. The TUC move came as Nuclear Electric claimed that up to 17,000 jobs could be lost if the government decided to close the UK's Magnox nuclear reactors to make more room in the energy market for coal. Responding to suggestions by the electricity industry that the Magnox reactors had reached the end of their useful lives, the state-owned utility said a premature shutdown would cost the Treasury Pounds 2bn in lost revenues. The TUC hopes to keep up the pressure on the government to revise parts of the employment bill, which has just received its second reading. It has for the first time hired a political lobbying group, Connect Public Affairs, which has been arranging informal meetings between small groups of Conservative MPs and Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary. TUC officials say they have targeted parts of the employment bill which have also been criticised by employers, including the new rules on automatic check-off of union dues and the abolition of the so-called 'Bridlington rules' which have been used to regulate inter-union disputes.</p>

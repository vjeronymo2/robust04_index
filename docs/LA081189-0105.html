			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER'S WILD CARD;  </P> <P> NO MATTER HOW YOU COUNT, 'BATMAN'S' PAYOFF IS NO JOKE  </P> <P> Just how big is "Batman"?  </P> <P>  Dazzled by the first $200 million-plus film to hit the box office since  Universal's "Back to the Future" in 1985, numbers crunchers from Wall Street to  Hollywood are pounding their calculators over Warner Bros.' latest blockbuster.  </P> <P>  "They're the gorilla. . . . They're going to make a fortune," said one envious  competitor, after doing some quick math that shows Warner might sell $130  million worth of "Batman" videocassettes around the world.  </P> <P>  Calendar decided to join the guessing game. What follows is a dual calculation  of "Batman's" prospects, compiled with help from securities analysts, Hollywood  agents, studio executives, and others who have been monitoring the film.  </P> <P>  Caution: Neither Warner executives nor other key individuals involved with the  film were willing to share the real numbers. Our numbers are estimates -- and,  in some cases, plain old guesswork.  </P> <P>  Because this is the movie business, moreover, you have to count twice.  </P> <P>  To the right, the "Batman" numbers as they might shape up on a classic  Hollywood profit statement sent to actors, writers and others with a stake in  the movie. Next to those numbers is a calculation, from the Wall Street point  of view, of income the film may bring to Time Warner Inc.  </P> <P> THE HOLLYWOOD COUNT  </P> <P> RECEIPTS:  </P> <P> U.S. Theaters. Ticket sales topped $214 million in a sizzling six weeks, and  are sure to pass the $250-million mark, even if audiences drop sharply. When  grosses pile up that quickly, the studio gets an unusually large share of the  total under contracts with theater owners. Figure Warner will keep about 60%,  or: $150 million.  </P> <P> Foreign Theaters. Warner is known for strong foreign sales, but "Batman" is an  American myth, and it isn't easy to duplicate any blockbuster abroad. Also, the  studio keeps less from foreign theaters, where "Batman" is just now opening. If  international ticket sales hit $225 million, Warner may keep 50%, or: $112.5  million.  </P> <P> U.S. videocassettes. This depends on strategy. Warner could take a  low-price/high-volume option, flooding the market with "Batman" cassettes  priced at $24.95 this Christmas. After costs, each cassette might bring $13 or  more back to Warner. ("E.T.," which initially sold at that price last  Christmas, sold a phenomenal 15 million units.) At 8 million cassettes,  "Batman" would bring in $104 million, but only 20% of that, known as the  "producer's gross," gets paid to the movie under common studio accounting  procedures. Add: $20.8 million.  </P> <P>  Foreign cassettes. Warner is likely to take a high-price option abroad,  selling to rental stores and other outlets for about $50 a cassette. A big  foreign sale would be 550,000 cassettes, for $27.5 million, of which the  producer's gross, again figured at 20%, is: $5.5 million.  </P> <P> Pay TV. Time Warner Inc.'s own HBO cable service will buy "Batman" under a  package deal signed before Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. "Witches  of Eastwick," another Warner hit, got $13 million from its cable sale. "Batman"  should do better, but not by much, since the HBO deal probably sets a maximum  price for any movie, no matter how popular. Figure: $17 million.  </P> <P> World TV. This market is exploding, making it tough to know where things will  stand when Warner sells the movie in three years or so. "You're always hesitant  to estimate somebody else's movie. But I guess ('Batman') could bring $10  million to $12 million on the conservative side, all the way up to $25 million  if things open up," says Bill Shields, head of the American Film Marketing  Assn. Somewhat conservatively, let's call it: $15 million.  </P> <P> Free TV. Far in the future, "Batman" will probably show on a major TV network,  and then on your local independent TV station. Those sales could bring $14  million or so, but one film securities analyst recommended discounting the  figure downward to a present value of roughly: $10 million.  </P> <P> Sound-track royalty. Every time Warner sells a "Batman" record, the movie gets  a tiny cut, probably about 3% of retail. If the album sale reaches 8 million  (see the corporate side of the ledger), this might yield: $2.4 million.  </P> <P> Imponderables. Movies get money from the darndest places -- airplanes, hotel  rooms, army bases, ships at sea. Let's just call it another: $1 million.  </P> <P> Total Receipts. $334.2 million.  </P> <P> EXPENSES:  </P> <P> Hard costs. This money is shelled out by the studio in cold cash, and includes  an estimated $6 million advance to Jack Nicholson, $5 million or so for Michael  Keaton and other actors, $1.25 million (including bonus) for director Tim  Burton, and other production costs. Some folks say the real number is over $50  million, but sources familiar with the movie have repeatedly pegged it at  about: $40 million.  </P> <P> Studio overhead. All studios charge a percentage of hard costs to cover their  own corporate expenses associated with a film. Fees vary, but a modest charge  would be 15%, or: $6 million.  </P> <P> Prints and advertising. Higher and higher all the time, as studios rely heavily  on prime-time TV to force-feed opening-night audiences. Including certain other  incidentals -- taxes, dubbing, shipping, and so forth by the end of the year --  this line approaches: $50 million.  </P> <P> Distribution fee. This one's a killer. Big studios charge every movie a stiff  percentage of revenue collected as a fee for distributing the film. The  percentage varies from market to market -- U.S. theatrical sales may carry a  30% fee, while foreign theater sales may cost 40%. Based on past Warner films,  it appears that the overall fee will be about 33%, or: $110.3 million.  </P> <P> Joker's cut. Jack Nicholson, according to several sources familiar with the  film, is paid a percentage of Warner's total receipts on "Batman." Supposedly,  the cut starts at 15%, then escalates to as much as 20% as the dollars flow in.  No joke, figured at 17.5%, Nicholson could get $58.5 million, minus his  advance, for an additional: $52.5 million.  </P> <P> Comic possibility. DC Comics owns Batman, the character, and Warner owns DC.  Sources say the unit gets 5% of the movie's receipts, from the first dollar.  That's: $16.7 million.  </P> <P> Other players. Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, Keaton and some others are  said to have deals that give them a cut of the "adjusted gross," a figure that  may be calculated differently, under complex formulas, for each contract. One  reasonably well-informed guess figures these participants could get: $18  million.  </P> <P> Interest. An old Hollywood custom allows the studio to charge interest on its  $40 million in hard costs at 125% of the prime rate until all the other charges  against a film are paid off. With the prime rate hovering around 10.5%, Warner  will collect about 13.13%, for as long as three years. That's another: $15.8  million.  </P> <P> Total expenses: $309.3 million.  </P> <P>  The bottom line. Is "Batman" going to be a "profit" picture? The figures here  suggest the movie will turn a modest net profit of $24.9 million during its  first sale to all the various markets. Traditionally, Warner collects about  half of that, or about $12.5 million. The rest gets divided among other profit  participants. If, as one source suggests, director Burton gets 10% of the net,  he will eventually see about $2.5 million.  </P></p>

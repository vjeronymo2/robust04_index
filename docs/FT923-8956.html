			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Australia releases rail project funds THE Australian government said yesterday it was making ADollars 181m (Pounds 71m) immediately available for a railway project designed to create 12,000 direct and indirect jobs over the next two years. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the spending was for the first stage of a ADollars 454m national rail network programme. Release of the funds coincided with figures showing unemployment for July stood at 11 per cent, only marginally lower than June's record 11.1 per cent. A national rail network was a key element of Mr Keating's economic statement in February. The statement allocated Dollars 2.3bn over two years to boost the economy and cut unemployment to less than 10 per cent by the next general election, in mid-1993. The government hoped this would lead to 4.75 per cent growth in 1992-1993. However, it has conceded that growth of less than 4 per cent is a more realistic target.</p>

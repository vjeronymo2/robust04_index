			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Great Portland scheme likely to be scrapped A CONTROVERSIAL management agreement between Great Portland Estates, the UK's sixth largest property company, and its chairman is likely to be scrapped in the light of the Cadbury report on corporate governance. At its next meeting, the board will discuss proposals to reform a long-standing arrangement by which Great Portland pays management fees to a company fully owned by Mr Richard Peskin, its chairman and chief executive. 'It is more than likely that we shall be changing it (the arrangement) in some form or other,' said Mr Roger Payton, deputy chairman. 'I think it is very likely that it has outlived its usefulness.' In its last financial year, Great Portland paid Pounds 2.97m in management fees to Basil &amp; Howard Samuel, a management agent owned by Mr Peskin that solely acts for Great Portland. Some institutional shareholders dislike the arrangement because it obscures the size of Mr Peskin's pay package and could present a possible conflict of interest. The Pounds 2.97m fee paid to B&amp;HS by Great Portland, which has a rental income of Pounds 83.8m, is at the top end of fees charged by managing agents, which are normally in the range of 1 to 3.5 per cent of the rent roll. Great Portland said that the fees were 'in accordance with the scale of professional charges laid down on 1 January 1963 by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors'. However, the RICS abandoned the scale in 1982 at the instigation of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and strongly discourages companies from referring to it. Mr Peskin, who is paid a direct salary of Pounds 33,000 by Great Portland, declined to disclose how much income he draws from his management company. The company is not obliged to disclose its income because it is classified as a small company under the 1985 Companies Act. The agreement between BH&amp;S and Great Portland has a 57 month notice period. If the agreement is terminated for any reason, Great Portland has agreed to pay Mr Peskin an additional salary, equal to his salary from B&amp;HS. 'There cannot be any advantages to shareholders of Great Portland Estates at all in this arrangement,' said one analyst. 'I think this agreement is unique.' Although Great Portland has used this arrangement for the last 34 years, the company may come under pressure to reform it because institutional shareholders are starting to take a greater interest in the pay packages of top executives. Mr Payton's decision to raise the issue at the next board meeting stemmed from the publication of the Cadbury Committee report last December.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING THE ART OF COURTSHIP;  </P> <P> JAPANESE SCHOOL HELPS BACHELORS GET 'GIRL OF DREAMS'  </P> <P> "My mother suggested that I come here," said Junya Iyori, giving a shy glance  at the interviewer.  </P> <P> "Whenever I tried to speak with girls, I'd choke on words. I also had bad sense  of fashion," said the 34-year-old bachelor, who works for a shipping company  and has tried at least three times to find a bride through omiai, or the  Japanese arranged marriage.  </P> <P> Iyori is one of 50 bachelors who gets help from Marriage Man Academy, a  finishing school for men that opened recently in Osaka, Japan's third largest  city, west of Tokyo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strictly for Men  </P> <P> Unlike the typical Japanese finishing schools, where women are taught how to  become good housewives, the academy teaches men how to communicate with women  and assume a realistic relationship with them.  </P> <P> On the wall behind Iyori's seat in the class room is a poster with five  principles of the "bridegroom school":  </P> <P> *Do not cringe to a woman.  </P> <P> *Do not underestimate a woman.  </P> <P> *Try to understand a woman.  </P> <P> *Be open to a woman.  </P> <P> *Have confidence in yourself.  </P> <P> Based on those principles, the academy's 22-step, six-month course gives  bachelors like Iyori lessons such as how to make a good first impression, how  to have a good sense of humor, how to understand women's feelings and what to  do during the first meeting in an arranged marriage.  </P> <P> Daily seminars and counseling programs also allow a man who cannot afford to  wait six months to learn some quick techniques to capture the heart of the  "girl of his dreams."  </P> <P> "The first thing we teach our students is how to introduce themselves," said  Satoshi Noguchi, founder and instructor of the Academy. "But it takes at least  four weeks for them to speak out loud enough for us to hear."  </P> <P> In most of the lessons, students practice Noguchi's technique with female  instructors. In the sense of humor class, they are told to give a popular  stand-up comedy routine in front of the instructors. Unless they can make the  audience laugh, the outlook for them may be very gloomy, said Noguchi.  </P> <P> The Academy also gives students professional advice on hair styling and how to  dress well. Though they are mostly salaried workers in their late 20s to early  30s, many still live with their parents, who often are just as desperate about  their son's single status.  </P> <P> "We get calls from parents asking us what exactly we teach to their sons,"  Noguchi said.  </P> <P> In Japan, boys are urged to study efficiently, get into an important university  and be hired by a respectable company. Studying hard often consumes so much  time and attention that it is impossible for boys to go out with girls. When it  becomes necessary for them to have relationships with women, they are  completely at a loss.  </P> <P> Why are bachelors like Iyori so anxious to find a bride?  </P> <P> Men hold a strong desire to get married because otherwise they feel incomplete.  They also need someone who will cook, clean and raise children, skills they  were not taught.  </P> <P> In some companies, a man who remains single -- thereby failing to show off the  most basic ability the society demands -- could forfeit his chances to be  promoted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negative Odds  </P> <P> In addition, the odds are against single men in Japan. According to the 1985  national census, the number of single men between the ages of 25 to 34 was 3.6  million -- more than double the number of single women in the same age group.  </P> <P> "Men basically haven't realized the changes in women," said Keiko Higuchi,  professor of women's studies at Tokyo Kasei University. "They're still looking  for a wife who will do everything for them."  </P> <P> Higuchi will offer a lecture course titled "Hanamuko Gakko," or "school for  bridegrooms," at a marriage-counseling center in Tokyo. In her lectures, she  will teach her male students the women's view of the changes in society and the  female role.  </P> <P> "In the old days women would have married such men because they had to have  financial support," said Noguchi of Marriage Man Academy. "But now that many of  them are financially independent, they have a wider choice of enjoyable things  to do other than getting married."  </P> <P> According to the 1988 Labor Ministry's white paper on working women, there were  16 million women who held either full-time or part-time jobs in 1987. The  number accounted for nearly 40% of the nation's total work force in the same  year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picky, Picky  </P> <P> Such financial independence in women has made it inevitable for them to become  choosier about the men they choose if they do marry.  </P> <P> A recent survey by the Altman Institute, a research branch of the match-making  Altman Co., showed that 75% of the women surveyed said the men they would marry  must earn more than $25,000 a year, a substantial income for a young Japanese  man. About 91% said the man has to be a university graduate working as an  engineer; 69% preferred public servants; 54% sought office workers. About 76%  also said that the groom ought to be four to five years older than the bride.  </P> <P> "Women ask for too much," complained Iyori, the student at Marriage Man  Academy. "They won't accept you unless you qualify all their conditions, and  their idea of a man's salary is too high."  </P> <P> Though Higuchi agrees that single women tend to be a bit greedy, she said that  men have much more to learn than women.  </P> <P> In the future, the basic form of a couple will be one where the wife and  husband both maintain their independence, said Higuchi.  </P> <P> To survive such relationships, "Men must learn more about the changes in women  as well as in society," she said Higuchi. "In the old days there were stage  settings that helped men take power over women. But we are now at an age when  men must face women with their true ability."  </P></p>

They are members  of the Mariposa network, linked to the Colombian drug cartels.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Amalia Pando] These youngsters  of  22 and 23 years of age, Eduardo Lima Lobo Dorado and Oscar Lima  Lobo Dorado, are members of the family making up the Mariposa  network, which exported about 1,500 kilograms of cocaine per  month. They were arrested five days ago in San Joaquin, Beni  Department. Two other brothers were also arrested: Joselo  Ignacio Lima Lobo and Carmen Lima Lobo. A fifth brother, Jesus  Einar Lima Lobo Dorado, escaped, and a sixth brother, Edwin  Douglas Lima Lobo, has been held under arrest for one year. The  father of these brothers, Ademar, was identified by Government  Minister German Quiroga as the head of the Mariposa network:    [Quiroga] The Lima Lobo brothers are being processed for  drug  trafficking. The antinarcotic officials are after Jesus Einar  Lima Lobo Dorado, who escaped during the operation in San  Joaquin. Another brother, Edwin Douglas Lima Lobo, was arrested  about one year ago, and is being held on charges of drug  trafficking. The operation of the Mariposa network began in  March 1993. The actions of antidrug agents allowed the capture  of 47 individuals linked to this important drug trafficking  network. In addition to the arrests, members of the Special  Antinarcotics Force seized six light airplanes, eight ranches,  two labs for processing drugs, and about 2,400 kg of cocaine  base.    [Pando] There are 10 Colombians among the 47 arrested. The  special force believes this network was linked to the Cali  cartel through Celimo Andrade, who was arrested more than one  year ago and is being held in the Chonchocoro jail. This  network also had links with the Medellin cartel through (Omar  Casis Candia). This is the second network of drug traffickers  which has been dismantled within the last seven days.

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (12): Close partnership could develop - International relations, China JAPAN is paying more attention to its Asian neighbours as its trade disputes increase with the US and the EC. Although the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) countries were the main focus of Asian investment by Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, China could emerge as Japan's closest economic partner in Asia in the 1990s. If that occurs, it would be as significant for east Asia as the post-war rapprochement between France and Germany was for western Europe. One encouraging sign is that Japanese investment is flowing into China as the two countries celebrate the 20th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations this year. Japan views China both as a source of cheap labour and natural resources as well as a potentially large and lucrative market. Although China harbours suspicions about Japan dating from the Second World War, it also eagerly seeks economic aid and investment capital from Japan. Japan has curried favour with Beijing by leading the way in breaking western diplomatic isolation imposed on China following the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 1989. Last year, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, then Japan's prime minister, became the first leader of a leading western power to visit China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. This was followed by the resumption of Japanese government loans to China. China's political troubles in 1989 occurred as Japanese investment in the country was accelerating. The investment reached a peak of Dollars 515m in 1988, then fell to Dollars 356m in 1989. There has been a gradual recovery since then, with Japanese investments amounting to Dollars 503m in 1990 and Dollars 533m in 1991. However, China still accounts for only a tiny share of Japan's total worldwide investment. Japan has invested Dollars 2.86bn in China between 1979 and 1991, although the figure climbs to Dollars 4.12bn if planned investments are included. This amounts to only about 4 per cent of Japanese industrial investments abroad and less than 1 per cent of its total investments overseas. Japan's direct investments accounted for a slim 4.4 per cent of the Dollars 11.98bn in total foreign investment in China last year. Although China ranks seventh among Asian countries in terms of Japanese investment, it is expected to climb up the table in the next few years. Corporate investment is concentrated among Japanese producers of light industrial goods, including textiles, electrical appliances and consumer products. In particular, Japanese electronics companies are looking to China as one route out of their current downturn. China is not only considered a low-cost manufacturing base, but also as a market for electronic goods such as TVs and VCRs that have reached saturation point in the west. But until Chinese authorities increase foreign access to the domestic market, an estimated 70 per cent of the goods produced by Japanese companies in China will be for export. The port of Dalian is the main area attracting Japanese investment, followed by Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. The Japanese government, banks and trading companies are financing development of a Y30bn industrial park at Dalian that will be 80 per cent owned by Japanese interests. 'The infrastructure at Dalian is good, with port facilities and an adequate transportation network,' said Mr Satoshi Imai, a senior economist and China specialist at the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro). 'We expect that around 100 small and medium Japanese companies will locate in the industrial complex.' Another attraction of Dalian is that 'the Japanese have a certain familiarity with the area,' explains Mr Imai in a subtle reference to Dalian having been part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite Japanese colonial occupation of Manchuria, 'the regional authorities are now encouraging Japanese investment.' Shanghai, meanwhile, has become the main base for Japanese trading houses and is likely to be another key manufacturing site for Japanese companies. Japan, however, has lagged behind other foreign countries in making direct investments in the booming Guangdong region of southern China. 'Japanese companies based in Hong Kong are primarily using Guangdong for subcontracting work and it is difficult to evaluate the extent of Japanese involvement in the province,' says Mr Imai. Japan is also providing loans to develop China's natural resources. The government has pledged a loan package of Y810bn to China for 1990-95. The funds will be used to develop coal and oilfields as well as the building of transport facilities, chemical fertiliser plants, and dams in which Japanese construction companies will be involved. This activity is taking place against the backdrop of growing trade between Japan and China. Bilateral trade is expected to reach at least Dollars 25bn this year, exceeding last year's record of Dollars 22.8bn. Japanese exports to China, which amounted to Dollars 8.59bn last year and mainly consisted of electronic goods, vehicles and machinery and equipment, were boosted by China's easing of import restrictions following the growth in its foreign exchange reserves and the resumption of foreign loans. China enjoys a trade surplus with Japan, with exports reaching Dollars 14.2bn last year. They included supplies of coal, oil and food products. But manufactured items accounted for 55 per cent of the Chinese exports and a rising proportion of the textiles, metal goods and computer software being shipped to Japan are made in factories with Japanese investment. Obstacles remain, however, to the development of Sino-Japanese relations in both the economic and political spheres. Japanese companies complain about the poor state of China's transport infrastructure, while the supply of electricity is unreliable. Laws and regulations lack transparency and are changed frequently. The chief source of concern among Japanese investors, however, remains the political stability of the Chinese government. 'There are worries about what will happen after the departure of Deng Xiao-ping,' says Mr Imai. But there is also a growing acknowledgement that China may be becoming a more stable place than the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. Government relations have been soured by several recent disputes. China has criticised parliamentary approval of legislation allowing Japanese troops to participate abroad in peace-keeping operations. Japan has been irritated by renewed claims by China to the ownership of an island group near Taiwan that Tokyo also claims. Oil deposits are believed to lie in the surrounding seas. But it is memories of Japan's aggression in China between 1931 and 1945 that still cast the biggest shadow over good relations. The Japanese government, for example, is reluctant to accept an invitation by Beijing for the Emperor Akihito to visit China in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of restored diplomatic relations. Tokyo fears that the Chinese may demand an apology for the Japanese occupation, although Beijing denies such intentions. However, China may permit individuals to seek as much as Dollars 180bn in war reparations from Japan, which has renewed suspicions among Japanese officials. 'The Chinese are raising the issue of the Japanese role in the Second World War as a bargaining chip to get more technology, investment and economic aid, which they consider inadequate. An apology by the emperor would force us to make new concessions,' said a Japanese government foreign policy adviser. 'Our position is that China has problems absorbing the current level of technology and investment that we provide.' Despite these differences, Japan will probably work hard to strengthen its relations with China during the next decade. The Asean countries are becoming too costly as a production base, while the Soviet Far East is regarded as a poor investment risk.</p>

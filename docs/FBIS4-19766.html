			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 20 (A.A.) -- A law which regulates  media broadcasts and publications came into force today when it  was published in the Official Gazette.    The law foresees the establishment of a radio and television  high board to control and oversee the media. The multi partisan  board will be composed of nine members: five from the ruling  party and four from opposition parties and will be nominated by  parliament. The board will function for six years and three of  its members will be replaced every two years.    The board will delegate national and regional frequencies,  will issue broadcast licenses, will allocate channels and will  monitor the compliance of radio and tv broadcasts to  international agreements.    The board will be responsible for making sure that the  broadcasts are in compliance with the expression of thought, the  existence, independence and unity of the Turkish State,  pluralism in communication and broadcasting, national and  ethical values, and the basic concepts and principles of the  republic as stated in the Constitution.    The amount of advertisement will not exceed 15 percent of  daily broadcasting time.    The broadcasts will not be subjected to a ban or censorship  by the board, unless by court verdicts. However, the prime  minister or a minister charged by the prime minister will be  authorized to interrupt a broadcast when national security  issues clearly necessitate it or there is a very high likelihood  that the public order could be damaged.    Radio and TV stations will be responsible for broadcasting  announcements made by the president or the government on  national security, public order, general health and general  ethics.</p>

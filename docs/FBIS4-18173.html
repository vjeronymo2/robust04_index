			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Game of Words"--all punctuation as </F> published]    [Excerpts] We do not underestimate the last-minute effort  by Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special representative on  Cyprus, to salvage the talks on the confidence-building  measures. However, we cannot understand the game of words with  which he covers and expresses the Turkish intransigence.    Yesterday we heard Mr. Lamb describe his meeting with  [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas as "productive." And  this, because the Turkish Cypriot leader "appeared to understand  some things better!!"....    We also heard yesterday Ankara's statement that the European  Union cannot help with a solution to the Cyprus problem. This  is because, supposedly, the European Union considers the Turkish  Cypriot side non-existent!!....    In both cases, the words do not express reality. On the  contrary, they twist, violate, and tamper with the rules of  dialogue on internationally acceptable principles.    Specifically:    1. We cannot accept Lamb's meeting with Denktas as  "productive," since it did not produce the outcome advised by  the UN Security Council permanent members within a specified  timeframe for "achievement of an agreement without delay."  Today is the expiration date of this effort and there are no  indications of a change in Denktas' position, which leads to a  new impasse.... It is therefore natural that we do not expect  any last-minute surprises because these moves must be considered  an effort to dispel the negative impressions of the other side  to avoid international condemnation. Denktas was in a position  many years ago to realize what today he appears to "understand"  to gain international tolerance and extension. Denktas' failure  to abide by the resolutions and advice of the Security Council  has exceeded all limits. [passage omitted]    We are right when we talk about a bad game of words and  provocative mockery. If the Security Council respects itself  and its decisions and deadlines, it ought to change its policy.  Otherwise, the impasse will continue and international tolerance  will be associated with acceptance [of faits accomplis].</p>

Those who  participated on the Israeli side were reserve Brigadier General  'Amos Gilbo'a and Dr. Yosi Olmert. On the Syrian side, there  was Professor 'Aziz Shukri, dean of the Law Faculty at the  University of Damascus, and another professor whose name was not  given.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the document says  that Syria agrees to peace with Israel based on the Egyptian  model -- which includes the opening of embassies and trade,  economic, and cultural ties -- in return for an Israeli  withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights. Each stage in the  normalization process will be accompanied by a withdrawal stage.  Differences surfaced on the timeframe for the withdrawal and  the fate of the Jewish settlements on the Golan, although the  Syrians accepted the Israeli position that settlements should  not be uprooted.</p>

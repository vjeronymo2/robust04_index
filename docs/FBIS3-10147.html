President Wasmosy convened a meeting of Industry and  Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone, Agriculture and Livestock  Minister Raul Torres, Cadelpa President Roberto Antebi, and  Oscar Aranda, of Inagrisa [Agricultural and Industrial  Investments, Inc.] to discuss the situation. Following the  announcement made by Scavone and Torres, Antebi rose to express  his disagreement over the proceeding. "We accept the decision,  but we do not share it," Antebi said, adding that the government  did not respect the signed agreement. Antebi questioned the fact  that the government made the decision "during the last minute of  the game."    Antebi said that last year the private sector was called in  to bear the burden of solving the critical problem created by  the picudo [cotton infecting insect] invasion. Besides,  producers did not have any incentives to cultivate cotton.  Cadelpa actively participated in promoting cotton production  with seeds, raw materials, financial and technological support,  and provided the necessary resources, Antebi said.    The industrialist added that conditions then were very bad  and that Cadelpa knowingly assumed the risk of fighting the  picudo infection which at the time was calculated to have  affected 50 percent of the land used for cotton cultivation. "It  was necessary to take preventive measures and Cadelpa imported  the best insecticides to fight the scourge and supplied them to  producers at cost," Antebi said. Besides, Cadelpa contracted 18  foreign experts in the disease, 100 engineers, organized more  than 1,000 meetings, trained 10,000 operators and as a result  today peasants know how to treat the disease, Antebi explained.    Antebi said that Cadelpa thinks the cotton industry is being  used as a "scapegoat" because currently there are many other  serious political problems. The industrialist said the decision  will end up causing more damage to agricultural production in  the future.    "The money always goes where it is safe to invest. Nearly  $120 million have been invested in agriculture and that is why  the rules of the game should have been respected," Antebi said.  "If there is no security for investments then who will invest in  agriculture next year? We will see if the government,  politicians, religious people, or who will be interested in  investing in agriculture. The private sector will watch and if  conditions are appropriate will participate, otherwise it will  not," Antebi emphasized.</p>

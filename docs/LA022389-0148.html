			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> PURCHASE OF RIGHT OF WAY  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors has urged the county Transportation Commission  to buy the Santa Fe railroad right of way from downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena  for construction of a light rail transit line.  </P> <P> Light rail cars would reach Pasadena through Highland Park. The railroad right  of way is one of two Los Angeles-Pasadena alignments under study by the county  Transportation Commission. The other alignment, which is favored by Alhambra,  would bring the line along Main Street through El Sereno, and then turn north  along the extension of the Long Beach Freeway.  </P> <P> Acting on recommendations from its Light Rail Alignment Task Force and  Transportation Advisory Commission, the Pasadena board urged the county  Transportation Commission to refrain from tying the transit line to the  long-delayed Long Beach Freeway project. In addition, the board noted that by  buying the Santa Fe right of way east to San Bernardino, the commission could  preserve the right of way for a commuter rail line to supplement the Los  Angeles-Pasadena trolley system.  </P> <P> The county commission has completed a draft environmental impact report for the  Main Street and Highland Park alignments from Los Angeles to El Sereno and  South Pasadena. Pasadena is conducting studies of light rail alignments through  Pasadena. The Pasadena board this week urged the county commission to finance  environmental studies of the route through Pasadena as quickly as possible so  that the commission can consider the entire line when it begins making  decisions on when to provide funds for construction.  </P></p>

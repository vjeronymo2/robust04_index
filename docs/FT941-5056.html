			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters at new peak News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings saw its share price jump to an all-time high yesterday. Dealers lifted their quotations and deterred some UK fund managers who were desperate to increase holdings. The stock jumped 81 to 2159p with the additional help of a repeated buy recommendation from perennial bull Mr Brian Newman of agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite. There was also some interest ahead of a dinner in New York last night between senior Reuters executives and US fund managers and a meeting with US analysts today. The rise was further exacerbated by a Dollars 3 gain in the US traded ADRs on Friday. However, the basis for the squeeze lay in the persistent reluctance of US investors to sell stock since the figures on February 8 and ahead of a share split on April 18. Analysts said that because of this unwillingness to sell, UK marketmakers were unable to get hold of the stock and were consequently marking up prices. Mr Alastair Smellie of Lehman Brothers said that as 37 per cent of the stock is held in the US and a further 6 1/2 per cent by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, UK funds are seriously underweight. Their drive to redress the situation has seen the Reuters share price climb by almost 13 per cent since the February figures, against an FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index which has slipped by 4.5 per cent.</p>

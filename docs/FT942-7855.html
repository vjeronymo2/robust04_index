			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Heseltine vows sell-offs will go on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday vowed to carry on the government's privatisation programme as he pushes forward the partial sale of the Post Office. He said the Conservatives would continue with the 'privatisation revolution' and carry it to completion. Mr Heseltine is determined to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, after publishing a green paper on the future of the Post Office. A number of backbenchers have warned the government that a flotation of the Royal Mail will be 'a privatisation too far'. But Mr Heseltine said dismissed such fears, saying there was no such thing. Mr Heseltine's comments were designed to promote the Conservative Political Centre pamphlet on privatisation, which seeks to commit the party to further privatisations. The centre says that the sale of British Gas was described as the first privatisation too far, but has 'turned into a great success for customers'. Ministers plan to continue the privatisation programme by selling Railtrack, the railway infrastructure company, before the next general election, in a public flotation which could be worth Pounds 3.5bn. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, described the planned privatisation of Railtrack as 'a splendid admission of failure'. He said: 'The Tories were only floating the idea of selling off the tracks and signalling because of their conspicuous failure in arousing investment interest in the passenger rail franchises.' Mr Wilson predicted a flotation of Railtrack would prove controversial. 'Everyone would realise that Railtrack would immediately try and screw its profits out of the passenger train companies.' However, Mr Heseltine said the privatisation programme was irreversible and would continue, irrespective of opposition from Labour and Liberal Democrats.</p>

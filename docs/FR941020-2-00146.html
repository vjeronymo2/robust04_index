In November 1993, Corporate Express purchased Hanson Office Products, a division of Hanson Industries, Inc., for $163 million. DLJ Securities Corporation (``DLJ Securities''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLJ, participated in structuring the terms of the acquisition on behalf of Corporate Express. Corporate Express financed the acquisition through the sales of senior subordinated notes and equity securities. In connection with this financing, Corporate Express approached its existing shareholders regarding follow-on equity investments, including MLVP II and the DLJ Companies. In addition, because of the services DLJ Securities provided in the acquisition, Corporate Express offered DLJ Securities a portion of the financing on the same terms as MLVP II and the DLJ Companies. DLJ Capital subsequently acquired the investment in Corporate Express on behalf of DLJ Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Consistent with the Blanket Order, the Sub-Manager reviewed MLVP II's funds available for investment and its current investment in Corporate Express. Following the review, the Sub-Manager recommended that MLVP II invest $1.07 million in Corporate Express, bringing MLVP II's aggregate investment in it to $3 million. At the same time, DLJ Capital reviewed the funds available for investment by the DLJ Companies. DLJ Capital determined that the DLJ Companies should invest an additional $11 million. Corporate Express subsequently informed DLJ Capital and the Sub-Manager that the aggregate equity investment available to MLVP II and the DLJ Companies would be $9 million. Of this $9 million, MLVP II was allocated the entire amount is sought to invest and the DLJ Companies were allocated the remaining $7.3 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On January 24, 1994, consistent with the terms of the Blanket Order, the Individual General Partners unanimously approved the follow-on investment by MLVP II in Corporate Express. However, MLVP II was not able to acquire the Corporate Express securities at that time because the terms of the Blanket Order do not permit MLVP II to co-invest with DLJ Capital, which currently holds DLJ Securities' investment in Corporate Express. Accordingly, the Management Company agreed to purchase and hold the 194,545 shares of series B convertible preferred stock offered to MLVP II. The Management Company will sell these shares to MLVP II if the requested exemptive relief is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Amendment of the Prior Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. As a separate condition made applicable to MLVP II under the Prior Order, MLVP II may not have more than 45% of its assets invested jointly with all affiliates, except as expressly permitted in an order issued by the SEC or as a higher percentage may result from appreciation rather than acquisition of assets the ``45% Limit''). The Blanket Order exempts co-investments made pursuant to that order from the 45% Limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. MLVP II requests an amendment to the 45% Limit to clarify that the limit does not impact its disposition of portfolio securities and the distribution of proceeds to MLVP II partners. MLVP II is in the seventh year of its ten year term and is actively considering exit strategies for its portfolio investments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Corporate Express Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons specified in section 57(b) from participating in joint transactions with a business development company in contravention of rules and regulations prescribed by the SEC. Rule 17d&hyph;1 under the Act applies to section 57(a)(4) transactions through section 57(i). Rule 17d&hyph;1 prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company from entering into joint transactions with the investment company unless the SEC has granted an order permitting such transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The persons listed in section 57(b)(2) include a person who is, within the meaning the section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act, an affiliated person of an investment adviser of a business development company. DLJ Capital owns 100% of the capital stock of the Sub-Manager, which is an investment adviser to MLVP II. MLVP II believes that the Sub-Manager is controlled by DLJ Capital. Thus, DLJ Capital is a person specified in section 57(b)(2) and may not engage in a joint investment with MLV II.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

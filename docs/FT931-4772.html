			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: GECC to pioneer 'dragon' offering THE FINANCING arm of General Electric of the US is set to become the first corporate borrower to tap the 'dragon bond' market, which is targeted at non-Japanese investors in Asia. General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC), which has a triple A rating, intends to launch a US dollar-denominated fixed-rate offering by the end of March. Lehman Brothers has won the GECC mandate. The dragon bond market has been pioneered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop Asia's capital markets and to stimulate participation by the region's investment banking community. The ADB has launched two US dollar-denominated dragon bond issues since 1991. It is expected to launch a yen-denominated issue in the near future.</p>

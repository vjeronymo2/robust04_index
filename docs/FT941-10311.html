			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Right approach for Labour 'Maybe he is right after all. If we just sit and do nothing it will drop into our hands.' You will gather from that comment from a senior Labour politician that Mr John Smith's leadership does not inspire all his colleagues at Westminster. The frustration is felt not only by those on the left such as Mr Bryan Gould who has been pressing the party to stop shadowing the Conservatives and offer instead an ambitious strategy for economic revival and full employment. Mr Gould's departure will not be mourned by those who believe that winning the next general election depends on stifling internal dissent. He is a rebel. His antipathy to Europe is difficult to grasp. But Mr Gould is a thinker in a party with many more placemen and women than intellectuals on its front bench. The modernisers, too, are frustrated. Though scornful of Mr Gould's economic expansionism, they share the analysis that now the party has dumped much of its ideological baggage, it must turn its mind to filling the vacuum. They, like Mr Gould, are not making much headway. The safety-first approach is going down well with the voters. Bank managers are back in fashion. The lesson of the last parliament was that we should pay little heed to the headline voting-intention figures of the opinion polls. Too many of those ready to say they intended to vote Labour changed their mind when they checked their wallets in the privacy of the polling booth. The important - and overlooked - indicators were to be found in the fine print of the polls. The voters did not trust Labour on the economy. In England's south and south-east, they worried that tax increases would hit the aspiring working classes. They felt uncomfortable with the idea of Mr Neil Kinnock in 10 Downing Street. The unions would wield too much clout. As one Tory strategist puts it: 'We were able to persuade them that things were never so bad that they couldn't be worse.' But as Mr John Major's government lurches from crisis to crisis those concerns have begun to disappear. Labour is rebuilding the respectable image it has craved since Mr Kinnock pulled it back from the abyss in 1983. Gallup's latest poll in the Daily Telegraph told the story. The interesting point was not that Labour had retained its 20-point lead. It was that the voters no longer feared a Labour government. Four-fifths thought the opposition had become more moderate. Nearly half thought it would do a better job of running the economy. Two-thirds thought Mr Smith looked like a prime minister. Three-quarters said they would welcome - or would have nothing to fear from - a Labour government. With or without Mr Major, the Tories are bent on self-destruction. Tax increases have deprived them of their strongest electoral card. Their reputation for financial and moral probity is tarnished. The party is locked in mortal combat over its ideological direction. After 15 years in office, the argument runs, the corrosion is too deep to expect the political recovery which traditionally follows an economic upturn. Amid the present disarray it sounds plausible. Even some of the modernisers believe it might be true. But the operative word is might. For Labour to look forward with any certainty to government it has to stand for something  -as it did in 1964 and in 1945. It is often said in defence of inaction that the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher offered only the thinnest outline of her programme when she published The Right Approach before the 1979 general election. The parallel is misleading. For all the absence of detail Mrs Thatcher left no one in any doubt about where she was heading. Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown have grasped the point. Mr Blair wants to reposition Labour as the friend of individual opportunity as well as of community. It should seek to enable not direct. Government should be cast in the role of partner not master. Mr Brown is expected to take up the theme in a series of speeches. His aim will be to emphasise that the debate over tax and spending cannot be divorced from the nation's overall economic performance. The market economy is taken for granted. Labour will promise to get more out of it. But the shadow cabinet's beautiful people - as they are dubbed by scornful colleagues - are in a small minority. The mood of the moment favours sitting and waiting. Maybe that will be enough. It will, though, beg the obvious question: what would Labour do in government beyond providing a breathing space for the Tories to prepare for their return?</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTING HOMELESS A TOUGH JOB FOR CENSUS;  </P> <P> MIGRANTS: ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS SAY THE GOVERNMENT UNDERESTIMATES THE  DIFFICULTY OF REACHING ILLEGAL ALIENS TO GET AN ACCURATE COUNT.  </P> <P> The nationwide barriers to counting the homeless in the 1990 census are even  more daunting in San Diego County, advocates for the homeless complain, putting  the county in danger of a big financial loss.  </P> <P> "The Census Bureau is coming from another locale, and they are simply not aware  of the situation, especially in North County," said Andrea Mintz of the  Regional Task Force on the Homeless.  </P> <P> Counting migrant workers who live in camps among the canyons of North County  represents different problems and requires different methods from counting the  more typical homeless populations in urbanized areas, said Mintz, who chairs  the task force's census committee.  </P> <P> "When I found out about their methodology for counting the homeless, I was just  kind of shocked," she said. "That's really not going to work."  </P> <P> The task force issued a report in mid-February expressing concerns that the  homeless population will be drastically undercounted in the survey this year  because the Census Bureau does not understand the dynamics involved in counting  the homeless in San Diego. Illegal immigrants, whether on urban streets or  rural encampments, fear government officials and will avoid census workers,  they say, while the large numbers of non-English speakers present other  challenges.  </P> <P> At least in urban areas, the advocates say, most of the hangouts of the  homeless are well known -- shelters, cheap hotels and parks. But there is no  easy way to identify the tent communities that have sprung up in North County.  The migrant workers live in hundreds of small encampments in the hills of  Escondido, Carlsbad, Oceanside and other communities.  </P> <P> "They're geographically scattered," said Connie Saldana of the North County  Interfaith Center. "Although there are a few large camps, most live in smaller  ones. There are so many people living in small camps of just two or three."  </P> <P> The outcome could make a major dollar difference to the county. Dan Conway, a  spokesman for the Census Bureau, said that for every homeless person not  counted -- whether in the country legally or not -- the county loses $150 in  federal funds annually for the next 10 years. This decade's census-taking of  the homeless, the second ever, would be more extensive than in 1980, Conway  said, with more interaction with community groups and agencies.  </P> <P> But simply finding where the migrant workers sleep at night is a problem. Local  homeless advocates, who are responsible for compiling a list of migrant camp  locations, said they have been given too little time to do the job.  </P> <P> "We're short on time with an enormous task to perform," Saldana said. "We know  it's not going to be accurate because the odds are so much against it. The  point is that we have to make an attempt.  </P> <P> "If I had a lot more people that could dedicate time, we could come up with a  pretty accurate list," Saldana said. "It is very likely that we will miss a few  camps. At this point, we're missing most of them."  </P> <P> To date, Saldana has found 78 migrant camps in North County.  </P> <P> "There's still lots out there that we haven't identified. For instance, we  haven't identified any in Ramona, and I know there are some there," Saldana  said.  </P> <P> Millie Gordon, who helped in the 1980 census of North County migrant workers,  called this year's one-night count a farce and "a waste of time and energy."  </P> <P> Gordon and 14 others counted the North County homeless from April to mid-August  in 1980 and found about 18,000 migrants.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's possible to get anywhere near a correct count with this new  method," Gordon said. "The people who are spread out in the hooches and spider  holes and aren't in a big group, who's going to count them? They're going to do  it in a one-day period, that's not possible. There's not enough time and its  not being done very realistically."  </P> <P> Conway defended the bureau, saying that it contacted agencies that help the  homeless in 1988 and again in 1989 to help them prepare for the upcoming count.  But the agencies only started recently to compile their lists, he said.  </P> <P> Another barrier to counting the migrant population is the shortage of bilingual  census takers. To help, the Census Bureau expects to hire bilingual noncitizens  with legal residency in the United States. Previously, federal policy did not  allow the bureau to hire noncitizens.  </P> <P> Finally, there is the task of getting undocumented people to cooperate with  census takers. Although people will not be asked their residential status and  all census information is confidential, undocumented persons tend to shy from  interaction with government representatives for fear of deportation.  </P> <P> "People that have a pattern of fleeing from strangers might not want to be  counted, especially not having been educated ahead of time about the purpose of  the count," Saldana said.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau launched an advertising campaign to educate the migrant  homeless on the census, particularly its confidentiality, with spots on  Spanish-language radio stations and flyers in Spanish. While the campaign is a  good idea, Mintz said the amount of resources being put into the effort is "not  sufficient."  </P> <P> Mintz also expressed concern over the count of the general homeless population.  Most homeless people have no interest in the census and they make it a point to  conceal where they spend the night, Mintz said.  </P> <P> "This isn't a priority for the homeless, they're not interested, and they're  reluctant to talk to anyone that smells like government," Mintz said. "Chances  are, they're not going to be too cooperative."  </P> <P> But Conway said that the most important part of the homeless count will be the  head count, and the questions being asked are few and simple. The five  questions being asked the homeless concern the person's race, sex, age, marital  status and whether they are of Hispanic origin.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau plans to take its count of all the homeless on the night of  March 20 through the early morning of March 21. Census takers will go to  shelters, cheap hotels and street locations that have been identified by local  homeless advocates as congregating places for the homeless.  </P> <P> The count of those in migrant camps will take place from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on  March 21.  </P> <P> Families that are doubled up in single-family dwellings, people in shelters for  abused women, and homeless people living in tents at commercial campgrounds  will be counted as part of the regular census operations.  </P> <P> "If we can find out where the homeless are, we have the resources to go to  those locations in one night," Conway said. "It's not a matter of people  power."  </P> <P> But homeless advocates say enumerators won't find out where the homeless are  because they don't want to be found.  </P> <P> "If the homeless are in Balboa Park, they're in trees and bushes and hard to  find, and you really don't want to go there anyway," Mintz said. She estimates  that only 10% of the homeless population sleep in shelters while up to 90% may  live on the street, "but you can't find them."  </P> <P> Conway admitted that the count will be "conservative," but that they are doing  what they can. Concerning Balboa Park, the Census Bureau plans a sweep of the  area with enumerators going in groups up to four, armed with flashlights and  highly visible vests identifying them as census takers.  </P> <P> One of the points of contention between census officials and homeless advocates  has been whether to count the homeless in soup kitchens. Homeless advocates  think that counting people while they are gathered in one place would provide a  more accurate count and would be easier to do. Census officials, however, are  afraid of counting people twice -- where they eat and where they sleep.  </P> <P> Conway said the bureau's policy is to count people where they sleep, and that  policy applies to the homeless also.  </P> <P> "The formal official position of the bureau is that we will not count people  standing in line at soup kitchens," Conway said. But since many soup kitchens  also provide shelter to a small number of their patrons, the bureau will count  some people at the soup kitchens.  </P> <P> "The plan is only to count those people that reside at the shelter," Conway  said.  </P> <P> To help in the count, the county board of supervisors recently decided to open  the cold weather shelters to the homeless normally used only under winter  conditions. By gathering many of the homeless in one place, they hope to not  only get a more accurate count but also to get more extensive demographic  information, said Nancy Allen, chief of staff at Supervisor John MacDonald's  office.  </P> <P> But the effect of not counting at soup kitchens could drastically hurt the  results of the count, workers with the homeless contend.  </P> <P> "It probably takes a third off of those out of the group that would have been  counted," said Frank Landerville of the Regional Task Force, which is financed  by San Diego city and county and the United Way. "I think the chances of being  able to find those people after they leave the soup kitchens are very poor,  especially those that are mentally alert enough to find secure and safe places  to sleep, because if they are secure and safe, they aren't going to be found.  </P> <P> "Homeless advocates and social workers couldn't find all the homeless in one  evening. I just don't believe that census enumerators can find them when others  cannot."  </P></p>

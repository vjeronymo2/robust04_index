			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: T&amp;N It is easy to be rude about T&amp;N's rights issue, the fourth cash call in five years. The shares have underperformed the market by 50 per cent since 1986. The proceeds do little more than cover the next two annual dividend payments. And the yield on the new paper works out at 10.3 per cent. With the balance sheet not seriously stretched, the market is entitled to be cynical. T&amp;N, however, still deserves the benefit of the doubt, and not merely because it is one of those companies still trying to keep UK manufacturing competitive. Trying to escape the long shadow of asbestos claims, it has undergone a radical transformation, with a growing reputation for the quality of its automotive and engineering products and big orders from Ford in Europe and Nissan in the US. The problem is maintaining the high levels of R and D and capital spending which made this possible at a time when markets, notably automotive markets, have collapsed around the world. T&amp;N's recent earnings record is miserable - minus 9.5 per cent compound over the last five years. But if it emerges from the current recession with lower costs and a sustained reputation for quality there is scope for a sharp reversal of trend. The trouble for investors hoping for more than a good yield is that the dividend cover (1.2 times) will take time to repair.</p>

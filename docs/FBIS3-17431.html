Generals Gromov and  Toporov are running the risk of being the first among those to  be axed.    Observers think that Boris Gromov -- one of the most likely  contenders for the position of minister if it becomes vacant --  is thus being "taken out of the game." Who the third one will  be is yet unknown.    Radical reforms in the ministry have long been expected. The  deputies -- Generals Toporov and Mironov -- have long been  gradually vacating the fifth floor where Pavel Grachev's office  is located. As for Boris Gromov's office, it is in an altogether  different building.    In principle, no defense minister before Gen. Grachev had  such a number of deputies.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular dailies on 28 February  carry editorials and articles assessing the recent development  in the North Korean nuclear issue in which the United States and  North Korea are reported to have agreed on four points: 1) The  United States will announce suspension of the Team Spirit joint  military exercise; 2) North Korea will allow the International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to inspect its nuclear facilities  beginning 1 March; 3) the inter-Korean working contact for the  exchange of special envoys will be resumed in Panmunjom; and 4)  the United States and North Korea will hold the third round of  high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Progress Only on Procedural Matters." The  editorial notes: "This progress in the North Korean nuclear  issue is only in procedural matters. No real progress has been  made. The so-called `full-scope inspection' to which North  Korea has committed merely has the significance of including in  the inspection `all of' the seven sites, including the  five-megawatt nuclear reactor and the radioactive chemical  laboratory. The `full scope' inspection entails only one  examination to determine if there has been any change in the  seven sites since North Korea rejected inspection one year ago.  As a matter of fact, this is a very limited inspection. Real  progress to ensure North Korean nuclear transparency remains  only in our vague expectation that such progress can be explored  in the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks."    The editorial notes North Korea unwillingly consented to the  inter-Korean dialogue for the exchange of special envoys. The  editorial notes the ROK Government's irresolute attitude to date  in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, apparently out  of the desire to induce North Korea to permit nuclear  inspections, and stresses that in future talks on tackling the  practical problems in talks with North Korea, we should take a  tough, clear-cut position to ensure transparency in North Korean  nuclear inspections.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word  editorial entitled "North Korean Nuclear Inspection -- This is  Only a Beginning." The editorial notes: "Full-fledged  negotiations will be begin at the third round of U.S.-North  Korean talks, which will deal with the issue of IAEA inspection  of the two undeclared nuclear sites in Yongbyon." The editorial  notes that these two undeclared nuclear sites are the key to the  resolution of the nuclear issue, and notes the fact that "the  United States failed to put down in writing the resumption of  inter-Korean dialogue as a precondition to the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks, accepting the North Korean stance that  if South Korea proposes the exchange of special envoys, North  Korea will hold a working contact in Panmunjom." The editorial  continues: "Under this condition, North Korea proudly disclosed  that it had agreed with the United States to suspend the Team  Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military exercise." The editorial notes  that when the inter-Korean contact is made in Panmunjom on 1  March, the South side will be able to find out how serious North  Korea is about inter-Korean dialogue and if the South's  irresolute position in dealing with the North Korean nuclear  issue has been appropriate.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled "The Nuclear Issue and the Attitude  of the Authorities of North and South Korea." The editorial  anticipates little problem in nuclear inspection by the IAEA "as  North Korean delegate Ho Chong said that the inspection will be  completed smoothly within the set period and the date for the  third round of high-level talks is set." The editorial  criticizes North Korea for its attempt to exclude South Korea, a  direct party concerned in the national reunification and nuclear  issues, from the discussion on the nuclear issue. The editorial  criticizes that the South Government "looks like a groomsman,"  as revealed by the ROK's "awkward" announcement on the  suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise after the  United States and North Korea had already adopted the written  agreement.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 7 a 500-word  article by Yang Sung-hyon entitled "The North Korean-U.S.  Negotiation and the ROK-U.S. Joint Cooperation System" from the  "Today's Eye" column. The article notes that relevant ROK  Government officials feel the result of the U.S.-North Korean  contact held in New York fell short of their expectations  compared to the enormous efforts and energy of the U.S. and ROK  side. The article notes the North Korean disclosure of the  U.S.-North Korean agreement on the suspension of the Team Spirit  joint military exercise before a ROK announcement and the  failure to demand as a precondition for the third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks that meaningful progress is  made in inter-Korean dialogue, and reports: "The failure to  include this precondition in the U.S.- North Korean written  agreement could be a stumbling block in the future in view of  the unpredictable North Korean attitude."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 5 an article by  Pak Ui-chun entitled "The Inter-Korean Scuffle Over the  Interpretation of the 'New York Contact.'" The article notes:  "While South Korea claims that it followed through on its  position with North Korea that the inter-Korean exchange of  special envoys must be made before the third round of North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea claimed that the  written agreement was adopted because the United States withdrew  the unreasonable precondition, hinting that the exchange of  special envoys was excluded as a precondition to the third round  of U.S.-North Korean talks." The article continues: "The ROK  Government explains that the United States did not include the  inter-Korean exchange of special envoys in the written agreement  because the United States can call off the third round of talks  in case the exchange of special envoys is not realized." The  editorial concludes: "Although North Korea shows an allergic  reaction outwardly to the inter-Korean exchange of special  envoys, it will probably agree to the exchange of special envoys  before 21 March to create an atmosphere favorable for the third  round of talks."</p>

To compensate, it is offering disappointed customers free admission to any two of the next three talks. They are by NatWest's Lord Alexander on banks, business and the community; David Sieff of Marks &amp; Spencer on the quest for quality; and by Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair and Merlyn Rees on the future of the Labour party.</p>

Katyal: "Arms Spares From Russia Coming"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 8--Three shiploads of spares for the  defence hardware are arriving from Russia this month, marking a  breakthrough in the jammed supplies since the disintegration of  the Soviet Union. One ship has already arrived, another is  expected this week and the third later in the month.    This is not the only sign of an upswing in India-Russia  bilateral relations, the plans for the exchange of visits by the  top brass being the other. The Russian naval chief, Admiral  Gromov, is due here soon, while the Chief of the Army Staff,  Gen. B. C. Joshi, will go to Russia later this month. Russian  ships will make a call at Bombay in the near future, while the  plans for joint naval exercises are under way.    At the political level too, the warmth and likemindedness,  evident during the stay here of the Russian President, Mr. Boris  Yeltsin, remains intact. According to latest indications from  Moscow, Russia will support New Delhi's stand at the U.N. Human  Rights Commission at Geneva, where Pakistan plans to move an  anti-India resolution. The warmth beneath the customary Republic  Day message from Mr. Yeltsin to the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma,  has not gone unnoticed. "Our two countries are united," said Mr.  Yeltsin, "not only by the concurrence of the core national  interest, adherence to democratic objectives but also by the  invaluable potential of mutual trust and sincere goodwill."    The idea of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's  visit to Moscow has been seriously mooted but the schedule is  yet to be finalised. At one stage, the two foreign offices  proceeded on the assumption of a trip in May--but, now a later  date is to be fixed, around the middle of the year.    The two leaders recently exchanged letters, dealing with  bilateral issues and the problems of their respective regions.  Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured in the two  communications though the precise references are not known  publicly. According to the Russian embassy sources here, Moscow  regarded Kashmir an integral part of India and affirmed faith in  its territorial integrity, considered a "must" not only for the  region but for the world as a whole.    On one issue, however, Russia will need to update its  position. Mr. Yeltsin's letter, it is learnt, had noted with  satisfaction Pakistan's decision to give up its plan for an  anti-India human rights-related resolution at the U.N. That  phase, however, proved short-lived with Pakistan thinking of an  identical move at Geneva. On trans-border terrorism, India has  every reason to draw comfort from the Russian view.</p>

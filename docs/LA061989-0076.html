			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER CHIEF WOULD RECEIVE $180 MILLION IN NEW TIME DEAL  </P> <P> Warner Communications Chairman Steven J. Ross will get a windfall of $55  million if Time Inc. succeeds in acquiring the entertainment giant for $14  billion rather than proceeding with the originally proposed merger through a  stock swap.  </P> <P> If Time buys Warner for the proposed $70 a share, Ross stands to receive $180  million for his holdings in the company. That compares to the $125 million that  Ross stood to make under the earlier stock-swap deal.  </P> <P> The calculation emerged over the weekend as analysts more closely scrutinized  the deal. Separately, Time disclosed more information about deliberations in  the nine days leading up to the acquisition proposal that was prompted by  Paramount Communications' hostile bid to purchase Time.  </P> <P> Time and Warner first proposed a merger in early March that would create the  world's largest media and entertainment company. Time owns such notable  magazines as People, Money and Sports Illustrated as well as the nation's  second largest cable television company and the Home Box Office pay-television  company. Warner owns cable TV systems in addition to its namesake motion  picture studio and the industry's most profitable recorded music business.  </P> <P> Warner spokesman Geoffrey W. Holmes confirmed the $180-million calculation for  Ross' holdings, but noted that Ross' annual compensation will be lower in the  years following the merger because the new deal requires Time to assume so much  debt. Ross and other top executives already had agreed to peg their bonuses to  the combined companies' pre-tax earnings, which is a sum derived after interest  payments.  </P> <P> If the new Time-Warner merger is completed, Ross probably will receive about  $80 million in a lump-sum payment, with the remaining $100 million paid out  over almost eight years, Holmes said. The Warner spokesman underscored the fact  that Ross' actual employment contract hasn't been changed.  </P> <P> In a document filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Time disclosed a  number of the options presented to its 12-member board before the directors  unanimously rejected Paramount's offer and voted to bid for Warner.  </P> <P> But just in case the merger with Warner is not consummated, Time has asked its  financial and legal advisers "to continue to explore the feasibility and  desirability of various . . . courses of action," including the options  outlined last week.  </P> <P> Those options ranged from a bid for Paramount, or certain other unidentified  companies, to various restructuring plans for Time itself. A financial  restructuring might include payment of a substantial dividend to Time  shareholders, or Time might repurchase its own shares. Yet another alternative  would be to place Time's businesses in a joint venture with a third party, the  document said.  </P> <P> Time also disclosed payment of $6 million each to its financial advisers, with  another $10 million payment due to each by Feb. 14, 1990. The two firms are  Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.  </P> <P> Time said in the filing that its 82%-owned cable TV company, American  Television and Communications Corp., filed suit Friday against Paramount in  Connecticut. The cable TV company alleged that it might be forced to breach  some of its cable franchising and financial agreements if Paramount completes  its tender offer for Time before obtaining certain governmental approvals.  </P></p>

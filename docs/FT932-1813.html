			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Danka takes first step into Europe with Pounds 9m buy DANKA Business Systems, the acquisitive US-based office equipment supplier quoted in London, yesterday announced its first move into Europe with the Pounds 9m purchase of a private UK copier company. Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the purchase of Saint Group marked the beginning of an acquisition campaign in the UK. 'Now is the right time to unfold our strategy of seizing fragmented markets,' he said. 'I believe the opportunities in the UK are very exciting.' Although Mr Doyle said in May that Danka would fund purchases through cash flow and recently increased banking facilities, the latest acquisition will be paid for with the issue of 1.1m shares and cash of Pounds 498,000. The vendors of Saint, who will have some 3 per cent of the enlarged company, have agreed to retain more than 90 per cent of their shares for an unspecified time. Mr Martin St Quinton, Saint's majority owner, has also entered into a three-year employment contract to run Danka UK, as Saint will now be called. Saint, which distributes Canon, NEC, Konica, and Risograph equipment, reported pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 752,000 on sales of Pounds 13m. The group claims net assets of Pounds 1.3m. Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, Danka's chairman, said he expected Saint's profits contribution to be significantly higher in the current year, due to the disposal of two loss-making businesses before being taken over.</p>

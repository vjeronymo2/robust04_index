			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL MAY GET LOW NIELSEN RATINGS  </P> <P> Preliminary TV ratings showed that the Super Bowl averaged a 38.9 rating in 23  cities, A. C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed today.  </P> <P> Michael Eisenberg, a CBS vice president for research, said his network expects  the ratings to rise to 43.5 when national estimates are available Tuesday. Each  national ratings point represents 921,000 homes.  </P> <P> If the national ratings don't appreciably rise from the 23-city "overnight"  figures, Sunday's contest could prove the lowest-rated Super Bowl since 1971,  when Baltimore beat Dallas 16-13.  </P></p>

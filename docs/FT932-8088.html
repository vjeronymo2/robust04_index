			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Equipment group sells Kango to Atlas Copco DOBSON Park Industries, the UK mining equipment and industrial group, is withdrawing from the highly competitive power tool industry with the sale of its loss-making demolition hammer operation, Kango, for Pounds 7.8m. Atlas Copco, the Swedish tools manufacturer, is to buy the Kango name and business, while High Speed Production, a private UK company, has agreed to purchase the division's machining and assembly operations. High Speed will then manufacture Kango product for Atlas. Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson's chairman, said Dobson had decided it could not compete against international giants such as Bosch of Germany. 'The scale of the people we were trying to compete with makes it difficult to keep up with the technology,' he said. 'Kango's potential will best be realised as part of a larger group within the power tools business.' Kango, which just four years ago returned pre-interest profits of Pounds 2.5m, has suffered from the sharp downturn in the global construction industry. Last year it incurred losses of Pounds 600,000. Dobson has been under pressure in other areas of its business and recently agreed to put its mining equipment division into a joint venture with a main rival to weather the UK coal crisis. For Atlas Copco, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, Kango represents another step towards its goal of increasing its presence in electric tools. Dobson will receive Pounds 6.5m in cash upon completion, with the remaining Pounds 1.3m payable within one year.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Tokyo): Nikkei gains 2% on government pledges Concerted efforts by government ministers pledging economic measures to help the weak economy boosted confidence, and the Nikkei average, which plunged to a year's low on Monday, advanced 2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, which has suffered heavy selling from arbitrageurs, dealers, corporations and banks during the past month, regained 327.83 at 16,406.54, after a day's range of 16,004.00 and 16,505.15. The Topix index of all first section stocks, which dropped 5.2 per cent in the previous session, improved 23.58, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,374.06. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.94 to 1,113.79. Volume totalled 320m shares, against 372m on Monday, while advances led declines by 691 to 323, with 101 issues unchanged. The 225-issue Nikkei average has lost 18 per cent since October 26, when the government listed East Japan Railway, the direct catalyst for the fall. The stock yesterday picked up by Y15,000 to Y415,000. Selling accelerated last week when investors took their cue from bad interim earnings figures at the country's leading banks. Renewed fears over the stability of the financial system emerged, as 11 commercial banks posted a 22.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year to September, while long term credit banks reported a 10.1 per cent decline. The total of bad loans reached Y13,800bn at 21 leading banks, up 7.7 per cent from last March. A fall in bank prices fuelled fears over a freefall in stock prices, since a sharp retreat in the banking sector heralded the stock market's plunge in August last year, when the Nikkei hit a six-year low of 14,309.41. The banking index has dropped 14.7 per cent over the past week, while leading banks such as Industrial Bank of Japan have lost 16.9 per cent. Investors still fear that a repeat of last year's fall would severely damage business confidence, as Japanese companies, including banks, heavily rely on unrealised profits on shareholdings as a buffer against weak profits. Government ministers yesterday tried to ease the alarm, by addressing the stock market's weakness, and stressing the need for stimulatory measures. While ministers said they would not directly intervene in the market to shore up prices, they pledged to boost the economy. Ms Manae Kubota, director general for the economic planning agency, said the economy needed an expansionary budget and tax cuts, while Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said he was ready to take further monetary action if the real economy demanded. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, and Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, met to discuss measures to strengthen the economy. While no concrete plans were announced, the two ministers said the government would consider easing the burden of land transfer taxes and increase tax breaks for land deals. In spite of the calls from leading ministers, investors remain cautious over the stock market's direction. The weak economy, worsening corporate profits, and the absence of public funds, which lifted the market from its lows earlier this year, mean that investors have little reason to buy. Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley, expects the market to fall at least to last year's low, and even to the Nikkei 12,000 level, if the government fails to implement economic stimulus. Data released yesterday further deepened prevailing gloom over an economic recovery. Industrial output fell 5.1 per cent from the previous month in October, the sharpest drop on record, while the country's unemployment rate rose to 2.7 per cent in October, the highest for nearly six years. Analysts believe that a combination of an income tax reduction, further monetary easing, and government aid for the banks, is crucial for a market recovery. However, even if the government manages to formulate such measures, implementation is likely to be early next year. Investors will need to wait until the political reform bill passes through the upper house during this parliamentary session, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will finally be ready to make decisions over the economy. Among individual stocks, export-orientated companies performed well, as the yen settled at its lowest level against the dollar in four months. Hitachi rose Y26 to Y768, Toshiba Y55 to Y655, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y60 to Y1,360, NEC Y12 to Y774, and Fujitsu Y32 to Y722. In the car sector, Toyota Motor strengthened Y110 to Y1,640, Nissan Motor Y22 to Y605 and Honda Motor Y30 to Y1,370.</p>

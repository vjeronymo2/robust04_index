			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The chairman of the main  opposition Democratic Party (DP), upon returning from a visit to  the United States, claimed Monday that he had achieved a great  deal in his talks with American Government leaders.    DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek also expressed sympathy and  understanding for the government for having to deal with U.S.  foreign policy which, he said, puts its own national interests  ahead of all other considerations.    Yi evaluated the results of his visit to Washington after  returning home Monday, cutting short his U.S. itinerary because  of the abrupt resignation last Friday of Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang.    "Through my talks with American personalities, both in and  out of the government, on the North Korean nuclear row and the  Uruguay Round, I am convinced that our party could carry through  its positions on these issues," Yi said.    The DP opposes sanctions against North Korea and rejects the  Uruguay Round trade agreement. The party has vowed to block  ratification of the UR accord at the National Assembly.    "At the same time, I could feel acutely how difficult it  would be to conduct diplomacy against (U.S.) foreign policy that  erects a high barrier that is called the national interest," he  said.    "I realized what kind of steel wall our government officials  have to face (in diplomatic negotiations) in defense of our own  national interest," he added.    The DP chairman defined Yi Hoe-chang's resignation as "a  national crisis," and said that the country should form either  "a pan- national crisis management council" or "a national  coalition cabinet."    He said his party, however, has no intention of taking  advantage of the current crisis for political purposes. The  opposition party is prepared to work together with the ruling  party to overcome the present difficulties, he said.</p>

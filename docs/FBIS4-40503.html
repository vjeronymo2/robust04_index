			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol to Supreme Council </F> in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed chairman, esteemed president, esteemed  people's deputies, esteemed citizens of Ukraine! First of all,  I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all those  people's deputies of Ukraine who supported me and voted to elect  me to this honorable and very responsible post of prime minister  of Ukraine. I would also like to thank those who did not vote  for me today, and I hope we can cooperate together. I regard  your considerable degree of support and trust as a pleasant sign  of a certain solidarity in the deputy corps, as a sincere desire  of the new Supreme Council deputies to unite in their  intentions, efforts and practical actions toward joint work on  solutions to acute economic problems facing our new independent  state. I am convinced that each of us sitting in this chamber  today is well aware that we are living and working in a time  difficult for our homeland, and that the top legislative body  and the government of the country are facing a huge  responsibility to strengthen its statehood, sovereignty, to  overcome the crisis in the economy, raise the living standards  and improve the people's well- being.    It would not be an overstatement to say that we are living  in  a historic time, a time of choice and resolute action in the  name of the Ukrainian people, in the name of the young  independent Ukrainian state. I would like to assure you,  esteemed people's deputies, in all frankness, that I am fully  aware of the complexity of the economic and political situation  in our country, and that I have a deep understanding of what a  tangible moral burden, what a huge responsibility I am  undertaking once I am elected prime minister of Ukraine.  [sentence as heard] I hope I will have enough strength and  experience to live up to your trust and the people's  understandable expectations and high hopes that we can stop the  country from sliding into an abyss and bring an improvement in  the lives of our people. Of course, the success of the  government that you have trusted me to head will considerably  depend on the individuals who agree to work there, their level  of competence and sense of responsibility. I would like it to  be a government of like-minded professionals who will pursue  modern economic views, stand firmly on a market platform, and  who will be guided in their practical work by Ukraine's national  interests, rather than their own, and will be beyond politics.  In my understanding, economics is the highest form of politics  for a government official of any level. At the same time, I  fully understand that the political factor, the atmosphere  around the government and society on the whole, must play an  extremely important role in creating proper conditions for the  revival of national economy and for its progress. In the past  few years, we have seen for ourselves, in our experience and  that of others, that deep economic reforms are impossible if  there is no national concord, civic unity, and an atmosphere of  understanding and full support for the government's economic  policy in the society.    On this premise, I would like to propose that all political  forces, millions working in various sectors of the national  economy and all citizens of Ukraine refrain for a while from any  destructive actions, by which I mean first of all strikes and  other forms of stoppages in the production. It is particularly  dangerous now in the coal industry and in the entire fuel and  energy complex. Of course, we are not going to live in some  conflict-free, totally peaceful society. But I am convinced  that even in today's extreme situation all misunderstandings and  contentious issues that may emerge can be solved in the course  of work, by studying all the circumstances and negotiating,  without resorting to extreme measures.    Our life and work will not be easy, because the crisis has  not passed but continues to deepen, and its worst consequences  are probably yet to come. We may be yet in store for an  explosion, but the government must do everything in its power to  minimize its socially negative consequences and prevent further  economic destabilization in the country. Moreover, the Cabinet  of Ministers, together with the parliament will take effective  steps toward gradual improvement of the people's living  standards, pay, pensions and social benefits. But all this will  be done together with the livening up of production and an  increase in the national income. Although the government will  give unconditional priority to the social sphere, I believe that  a change for the best in our life and stabilization of the  economy will not begin until a year or a year and a half from  now. I don't think we should make promises we cannot keep.    I have already said this, and I want to say again that we  must create a government with full powers, with a genuine  responsibility for the state of the economy. I proceed here  from the fact that the competence and efficiency of any  management structure primarily depends on how well the powers  and responsibilities vested in it accord with its practical  activities. There should be a clear and direct correlation. On  this basis, I support the provisions of the draft law on  amendments to the Constitution, which stipulates that the prime  minister of the country must be head of executive power,  personally accountable to the Supreme Council and the people for  the implementation of the laws, resolutions and economic  programs adopted and their social consequences.    We should say bluntly that today, with the existing split  and  duality in the executive power, our government does not have  this status, and it cannot help but affect its efficiency. We  must draw a clear and rational line between the functions and  responsibilities of representative and executive bodies, of the  center and the regions, giving local authorities powers to  resolve all issues concerning local life, provided that they  unconditionally support the overall state interests and preserve  Ukraine's territorial integrity. We are in great need of a  flexible and effective vertical power structure, without which a  state cannot exist. We have certain intentions to that effect,  and I hope that our parliament will come to an agreement on this  important issue and will pass relevant laws. Using its right  to initiate legislation, the government will be active in  creating a reliable legal basis and preparing laws necessary to  accelerate economic and political reforms. We must make  relevant changes in some of the acting laws and as soon as  possible renounce outdated legal acts which are slowing down the  recovery of our economy and society on the whole. Undoubtedly,  I am counting on joint constructive work with the parliament,  its commissions and people's deputies. Of course, in the current  situation, neither the government nor myself can count on any  chance of quiet work in comfortable offices. I am not even  thinking of that, but I do hope that the new Cabinet of  Ministers will be given a chance to work fruitfully, fulfill its  potential and do all in its power to improve our economic  situation. During this work, I will always be ready to consider  any anticrisis proposal from people's deputies, one which would  be well-grounded, backed up by relevant economic calculations  and offering positive consequences of its implementation. To  that end, the doors of the Cabinet of Ministers will be open to  anyone. But, on the contrary, I believe there is no need today  to queue to the prime minister's office to beg or snatch  something from the state treasury. Give us a chance to work,  and if there is any emergency, we will see you. There is almost  nothing left to hand out at the government level, and, moreover,  in the market conditions that we are adopting the functions and  powers of the government will be totally different.    In conclusion, esteemed people's deputies, allow me to  express again my sincere and deep gratitude to all of you for  the great deal of trust you have placed in me. Thank you for  your attention.</p>

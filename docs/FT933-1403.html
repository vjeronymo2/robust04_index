			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / LUI brokers diverted millions to Liechtenstein accounts: 'Mr Fixit' refused to co-operate with DTI inspectors - Founder and director acted with 'gross misconduct' MILLIONS of pounds in insurance premiums were wrongfully diverted to Liechtenstein accounts by brokers at the former London United Investments, according to a report by government inspectors published yesterday. The report into the activities of LUI and CR Driver and Co, a connected but privately owned underwriter, was by inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry. They concluded that at least three underwriters at the company were intended to benefit from the transfers, which had no insurance function whatsoever. Both companies are now in liquidation. The underwriters concerned are Mr Charles Driver, founder and controlling shareholder of CR Driver and chairman of LUI from 1982, Mr Henry Weavers, the chief underwriter at HS Weavers, an underwriting firm that became a subsidiary of LUI, and Mr Peter Wilson, a director of Driver and of LUI. Between 1970 and 1989 about Pounds 40m, allowing for exchange rate fluctuations, was diverted from Driver and Weavers to Liechtenstein and German companies. Many of these were controlled by Mr Graham Smith, the Liechtenstein-based underwriter at the heart of the DTI investigation. The report says that Mr Driver, Mr Stanley Mayhew, a director of Driver, Mr Weavers and Mr Wilson all dealt directly with Mr Smith. Mr Smith used a series of Liechtenstein and German companies to transfer Mr Weavers' reinsurance premiums through the bank account of a Liechtenstein anstaldt, or type of trust, in Vaduz called PAA. Reinsurance is the way that underwriters reduce exposure to potential losses by spreading the risk throughout the markets. Mr Smith, described in the report as a 'Mr Fixit', still lives in Liechtenstein. He refused to co-operate with the DTI inspectors. None of the Smith companies, said the report, carried out the essential functions normally associated with the role of an insurance broker. 'It is our view that the Smith companies were not genuine insurance or reinsurance brokers,' the inspectors said. They added: 'We can see no necessity or commercial reason for the use by Driver and the LUI group of the Smith companies. We believe that all such functions as the Smith companies performed could easily have been performed either by Driver or the LUI Group.' One of the first Liechtenstein companies used to receive money transfers - variously described as commissions, brokerage, shared commissions and administration fees - was Sarita. According to one witness, Sarita - set up by Mr Smith and Mr Driver - was used in a project to sell US cancer insurance policies in the UK and Argentina. This money has not been traced. The inspectors discovered a private account held by Mr Driver in Bermuda, which was also used by Mr Mayhew. The inspectors said that Mr Mayhew and Mr Driver acted with 'gross misconduct' in their use of the account. Mr Smith must have known, concluded the inspectors, that he was performing 'no genuine commercial function for Driver and the LUI group'. Both he and his wife, Isolde, they decided, were 'knowingly parties to the wrongful diversion of funds' from Driver, LUI and the Weavers stamp companies. 'The overwhelming probability is that they derived some financial benefit from those funds but we are unable to determine the extent,' said the inspectors. Mr Driver, a former underwriter at Alexander Howden, had 75 per cent of Driver's shares. He formed Weavers with Mr Weavers, an underwriter, in 1963 and became a director of LUI when it took over Weavers in 1971. In 1982 he became LUI's chairman. The inspectors said he was suffering poor health and had difficulties in recollection. 'Nevertheless,' they said, 'we are driven to the conclusion that on a number of essential issues he has not told us the truth.' The inspectors said that Mr Driver, a keen polo player, was clearly 'the boss' of the LUI Group and inspired awe and trepidation in employees. 'In our view it is inconceivable that the events chronicled in this report could in general terms have occurred behind his back and without his knowledge or approval,' the inspectors said. Mr Weavers, who went to live in Bermuda, was too ill to be interviewed at length by the inspectors and died this year. Mr Peter Wilson, who eventually became managing director of Weavers, helped conceal commission payments paid to Smith companies and Sarita, the report said. The board of LUI as a whole, excluding Mr Driver and Mr Wilson, are exonerated from criticism by the report, which said the problem arose when the business was facing a difficult future.

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXERCISE PREVENTS BONE LOSS -- IF ESTROGEN REMAINS NORMAL  </P> <P> Question: I am confused about the value of exercise in preventing bone loss for  women in their 20s and 30s. I must have read a thousand times that exercise can  help prevent bone loss. But I met a young woman who is in her late 20s who is a  marathoner, and she says that she's been told by her doctor that her bones are  getting thinner, and that she should consider cutting back on the amount of  running she does. How can exercise be both good and bad in relation to bone  loss?  </P> <P> Answer: In general, exercise is beneficial in helping prevent osteoporosis  (bone loss). However, young women who engage in very strenuous exercise  sometimes stop having their menstrual periods, and their estrogen levels are  low. These women may have a low bone density, which is probably associated with  their lower estrogen levels. Nevertheless, they generally have a higher bone  density than women who don't exercise and who don't have their periods.  </P></p>

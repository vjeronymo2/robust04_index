Ren Jianxin discussed bribery and embezzlement cases  involving Li Xiaoshi, former vice chairman of the State Science  and Technology Commission, and Shen Taifu, former president of  Beijing's Great Wall Scientific and Technological Industrial  Corporation of Machinery and Electronic Products, which had  aroused widespread concern in all segments of society. He said:  Li Xiaoshi abused his power to help Shen Taifu illegally  collect money in return for more than 52,000 yuan in bribes and  20,000 yuan in embezzled funds from the latter and his  colleagues. On 4 March this year, the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison  on several charges during first-instance trials. On the same  day, the same court, during first-instance trials, sentenced  Shen Taifu to death on several charges, including those of  raising funds illegally, such as embezzling 1 million yuan in  public funds in collaboration with his wife and misappropriating  2 million yuan in public funds by himself, as well as those of  offering 250,000 yuan in bribes. Following appeals by Li  Xiaoshi and Shen Taifu, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's  Court is currently conducting second-instance trials.    Speaking of a cigarette-smuggling case in Shandong's Rushan  City, Ren Jianxin said: Liu Qishan, former director of the  Rushan City Commerce Bureau in Shandong Province, and his  associates smuggled cigarettes worth a massive sum of money in  collusion with smugglers outside the national boundaries in  exceptionally serious circumstances, thereby causing an adverse  effect in society. On 15 February this year, the Weihai City  Intermediate People's Court in Shandong Province sentenced Liu  Qishan; Fan Zhanwu, former political commissar of the Weihai  City Border Defense Sub-Bureau; and Liu Ning, deputy director of  the sub-bureau's business section, to death on several charges,  including smuggling and bribery, during first-instance trials.  The same court also sentenced Wang Jianzhi, former secretary of  the Rushan city party committee, to death on several charges,  including bribery and perversion of the law for personal gain,  with two years' probation. The defendants have appealed to the  Shandong Provincial Higher People's Court, which is conducting  second-instance trials.    In his report, Zhang Siqing related how procuratorial organs  investigated and dealt with major and important cases, saying:  Fujian Province procuratorial organs solved a massive bribery  case involving the Power Industry Ministry's Minjiang  Engineering Bureau. The bureau director, four other bureau-level  cadres, and 10 division-level cadres abused their  project-contracting positions to demand and accept more than 3  million yuan in bribes. Last September, procuratorial organs in  Tieling City, Liaoning Province, solved a massive case of  embezzlement, bribery, misappropriation, and tax evasion  involving grain departments in Changtu County. Gui Bingquan,  director of the county grain bureau, his deputy Yang Maoyuan,  and other people abused their power to demand and accept bribes  and to jointly engage in graft while selling substandard  equipment to the county grain depot. Procuratorial organs  booked 43 people for investigation, decided to arrest 25 people,  and recovered and impounded 32 million yuan in ill-gotten money.    Zhang Siqing also related how procuratorial organs  investigated and dealt with judicial personnel whose actions  constituted crimes, saying: Guo Zhengmin, director of the  Guizhou Provincial Public Security Department, abused his power  to illegally authorize other people to process exit permits,  taking more than 100,000 yuan in bribes in the process. Chen  Zhiwen, procurator general of the Changping County Procuratorate  in Beijing City, misused his power to take more than 20,000 yuan  in bribes. Li Kaifu, member of the judicial committee and  president of a Hubei Provincial Higher Court criminal tribunal,  promised to win a reprieve for a death-row inmate in return for  10,000 yuan in bribes from the inmate's relatives. Zhang Siqing  said: Procuratorial organs investigated and sternly dealt with  crimes committed by such judicial personnel while enforcing the  law, thus safeguarding the dignity and fairness of state laws.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / GEC increases profits by 1% to Pounds 829m CANCELLATION of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) could have serious consequences for the General Electric Company's radar factories in Edinburgh, Lord Weinstock, managing director, warned yesterday after announcing a 1 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 829m last year. He said the company had not calculated how many jobs would be at risk, but GEC is planning to develop the EFA's radar on the basis that Germany may pull out of the project's production phase. Lord Weinstock was confident that Britain's other EFA partners - Italy and Spain - would develop a fighter regardless of the German decision. He said GEC's results vindicated its strategy of expansion in Europe through joint ventures with Alsthom of France (power engineering) and Siemens of Germany (telecommunications). GEC also has a joint venture with General Electric of the US in consumer appliances. Profits from continental Europe rose 32 per cent to Pounds 199m, offsetting a fall in UK profits from Pounds 428m to Pounds 393m. Operating profit rose 2 per cent to Pounds 702m for the year to March 31, on a Pounds 27m fall in turnover to Pounds 9.44bn, largely due to a strong performance from GEC-Alsthom. Improved profits from GEC's 50 per cent share in that venture helped profits in the power systems division rise 27 per cent to Pounds 157m. Operating profit at GPT, the telecommunications joint venture with Siemens, rose Pounds 2m to Pounds 127m on a 10 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 1.1bn. Better financial discipline at GPT also helped GEC's cash reserves rise sharply, from Pounds 528m to Pounds 876m. GEC has net cash of about Pounds 1.46bn. The consumer goods joint venture with GE raised operating profits by Pounds 3m to Pounds 21m. Turnover fell Pounds 3m to Pounds 268m. Profits at electronic systems, which mainly comprises Marconi, the defence electronics subsidiary, fell Pounds 9m to Pounds 260m. The Picker medical equipment business improved profits by Pounds 6m to Pounds 32m, but profits at the office equipment and printing division fell by Pounds 9m to Pounds 17m. The board is recommending a 5.2 per cent increase in the final dividend to 7.05p for a total of 9.6p (up from 9.25p). Earnings per share were unchanged at 18.6p.

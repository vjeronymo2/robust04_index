			<p>BFN     [Text] Pinar del Rio, Cuba, 15 Jun (PL) -- A gold mine,  with a production capability of approximately 500 kg a year, was  inaugurated in this western province with an initial yield of  100 grams of this precious mineral.    The Canadian-built facilities are located in the Castellanos  bed and use a system of zinc precipitation, which is widely used  in the international gold industry, to extract the mineral.    According to mining authorities, this mine opens new  possibilities for Cuba to diversify its economy. In addition to  Castellanos, Cuba has gold deposits in the Isle of Youth  (Delita), in the central province of Villa Clara (El Descanso),  and in the eastern provinces of Camaguey (Jobabo) and Holguin  (Aguas Claras).    The most promising of those gold deposits is the one located  in Delita. Experts have concluded, however, that this is where  gold extractions will be more difficult because the mineral is  accompanied by large amounts of arsenic, which is definitely an  undesirable element.    Cuba is divided into 37 areas for geological prospects. More  than 20 contracts have been signed with foreign investors,  particularly from Canada, for the exploration of solid minerals.</p>

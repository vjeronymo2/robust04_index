			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: African walkabout - On Safari / Travelling on foot is just one of many ways of seeing the bush The deep rumble made by one elephant talking to another is a sound which, once heard, is impossible to forget. I had come across it before, sitting on a high bank above the River Ruaha in Tanzania and looking down on an extended family group of elephants at sunset. Lit by the fiery orange of the last light of the day, they drank and browsed, played and greeted one another, totally relaxed and at peace. I had even had the privilege of feeling it during an elephant back safari in the Okavango Delta, for that rumble sends the whole body of the elephant quaking. But the biggest surprise came during a walk in Zambia when the same rumble reached me unexpectedly from just the other side of a dense thicket. We left the termite mound we were inspecting and withdrew quietly and quickly, keeping the elephants upwind and leaving them to their own devices. African safari companies are becoming increasingly bold and imaginative in the methods by which they encourage their clients to come close to wildlife and to appreciate their surroundings, rather than simply to concentrate on seeing and photographing the large or dangerous mammals. The use of open vehicles with a thin canopy and neither sides nor doors in southern Africa is a world away from the enclosed mini-buses employed in east Africa but an even more significant step forward, literally, is a walking safari. At first, forsaking a vehicle in the bush feels about as crazy as abandoning a life raft in the open sea. But there is no doubt that walking is one of the most exciting ways of enjoying the bush. You may not come away with the greatest photographs of larger animals, because they tend to be more wary of people on foot, but your appreciation of the smells, the space and simply the feel of the place will remain in the memory. Zambia has long been considered Africa's walking mecca, for this activity has been a major feature of safaris here for many years (try Twickers World). But the walking opportunities in other countries are growing rapidly as governments alter park rules to permit them and as safari guides gear themselves up to this new discipline. Richard Bonham (booked through Worldwide Journeys and Expeditions) guides walks in the Selous Game Reserve in southern Tanzania and it is possible that this opportunity will be extended to other parks in that country especially now that a regular air charter has been established - contact Wildlife Safari. Good walking is also available in Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Safari Consultants and Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris are among others who offer this opportunity. Alternatives to walking, which avoidmotors, are also growing in popularity. Horse-riding safaris, mainly for those who ride regularly, are available in Botswana, Kenya and South Africa. (Cazenove &amp; Loyd Safaris). You do not have to be a regular elephant rider to enjoy an elephant back safari in Botswana's Okavango Delta, though, and this experience, offered by Ker and Downey, enables visitors to experience the joys of travelling through the Delta aboard the mammalian equivalent of an all-terrain bus. There are new opportunities to watch gorillas in Uganda which has seen a regeneration of its tourist industry. Not only does it have gorillas, together with a range of other primates, but some of the most picturesque national parks in Africa and good walking in the Ruwenzori Mountains. Try Abercrombie and Kent, Twickers World and African Explorations. And then there are the opportunities available in the new South Africa. By the increasingly exacting standards of Western Europe, some safaris on offer here are quite dated. If you are looking for a single night in an air-conditioned safari camp, with game drives evening and morning during which you might experience, as I did, radio-linked drivers relentlessly pursuing the Big Five in order to provide you with a certificate and a free T-shirt, then Mala Mala is for you (Rattray Reserves). If, on the other hand, you are looking for rather more from your African experience - starlit nights in the bush, peaceful and unobtrusive game drives - and a good guide then you are probably looking for a tailor-made itinerary offered by many of the smaller operators such as African Explorations, Art of Travel and Safari Consultants. But what South Africa does offer, in greater measure than probably any other African country, is the chance of independent travel. With its excellent infra-structure, accommodation and services and with its amazingly rich variety of landscapes and wildlife, it is well worth investigating. Namibia, just over the border, is also an exciting destination for the independent traveller. Try Sunvil for a fly-drive and assistance with an itinerary. For the more rugged, Safari Drive will provide a fully equipped Land Rover, complete with all camping equipment including a tent pitched on the roofrack, to enable you to travel through Botswana and Zimbabwe on roads suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles. If independent travel is not for you, but you are looking for something special, there is a growing list of safari operators, such as Abercrombie &amp; Kent and Safari Consultants, who have wildlife tours led by specialists from Britain and Africa. Other safaris include those concentrating on photography or ornithology (try Hartley's Safaris) while Art of Travel provides the chance to take a painting and drawing and even a wildlife writing safari.

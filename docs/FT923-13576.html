			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Inquiry by SFO looks at share dealings THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is investigating share dealings in at least two quoted companies - Richmond Oil and Gas and Butte Mining. The inquiry, which follows a raid on the abandoned offices of Jersey accountants Bryant &amp; Co in April, is investigating transactions in Richmond Oil between the Pounds 21m public offer in June 1989 and the failed Pounds 31m rights issue of October 1990. It is believed early indications have raised the possibility of a share support scheme. Documents recovered in Jersey, half a tonne of which were brought back to the UK by investigators last week, could prompt an inquiry which may affect several natural resource companies, including Geevor and Globe Petroleum, formerly known as Far East Resources. Bryant &amp; Co appears to have been a 'significant staging post' for share irregularities, said a local investigator. Documents regarding Butte Mining were also discovered at Bryant &amp; Co. Butte has launched legal action claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 184m) from more than 70 former executives and advisers, including Bryant &amp; Co. Also named in the Butte litigation is Mr Clive Smith, the Midland's based entrepreneur with natural resources interests, who helped bring Richmond and Butte to the market. Mr Smith and his family interests held 11 per cent of Corporate Broking Services, the defunct broker which sponsored the Richmond float.</p>

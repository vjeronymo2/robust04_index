The action is the first taken under the force improvement  plan codenamed Yulgok, and it will set a precedent for other  weapons system development programs under the scheme, Ministry  officials said.    At a Yulgok Committee meeting last June, the Ministry  tentatively decided to use the Cosys-200k1 system developed by  Germany's Atlas Electronik Co. for the KDX. The decision was  opposed by some, however, who maintained that a British system  was better than the German one in terms of reliability and  performance.    The German and British suppliers then offered to cut their  prices, causing the Ministry to put off a final decision.    In view of the system's features, the KDX building process  and to ensure the success of the KDX program, the Ministry  recently decided to leave the decision up to the Navy, which  will operate the system to meet its tactical requirements, an  official said.    The Navy will select a system next month so that the KDX  program can be completed by 1998 as scheduled, he added.    Under the KDX program, a state-of-the-art tactical command  and fire control system will be developed at a cost of 151  billion won (188 million U.S. dollars) for use in the KDX, the  Navy's main warship in the 21st century.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Terminals, tunnels and high-speed trains (1) Sir, I am concerned to read the piece 'Waterloo terminal may be obsolete in six years' (March 29). You correctly quote our report in saying the journey to Waterloo would be longer by about 17 minutes than journeys from St Pancras/King's Cross. However, you are wrong to suggest that the savings over the old journey times will be negligible. As our report indicated, and I have repeated, there will still be a time benefit of about 15 minutes for Waterloo trains from use of the Union Railway compared with the best times which will be available next year. I am concerned that as a result you may have presented an unduly unfavourable view of the prospects for Waterloo International Terminal which can only be demotivating for those setting out to make it into an outstanding success in the next few years. John Prideaux, chairman, Union Railways, Euston House, 24 Eversholt Street, London NW1 1DZ</p>

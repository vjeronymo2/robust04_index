			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Airtours The problem facing Airtours this year was always going to be what it could produce by way of an encore. After lifting its profits four-fold and share price six-fold in 1991, as it picked over Mr Harry Goodman's collapsed International Leisure Group, Airtours has since been faced with the far harder task of expanding in a sticky market full of prickly competitors. Unsurprisingly, therefore, its shares have disappointed this year. Even after full-year profits growth of 33 per cent, Airtours' forward multiple continues to languish at less than nine. This summer's erosion of trading margins as a result of a flurry of discounting was certainly a potent reminder of one of the industry's nastier habits. Airtours can, however, count on the benefits from the Pickfords' integration and boasts cash in the bank to fund continued expansion of its travel agency arm. As a vertically-integrated operator, Airtours should be well-placed to pick up extra business as well as improve its utilisation levels, which are crucial for the industry's profitability. City sentiment may mellow as the travel industry matures and the regulatory authorities impose tougher financial straitjackets to the detriment of the fly-by-night merchants. Airtours' record of cautious management would certainly justify the benefit of the doubt; the industry's worrisome history, however, suggests investors are unlikely to be so charitable.</p>

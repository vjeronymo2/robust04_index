			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russian Representative Assembly has appealed to  the Russian and U.S. Presidents for help with ending the  continuing discrimination of Estonian inhabitants on the basis  of their citizenship. An aggressive nationalist policy aimed at  establishing a nation state, which manifests itself through a  well-considered system of legislative acts, is directed toward  ousting the Russian-language population from Estonia and brings  them humiliation and suffering. This is what the appeal adopted  at the session of the Representative Assembly's presidium on 18  January says.    The appeal states that over a third of permanent Estonian  residents have been declared to be foreigners; the principles of  the Human Right Declaration and the Convention on the  Elimination or Reduction of Statelessness have thereby been  ignored. The Representative Assembly notes that until now the  awarding of citizenship on the basis of one's free will has not  been decided, as had been envisaged in the agreement on the  foundations of interstate relations concluded between Estonia  and Russia on 12 January 1991, as well as the granting of  permits for permanent residence. This is what the  Representative Assembly's statement says.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Fiat workers' rethink saves investment: Car group set to go ahead with expansion plan at plant in south Italy Fiat, the Turin-based automotive group, is expected to go ahead with a L400bn (Pounds 156.6m) investment in its plant at Termoli in southern Italy following a volte face by the local workforce. Workers yesterday agreed to accept a new flexible working week at the plant, after rejecting the plan less than three weeks ago. Their spurning of the agreement led to threats by Fiat to pull out of the investment aimed at expanding engine-manufacturing capacity. Such a move would have lost 300 new jobs. The threat in an area with more than 20 per cent unemployment, and the risk that Fiat would switch new capacity elsewhere, including Poland, triggered a local outcry. It also dismayed the main trades union which had already negotiated the flexible working hours deal with Fiat management. Such was the outcry that the labour ministry was drawn in, along with national union leaders and local dignitaries. More importantly the dispute cast a spotlight on the problems, which have had a negative impact on investment projects, of introducing modern work practices in the south. The crux of the problem was that the 2,700-strong workforce had been working a five-day week while earning extra wages through overtime on Saturday. Fiat proposed to introduce a six-day week with Saturday-working but eliminating overtime. Although this meant expanded capacity at the plant, extra jobs and a more secure future, it also meant a cut of some L300,000 a month in lost overtime. The fear of losing this money turned a referendum into a simple issue of voting for higher pay for those in jobs while ignoring the broader issue of further investment and new employment. The national engineering union which negotiated the original deal was weak at the local level and unable to get across its point of view. During intense discussions after the vote on November 30, the workforce was won over and a show of hands was taken yesterday. This clears the way for Termoli to play an integral part in Fiat's plans to capitalise on the success of its latest model, the Punto, produced at the nearby plant of Melfi. As a result of the Melfi operation coming on stream last year, Fiat now has more automotive production facilities in the south than northern Italy. This new agreement could consolidate the trend.</p>

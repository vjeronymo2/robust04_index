			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden down 8% as caution unsettles sector WILSON BOWDEN restricted the fall in its pre-tax profit last year to just 8 per cent at Pounds 27.8m as it unveiled what is likely to be one of the better performances from housebuilders in the current reporting season. However, the group cautioned against optimism created by a rise in house sales since the end of last year. This has prompted some suggestions that the housing market may be starting to recover after almost four years of recession. Mr David Wilson, chairman, said that the modest improvement was being compared with a very depressed period in 1991, when sales were affected badly by the Gulf war. It could in no way be described as a recovery, he said. Purchasers' confidence remained fragile and was likely to be dented by the uncertainty caused by the election campaign. Sales had already started to drift back, said Mr Wilson. His comments sent the group's share price down 10p to 430p and caused other housebuilding and building materials stocks to fall. The decline from the previous year's Pounds 30.1m came on turnover ahead from Pounds 129.1 to Pounds 135.9m. The final dividend is increased to 6.2p for a total dividend of 8.7p (8.3p), covered almost 3 times by earnings which, after allowing for the effects of the Pounds 34m rights issue last March, fell from 28.6p to 24.5p. The total dividend on the enlarged share capital represents a 14 per cent increase. The housebuilding division increased profits from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 21.5m. It sold 1,324 homes last year - against 1,263 in 1990  - at an average price of Pounds 80,000, up from Pounds 78,500. Commercial property profits, however, fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 6.7m on sales virtually unchanged at Pounds 30m. At the end of the year the group had net cash of Pounds 7m compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 157m. Borrowings, however, are likely to rise this year as the group takes advantage of lower prices to purchase residential and commercial land. COMMENT The market paid more attention to comments about the fragility of confidence in the housing market than it did to the quality of Wilson Bowden's results. Despite its current reservations, the company is clearly positioning itself for a recovery. Borrowings have risen to about Pounds 20m and could approach Pounds 30m by the year end - representing gearing of about 20 per cent. The company's housing land bank last year increased from 6,200 plots to 7,900 plots with planning permission. The company also recently acquired the rights to a further 230 acres of commercial land. These purchases should stand it in good stead when demand does start to recover. Much of this potential, however, is already in the share price with a prospective p/e of 19.4 on prospective profits of Pounds 25.5m in 1992.</p>

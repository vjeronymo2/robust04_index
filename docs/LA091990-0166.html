			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HAIR HARASSES CRYSTAL GAYLE  </P> <P> Crystal Gayle may cut her famous ankle-length hair because it can be a pain in  the neck. Literally.  </P> <P> Pressure from her hair's extreme length gives her headaches and neck aches, the  country-western singing star said before performing with her sister, Loretta  Lynn, Tuesday at the Tulare County Fair.  </P> <P> It also takes an extraordinarily long time to wash and dry -- five hours before  her performance Tuesday. She lets her hair dry naturally instead of using an  electric blow-dryer.  </P> <P> "The worst part is combing it out," said the singer.  </P> <P> Her hair was down to the ground for her performance, but she had it up earlier  in the day for convenience.  </P> <P> "It was catching on every knob in the trailer," Gayle said. "It's like wearing  a gown."  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television Because Ireland produces such wonderful writers, the English view of the Irish aristocracy tends to come entirely from fiction. Perhaps Ireland really is full of the scions of ancient families, mad, fey and mounted on a big chestnut hunters. . . perhaps not. In Borderlines Hector MacDonnell, descended from the Earls of Antrim, meets other survivors of Ireland's once-great families, including Baron Kingsale, who lives in Somerset and is on the dole (7.30 BBC2). I know from letters (and the mailbag at Radio 4's 'Feedback') that there is an unfulfilled demand for television programmes of popular music; not pop or rock music, but ballads and arias and music from the shows. Perhaps Michael Ball will help fill the void. Made famous by Aspects Of Love', Ball begins a six part series on ITV at 8.30. By all accounts Roger And Me (9.00 C4) is an unusual movie. Director Michael Moore set out to meet Roger Smith, head of General Motors, when the company laid off 30,000 workers in Moore's home town. It has been variously described as dark, ironic, hilarious, and scathing. Moore calls it a 'docucomedy'.</p>

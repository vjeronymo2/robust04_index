			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Liu Guoguang by Xiao </F> Meng and He Dexue on 5 December 1993, place not given:  "Construct Solid Actors in the Socialist Market Economy--An  Interview With Professor Liu Guoguang, a Prominent Economist"]    [Text] As pointed out by the Third Plenum of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, it is necessary to establish a modern  enterprise system appropriate to a socialist market economy.  However, people's understandings of a modern enterprise system  are not very clear and uniform; in addition, people are also in  the process of exploring and studying some concrete ideas on the  establishment of a modern enterprise system. Therefore we  specially interviewed Professor Liu Guoguang, a prominent  economist, who participated in the drafting of the Decision on  the Several Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist  Market Economic System.    [Xiao and He] Enterprise reform has been going on for over  ten years in our country. Why was the idea of establishing a  modern enterprise system raised just now? Would you please  discuss the background involved.    [Liu] The Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee  formulated the basic framework of a socialist market economic  system, and a very important pillar and pivotal point is the  establishment of a modern enterprise system. As we all know, to  establish a socialist market economic system, it is first of all  necessary to have fully developed actors engaged in market  activities. And among various kinds of market actors,  enterprises are the most basic and important ones. Over the past  ten-odd years, while always situated at the center of our  country's economic structural reform, the reform of state-owned  enterprises has all along been one of the difficult problems  puzzling the reformers. As should be recognized, the reform of  state-owned enterprises has proceeded mainly in the direction of  expanding enterprise autonomy, and the approach used has been  one of "delegating power and giving away gains"; some progress  has been made, thereby providing some foundation for  enterprises' entry into the market. Nevertheless, up to now, the  reform measures concerning state-owned enterprises have not  deviated from the line of thought characterized by the idea of  "delegating power and giving away gains," neither have they  constituted breaking away from the confines of traditional  ideas--taking the initiative in actively proceeding with the  reform of the traditional enterprise system. Consequently such  problems besetting state-owned enterprises as the failure to  separate government from enterprises, the unclear property  rights relationships, enterprises' lack of the right to freely  enter the market, and soft financial-budget constraints have  remained unresolved throughout all these years. The "one-third  each" situation in which nationwide one-third of state-owned  enterprises are making losses, one-third potential losses, and  one-third profits means that the situation of low efficiency in  state-owned enterprises has not been fundamentally improved. The  economics community has been engaged in exploratory discussions  of the issue of the necessity to fundamentally reform the system  of state-owned enterprises, and has now reached rather unanimous  understandings, that is, that to further proceed with the reform  of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to resolve  deeper-level contradictions, turning from using the policy which  mainly entails "delegating power and giving away gains" into  carrying out enterprise system innovations which mainly include  clarifying property rights relationships. In other words it is  necessary to reform the form of embodiment of state ownership  and the ownership framework governing state-owned enterprises,  establishing an enterprise system of a new type which is mainly  based on the system of corporate legal entities. This is the  modern enterprise system clearly set forth in the Decision.    [Xiao and He] Many people have now put forward the concept  of  "turning entities into corporations." As we read not long ago,  when interviewed by a reporter of ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO, you  also said that it was necessary to establish the system of  corporate legal entities. What do you believe to be the main  characteristics of the corporate system as a modern enterprise  system?    [Liu] The corporate system is a modern enterprise system; it  is the product of prolonged development of modern market  economics and socialized large production, an achievement of  human civilization, and a part of mankind's common wealth. Since  we have decided to establish a socialist market economic system,  it is necessary to transform state-owned enterprises which  constitute such a large proportion of the national economy into  actors appropriate to a modern market economy. In my view,  turning entities into corporations is also the process of  transforming traditional state-owned enterprises. The corporate  system has the following several main characteristics: First,  property rights relationships are clear. It is thus possible to  achieve the separation of the investors' ownership rights from  the enterprise legal entities' property rights, so that  enterprises may become legal entities with civil law rights and  civil liability and actors in market competition, on the basis  of corporate properties formed by investments from enterprise  investors. Second, rights and responsibilities are clear. By  having legal entity properties, corporations would both acquire  effective independent management power, and have increased  responsibility, to investors, for their own profits and losses  and for preserving and increasing the values of assets. On the  one hand an investor enjoys the owner's rights on the basis of  the amount of capital he has invested in the enterprise,  including those relating to returns on assets, important  decisions, and the selection of enterprise managers, but does  not directly intervene in the enterprise' management activities;  on the other hand the investor assumes limited liability for  debts on the basis of the amount of invested capital when the  enterprise goes bankrupt. Third, there is a standardized  corporate governing structure, that is, that a balancing and  constraining mechanism which adjusts relationships among owners,  representatives of the legal entity, managers, and the employees  as a group will be established through the forming and  functioning of such corporate governing institutions as the  general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors, the  board of supervisors, and executive departments (management  departments). Fourth, the system is conducive to raising funds,  thereby presenting a good way to increase the scale of  production and to socialize capital. Having state-owned  enterprises turn into being based on the modern corporate system  will provide a foundation for severing the umbilical cords  linking up enterprises with government, rectifying the  relationships of property rights over state assets, and  achieving the transformation of state-owned enterprises'  mechanisms, and also increase the scope of fund raising, thereby  promoting the development of socialized large production.    [Xiao and He] What specific ideas do you have on  transforming  various enterprises in the various industries in our country  into corporations?    [Liu] In order to standardize corporations' governing  structure and operating mechanisms, it is obviously necessary to  diversify shareholding by having multiple shareholders. Overall,  this objective can be achieved through transforming entities  into multiple-shareholder corporations through issuing shares on  the basis of the existing assets of state-owned enterprises,  issuing additional shares on the basis of increases in their  assets, selling or transferring their shares, or forming joint  ventures. It is proper to determine the proportion of shares to  be held by the state in an differentiating and flexible manner  on the basis of such factors as the industries involved, the  distribution of shares, and the situation of the financial  market. More specifically, first, generally, practice sole state  ownership and adopt the corporate-system management approach  with regard to enterprises involving national security,  sophisticated technologies, and special products; transform such  enterprises into solely state-owned limited liability  corporations, do not set up the general meetings of  shareholders, and let the relevant agencies who have been  entrusted to manage and supervise the enterprises' state assets  send representatives to supervise the preserving and increasing  of the enterprises' state assets. Second, with regard to the  backbone enterprises in the basic and pillar industries, it is  proper to gradually transform the solely state-owned  corporations into state holding companies, so as to gather more  social funds to be invested in key industries; the proportion of  state-held shares should be determined by the position of the  relevant enterprise in the national economy and by the degree of  dispersion of the shares involved. Third, it is proper for the  state not to hold controlling shares but just some shares of  enterprises in ordinary competitive industries, and for the  state to carry out market operations in view of the financial  and fiscal situation, so as to invigorate state shareholding and  ensure the preserving and increasing of the value of state  assets. As should be noted, experience abroad shows that  excessive dispersion of corporate shares is prone to make  enterprises pay attention only to short-term returns but  disregard long-term development interests, and would also result  in the weakening of the constraining role in terms of providing  effective supervision of enterprise operations.    [Xiao and He] Some people worry that having state-owned  enterprises turn into being based on the modern corporate system  will inevitably weaken the leading role of the state sector  because of the diversification of shareholders, or even result  in a situation in which the relevant enterprises are in danger  of being privatized. What are your thoughts on this issue?    [Liu] I was going to discuss the issue of "privatization."  Not only do some people have worries in this respect, but even  more people believe that the idea of a modern enterprise system  is not clear enough, and that it would be better to adopt the  approach of privatization of state-owned enterprises. Or there  may be many people who, while not speaking out publicly, believe  in private that only "privatization" can save state-owned  enterprises. I believe that both views are slanted. Perhaps some  people would say that I am an eclectic, but this is not true.    In my articles published in 1989, I already explicitly  pointed out that it was no longer workable to continue to use  the old "delegating power and giving away gains" approach to  reforming state-owned enterprises, and that it was necessary to  transform and restructure the system of state ownership, so as  to resolve the aforementioned problems. Now I am even more  adamant in holding this view and have further developed my  understanding. In my view, through diversifying shareholders,  having state-owned enterprises turn into being based on the  modern corporate system can result in extensively gathering  social funds for industries needed to be developed by the  country, so as to make up for the insufficiency of state funds.  If only the state can maintain its position as the holder of  controlling shares in terms of the total amount of a  corporation's capital, the leading role of the state sector not  only will not be weakened, but will be strengthened, and the  impact of the state sector will also expand. In the process of  turning state-owned enterprises into corporations, while the  state will retain some shares, some shares (shares based on  existing assets or shares based on increases in assets) need to  be sold to legal entities or individuals. But this would do no  harm to state assets, neither should this be considered  "privatization." This development would constitute the change of  the form of state assets, turning shareholding into monetary  funds; the value remains in the hands of the state. Surely it is  necessary to emphasize here that in evaluating state assets in  the process of transforming state-owned enterprises into  corporations it is necessary to carefully inventory and evaluate  assets so as to prevent the phenomenon of state asset washout  caused by undervaluation of state assets. It is now clear that  the inactivity of state assets under the old system was not good  for preserving and increasing their value. Changes in the form  of state assets and the flow of state assets, as a factor of  production, are conducive to preserving and increasing their  value and to reinvigorating the economy.    On the other hand, I also have to point out that  privatization may not necessarily be a shortcut, and would  involve rather large difficulties and risks. In terms of  experience around the world, the lessons of unsuccessful  privatization in some transitional countries have begun to be  noticed.    [Xiao and He] If so, what do you believe to be the difficult  issues which need to be urgently considered in the initial stage  of the transformation of entities into corporations?    [Liu] In my view, in reforming state-owned enterprises, it  is  necessary to think about: Making clear who will preside over the  transformation of a state-owned enterprise on behalf of the  original owner; and making clear who will be the representative  of the state-held shares in the future corporation. Both issues  will lead to many specific operational problems, and are  therefore very complicated. It is necessary, I believe, to make  clear theoretically that the function of the state as the owner  of state assets and the political authority function of the  state as the social and economic regulator should be separated,  that is, that government and assets should be separated from  each other. Each status of the government has its different  purpose. If government and assets are not separated, then the  government's command signals sent to enterprises would tend to  be mutually contradictory and chaotic; nevertheless the  administrative command nature of those signals would tend to  make it difficult for enterprises to refuse to implement them.  Therefore the failure to separate government from assets and the  failure to separate government from enterprises are inherently  linked together. If the problem of government's remaining not  separated from assets is not resolved, then it would also be  difficult to achieve the separation of government from  enterprises. It is necessary to establish and strengthen the  authority institutions exclusively engaged in performing the  function of managing the ownership rights over state assets,  changing the preexisting situation in which state assets are  managed by multiple bodies but in which no one is actually  responsible for the assets. Otherwise the phenomenon of the  "absence of the owner" of state-owned enterprises will remain  unresolved. This is the most difficult problem in the current  efforts to reform state-owned enterprises. With regard to this  problem, the Decision states that "it is necessary to actively  explore the right form and way of managing state assets and of  conducting business operations based on state assets." The  statement is concise but comprehensive, giving reformers a large  space and room for manoeuver. In my view, the management of  state assets and business operations based on state assets  should also be separated. Agencies managing state assets perform  the function of administrative management of state assets. At  the same time, it is proper to consider having state-asset  management agencies authorize or entrust parent companies in  some large enterprise groups, investment companies, and large  enterprises capable of making the investments needed to get  controlling shares so that they may become holding companies,  performing the function of carrying out business operations  based on state assets within a certain scope. It is also proper  to establish some companies designed to engage in business  operations based on state assets, mainly those of small and  medium-sized enterprises and those in the form of value.  Currently, for transitional purposes, the state may entrust some  specialized economic agencies with the task of establishing  state-asset supervision agencies which will supervise the  subordinate enterprises with regard to the preserving and  increasing of the value of the enterprises' state assets. With  the dismantling of specialized economic agencies, those  supervisory agencies should also be gradually turned into  institutions carrying out business operations based on state  assets. The existing national general corporations in the  various sectors should be gradually transformed into several  enterprise group corporations and state-asset business  corporations of a holding-company nature, in accordance with the  requirements of the modern enterprise system. Currently the  situation of washout of state assets is serious. In turning  entities into corporations, it is all the more necessary to  adopt effective measures to prevent the situation where  asset-based shares are characterized by low prices and where  shares are sold at low prices or even given away free to  individuals. It is necessary to plug loopholes in all aspects so  as to ensure that state assets and the related rights and  interests are not encroached upon.    [Xiao and He] There exists now an argument that after  becoming corporations enterprises may acquire their own property  rights. What is you view?    [Liu] In this respect, I believe, there exists a  misunderstanding with regard to whether enterprises may hold  shares of their own enterprises. This issue should be clarified.  According to some comrades, after the "change from making  appropriations into giving loans," the assets formed on the  basis of state loans to enterprises after the repayment of debts  are no longer state investments but should belong to the  enterprises. Those assets should be considered the basis of  shares owned by enterprises themselves when shares are issued on  the basis of assets in the process of turning entities into  corporations. Our view should be that the ultimate ownership of  an enterprise's assets belongs to the investors, including the  state's ownership rights. Enterprises themselves have  legal-entity property rights formed on the basis of the  investments made by the ultimate investors. Whether the assets  involved are formed on the basis of profit retention under the  situation of enterprises' shouldering all responsibility for  their profits or losses or are enterprise assets after the  repayment of debts relating to the practice of changing from  giving appropriations into giving loans, ultimately the  properties belong to the original owners, assuming the form of  increases in the value of the stocks or increases in shares.  Enterprises may not hold their own shares. Allowing an  enterprise to hold "its own shares" would result in those  running business operations based on state assets violating the  rights of the owner, making it impossible to safeguard the  owner's rights. If the owner holds shares by itself in addition  to legal-entity property rights, then shareholding rights would  represent both legal-entity property rights and ultimate  ownership rights; as a result relationships between the owner  and the actor carrying out business operations based on the  assets involved will inevitably become disorderly, leading to a  situation where the interests of the actor carrying out business  operations based on the assets are promoted at the expense of  the interests of the owner. Such a situation will not meet the  requirements of a modern enterprise system. However they are  produced, all increases in assets are manifested as investors'  gains, and the right to returns on assets belongs entirely to  the investors. Surely in the process of development enterprises  need to provide drive-increasing incentives, but this issue is  resolved through incentive mechanisms such as the systems of  salaries and bonuses for management personnel and of wages and  bonuses for workers. With regard to enterprise employees'  holding a certain proportion of the shares of their enterprise,  such shareholding should be limited and should not exceed a  certain proportion. In order to develop, an enterprise needs to  have funds and has to retain profits and keep common purpose  funds, but the ultimate ownership rights involved belong to  investors. An enterprise may carry out independent operations  based on the shareholders' funds, and assume independent  responsibility for profits and losses. Successful operations  will be manifested as increases in the market value of the  shares held by investors. In such a situation new shares may  also be issued, but only to the existing investors instead of  the enterprise. An enterprise has legal-entity property rights,  and may control all the invested capital and carry out business  operations based on such capital; if the operations are  successful, the board of directors can reward and promote  management personnel; the management personnel who have  performed poorly will be dismissed. An enterprise may also make  investments; however it may only invest, as a legal entity, in  other enterprises and hold the shares of the enterprises  receiving the investments, but may not hold its own shares. This  misunderstanding should be eliminated; otherwise it can easily  lead to a situation where those carrying out business operations  based on assets encroach upon the rights of investors.    By the way, another misunderstanding should also be  eliminated. Some comrades believe that the basic content of the  transformation of entities into corporations is to have shares  embody property rights and to have corporations listed,  regarding the move as an expedient way to gather funds and  create new enterprises. The operating mechanisms of some listed  corporations remain as before. This situation does not meet the  requirements of the modern corporate system. According to  experience abroad, the number of corporations listed in  securities exchanges is very small; those corporations account  for only approximately 1-2 per thousand of the total number of  corporations. In the Western developed market-economy countries,  the stocks of most limited-liability joint-stock companies are  traded on trading markets outside the stock exchanges, and only  the stocks of a small number of large corporations are listed  and traded in securities exchanges. For instance, in the early  1980s only less than 2,000 of the approximately 2.5 million U.S.  companies are listed in securities exchanges. Thus this  misunderstanding has resulted in the distortion of stock market  behavior. As state-owned enterprises have not completed the  transformation into corporations in a standardized manner and as  their accounting and auditing systems are not fully developed,  the stock market has not only failed to perform a positive  function, but on the contrary has to some extent induced  excessive speculation and the "bubble" phenomenon. Such a  situation is not conducive to the effort to transform entities  into corporations. The chief goal of the effort to transform our  country's enterprises into corporations is to transform  mechanisms but not to gather funds. For a long time to come,  enterprises' main fund-gathering method should be based on  indirect fund gathering through banks, with direct fund  gathering on the securities market serving as a supplementary  means. Consequently, while it is proper to conduct active  experiments on limited-liability joint-stock companies listed on  the stock market, activities in this direction should not become  the focal point of our country's current effort to transform  entities into corporations.    [Xiao and He] It seems that the property rights system is  the  link most critical to establishing a modern enterprise system.  Is this your view?    [Liu] I do not believe that it is proper to have such a  simplistic understanding of the issue. Transforming state-owned  enterprises into modern legal-entity enterprises based on the  corporate system is a very complicated and difficult process.  Rectifying property rights relationships is surely a critical  link of the reform of state-owned enterprises, but many other  problems currently besetting state-owned enterprises cannot be  resolved through rectifying property rights relationships; on  the other hand, if those problems are not resolved, it would be  difficult to proceed with the rectification of property rights  relationships in a successful manner. It can be said that the  problems can be resolved only through adopting relevant  comprehensive and mutually supportive policy measures and reform  measures. Those problems include: State-owned enterprises' heavy  tax burdens, a serious situation of unauthorized fund gathering,  unauthorized levies, and unauthorized fees, growing burdens  created by enterprises' retirees and surplus personnel, and  enterprises' burdens caused by their role in providing various  social-welfare services. For example, some people have suggested  the use of the method of share-debt transformation for resolving  problems such as those of how to get rid of the enterprises'  historical burdens, how to shed the enterprises' burdens  resulting from their role in providing social services, and how  to resolve the widespread problem of debt burdens in state-owned  enterprises. It is necessary to study whether such a suggestion  is feasible.    [Xiao and He] You suggest that social security matters be  removed from the enterprise system, that state-asset holding  companies be established, that reforms of the taxation system  and the financial system be also carried out, etc. Would such  measures not make the reform of state-owned enterprises have too  widespread implications? Would people not be unwilling to wait  for such a comprehensive reform, resulting in a failure to carry  out the reform?    [Liu] The reform of state-owned enterprises is certainly a  very difficult reform. There is no doubt about that. Anyone  saying that the state-owned enterprises with thousands of  billions of yuan in assets can easily turn into being based on a  true modern corporate system is, I believe, being irresponsible.  With regard to some reforms such as the reform of the fiscal and  taxation system, the separate taxation system used by market  economy countries provides ready experience, and it would be  fine to just proceed on the basis of referring to the  experience; of course it is necessary to proceed in a way in  line with our country's realities. The situation is the same  with the reform of the financial system. The central bank's task  is to control money, maintaining stability and formulating a  right interest-rate policy and policies on open market  operations, but should not engage in commercial operations. To  commercialize specialized banks, it is necessary to separate the  policy nature from the commercial nature. These macroeconomic  regulation and control measures do not involve the issue of  ownership to a great extent, and there exists ready experience  to be referred to. But when the issue of transforming the  ownership system is involved, what is at stake is something  essential to socialism, that is, the leading role of public  ownership. If we are unable to successfully restructure the  state-owned enterprises' ownership framework and if we,  following fashionable ideas, let some people use a "deceptive"  approach to turn the enormous amount of state assets into  private assets in a "deceptive" manner, injustice and corruption  will become rampant across society. If such a method of cryptic  transition is used, powerful people and swindlers will become  very rich, whereas honest people and ordinary people will become  very poor. Such a society is sure to be unstable, and political  turbulence will be unavoidable. In such circumstances, what  socialist market economic system is there to speak of!    We should fully understand the difficult nature of the  reform  of state-owned enterprises. For not only does the transformation  of entities into corporations itself have widespread  implications, but the standardized operational designs of the  corporate system themselves will encounter the issue of  contrasting and competition among various interest  relationships. Past reform measures were mostly the product of  "one on one" bargaining; as a result contradictions and  conflicts among different interests were often alleviated or  delayed. But if all of the state's properties are to be  redistributed, dodging interest contradictions might not work.  Nevertheless, in any case the decision made by the Third Plenum  of the 14th CPC Central Committee has described in a theoretical  manner the contour and direction of the reform of state-owned  enterprises in our country. An economist's responsibility should  be to make more people understand what a modern enterprise  system is so as to prevent the occurrence of the "deception"  situation, and produce a rational, orderly, thorough, and  feasible operational plan on the reform which turns entities  into corporations, so as to produce a good foundation for the  first-step reform, thereby creating conditions for further  reform steps. Only in this way will we be able to accomplish the  transition from traditional enterprises to the modern corporate  system and to successfully reform state-owned enterprises at low  costs.</p>

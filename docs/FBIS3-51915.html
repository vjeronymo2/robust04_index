In a letter sent to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali,  Conaie, which comprises the Indian communities of Ecuador,  indicated that the uprising in Chiapas "is not an isolated  incident but, rather, a social response to the prevailing  conditions of poverty" extant in Latin America. Conaie said it  is calling on the high-ranking international official to "in  human terms" intervene in Mexico to help put an end to the  abuses committed by against Indians in Ecuador.    The communique adds that it is the UN's "moral and political  obligation" to guarantee the lives of the Indians in some way,  because they are the "victims of the ferocious genocidal war  waged by the Mexican Army."    It adds: "It cannot be possible that instead of providing  human solutions to centuries of suffering, entire communities  are being bombed."    The communique also says: "Measures such as declaring an  amnesty or calling for a dialogue are insignificant in the  solution of this dramatic situation if the economic interests of  the dominant classes are not set aside."    According to Conaie, the events in Chiapas "are not promoted  by a guerrilla group," but are "social reactions that should  make all governments on the continent reflect about the need to  review and change their neoliberal models."</p>

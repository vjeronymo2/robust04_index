			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Membership of unions down 5.6% Union membership in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1946 with only 31 per cent of employed workers belonging to a union. Figures issued yesterday by the Department of Employment show that total membership declined 5.6 per cent by the end of 1992 to 9m. Since the Tory election victory in 1979, the number of workers in unions had dropped by 4.2m. It is estimated that 35 per cent of the total labour force was unionised by the autumn of last year. Thirty-eight per cent of men are in unions compared with 31 per cent of women. While 63 per cent of public-sector workers are in unions, the figure is only 23 per cent in the private sector. There has been a steep drop in unionisation in the water industry since privatisation. Since spring 1989 membership has dropped 22 per cent, mainly because of a sharp drop in white-collar unionisation. The Department of Employment also released final labour dispute figures for 1993. Some 600,000 working days were lost, nearly half of which were in the public services. This is the second-lowest total since records began in 1891. There were 211 separate stoppages.

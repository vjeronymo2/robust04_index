			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Arnaldo Leite Pereira, the chief  of the Armed Forces Staff, yesterday confirmed that the military  opposed Article 74 of the amendment that creates the Social  Emergency Fund, and that they had pressured to have it rejected.  Leite said that, if approved, the article would have caused  "great damage to the military," whose salaries would have been  frozen, without any increases up until 1995. In light of the  pressure, the government and the parties yesterday excluded the  measure from the amendment.    Article 74 set forth that expenses for payment of public  servants' salaries in 1994 and 1995, on a monthly basis, may not  surpass the expenses incurred last year, plus monetary  correction. The article added that if monthly personnel expenses  surpass the level of spending of the same month in 1993, salary  revisions, adjustments, or improvements -- that increase total  expenses within each branch of government -- will be vetoed  until the spending level is recovered.    Leite said he sent a fax to 40 or 50 lawmakers asking that  the article be rejected. The article was drawn up by PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Rio Grande do  Sul Luiz Roberto Ponte. Leite explained that before sending the  fax messages he consulted with President Itamar Franco. The  chief of staff claimed that the article dealt with a matter that  may not be included in temporary constitutional provisions. He  said that the military pressure was "legitimate and democratic."    Article 74 was approved by the Chamber subcommittee that  studied the fiscal adjustment, and was included in the amendment  that creates the Fund by PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul  Nelson Jobim, the coordinator of the constitutional revision.  Ponte estimated that this year the government has to cut  approximately $1 billion in salary expenses. The budget provided  for $24 billion in salary expenses. After the cut, salary  expenses would have stood at $23 billion.    The government also agreed to exclude Article 75 of the  amendment, which authorized the executive branch to unilaterally  reduce the budget if revenues did not prove to be enough to  cover expenses. This measure was considered as a safeguard of  the stabilization program, because in practice it compelled the  government to spend only what it could collect. "This article  reduced the power of Congress," PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]  Deputy for Sao Paulo Delfim Netto said. "The budget can be  changed only through a law, and this is the essence of  democracy," he added.</p>

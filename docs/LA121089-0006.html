			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING SENSE OF MAUREEN;  </P> <P> THE CURIOUS POLITICS OF SAN DIEGO'S MAYOR O'CONNOR  </P> <P> SHE HAD MASTERED the Soviet bureaucracy, defied her critics at home, and now,  at the pinnacle of her political career, San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor would  have to take on Mother Nature as well.  </P> <P> More than 60,000 people were jammed into the city's beloved Balboa Park for  "Super Powers Sunday," the opening ceremony of the three-week Soviet arts  festival to which O'Connor had devoted the past 16 months. Crushed together in  the park's open-air Spreckels Organ Pavilion on a late October day, thousands  anxiously awaited the start of the ceremony as colorfully costumed children  joined O'Connor and a troupe of Soviet Georgian dancers on stage.  </P> <P> And then it started to rain. The mayor's audience headed for cover.  </P> <P> "Please, these people have come all the way from Tbilisi to dance for you,"  O'Connor implored, shielding herself from the rain with a festival program. "I  don't care if it's raining; it's shining on San Diego!"  </P> <P> As if on cue, the drizzle stopped. Within the hour, the sun was out, and for  the rest of Super Powers Sunday, the skies were as bright as O'Connor's beaming  face.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, the mayor basked in the kind of public adoration that is  the stuff of a politician's dreams. At some of the Balboa Park sites, where  Soviet dancers and singers performed for thousands, O'Connor herself drew  rousing ovations. Scores of San Diegans approached her entourage to pose for  pictures or ask for autographs. Others shouted praise: "It's a great party,  Maureen."  </P> <P> In the end, that's all it was.  </P> <P> That O'Connor considers the $6-million arts extravaganza the triumph of her  curious 3 1/2 years in office speaks volumes about the woman who in less than  two decades has risen from high school gym teacher to first female mayor of  America's sixth-largest city. The festival posed the essential question  skeptics have raised throughout O'Connor's mayoralty: Why doesn't she bring the  same planning, dedication and hands-on approach to the city's long-term  problems that she devoted to assembling the world's largest public showing of  Faberge Imperial Eggs?  </P> <P> Frequently absent from the chambers of government while she served as virtual  executive producer of the festival, the 43-year-old mayor has only sporadically  functioned as the city's leader. When the festival ended Nov. 12, the homeless  were still sleeping in Balboa Park canyons near the exhibition areas. San  Diego's roads remained choked, its library and sewer system antiquated and  inadequate. Despite recent staffing increases, the city's police force was  still undermanned in the face of crack cocaine traffic and street-gang warfare.  Its trash-disposal crisis was mounting. It was no closer to finding a  substitute for its crowded and dangerous airport.  </P> <P> Clearly, O'Connor inherited most of the urban ills that confront San Diego --  crises that are similar to those facing every rapidly growing city. But  sometimes it seems she is running an increasingly complex metropolis as if it  were still the small city of her youth.  </P> <P> "Maureen O'Connor is a risk-averse politician," says Steven Erie, a UC San  Diego political scientist who has tracked O'Connor's career. "She's so  incredibly cautious, so unwilling to take bold steps that, at best, she  provides a reactive style of leadership. You don't get any sense of the  direction in which she'd like to take the city, or whether she even knows. What  we're left with is essentially a caretaker administration."  </P> <P> O'Connor has heard it all before, particularly during the past two years, as  the festival grew from a casual conversation with a Soviet culture official in  Scotland to a major spectacle. "Let's just take a minute to remember what San  Diego was like before Maureen O'Connor became mayor," O'Connor snapped when  asked about these criticisms in a recent interview. "When I came in office  three years ago, this place was a mess. The (previous) mayor had just been  convicted of a felony, there was a councilman under indictment, a Housing  Commission scandal, the city manager and council weren't working together, we  had a police department at odds with the city, problems like sewage, crime.  </P> <P> "Every single issue that was waiting on my plate has been improved. Critics  might say we're only 50% or 75% of the way there, but they can't deny the  progress that's been made. This city's working again."  </P> <P> O'Connor's effect has been felt both inside and outside City Hall, though often  in ways difficult to record on a score card. Although political insiders  quibble over whether the mayor lost this vote or dropped the ball on that  issue, she is widely credited with returning integrity to a City Hall racked by  turmoil.  </P> <P> "She's restored people's faith in city government, which is no small thing,"  says Louis Wolfsheimer, a land-use attorney and longtime O'Connor confidant.  "As far as issues, she's identified the problems, knows what needs to be done  and is moving the city ahead."  </P> <P> Others are not nearly so charitable. In an anonymous survey of City Hall  lobbyists, reporters and government staffers taken in February by the San Diego  Report, a monthly political newsletter, O'Connor placed last in overall  performance among the nine council members. She ranked seventh in  effectiveness, eighth in intelligence and quality of staff, and last in  accessibility.  </P> <P> Most often, she is criticized for abdicating responsibility on major issues,  for lacking vision, for failing to display the leadership that her position  demands.  </P> <P> As mayor, O'Connor's "not one of the boys anymore," says county Supervisor  Brian Bilbray, a frequent critic. "People are expecting you to stand up and be  heard. You either do that, or you don't take on a position of leadership."  </P> <P> STREET SMARTS  </P> <P> MAUREEN O'CONNOR IS wandering around Balboa Park, pressing the flesh of the  faithful who have come to celebrate her finest hour. She is in her element. She  is with her people. She is on the street.  </P> <P> Dressed in a tapered gray jacket with the oversized, padded shoulders she  favors, O'Connor strolls arm-in-arm with Mikhail Gribanov, the Soviet acting  minister of culture, and his entourage.  </P> <P> To the Soviets, who are not accustomed to a woman mayor or one so young, the  constant displays of public affection for O'Connor are clearly intriguing.  "Everyone's calling you by your first name, which is fascinating," remarks an  interpreter. "This is quite amazing."  </P> <P> "Oh, they all call me 'Maureen,' " the mayor replies breezily, breaking into a  broad grin. "That's how I'm known here. That's why they call me 'the street  mayor.' "  </P> <P> Say what they will about O'Connor's performance in office, even her critics do  not deny that she is genuinely popular on San Diego's streets. A Democrat in a  city long controlled by a Republican old-boy network and a slow-growth advocate  among the wealthy builders who have dominated the political landscape, O'Connor  has charmed San Diego with her schoolgirl style and from-the-heart  pronouncements since she was elected a city councilwoman.  </P> <P> "She's not one of these politicians who puts a wall up between her and the  people," said Georgia Tarwater, a festival volunteer from La Jolla, as she  watched O'Connor, attired in black jeans, boots, a purple cowboy hat and  matching scarf, dance at a Western-theme barbecue during the arts festival.  "Her sense of caring is genuine and comes across that way. That's what makes  her so approachable."  </P> <P> "People perceive her as being a San Diegan, which in this town is critical,"  says Mark Nelson, former executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn.  "People perceive her as being part of San Diego."  </P> <P> Raised in a lower-middle-class San Diego home, the daughter of a  convenience-store owner and part-time bookie, O'Connor became a  multimillionaire in 1977 when she married Jack in the Box restaurant-chain  founder Robert O. Peterson, a man 30 years her senior. Although she now lives  in a Spanish-style Point Loma mansion with a bay view, O'Connor never forgets  that the Mission Hills home of her childhood sometimes went unheated. "At  night," she recalls, "when it was really cold and you had your blanket on, you  might wake up and find it gone because someone had come in and taken it. So you  learned how to sleep with your blanket between your knees for protection."  </P> <P> O'Connor and her twin sister, Mavourneen, were born July 14, 1946, the seventh  and eighth of the 13 children of Jerome and Frances O'Connor. O'Connor  remembers her childhood as "a pretty no-frills life." Dining out and going to  movies were rarities, and only the children's parochial-school uniforms  disguised their lack of clothing. One year, when the family could not afford a  Thanksgiving turkey, one of O'Connor's brothers molded a bird from hamburger.  </P> <P> An average student known more for her sense of humor than her scholarship, the  future mayor's entry into politics was delayed when Rosary High nuns, who found  her too feisty, barred her from running for student body president. Instead,  O'Connor helped Mavourneen get elected to the post. Maureen graduated in 1964  and attended San Diego State University, earning a bachelor's degree with a  triple major in recreation, psychology and sociology in 1970.  </P> <P> With her parents and most of her siblings still living in San Diego, the  O'Connor family is extremely close, despite the split between what O'Connor  describes as her "Archie Bunker brothers" and "liberal sisters."  </P> <P> She credits her parents for her public-service career. By the time O'Connor was  a teen-ager, she and her six sisters had become accomplished precision and  rough-water swimmers, touring the country in 1964 as the "Swimming O'Connor  Sisters," part of a traveling show called "The Wonderful World of Sport."  O'Connor's mother, a nurse, introduced her children to community service by  having them give swimming lessons to multiple sclerosis patients.  </P> <P> "At a very young age, you had a sense of being responsible for someone other  than yourself, of working for the good of the group," O'Connor recalls. "Public  service is a natural outgrowth of that."  </P> <P> In 1971, after O'Connor had started teaching physical education at Rosary High,  she went to City Hall to complain about the treatment a troupe of  Mexican-Indian performers had received during a city celebration. When she got  the runaround, she resolved to run for office, more out of a desire to teach  her students a civics lesson than out of ambition.  </P> <P> Later that year, O'Connor and her twin sister, guided by a borrowed library  book on political campaigning, called a news conference to announce that  O'Connor would make a long-shot run for City Council. She likes to tell the  story of how, at the appointed hour, the gym was crammed with her partisans,  mostly students and nuns.  </P> <P> Only the media failed to show.  </P> <P> Despite that inauspicious beginning, the lightly regarded candidate went on to  score a stunning upset on a shoestring budget, aided by hundreds of Rosary High  student volunteers dubbed "the Maureen Corps." After qualifying for the  two-candidate council runoff, O'Connor became, at 25, the youngest person ever  elected to the San Diego City Council.  </P> <P> She served for eight years, becoming a member of then-Mayor Pete Wilson's inner  circle and a protege of his despite their differing party affiliations.  O'Connor went on to become a port commissioner and member of the Metropolitan  Transit Development Board, winning credit for overseeing the complicated  negotiations that created San Diego's trolley line, which opened in 1981. In  1983, she lost a bitter race for mayor against county Supervisor Roger  Hedgecock.  </P> <P> Three years later, when Hedgecock was forced to resign as mayor after his  conviction for perjury, O'Connor won the special election to complete his term  by a 10-point margin. Last year, in her first bid for a full four-year term as  mayor, O'Connor, enjoying name recognition and a lingering honeymoon from her  1986 victory, was considered so unbeatable that no serious opponent would run  against her. She was reelected with 60% of the vote. Although Times surveys  show her popularity rating has slipped from 69% to 48% in the past year and a  half, O'Connor's current 2-to-1 favorable rating is nonetheless healthy for a  midterm mayor.  </P> <P> Buoyed by public support, aided by her remarkable political and public  relations savvy, O'Connor repeatedly thumbs her nose at the downtown power  structure and maintains a bond with San Diego citizens that delights her  supporters and intimidates her opponents.  </P> <P> "My style's probably confusing to those who make their living off politics --  the Chamber of Commerce types, land-use attorneys, people like that," O'Connor  says. "They're used to coming to City Hall and talking to the mayor over a  desk. Well, I don't have to be behind a desk to know what's going on in the  city."  </P> <P> BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  </P> <P> O'CONNOR'S POPULARITY on the street makes it all the more surprising to view  her at City Hall. She is distant, isolated and defensive, guarded by a staff  that is protective even by political standards. Uncomfortable as the city's  official figurehead, O'Connor hates to pose for photographs. She is a painfully  inept speaker, even when reading from a prepared text. And despite an 18-year  political career, she is amazingly thin-skinned: In November, O'Connor demanded  that a local newspaper print a clarification of a description of her as the  "gum-chewing Mayor O'Connor." The mayor, her spokesman insisted, was munching a  breath mint.  </P> <P> In contrast to her zest for conversation with the common man in "the  neighborhoods," as O'Connor calls them, the mayor appears uncomfortable dealing  with some of the high-powered leaders who must command her attention. County  supervisors, Chamber of Commerce executives and fellow mayors have waited in  vain for O'Connor to return telephone calls about important city business.  Prominent political players have been issued hints to line up with the hoi  polloi for five minutes with O'Connor at twice-monthly "Meet the Mayor"  sessions. Even as the county's Superior Court judges considered moving the  court system out of downtown because of a space crunch, they could not gain an  audience with O'Connor to discuss the issue.  </P> <P> "We've found it's much more effective to work around the mayor's office than to  work with it," Supervisor Bilbray says, "because there's just no access."  </P> <P> Last spring, when she traveled to Sacramento for a hearing on the proposed  merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the  mayor alienated a host of legislators with her behavior, according to  Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista). O'Connor has worked hard to thwart the  merger, persuading the City Council to spend more than $2 million on lawyers  for regulatory proceedings. She fears a loss of local control of the utility,  1,000 lost jobs and higher utility rates.  </P> <P> But "you don't win votes by insulting people," Peace says. "In particular, you  don't do so when you also demonstrate a profound lack of knowledge on the  subject matter you're dealing with. Unfortunately, the mayor came up and didn't  sound like a professional person or an elected official or an informed  community leader or like an educated consumer activist. She came up sounding  shrill and offensive."  </P> <P> Vowing never to run for higher office while holding an elected post, O'Connor  is almost apolitical when it comes to other candidates' races. The mayor almost  never issues endorsements; she infuriated local Democrats and aides for Michael  S. Dukakis last year by failing to appear at a downtown rally for the  presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Despite her populist proclivities, O'Connor maintains a kitchen cabinet that  includes prominent land-use attorneys, relies on the financial backing of  McDonald's chain owner Joan Kroc and enjoys the editorial largess of friend  Helen Copley, publisher of the Union and Tribune newspapers.  </P> <P> But she leans most heavily on family members. Her sister Colleen, who made two  trips to the Soviet Union to negotiate loans of festival artwork, is a frequent  adviser who helps write O'Connor's yearly State of the City addresses.  Mavourneen, a developer of low-cost senior citizen housing, is a frequent  sounding board. And there's Peterson, a self-made political mover and shaker in  San Diego despite suffering from leukemia for the past decade.  </P> <P> Perhaps because of her insular style, O'Connor is deeply suspicious of the  press, often dodging phone calls from all but a handful of local columnists who  give her flattering treatment. The mayor prefers closed-door negotiation to  public debate. She is quick to point out that citizens now are offered more  time to speak at council meetings, but the City Council under O'Connor has  shown a penchant for considering arguably public matters in private. Most  recently, the council met privately to discuss a lawsuit filed by a Latino  coalition seeking to expand the council from 8 to 12 seats, thereby improving  minority representation. The city's attorneys argued that the council's  discussion of its legal strategy should be privileged, but some observers  believe that debate about the city's electoral system should be public.  </P> <P> AFTERNOONS AT THE MOVIES  </P> <P> DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN O'Connor's style is her enduring contempt for Hedgecock, the  only person to defeat her in an election, one she believes he captured by  accepting illegal campaign contributions. Reporters at radio station KSDO,  where Hedgecock is now an O'Connor-bashing talk-show host, believe that they  are routinely denied interviews with the mayor because of his presence there.  The mayor's spokesman denies the claim, but O'Connor maintains a strict policy  of refusing to appear publicly with Hedgecock.  </P> <P> "He's a convicted felon. He's on the radio, making $100,000. He is not  repentant about his crime," says Paul Downey, a spokesman for O'Connor.  </P> <P> Some believe that O'Connor ran for mayor in 1986 simply to win. "Maureen wanted  to prove that . . . '83 turned out the way it did because Roger had cheated," a  former insider recalls. "There really wasn't much thought given to what would  happen afterward or what the agenda would be. . . . Winning was an end in  itself."  </P> <P> The bottom line for many, in fact, is the question of how interested O'Connor  is in governing. From growth control to the airport to the trash crisis, she  has abdicated leadership to council colleagues and left personal priorities  unfinished.  </P> <P> O'Connor is not among the council's hardest workers, slipping out of her office  occasionally to take in matinee movies (often police sagas). She has not  attended a meeting of the Housing Commission, of which she is vice chairman, in  more than seven months. (In her defense, Downey notes that O'Connor often  guides the city's affairs via telephone from her home late into the night.)  </P> <P> O'Connor steadfastly defends her performance, claiming that she works quietly  and effectively behind the scenes, a style to which the public and the media  are not accustomed. "There's no limit to what you can accomplish if you don't  care who gets the credit," the mayor says, reciting one of her favorite  political aphorisms. "My ego doesn't demand that my name be on everything."  </P> <P> "I think she is vastly underrated as a leader," said Paul Peterson, a building  industry lobbyist (no relation to O'Connor's husband) and informal adviser to  the mayor. "I've seen her in action, and . . . the fact is she has a method of  keeping the city on an even keel that's very effective."  </P> <P> NO-FRILLS TO RICHES  </P> <P> WHEN SUPER POWERS SUNDAY dawned cool and overcast, the mayor fretted to one of  her closest friends, a nun whom she has known since her teaching days, about  the weather's effect on the turnout. "Maureen's always afraid she's going to  throw a party and no one will come," Sister Jeannette Black said, chuckling as  she walked beside the mayor during the event, which proved to be the biggest  single-day draw in the park's history.  </P> <P> O'Connor need not have worried. Pausing along the park's historic Prado,  O'Connor stretched her 5-foot-2 frame for a view of the growing mid-afternoon  crowd and could not help but smile at what she saw. Even before the skies  cleared, attendance surpassed the most optimistic predictions. "Geez, Louise!"  O'Connor said, squinting as she surveyed the scene. "This is a long way from  Rosary High School."  </P> <P> It was there in 1971 that, as a $450-a-month gym teacher and come-from-nowhere  council candidate, O'Connor was pursued by a political power broker whose  candidate had been eliminated during the primary. When Bob Peterson's repeated  telephone calls to Rosary High began to irk the nuns in charge, O'Connor  finally spoke to the man who "wanted to know about this girl that defeated his  candidate."  </P> <P> They began dating several years later and were married in a 1977 ceremony in  the south of France. It was Peterson's fifth marriage, O'Connor's first, and a  match O'Connor calls "the best decision I ever made." The couple separated  after her 1983 election loss, filing divorce papers before reconciling less  than a year later.  </P> <P> Peterson is a man of diverse interests, including fabric dyeing, gourmet  cooking and landscaping. He once invested in research about synthesizing  firefly luminescence for medical use. Describing her husband as "truly a  Renaissance man," O'Connor says he "broadened me tremendously . . . by exposing  me to a world I'd never seen before." For a woman from less-than-comfortable  beginnings, the marriage also has provided O'Connor with exotic vacations,  designer clothing, a Mendocino retreat and a backyard lap pool behind a mansion  where cooks prepare the meals. Perhaps because of her upbringing, O'Connor  wears her new economic status almost self-consciously, despite the more  powerful and glamorous circles in which she now travels.  </P> <P> Peterson encouraged O'Connor to run for mayor, and she says her husband's  chronic illness has never held her back. "He didn't want this to control his  life," she says, "and it hasn't." But Peterson's leukemia often keeps him from  attending public functions with his wife.  </P> <P> "Bob's been extremely supportive," O'Connor adds. "This job would be difficult  on any marriage, even without this additional problem. His health has its ups  and downs, and we've just learned to live with it and keep moving ahead."  </P> <P> CURSING 'LOS ANGELIZATION'  </P> <P> O'CONNOR PRESIDES OVER a San Diego dramatically different from the city in  which she grew up, or even the one that existed when she took office in 1971.  During her two four-year terms on the council, San Diego began to outgrow its  reputation as a sleepy Navy town near Tijuana to become one of the nation's  largest cities -- and one of its fastest growing: Since 1970, San Diego's  population has increased 58%, to 1.1 million. Between 1983, when O'Connor first  ran for mayor, and 1988, more than 70,000 homes sprouted in San Diego's  unprecedented building boom.  </P> <P> The staggering growth rate has brought big-city problems that San Diegans curse  as "Los Angelization" -- traffic jams, air and water pollution, vanishing open  space, crowded schools and parks -- in short, a decline in the quality of life  that brought many to the city in the first place.  </P> <P> Few question that O'Connor inherited significant challenges when she was  inaugurated as mayor on July 7, 1986, to fill out Hedgecock's unexpired term.  Hedgecock had spent much of his brief term absorbed in his legal battle, and  his predecessor, Wilson, now the junior senator from California, had ended an  11-year tenure as something of an absentee mayor while he campaigned for higher  office. The city and City Hall were reeling from a handful of corruption  scandals, most notably J. David Dominelli's 1984 Ponzi scheme, which defrauded  investors of $80 million.  </P> <P> Elected on a platform that emphasized slowing growth, O'Connor soon pushed  through a landmark ordinance that for 18 months capped the number of homes that  could be built citywide, though some of the city's most rapidly developing  areas were exempted. Confronted by a conservative, developer-backed council  majority, the new mayor also sought to convince the average citizen that he  would be heard at City Hall.  </P> <P> "In 1986, community groups felt very strongly that developers had a lock on  City Hall," O'Connor maintains. "Now the neighborhood groups feel very strongly  that they're sitting at the decision-making table."  </P> <P> In February, 1987, she persuaded the council to reverse its stand and begin the  $2.8-billion task of cleaning up the city's sewage to comply with the federal  Clean Water Act. The following year, however, the city was sued by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency for failing to comply quickly enough. As a  result, it faces millions of dollars in fines.  </P> <P> The new mayor also called for more police and a crackdown on street drug sales.  This year, the council added 116 officers to the police force, slashing $5  million from other parts of the city budget to do so. To establish tighter  control by the City Council, O'Connor also took the Housing Commission away  from its citizen board of directors.  </P> <P> But as time wore on, the promising beginnings of O'Connor's tenure were  replaced by her dawdling on issues and appointments, and, later, her devotion  to the arts festival. O'Connor's performance on the growth issue, perhaps the  city's most chronic problem, is illuminating.  </P> <P> Ranked by the Sierra Club as the council's most dependable environmental vote,  O'Connor nevertheless failed to campaign for the City Council's 1988 permanent  growth-control initiative -- which had taken nearly two years to bring to the  ballot -- until shortly before the election. With only days to go, the mayor  abruptly endorsed both the city's measure and a stricter, rival initiative  placed on the ballot by a slow-growth group.  </P> <P> Both measures, and two more covering the unincorporated areas of San Diego  County, were crushed by a nearly $3-million spending campaign mounted by  developers, the most expensive campaign in city history. The council  subsequently enacted a series of ordinances that accomplished some of the goals  of the city's ballot measure, but not enough to satisfy some of the slow-growth  advocates who helped propel O'Connor into office. O'Connor and others have said  that the package of laws was the best they could get, given the City Council's  composition.  </P> <P> But O'Connor's critics accused her of doing too little too late. "If the  building industry didn't have Maureen O'Connor, they'd have to invent her,"  says Peter Navarro, leader of the vanquished slow-growth organization Citizens  for Limited Growth. "You have a figurehead mayor who projects the illusion that  she's getting things done on growth management and the environment, and that  keeps the public at bay."  </P> <P> "Sooner or later," says Dick Dresner, a former O'Connor political consultant  whom she dropped after the 1988 election, "people are going to realize that the  emperor -- or, in this case, empress -- has no clothes."  </P> <P> THE WEEKEND TRANSIENT  </P> <P> O'CONNOR HAS MADE youth-oriented programs a priority throughout her political  career, in part because she cannot have children of her own. "Everyone's dealt  a deck of cards, and children didn't happen to be in mine," O'Connor says. "But  I compensate for that. Being able to do something for kids is one of the real  joys of this job."  </P> <P> O'Connor frequently visits the poor and victimized, serving as a kind of  Florence Nightingale backed by the substantial resources of the government and  the prestige of the mayor's office.  </P> <P> In July, when 9-year-old Joshua Garrett had his skull fractured by a teen-ager  wielding a baseball bat from a passing car, O'Connor privately visited his  hospital room, and later took Joshua and his mother home in her city car.  </P> <P> There, they discovered that the family's apartment had been ransacked by  burglars who left it a shambles. After tucking Joshua's mother, Theresa, into  bed, O'Connor spent the next four hours straightening up the apartment --  washing dishes, sending her police escort out for pizza, buying groceries,  making child-care arrangements for Garrett's children and demanding that the  building manager fix Garrett's broken bathtub.  </P> <P> "She took the time and effort to do something for my family," Theresa Garrett  recalls. "She didn't have to do that. She didn't have to do that at all."  </P> <P> This may be O'Connor at her best. She has personally painted a Boys Club  wrecked by vandals and sat up for two days with a dying port commissioner. She  has hauled trash, ladled food at shelters for the homeless and toured the city  handing out Christmas gifts to shut-ins.  </P> <P> In a locally celebrated and nationally publicized odyssey, O'Connor spent two  days in 1988 living on San Diego's streets disguised as a transient.  Accompanied by undercover police officers and two disguised reporters, she  watched drug deals, picked through encampments in the canyons of Balboa Park  and washed furniture at a shelter for the privilege of taking a shower.  </P> <P> O'Connor's critics scorned the action as a publicity stunt, noting that the  mayor's memo describing the tour focused on crime, drugs and filth, instead of  homelessness. "You can't experience homelessness in two days on the street,"  says Frank Landerville, executive director of the Regional Task Force on the  Homeless.  </P> <P> But O'Connor credits her wanderings throughout the city and frequent police  ride-alongs in the crack-infested sections of southeast San Diego for her  knowledge of how San Diegans feel and what they need. "I know before the  pollsters realize there's a problem," O'Connor says, "because I do that. I go  out. I spend a lot of time on the streets and I get criticized for it. That's  my style."  </P> <P> "This isn't typical political behavior -- that's what confuses and perplexes a  lot of people about Maureen," confidant Wolfsheimer says. "She takes her  signals from what she picks up from talking to people at shopping malls or  riding around with cops, not from polls or other politicians."  </P> <P> 'JUST SAY NYET'  </P> <P> O'CONNOR LIKES TO say that the arts festival proved that San Diego had "come of  age" culturally and perhaps, in some small way, further warmed U.S.-Soviet  relations. "To see Frish the Clown (of the Moscow Circus) mixing with Ronald  McDonald and Mickey Mouse, . . . it was wonderful," O'Connor gushed between  bites of Russian food.  </P> <P> But a Soviet clown holding hands with two walking corporate logos hardly marks  a significant new chapter in glasnost. The arts festival, announced at  O'Connor's January, 1988, State of the City address, once again set some San  Diegans to wondering about O'Connor's priorities for the city. The project also  conjured up recollections of Hedgecock's caustic dismissal of O'Connor in their  1983 showdown as "a little rich girl with nothing better to do" than dabble in  politics, someone better suited to organizing a party than to managing a major  American city.  </P> <P> O'Connor threw herself, body and soul, into the festival like nothing else she  has tackled during her tenure. Despite the appointment of two festival  coordinators, the mayor controlled the show from start to finish, personally  selecting the opening ceremony songs: "We Are the World" and "It's a Small  World."  </P> <P> Negotiating the labyrinthine Soviet bureaucracy, O'Connor persuaded the Kremlin  Armory museum and U.S. billionaire Malcolm Forbes to lend the festival their  collections of Faberge Imperial Eggs for a showing of 27 of the bejeweled  artifacts. Two Soviet dramas, "Brothers and Sisters" and "Slingshot," were  brought here for their U.S. premieres; for an opera production, the mayor chose  Mussorgsky's masterpiece "Boris Godunov."  </P> <P> The festival was a huge political gamble for O'Connor, who inaugurated the  event without assurances that the public would attend. Moreover, she was asking  the military-dominated city of San Diego to embrace the Soviets. In the era of  Gorbachev, she was offering Czarist art. Some artists sniffed at the quality of  the exhibits.  </P> <P> To top it off, O'Connor set off howls when she asked the council to finance the  festival with $3 million in city hotel taxes at a time when the sewer system,  the roads and the police force were begging for funds. "Just Say Nyet" and  "Homeless Children Can't Eat Faberge Eggs" bumper stickers were circulated.  </P> <P> Lobbying the City Council with rare fervor, O'Connor won the public funding,  plus an additional $500,000 from the San Diego Unified Port District, which  Wolfsheimer heads. She rounded up more than $3 million in private  contributions, including $1.4 million from Kroc and the Ronald McDonald  Children's Charities, $250,000 from Helen Copley and $250,000 more from the  James S. Copley Foundation.  </P> <P> The result was a festival of astounding popularity and some rave reviews,  particularly for the two dramas. In a Times poll conducted during the  festival's final weekend, residents favored it by a 72% to 19% margin, and 33%  said they or a family member had attended at least one event. Organizers  reported that a total of 600,000 people attended during the festival's 22-day  run.  </P> <P> Whether the extravaganza proved an artistic or financial success and how it  will serve as Maureen O'Connor's legacy remain open questions. Her office  maintains that the festival and the national publicity it generated have  elevated San Diego's standing as a cultural center. Although the poll found  residents refuted the mayor's notion that the festival demonstrated that San  Diego had "come of age," San Diegans heartily welcomed O'Connor's proposal that  similar festivals be held every three years, beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> The mayor feels vindicated.  </P> <P> "Did you see the movie 'Field of Dreams?' " O'Connor asks. "That's what the  arts festival was to me. It was my field of dreams. And the voice I heard was  the voice of the people.  </P> <P> "The critics were all waiting for me to fail. I heard that this was going to be  my funeral. Well, they were wrong, and I knew they would be. Frankly, it just  brought home a lesson I learned a long time ago in politics. If I hadn't tried  to do all the things that my critics over the years have said couldn't be done,  I'd probably still be back teaching phys ed. I listen to the people. And thanks  to them, I've been under a very lucky star."  </P></p>

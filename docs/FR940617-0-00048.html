			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established. The Contractor, however, is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and non-minority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246 if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even though the Contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246 if a specific minority group of women is underutilized).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The Contractor shall not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) The Contractor shall not enter into any Subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts pursuant to Executive Order 11246.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of these specifications and of the Equal Opportunity Clause, including suspension, termination and cancellation of existing subcontracts as may be imposed or ordered pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Any Contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions and penalties shall be in violation of these specifications and Executive Order 11246, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) The Contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, shall implement specific affirmative action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph (g) of these specifications, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, the implementing regulations, or these specifications, the Director shall proceed in accordance with 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to monitor all employment related activity to ensure that the company EEO policy is being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required by the Government and to keep records. Records shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone numbers, construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned, social security number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement, contractors shall not be required to maintain separate records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) Nothing herein provided shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws which establish different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents (e.g. those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4. In this Article VI_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The term ``Contractor'' shall also mean ``Bidder'' or ``Subcontractor'' as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The provisions of sections 2 &amp; 3 are applicable to the extent required by law. In determining whether these Sections are applicable, reference should be made to Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulations (41 CFR part 60).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

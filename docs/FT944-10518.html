			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / People: Jean Wood promoted at Irish Life Brian Duncan is to step down as chief executive of Irish Life Ireland as part of the company's reorganisation of its European operations. Duncan, who joined the company after leaving school, has been in charge of both retail and corporate arms. His departure follows a merging of the company's retail business in Ireland and the UK under a new chief executive, Jean Wood, currently head of Irish Life's European business. Corporate activities are to be headed by Kevin Murphy, currently in charge of investments. Irish Life's managing director David Kingston says Duncan, 49, believes 'it is now time for a change - both for himself and for Irish Life'. Duncan declined to take one of the two new positions created by the management review and is now said to be favourite to take the vacant position of chief executive of VHI, the big state health insurer.</p>

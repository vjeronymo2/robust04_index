			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WISE FALL GUY  </P> <P> If Ken Wahl's version is true (" 'Wiseguy' Plot Thickens, but Who's the Fall  Guy Here?," by Irv Letofsky, June 2), it is unfortunate that Stephen Cannell  believes that "Wiseguy" can continue without Wahl.  </P> <P> The actor brought incredible depth to the character of Vinnie Terranova that  undoubtedly cannot be matched. His portrayal is what made the show intriguing.  </P> <P> It is always sad when quality programs such as "Wiseguy" go down because of  behind-the-scenes battles. While "Wiseguy" is not dead yet, its demise is only  a matter of time.  </P> <P> APRIL ROCHA  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

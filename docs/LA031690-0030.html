			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPENING SET FOR PARK'S JAPANESE GARDEN;  </P> <P> LANDSCAPE: AN IDEA THAT TOOK ROOT 20 YEARS AGO WILL BLOSSOM THIS SUMMER, WHEN  THE FIRST PHASE OF A $11.4-MILLION JAPANESE FRIENDSHIP GARDEN IS COMPLETED IN  BALBOA PARK.  </P> <P> The first phase of the long-awaited Japanese Friendship Garden in Balboa Park  will open this summer, the garden's landscape architect said Thursday.  </P> <P> The 11 1/2-acre project, which has been contemplated for more than 20 years, is  being built in five phases and will cost $11.4 million. The group sponsoring  the garden, the Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego, has  raised $1 million so far to help complete the initial phase.  </P> <P> Speaking at an outdoor ceremony on a spring-like day in the park, landscape  architect Ken Nakajima told the gathering the first phase will be completed by  July or August. Work began in January at the site on the rim of Gold Gulch  Canyon.  </P> <P> Nakajima, who built a similar garden retreat in Moscow, was in town to consult  with the joint construction team of Shimizu America Corp. and Nielsen  Construction. Founded in 1804, Shimizu is the oldest and largest construction  firm in Japan.  </P> <P> The entire garden should be completed in 10 years, said Larry L. Marshall,  president of Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego. Work will  occur as funding becomes available.  </P> <P> Marshall said that "when we negotiated the 50-year lease with the city in 1984,  we knew that it was unlikely (we could) . . . raise all the money to build the  garden at one time. That's why we designed the garden in phases."  </P> <P> The city has pledged to donate $2 million, and plans to turn over $500,000 in  June, Marshall said.  </P> <P> Included in the first phase are an exhibit room, a gift shop, snack bar, and an  administration office. There will also be a sand and stone garden and a picnic  area.  </P> <P> "We have a master plan, and the garden will continue to get better," he said.  "The zoo has been around for more than 50 years, and it is still adding  attractions. We will be second only to the zoo in attraction."  </P> <P> The master plan for the garden was approved by the City Council in 1979. The  garden has been named Sankei-en, which means a garden with three types of  scenery. When finished, it will feature a pond surrounded by paths, pastoral  and mountain retreat settings, a tea house, culture center, arbor and exhibit  building.  </P> <P> For all the anticipation, this is not the first time a Japanese garden has been  built in Balboa Park. A tea garden, complete with a pavilion and a small tea  plantation, was built for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. This is the  75th anniversary of the exposition. The garden was dismantled in the 1950s to  make way for the Children's Zoo.  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, the San Diego-Yokohama Sister City Society began to make  plans to replace the one torn down.  </P> <P> Gold Gulch Canyon was selected as the new site in 1968, and the Charles C. Dail  Memorial Japanese Gate was erected just north of the Organ Pavilion. And until  January, that was the last construction on the project.  </P> <P> In 1980, the garden committee of the Sister City Society transferred control of  the project to the new Japanese Friendship Garden board, which eventually began  raising funds for the garden.  </P> <P> At Thursday's ceremony, the San Diego chapter of Ikebana International, a  nonprofit floral organization, donated $10,000 and the Kearny Mesa Rotary Club  gave a $5,000 donation collected from five Rotary clubs in Japan.  </P></p>

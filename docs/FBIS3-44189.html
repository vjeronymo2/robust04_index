			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Johannesb Ngcobo] </F>   [Text] The SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF], SA  Police [SAP] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and ANC [African  National Party] have agreed that SADF troops will guard refugees  returning to their East Rand homes. The decision was taken at a  meeting attended by the ANC, Inkatha and the SADF's 41 Battalion  last Friday, said SADF Witwatersrand spokesman Maj. Christo  Visser.    The battalion had agreed to provide security for people  returning to homes vacated during violence in Katlehong and  Thokoza. Visser said the SADF had made the undertaking because  it wanted to help the SAP restore normality in the townships by  ending violence. "The SADF has deployed other troops in  Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus because the ones that were  stationed in these areas have been taken into the national  peacekeeping force."    Visser said the army was in the townships to provide  security  and not to take part in the politics of the area. He said the  troops had agreed to assist people returning to clean their  homes before reoccupying them.    ANC East Rand subregional secretary-general Xeba Soyaya  confirmed that a meeting between Inkatha and the SADF had taken  place last Friday and said members of the army had agreed to  guard the refugees when they cleaned their homes this weekend.  He said that after the announcement of the peace plan being  worked out between President F.W. de Klerk and ANC president  Nelson Mandela, the ANC would call a series of rallies to  welcome troops "and introduce them to the people."    An Inkatha official in Thokoza, Abram Mzizi, said he  attended  the meeting but as a parent, not an Inkatha member. He  confirmed that army members had agreed to provide security in  the area. He said this exercise was to last two weeks, after  which a meeting would be called to review progress. If the need  still existed, the army would continue providing security.    However, the Inkatha East Rand region accused SADF members  of  harassing its members in Katlehong and Thokoza. Inkatha  regional organiser Thabani Dlamini said 17 cases of assault and  harassment had already been reported to the Thokoza police  station. "SADF members blockaded the only access available to  hostel residents in and out of Katlehong," said Dlamini. "This  has contributed to hundreds of hostel dwellers, particularly  shift workers, losing their jobs," he alleged.    Dlamini said Inkatha was astounded at the sudden deployment  of SADF troops without East Rand residents being consulted.  "The decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] to  replace the internal stability unit with SADF troops despite our  known objections confirms once again widely held suspicions that  the TEC is an instrument set up to rubber-stamp ANC demands."    Visser said the SADF "distances itself from any political  party and is there to serve the community as a whole." To  stabilise the area and keep fighting factions apart, the support  of the whole community was needed. Any person assaulted or  harassed was free to report this to the police.    SAPA reports that Visser confirmed that troops in Katlehong  had blocked some routes yesterday to control the movement of  weapons better but this had been done after discussions with  Inkatha and the ANC. The SADF had also agreed to build another  road for hostel dwellers, he said,but was unsure about its  progress.</p>

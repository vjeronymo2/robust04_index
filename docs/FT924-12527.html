			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow firmer as investors show resilience again Wall Street Some good corporate earnings results helped US share prices to end firmer yesterday despite further declines in IBM and another rise in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.04 at 3,188.45. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also firmer at the finish, up 3.23 at 414.96, while the Amex composite edged 1.21 higher to 368.54 and the Nasdaq composite roared ahead 8.06 to 590.67. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 226m shares. The fifth anniversary of the October 1987 stock market crash passed uneventfully. Market sentiment remained reasonably positive, buoyed by a third quarter reporting season that is proving to be more positive than envisaged. The resilience of investors was displayed last week, when large declines in three of the market's biggest stocks - IBM, Philip Morris and Westinghouse - only slightly depressed the Dow and left the wider market indices, such as the S &amp; P 500, unscathed. IBM remained weak, but again failed to disturb sentiment significantly. Investors also shrugged off continued declines in bond prices, which sent short and long-term yields higher as fixed interest markets expressed concern about the implications of a Democratic victory in the presidential election next month. Among individual stocks, Time Warner rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 on the news that the entertainment group earned Dollars 6m in the third quarter, an improvement on the Dollars 62m loss reported at the same stage a year ago. The company, however, reported a loss after preferred dividend payments were included. IBM continued to decline in the wake of last week's dreadful earnings figures and the stock fell another Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 68 1/2 in turnover of 2.7m shares. Chase Manhattan Bank rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 after reporting a big improvement in quarterly profits to Dollars 176m, up from Dollars 136m a year earlier. Other banks were firmer in anticipation of good quarterly earnings, including Chemical, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 33 1/4 , also aided by reports that the billionaire investor, Mr Warren Buffett, may have taken a stake in the bank. Blockbuster rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 14 1/2 on news of a 37.5 per cent rise in third quarter earnings to Dollars 41.3m, or 22 cents a share. Hasbro climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 on the American Stock Exchange after reporting profits of 75 cents a share in the third quarter, up from 55 cents a share a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft led the way higher, rising Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 87 7/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at the securities house, Goldman Sachs, made positive comments on the stock. Others to benefit from Goldman recommendations included BMC Software, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 61 1/4 , Sybase, Dollars 2 1/2 higher at Dollars 40 1/2 and Oracle Systems, Dollars 1 1/2 firmer at Dollars 22 1/8 . Canada TORONTO share prices ended higher, boosted by firmer bank and gold stocks. Toronto's 300 index added 17.78 points, or 0.55 per cent, to 3,225.48, with advancing issues ahead of declines 271 to 248. Volume was 25.7m shares worth CDollars 208m against 29.5m shares worth CDollars 259.2m on Friday.</p>

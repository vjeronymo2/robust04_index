			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICOTINE GUM IS ONLY FOR QUITTERS;  </P> <P> THE NO-SMOKING AID WON'T HELP YOU JUST CUT DOWN  </P> <P> Question: I'm a long-time smoker, I enjoy smoking and I don't have any plans to  stop. But I would like to cut down on the amount I smoke, which is now more  than two packs a day. I went to my doctor and asked him for a prescription for  nicotine chewing gum, but he said he would not give it to me as long as I  continued to smoke. Wouldn't it be a good idea to use the nicotine gum to cut  down on the amount a person smokes? Is there any special way the gum should be  used?  </P> <P> Answer: While smoking less is better than smoking more, not smoking at all is  best of all. And it is generally agreed that smokers have the best chance of  kicking the habit when they begin using nicotine chewing gum only after they've  stopped smoking completely. It is better not to use the gum simply to cut down  on the number of cigarettes smoked.  </P> <P> As for how the gum is to be used, the nicotine from the gum is absorbed in the  mouth; therefore, it should be chewed slowly. In addition, it should be used  for at least three months because of the risk of relapse during that time.  </P> <P> Q: My sister-in-law suddenly developed a kind of facial paralysis that the  doctor diagnosed as Bell's palsy. Since then I've spoken with a lot of people  who either had this condition or who knew people who had it. From what they  tell me, sometimes the condition clears up by itself, but this doesn't happen  all the time. Is there any way anyone can predict whether the condition will  get any better?  </P> <P> A: The results of a study conducted in Scotland suggest that a poor outcome in  patients with Bell's palsy is associated with the patient's age, the severity  of the condition initially and the length of time that elapsed before  spontaneous improvement occurred.  </P> <P> Q: A lot of times when people want to make fun of a condition they say that  it's as serious as an ingrown toenail. But as someone who often gets ingrown  toenails, I'm not laughing. They hurt too much. Is it possible that there is  something wrong with the shape of my nails that make them ingrown?  </P> <P> A: An English study of patients with ingrowing toenails who were scheduled for  surgery showed no differences between their nails and those of a group of  control subjects. In other words, an abnormal nail shape does not appear to be  responsible for the ingrowth.  </P> <P> Q: I would like to know what is meant when a cheese is said to be natural.  Could you give some examples?  </P> <P> A: A natural cheese is one made directly from milk. Swiss, Cheddar and cottage  cheese are some examples of natural cheeses.  </P> <P> Q: I went with my mother to her doctor for a checkup, and he emphasized how  important it is for older people to drink water. He made it sound as if it is a  serious problem, and I would like to know if you agree that it is something to  be emphasized.  </P> <P> A: Older people often consume less water than they should, partly because the  body's thirst responses become impaired as a person grows older. The situation  may be complicated in those with urinary problems, who may deliberately limit  their intake of fluids and therefore risk dehydration.  </P> <P> Q: My mother is 84 years old, and she sometimes complains of being dizzy. Can  you tell me the causes?  </P> <P> A: There are a number of possibilities that might explain dizziness in a person  your mother's age. Even something as simple as the excessive use of aspirin may  cause some imbalance. But speculation would not be helpful; I suggest an early  appointment with her physician to determine the cause and recommend appropriate  treatment.  </P></p>

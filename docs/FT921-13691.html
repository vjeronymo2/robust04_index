			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Political fears hit north-west businesses BUSINESS confidence in north-west England is being adversely affected by political and economic uncertainty, as well as the recession, according to the 1991 fourth-quarter survey of nine chambers of commerce in the region. Some manufacturers reported signs of improving exports, but domestic orders continued to reflect low demand. But the gap between those reporting a drop in home orders and those experiencing a rise was the smallest for the year. Confidence fell from the third-quarter peak, with companies expecting some upturn in the second half of this year, but from a very low base and with no evidence or experience yet apparent to back up this belief. The survey covered 279 manufacturers employing 63,000 people and 218 service-sector companies with 41,000 employees, with the bulk of companies employing fewer than 200 people each. London's service sector is showing faint signs that it is emerging from recession, according to the latest quarterly economic survey from the capital's chamber of commerce and industry, Edward Balls writes. Yet there is little evidence in the survey to suggest that a strong overall recovery is under way, cautioned the chamber of commerce: 'The signs of recovery in the service sector are still faint while the manufacturing sector is still very much in recession.' The survey of 250 companies with a total of 250,000 employees reveals that a net positive balance of 3 percentage points of service companies are increasing their domestic activity, against a negative balance of 23 percentage points in the previous survey. Manufacturers remain depressed, with output falling particularly sharply in export markets. Domestic orders remain depressed, with a negative balance of 5 percentage points reporting higher orders, against a negative balance of 18 points last survey.</p>

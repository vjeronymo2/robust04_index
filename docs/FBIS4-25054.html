			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Over 2,000 children who  could not afford to continue school have resumed their schooling  as the region has collected donations totalling two million yuan  in the "Hope Project", a nationwide program to help drop-outs  return school.    Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the people's government of the  Tibetan Autonomous Region, said that Tibet has built eight Hope  schools and two Hope classes with the donations and another  seven such schools are under construction.    But being one of the most underdeveloped parts in China,  about one third of the school-age children could not afford to  go to school in Tibet by the end of 1993, he pointed out. This  mainly arises from Tibet's poor transport conditions, fewer  schools and poor schooling conditions, he said.    In the light of the backward education, the regional  people's  government has decided to put education on the top agenda. The  most concrete step for this move is to build at least one middle  school in each county and at least one primary school in each  township so as to provide 80 percent of the region's school-age  children with proper education.    To this end, Gyaincain Norbu called on the efforts of  different social circles to help build the project, since  governments at different levels have but small budgets.    He suggested some detailed fund-raising ideas, such as  auctions, benefit performances and charity bazaars, which have  already proved effective in other parts of China.</p>

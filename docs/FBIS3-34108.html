"Dozens of tanks, troop transporters and missiles are  concentrated in the Shabwah region," a congress spokesman told  the press here.    Military units based in the north have not moved any of  their  missiles, he insisted, despite allegations to the contrary from  the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which operates in the south  and whose leader, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, is in  conflict with Salih.    The YSP said that southern-based units along the former  border had seized a shipment of 40 anti-aircraft missiles from  the north.    But the GPC spokesman charged that such reports were  designed  "to camouflage troop movements (from the south), deceive public  opinion and divert attention away from the refusal of the YSP to  sign (an) agreement in Amman this Sunday."    The draft agreement was aimed at ending a dispute over the  administration of the country that has plagued Yemen since last  August.    Despite the political unification of the north and the south  in May 1990, the armies from the two regions have never merged.    The GPC spokesman accused the YSP of "setting new  conditions,  revealing its intention of going back" on the accord, which was  reached January 18.    Salih and al-Bid were due to sign the agreement in Amman on  Sunday, Arab diplomats in the Jordanian capital said Wednesday,  but Yemeni officials warned it was unlikely the two sides would  be ready by then.    A member of a mediation committee, 'Abdallah al-Jifri,  predicted that the accord would probably be signed "just before  Ramadan," the Moslem month of dawn-to-dusk fasting expected to  start around February 12.</p>

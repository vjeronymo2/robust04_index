			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Citibank sees revival in consumer banking CONSUMER banking profits at Citibank, the US banking group, will be 'substantially higher' this year than last, due mainly to falling levels of bad debts in the US and cost-cutting, Mr Pei-Yuan Chia, head of consumer banking, said yesterday. He added, though, that recession in Europe and the slow economic recovery in the US was holding back income growth. 'Revenue growth is still not very robust. It is anaemic. But the bottom line will be very good.' Citibank's consumer business generated record net income of Dollars 941m last year after bad debts had dragged it down to Dollars 530m in 1991. The biggest improvement has come in the US market, largely as a result of declining credit losses on credit cards and other products, Mr Chia said. Although he declined to disclose figures, Mr Chia said that the bank's write-off ratio was back to the 'reasonable' level it had been at before 1991. Increasing competition in the US credit card business is likely to reduce revenues in that sector by between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m, as the bank spends more on marketing and reduces its fees in order to keep customers. 'We have lost market share. Our aim is now to defend our share. If that means lower margins, so be it,' Mr Chia said. Mr Chia's up-beat assess-ment came as Citibank announced plans to complete the remodelling of all 1,400 of its branches around the world over the next two years. The aim of the programme is to increase the revenues earned by the branches  -which currently generate 40 per cent of the consumer bank's revenues - rather than to reduce costs or improve productivity, said Mr Chia. Most of the bank's branches in Asia and many in Europe have already been revamped, and the remodelling programme is now being accelerated in the US.</p>

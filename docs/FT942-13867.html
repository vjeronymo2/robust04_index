			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Peugeot Citroen slides FFr1.4bn into red Peugeot Citroen, the French vehicles group, plunged into a net loss of FFr1.41bn (Dollars 242m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr3.37bn in 1992, the company announced yesterday. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, said that the loss, although smaller than many analysts had expected, reflected the impact of the 'worst decline in the European automobile market since the second world war'. He also blamed a period of 'monetary anarchy' which had seen substantial currency devaluations for foreign rivals in the UK, Italy and Spain. According to Mr Calvet, the devaluations of the pound, the lira and the peseta since 1992 had compounded the fierce competition in the car market. He also criticised the monetary policy of the French government which, he said, had resulted in excessively high real interest rates. Last year's loss was the first at Peugeot Citroen since 1985 and prompted the group to withhold a dividend. In spite of last year's reversal, Mr Calvet cited encouraging factors. The second half of last year showed a marked improvement over the first, with net losses declining to FFr292m from FFr1.12bn between the two periods. Mr Calvet said he expected the improvement to continue because of emerging signs of economic recovery in some of the group's principal markets and a strong boost to sales in France resulting from government measures. These measures, which include a payment of FFr5,000 for car owners who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new one, will help lift new car sales in the French market to 1.85m this year from 1.72m in 1993, the company said. Sales last year fell to FFr145.43bn from FFr155.43bn, while production fell by 14.5 per cent to 1.75m vehicles. The worst affected markets, according to Mr Calvet were in continental Europe, with France, Spain, Germany and Italy all suffering an overall decline of between 18 and 24 per cent. However, Peugeot Citroen said it had managed to increase its share of the European market during 1993, to 13.1 per cent in the last three months of the year from 12 per cent in the first quarter. The company said the increase reflected the impact of new models. The improved financial performance in the second half of the year partly reflected a series of cost-cutting and productivity measures.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE;  </P> <P> MEDICAL CENTER'S ROAD COMPROMISE APPROVED  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved an agreement  ending a dispute with UCI Medical Center over use of a road that both sides  consider essential to their plans for more than $200 million in expanded  facilities in Orange.  </P> <P> Board members voted, 4 to 0, with Supervisor Don R. Roth absent, to ratify the  accord that allows both the county and UCI Medical Center to use the road known  as Dawn Way and to share the cost of maintaining the private, four-lane road  that divides university and county facilities east of the City shopping center  mall in an area known as the Manchester Complex.  </P> <P> Both sides also agreed not to pursue threatened legal action. County officials  had filed a lawsuit to halt UCI's building of a 700-space, six-story parking  garage next to the medical center. The UC Board of Regents has authorized a  suit against the county to block a proposed expansion of Theo Lacy Branch Jail  at the site.  </P> <P> County officials forced the confrontation when they complained that UCI had  begun building the garage without consulting the county or assessing the level  of traffic that it would generate.  </P></p>

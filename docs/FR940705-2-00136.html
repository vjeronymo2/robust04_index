			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules, shall be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix K describes containment conditions Good Large Scale Practice through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BL3&hyph;Large Scale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7. Human Gene Transfer Experiments Not Covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;3, and Not Considered Exempt Under Section V&hyph;U  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;3, and that are not considered exempt under Section V&hyph;U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;D. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous With Initiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experiments not included in Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, III&hyph;C, III&hyph;E, and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsections are considered in Section III&hyph;D. All such experiments may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration document (see Section III&hyph;C) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment is not required (see Section IV&hyph;A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III&hyph;D and may be conducted at BL1 containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;D&hyph;1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Molecules Containing No More Than Two-Thirds of the Genome of Any Eukaryotic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V&hyph;Q) being considered identical (see Section V&hyph;S)) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;3 should be used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Mr. Amar Abdilleh Issaq, a senior nurse,  had his left arm smashed by the UNOSOM troops' shots at Banaadir  Hospital.    The director of the Banaadir Hospital, Dr. 'Abd al-Razaq  Hasan Ali, told journalists today that the UNOSOM troops fired  on the hospital through a window facing the UNOSOM base at the  American Embassy. The hospital director said that this  appalling act by UNOSOM troops is inexplicable since in all  situations hospitals and medical centers are to be spared from  such acts. The UNOSOM troops are aware and have a written  explanation of all the areas forming the main Banaadir Hospital.  The director of Banaadir Hospital, Dr. 'Abd al-Razaq Hasan Ali,  said these sort of acts have been committed in the past against  the hospital by UNOSOM troops. He lastly called on world human  rights organizations, world health organizations and others to  condemn the annihilation of patients and doctors targeted by  UNOSOM troops in breach of the international code for hospitals.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Dr Pepper scraps Dollars 600m offer DR PEPPER/SEVEN-UP, the third largest soft drink manufacturer in the US, has pulled out of its plan to go public in a Dollars 600m (Pounds 320m) stock issue because of unfavourable market conditions. The company took the decision to pull the issue late on Wednesday when it realised it could not sell the stock at its original target price of between Dollars 20 and Dollars 23 a share, or even at its revised price of between Dollars 17 and Dollars 18 a share. The issue of about 38m Dr Pepper shares was part of a refinancing plan that involved using new low-interest bank borrowings of approximately Dollars 714m and Dollars 143m of cash in hand to sharply reduce the company's debt load. That plan has also been shelved, but Dr Pepper said it would try to revive the issue, and with it the refinancing plan, when market conditions improve. The Dr Pepper flotation is the latest in a line of recently-cancelled US stock issues, all prompted by concern about the outlook for equity prices and realisation that investors are becoming more selective about the prices they pay for new stock and the companies they are willing to invest in. Potential corporate issuers have also been scared by the experience of some companies that have recently floated stock, but seen the value of their shares fall well below the offer price. Although proceeds from stock issues, both new and secondary, reached a record Dollars 41.3bn in the first half of this year, new stock activity slowed appreciably in the second quarter as the pricing environment deteriorated. Of the 140 initial public offerings (IPOs) that came to the market in the second quarter, 60 were offered at a price below the filing range. One such was Lasmo's Dollars 495m float of its Ultramar North American operations. Many stock issues, especially IPOs, have also been withdrawn at the last minute because of the poor state of the market. Of the 250 IPOs filed so far this year, 53 have been postponed or cancelled, including a Dollars 404m offering from GPM Gas. The new issues slump has also hit foreign companies. Banacci, the Mexican financial group, cancelled its planned Dollars 1.4bn stock offering, part of which would have been in the US.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN VOWS TO STAY IN THE RACE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: POLLS SHOW HER SLIPPING, BUT SHE SAYS SHE'LL MAKE A STRONG RUN FOR  GOVERNOR.  </P> <P> "I'm in this race and I intend to stay in."  </P> <P> With those words, Dianne Feinstein tried Thursday to put to rest speculation  that she may soon get out of the Democratic gubernatorial primary.  </P> <P> In her first meeting with the news media since a statewide poll showed her  effort lagging, Feinstein added, "I believe I'm irreversible on this."  </P> <P> The independent California Poll released earlier this week showed her trailing  Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 53% to 35% among Democrats who were asked in  late October to pick their choice to take on the likely Republican nominee,  U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, next June.  </P> <P> Six months ago the same polling organization found her leading Van de Kamp and  two other potential opponents for the Democratic nomination.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Times Poll in early October also found Feinstein trailing Van de  Kamp, 37% to 25%.  </P> <P> "One of the things I did see in the (latest) California Poll is that my base  remains intact," Feinstein said, referring to the fact that all along she has  received about a third of the vote in most polls.  </P> <P> "The challenge is to build on it, to become more visible, to convince people  that I would be the best choice," Feinstein said. "It's an enormously difficult  thing to do, particularly for someone who has never run statewide before."  </P> <P> And indeed, Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor of San Francisco, has  generated speculation that she may drop out precisely because she has appeared  to be uncertain about how to go about the difficult task of nailing down the  nomination as a newcomer to a statewide campaign.  </P> <P> While Van de Kamp has been actively introducing ballot initiatives that he says  will be his platform for a 1990 governor's race, Feinstein has struggled to  increase her visibility in Southern California, which holds the bulk of the  votes in any election.  </P> <P> Since leasing a condominium in Century City over the summer, Feinstein has  spent more and more of her time south of the Tehachapis, meeting with potential  donors and trying to persuade them that she has a better chance against Wilson  because her support of the death penalty and record as mayor show her to be  tougher and more decisive than Van de Kamp -- a capital punishment opponent who  has been fairly low key in seven years as the state's top law enforcement  official.  </P> <P> Although Feinstein has lagged behind Van de Kamp in raising campaign money, she  said Thursday that she has other assets that will make her a strong candidate  by next March's filing date. One of them, she said, is a willingness to express  strong opinions on current California problems.  </P> <P> Feinstein said it is "sheer folly" to rebuild the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland as  a multilevel structure because the massive damage in the recent earthquake  proved that the design was unsound.  </P> <P> And she charged that no one in state leadership is discussing whether the Bay  Bridge, also damaged, can safely serve the area in the future after it is  reopened later this month.  </P> <P> "What the earthquake really showed," Feinstein said, "is . . . how bad our  policies for the future really are."  </P> <P> Feinstein also charged that Van de Kamp would not be able to work with the  Legislature to solve problems because he has antagonized lawmakers with his  so-called ethics initiative, which would limit the terms of legislators.  </P> <P> "I think Pete Wilson and John Van de Kamp are very nice people," Feinstein  said. "But they are part of the politics of the past."  </P></p>

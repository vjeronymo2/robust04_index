			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said that  common historical and cultural heritage linking Pakistan with  the Central Asian states could pave the way for a useful  economic cooperation. The prime minister was addressing a  seminar on Central Asia as part of deliberations of the World  Economic Forum. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan is  ideally situated in the region to promote economic cooperation  in the area.    [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is placed at an exciting  geographical location, and Pakistan had always enjoyed its own  sense of strategic importance. Previously, it enjoyed its  importance because of the Cold War and the fact that it was  bordering the communist state -- the Soviet Union. But with the  collapse of the Soviet Union a new world emerged, new  opportunities emerged for us in Pakistan. Because it paved the  way for us to reestablish our links which had historically  existed with the Central Asian republics. So, we are seeking to  build our regional links with the Central Asian republics not  only in diplomatic terms or commercial terms, but we are also  seeking to build these links in communication terms. Pakistan  is an important country because Pakistan is the gateway to  different regional groupings. One, Pakistan is a gateway to  South Asia, and in fact, Pakistan is also a member of the South  Asian association of regional countries. Pakistan is situated  right in the center, where to one side we have South Asia, to  another side we have the Persian Gulf, and yet to another side  we have Central Asia. And that is why we feel that in today's  world, Pakistan is an important center for potential investors  because any investment in Pakistan can be rerouted in three  different directions. So, Pakistan is a gateway to three very  important trading areas and potential market. [end recording]    Economic policies of the government offer better  opportunities for foreign investors which will in turn help  promote economic stability in the region. The president of  Turkey, Mr. Suleyman Demirel; president of Turkmenistan;  president of Kazakhstan; and president of Uzbekistan also  addressed the seminar.</p>

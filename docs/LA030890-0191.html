			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> YUDELSON SUES TO HALT PRINGLE FUND RAISING  </P> <P> Democratic Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson has filed a lawsuit against  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) that seeks to halt the incumbent's  fund raising, alleging that he received improper contributions.  </P> <P> The suit is identical to a complaint that Yudelson filed with the state Fair  Political Practices Commission last August.  </P> <P> But Yudelson said the FPPC investigation is taking too long, allowing Pringle  to use the disputed contributions in his reelection campaign.  </P> <P> "Why should Pringle be allowed to build his campaign war chest in such an  outrageous scofflaw manner?" Yudelson said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which was filed in Orange County Superior Court, focuses on  $55,012 that Pringle raised last year to defend himself against a threatened  recall attempt and a lawsuit.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was brought by voters who charged that their civil rights were  violated on Election Day in 1988 when Pringle's campaign hired uniformed guards  at polling places in predominantly Latino neighborhoods. It has since been  settled for $480,000.  </P> <P> Yudelson charges that the money Pringle raised for the recall and the lawsuit  should be subject to the $1,000 contribution limit that was approved by voters  in 1988. Pringle has responded, however, that the limits do not apply to the  lawsuit or the threatened recall, only primary and general election campaigns.  </P> <P> Pringle said Wednesday he believes Yudelson's suit was intended only to get  publicity.  </P> <P> The suit asks that Pringle be prevented from raising any more money for his  campaign until the disputed funds are repaid. No date has been set for a court  hearing on the issue, said attorney Mark Rosen, representing Yudelson. DAVE  LESHER  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: The touch of a virtuoso - Cinema THE PIANO (15) Jane Campion DIRTY WEEKEND (18) Michael Winner HOCUS POCUS (PG) Kenny Ortega IT IS the 1850s. You are a mute Scottish woman sent to wildest New Zealand to marry a landowner you have never met. Your father arranged the marriage; your little daughter goes with you. You insist on taking one luxury object, your piano. You already hold the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare  -or much of them - inside your grave, well-schooled Victorian head. But soon things will change. The brittle battlements of art and education will be stormed by new emotions, new passions, new horrors. Jane Campion's The Piano, which won this year's Cannes Golden Palm, is a masterpiece: more, an astonishing masterpiece. We know we are on inspiration's Cloud Nine from the early scenes. The black-garbed heroine (Holly Hunter) transported ashore on sailors' shoulders looks like a giant sea-born spider being carried towards Eden. Behind her the sky is a lowering, ominous water-colour. Before her lies the beach, a silver-white sheet on which she sets down her life's few, surreal essentials. Chiefly that packing-cased piano, on which she plays a few wistful notes through a crack in the planking. But, first rumble of doom: husband-to-be Sam Neill will not spare the servant-power to carry it to his home. Second rumble of doom: his estate manager Baines (Harvey Keitel) will spare the manpower to carry it to his home. With her piano held hostage by this Scottish hulk, half gone-native with his daubs of Maori make-up, Hunter can only win the instrument back - in key-by-key barter - by giving Keitel lessons. The lessons consist of her offering him musical instruction and him offering her initially-resisted physical attentions. These start with eyes poring over her petite figure encased in voluminous black; then graduate to a finger delicately sounding a stocking-hole; then consummate in an erotic wrestling match watched by the horrified Neill. Once again a crack in wooden planking is the fateful - soon to be tragic - point of access. Is this the first ever film to depict the growth of erotic feelings from the woman's viewpoint - first as victim, later as willing accomplice? Or is it just the first film to do so unforgettably? Campion, with her cameraman Stuart Dryburgh and sound designer Lee Smith, make the whole landscape of this dank, twisted jungle seem part of the emotional maze closing around the heroine. For days after seeing the movie, you hear the swish of hooped dresses on muddy forest floor or the crackle of condescension, like dry twigs, as Mr Neill's family 'welcomes' the new non-speaking bride. (Says an aunt: 'There's nothing so easy to like as a pet and they're quite silent'.) But this mute heroine presides over a movie of piercing eloquence. As well as orchestrating her supersensitive soundtrack, Campion provides images that swell in the memory. As in her first feature Sweetie - the calling-card of a genius even before she gave us An Angel At My Table - the New Zealand-born director's screen pictures are never just exotic backcloth. They extend landscape and gesture, human face and inhuman wilderness into metaphor. Marvel at the moment when the camera, placed behind Hunter, rises and moves mysteriously in towards her hair-knot, then on beyond into the dark, mist-strewn forest. It is as if we are passing right through her mind into her mind's gathering nightmare. The Piano is about disorientation. But more, it is about emotional free-fall; about the fateful plunge we humans go on willingly risking - in music, sex, passion, in almost every profound human transaction - from first diffident address to ultimate self-offering or self-immolation. If the love story is one variation on the theme, another is the heroine's vertiginous reaching out towards another world, another culture. In this imperial outpost barely quarantined from barbarism, superstition is not just the natives' prerogative. The Victorian interlopers have their own dotty mystical panaceas. When the adult-mimicking children are caught playing games of mock sexual embrace with the forest trees, they are ordered by the grown-ups to wash them down. In this empire of unreason Campion finds the perfect setting for her climax of plausible horror. The discovery of infidelity; the husband's rage; the act of mutilation; and the human cry so loud, so unnerving that it seems to bounce off the heavens and back again. But in this film, even after the horror, it is the mystery that we remember. The words that never issue from Hunter's mouth - though we sense them moving about behind those clenched, luminously responsive features - are the words that never issue from the film. Born to deal with passions beyond reason, we on Earth know that the inexpressible, the incommunicable, lives out there in the jungle beyond words. The triumph of The Piano is that it finds a language of its own in its vocabulary of image and metaphor; and that it reminds us of a time, before the world was glibly dubbed a 'global village', when human beings had a proper, primal awe of the distances separating land from land, man from man, and man from woman. Any movie week that starts with the sublime usually ends up with the other commodity. Female self-emancipation comes in different sizes and guises, and in Michael Winner's Dirty Weekend it is large, loud and lunatic. With Charles Bronson now giving up mugger-chasing for free bus travel, Lia Williams has been tapped as Mr W's new gun-toting, knife-toting, scowl-toting citizen-vigilante. She is Bella, heroine of Helen Zahavi's acclaimed (by some) novel about a young woman who turns avenging angel against male harassment. She does this over one busy weekend in Brighton. A hammer to the cranium of a Peeping Tom, a plastic bag over the head of a Tired Businessman, bullets to the bodies of three alley thugs . . . And the important thing is that Bella enjoys it all. 'This is jolly, isn't it?' she says during one paroxysm of perforation. And by the final reel she is spending her last night in Brighton ridding the famous pier of a vagrant serial killer. Typically of a Winner film, this nocturnal finale takes place in what seems to be broad daylight. But when did our Mr W ever care about realism? Enough that the celluloid passes through the camera; that the post-dubbed voices match the lip movements; and that a series of stalwart British actors earn their crust by making unbelievable dialogue sound believable. Miss Williams, fresh from Oleanna on the London stage, manages to give a demon polish even to lines like 'You piece of stateless scum', uttered to Ian Richardson's interesting impersonation of an Asian clairvoyant. After a short struggle I gave up and enjoyed this film. Certainly it is omega to the alpha of The Piano. Certainly it is crude, rude and preposterous. But at least it is lively. And what is life without lurid contrasts between the Good and Bad? Anything would be better than Hocus Pocus. For dirty weekend read Disney Hallowe'en. Bette Midler, wearing buck teeth and an orange fright-wig, scampers across the skies of Salem, Massachusetts, casting spells, singing songs and bearing an eerie resemblance to another famous lady with flashing eyes and forceful front teeth. But 'Margaret Thatcher, The Salem Years' this, alas, is not. Rather the film tells of three reincarnated witches and the youngsters who tediously combat them, helped by a cat and a friendly walking corpse. The script is bad, the songs worse, the jokes nowhere to be found. But then spoof Gothicism cannot be expected to flourish in the wake of Vincent Price's death. That velvet snarl; that leonine scowl; farewell to the greatest actor of his genre. I shall be writing more about the cinema's Demon King, and recalling a recent conversation on Saturday.</p>

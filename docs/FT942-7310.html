			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / MPs urge replacement of PIA head A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday called for the replacement of the chairman of the much-criticised Personal Investment Authority, the planned watchdog to protect private investors. Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, has previously come under fire from Labour MPs. The insurance group Legal &amp; General, where he was formerly chief executive, was fined heavily for failure to meet regulatory standards. There is no sign, however, that Mr Palmer will resign from the PIA. He still has the backing of the Treasury, and insisted yesterday that he would stay as chairman. The call for a new chairman came against the background of general concern about the role of PIA directors who were public-interest appointments even though they had long associations with the financial services industry. The report, agreed by all but one of the Treasury committee of MPs after a stormy debate, said serious changes were necessary for the PIA to achieve credibility and authority. The committee said the government should legislate to allow SIB to refuse to regulate financial services organisations for which another appropriate regulator exists, instead of such organisations being able to insist on being regulated directly by SIB. SIB would welcome this power, but the government is most unlikely to want to legislate at all on financial services, so its prospects look doubtful. The MPs proposed conditions to be attached to SIB's decision to recognise the PIA as the regulator for retail financial services. These conditions related to the public-interest PIA board members. The most important and difficult was to give the PIA board a clear majority of public-interest members excluding the chief executive. They also proposed SIB approve public-interest appointments and that public-interest directors should be nominated by outside organisations, such as the Treasury and relevant consumer interests. The tensions which were a feature of reaching an agreed report burst into the open yesterday, undermining the force of its recommendations. Some committee members distanced themselves from those recommendations which they had opposed. Tory MPs said they did not support the criticism of Mr Palmer. Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour MP who was the only committee member to vote against the report, described the manoeuvrings needed to reach an agreed report as a 'disgrace'. The committee broke up in disagreement last Wednesday when Mr Barry Legg, a Conservative, proposed amendments making structural changes to the PIA. Mr John Watts, chairman, revised his original draft and on Monday Tory members reluctantly accepted a revised report, which took a harder line on the PIA. The government and regulators welcomed the committee's support for one regulator for retail financial services, and its recognition of the need to introduce the improvements in investor protection. Mr Eddie George, governor of the bank of England, yesterday defended Mr Palmer, saying that he would contribute to an improvement of standards in the retail financial sector. During testimony to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee, Mr George said he believed Mr Palmer carried credibility 'with the constituency he represents' and that he can earn the confidence of the general public by putting the machinery of the PIA into place.

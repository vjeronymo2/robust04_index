Addressing in Vilnius a news  conference he said that the withdrawal from Lithuania of the  Russian troops and the signing of the trade and economic  agreements helped develop bilateral cooperation. Jursenas  voiced regret that some agreements signed by prime ministers,  including those on bilateral trade, are not being implemented.    The speaker believes that the two sides should not only  comply with the documents, they should more dynamically discuss  the urgent problems. He believes the delay in solving some  problems may play into the hands of the politicians who are  trying hard to present Russia as the main source of threats and  dangers.    Speaking about the internal situation in Lithuania, Jursenas  said that it was stabilizing and this year there are chances to  improve it.    However, the prospect for stabilization of the domestic  situation, said the speaker, do not suit the interests of the  extreme right-wing opposition, which does all it can to put  Lithuania into a distress situation.    The speaker reminded about the abortive strike declared by  farmers ten days ago.    Jursenas described as an attempt to deteriorate the  political  atmosphere the recent call by four opposition factions in  parliament to hold a referendum on early elections, "no doubt,  these attempts will be futile and the parliament will work until  its powers expire in the autumn of 1996.</p>

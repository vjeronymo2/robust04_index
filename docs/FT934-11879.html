			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: India software group to fight US action INDIA'S largest software company is filing a suit in the US in protest at claims that it broke American law governing the conditions under which its Indian engineers were sent to work in the US, writes Stefan Wagstyl from New Delhi. Tata Consultancy Services, a member of Tata, India's biggest industrial grouping, is reacting to a suit filed in California this month by Californians for Population Stabilisation, an anti-immigration lobby group, which alleges that Tata Consultancy and Hewlett Packard, the US computer maker, infringed American labour laws. In a suit filed in the Superior Court of California, CAPS alleged that Tata, which had sent employees to work on contract at Hewlett Packard, had ignored US provisions on pay, holidays and payroll taxes. Tata Consultancy denies the claims and plans to file a counter-suit denouncing the CAPS action as malicious. The suit comes amid growing concern among US software engineers that software engineers from India, the former Soviet Union and other countries are taking their jobs by working at a fraction of American rates. Their cause was taken up by CBS, the television network, which this month broadcast a documentary alleging that Indian and other software companies were supplying low-cost staff to US companies. The arguments are important for the international software industry because software engineers from poor countries are ready to work at lower rates than Americans.</p>

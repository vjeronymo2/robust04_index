			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tapping institutional investors - Has the nursing home sector saturated the market? THE POOR performance of Court Cavendish's shares in their first two days of trading as a quoted company has raised questions for investors who have chosen the nursing home sub-sector as a growth area. Court Cavendish was floated at 225p a share, valuing the company at Pounds 51m. Its issue involved raising Pounds 40m through the sale of 17.7m new shares, as well as existing shareholders selling 2.56m shares. Although the public offer was 2.2 times subscribed and allocations were scaled down, the shares had fallen to 198p by last night's close, 27p below the issue price. Last week another nursing home group, CrestaCare, raised Pounds 33.3m through a placing, doubling its market value. There is also persistent speculation that Takare, the market leader, will return to the market for new equity in September - speculation described by Mr Hamilton Anstead, deputy managing director, as idle and irresponsible. So has the healthy appetite for nursing home shares suddenly faded? CrestaCare's advisers say they found no difficulty in finding buyers for the company's new shares, even after a placing of over 20 per cent of the group's equity as recently as March. One excuse put forward for Court Cavendish's dismal initial showing was that the CrestaCare placing - which came between the closing of Court Cavendish's offer and its first dealings - sated institutional investors desire for stock. When stags tried to sell their shares they found no institutional demand, and the weight of selling pushed Court Cavendish's price down. But one institutional investor gave another reason. He believes that Court Cavendish, placed fifth in the market behind the likes of Takare and Westminster Health Care, was overpriced given its record - or even that it should not have floated at all. He points to its record of losses since formation four years ago and a refinancing two years ago. In effect, he says, the flotation was another refinancing exercise. Court Cavendish is using the money to repay debt of Pounds 24.6m and to fund further expansion. Others say that Court Cavendish's policy of buying nursing homes, many converted from old, large houses with extra accommodation added, compared badly with the policy of the market leaders of building their own homes to particular specifications. Another consideration is that the industry has been affected by the changes to the government's funding of nursing home care on April 1, which has slightly depressed occupancy rates and put some pressure on pricing. However, most accept that this is a short term effect, and in the longer term the reforms should increase private sector provision of nursing homes. The wider question, though, is how long this young but fast-growing industry will need to suck in new equity capital to expand. Once established with a high occupancy rate, nursing homes are highly cash generative. But even so the rapid expansion rates of many companies, which can see demand for beds fast outstripping supply, means relatively young companies cannot finance their expansion internally. Takare, which joined the Official List in 1989, has raised Pounds 67.2m through three equity issues, and another Pounds 50m through a 20-year debenture secured on some of its homes. At the time of its last placing in September 1991, which raised Pounds 35.4m, Takare promised not to issue more equity for two years, hence the speculation that it will come to the market this autumn. But Mr Anstead says Takare has sufficient bank facilities never to come to the equity market again, although conceding this would take its gearing to 100 per cent at some future date before rising cash flow brought debt down once more. He says the company is not ruling out an equity issue but will not make one if there is not the appetite for it. Mr Kent Phippen, finance director of Westminster Health Care, which floated in April with an issue raising Pounds 63m, says that there are early signs of a leasing market for nursing homes developing in the UK. Such a market operates well in the US, but may take a couple of years before opening here. He believes that with many homes operated under long-term contract to health authorities, the guaranteed revenue stream should entice institutions more used to investing in office blocks. All in all, there is still confidence that Court Cavendish's experience of apparently poor institutional demand for its shares should not put a damper on the industry as a whole.</p>

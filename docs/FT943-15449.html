			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Peruvian economy surges Peru has retained its position as Latin America's most dynamic economy in the first five months of this year, with growth rates that have outstripped expectations, including those of the government. The government said the economy grew by an annual rate of 11.8 per cent in the first five months of the year, compared with growth forecasts of 4 to 5 per cent for 1994 as a whole. The expansion is in most sectors, but has been marked in fishing, with catches a third higher than last year - when they were also good following a downturn in 1991 and 1992. Peru is the world's third largest fishing nation and the leader in fishmeal exports. This year, the industry expects to exceed 1993's 1.13m tonnes of fishmeal exports by some 20 per cent.</p>

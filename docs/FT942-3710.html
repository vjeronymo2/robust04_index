			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Murdoch cut BBC to please China Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has finally admitted that he kicked BBC World Service Television off his Star TV system in Asia to please the Chinese government and help estab-lish the satellite service there. In an interview with Mr William Shawcross, author of a Murdoch biography, for Esquire magazine, Mr Murdoch conceded he had perhaps taken the action 'a bit too easily because of my feelings for the BBC'. Mr Murdoch also argued that it was pointless doing any broadcasting in Asia except in local languages. But he accepted that those arguments did not meet the main criticisms that had been made of him in an editorial in the International Herald Tribune. 'There's no answer to it. They say it's a cowardly way, but we said in order to get in there and get accepted, we'll cut the BBC out,' said the News Corporation chairman. 'I was well aware that the freedom fighters of the world would abuse me for it. I think my credentials are good enough to be able to see me through that one. But I don't want to do it through the medium of the BBC,' Mr Murdoch added. The BBC agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star TV system which covers Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan before its contract ran out at the end of this year. In return News Corp was able to negotiate an extension into 1996 to keep its service on the southern beam covering the Indian sub-continent. In a speech in London last September Mr Murdoch spoke of how advances in technology 'have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. It was an argument that clearly impressed the Chinese government.</p>

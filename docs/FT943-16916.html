			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fiat confident of return to the black Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, should return to profit this year, Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman, said yesterday. Fiat recorded the largest loss in its history last year - L1,783bn (Dollars 1.11bn) after tax and minority interests - but Mr Agnelli told shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that the company's full-year result would 'certainly be better than break-even'. At a press conference after the meeting, the chairman indicated that, unless market conditions deteriorated, the board would also consider paying a dividend on ordinary shares this time next year. This year Fiat did not propose an ordinary share dividend, for the first time since 1947. In the first four months of 1994, Mr Agnelli said Fiat had increased turnover by L1,865bn to L19,819bn - up more than 10 per cent on the same period in 1993. Operating profit for the period was about 1 per cent of sales, after L700bn of research and development expenditure, compared with an operating loss in the first four months of last year. For the full year, Mr Agnelli said Fiat was expecting an increase in consolidated sales to more than L62,000bn, from L54,556bn in 1993, and an improvement in net borrowings, which stood at L5,247bn at the end of 1993. Mr Cesare Romiti, group chief executive, said net debt was L3,700bn at the end of May. Mr Agnelli blamed the effects of the international recession, and in particular the difficult situation in the European automotive sector, for the poor results last year. 'To some extent this had been expected, but no source had predicted the scale of the disaster until well into the year,' he told shareholders. 'It can only be matched by the collapse in demand after the first oil shock 20 years ago.' He said the overall European car market had begun to recover in 1994, recording a 5 per cent increase in sales during the first five months. But in Italy, car sales declined by 4 per cent against the equivalent period last year, adding to the 20 per cent drop in 1993. Mr Agnelli pointed out that in France, Spain and Denmark - where the governments have taken measures to improve demand - car sales had increased substantially in the first five months of 1994. However, Mr Agnelli denied that Fiat had lobbied the new Italian government for incentives. Fiat is placing a lot of faith in the Punto, its new small car launched last year, and its new 'integrated' factory in southern Spain which began producing the vehicle in January. The group said yesterday that by the end of May it had received 420,000 orders for the Punto and delivered 225,000 vehicles. Separately, Mr Agnelli said negotiations between Fiat and Renault of France, about pooling their foundry resources around the world, had ended.</p>

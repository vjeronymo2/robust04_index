Ross made this statement in the television program "Open  Agenda" during which he announced over 3 million union members  will participate in a consultation process called "the  parliament of the labor centers."    He recalled that union debate on the measures the country  should adopt to reorganize its finances and revitalize the  economy began yesterday on an experimental basis in the western  Province of Pinar del Rio. Numerous meetings of companies  related to the food and fishing industries took place in Pinar  del Rio.    Ross considered the debates held with workers from Pinar del  Rio as broad, open, and fruitful. Ross said that the workers  proposed such measures as increasing the price of electricity;  charging a fee for sports and cultural events; and creating and  selling national bonds recoverable within a period of five to 10  years.    Ross added that there is a broad consensus regarding the  need  to seek ways to recover the money illegally obtained by Cubans  who are locally called "macetas" [profiteers]. He emphasized  that these "macetas" have built their fortunes by exploiting the  needs of others.    Ross confirmed that the consultation process will include in  its first stage (until 29 January) over 400,000 union leaders,  and after 29 January, meetings will be conducted in all the  country's labor centers.    The popular debate on the serious economic-financial  situation was recommended last December by the National Assembly  of the People's Government (Parliament). During the  Parliament's regular session, it was learned that Cuba faces an  excess of currency in circulation amounting to more than 12  billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official currency  exchange).    It was also learned in Parliament that 30 percent of state  companies are unprofitable and it was estimated that the  subsidies to just the sugar industry in the past three years  reached 7.2 billion pesos.    Ross Leal's statement was preceded by the publication  yesterday in the weekly TRABAJADORES of an editorial which urged  the union sectors to "take part in the kneading of the bread of  decisionmaking rather than sitting back and smelling it as it is  baking."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 20 (CTK) -- New Director General  of the Slovak News Agency TA SR Ivan Melichercik singled out  improving news services as his major task in an interview with  CTK today.    "News services must be given absolute priority and the rest  is nothing but a parasite, including publishing activities,"  stressed Melichercik who replaced Dusan Kleiman yesterday.    But he said that not the quality of the services, but "the  case of the daily REPUBLIKA" had led the government to change  the agency's director.    REPUBLIKA, the sole national paper supporting the current  opposition led by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar, ran into a loss of  18 million crowns (about 545,454 USD) last year. The law does  not allow organisations partially funded from the state budget,  which is the case of TA SR, to engage in business activities  ending at a loss.    "It is clear that a paper of this type cannot exist on the  soil of an agency which is striving for maximum objectivity and  impartiality," Melichercik stressed. He added that  privatisation of REPUBLIKA would solve the problem.    But Melichercik said this may take a long time because the  debt plus the title's value of 13.5 million crowns made up the  purchasing price and no prospective buyer had appeared as yet.    TA SR now has a staff of 350, including 130 journalists 30  of  whom work for REPUBLIKA. 15 correspondents work in regions and  eight abroad, including two in Prague and one in Brno, South  Moravia. The home and the sports desks each publish about 80  news items per day, the foreign desk about 130, the economics  desk 60 and the export desk 20-30.    Melichercik said he wanted to increase the number of  staffers  in the home and foreign desks and "to part with those who have  not mastered agency work."    He said he regretted that cooperation with CTK had not been  established yet while TA SR was cooperating with all agencies  from the other neighbouring states.    But Melichercik added he was pleased with today's proposal  from CTK Director General Milan Stibral to meet soon.</p>

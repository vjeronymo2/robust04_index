			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Excerpts] Dushanbe, 9 June -- The commander of Russian  border troops in Tajikistan, Lieutenant General Anatoliy  Chechulin, has described the operational situation on a wide  section of the Tajik-Afghan border as extremely complex. He  said the situation had deteriorated seriously during the last  few days. The general was speaking at a hurriedly summoned news  conference to discuss the latest major provocation against  Russian border guards in the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy  border detachment. [passage omitted]    These provocations, Anatoliy Chechulin stressed, are not the  best prelude for the second round of inter-Tajik talks  provisionally scheduled for 17 June in Tehran. The Russian  general pinned the blame for the continued provocations both on  the extremist wing of the Tajik opposition and on the civilian  and military authorities in certain Afghan border districts, who  pay lip service to stabilization of the Afghan border situation  but, at the same time, directly facilitate the staging of these  provocations. He declared that the most decisive measures would  be taken against "the instigators and organizers of aggression,"  whom the general held entirely responsible for the possible  consequences.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOT TOPIC: The county heat records falling this week (B1) were set in 1907 when  heat was harder to handle. . . . The Santa Ana Daily Evening Blade reported an  "ice famine," in which ice was rationed for refrigerators only. . . . Ice  shipments from Los Angeles were stopped at the height of the heat wave, causing  intense resentment here. . . . June has long been a freakish month in Orange  County. The highest June temperature occurred early in the month (112 degrees  on June 1, 1879), but a meager 87-degree record for June 14 has stood for 86  years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENANTS OF ILLEGAL UNITS MAY RECEIVE EVICTION FEE  </P> <P> Property owners who illegally convert garages or other portions of their  buildings into rental units would have to pay up to $5,000 to tenants who must  move because of substandard conditions under an ordinance approved Wednesday by  the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> Tenants' rights attorneys praised the measure because it would require  relocation assistance for renters who are evicted from illegal dwellings as the  result of Building and Safety Department inspections.  </P> <P> "This is literally going to help thousands of poor people who before today did  not have any protection from evictions," said Mary Lou Villar, an attorney with  the East Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation. "Up until now, if you were kicked  out of a garage, you were out on the street."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4,500 in East Valley  </P> <P> East San Fernando Valley Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who co-sponsored the  ordinance with Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, estimated that there are about  4,500 illegal garage dwellings in his district. He said the number is derived  from an informal survey of Department of Building and Safety complaints in his  district in the last two years.  </P> <P> "At least now these tenants will have a little money to get a start someplace  else," Bernardi said. "Now we can penalize landlords for the benefit of those  people whom they have been feeding on."  </P> <P> City law requires landlords of legal dwellings to pay for tenant relocation  when renters are evicted for extensive renovation or for repairs that have been  ordered by the Department of Building and Safety. But a loophole in the law did  not require property owners of illegal units to do the same.  </P> <P> "The law has to apply equally to every landlord, whether it's an illegal unit  or not," said Flores, who introduced the measure after learning about a  Wilmington apartment owner who illegally converted a three-car garage into  three apartments.  </P> <P> "Now greedy landlords who don't care about humanity but only care about the  almighty dollar are going to have to think twice before they rent out an  illegal apartment," Flores said.  </P> <P> The ordinance, passed on a 12-0 vote by the council, was sent to Mayor Tom  Bradley for consideration. Bradley has not taken a position on the measure.  </P> <P> It would largely affect homeowners who convert back-yard garages into  apartments or build illegal additions to their homes, said Barbara Zeidman,  director of the city's rent stabilization unit.  </P> <P> "I think this very clearly says we are not going to turn our back and look the  other way when it comes to illegal dwellings," Zeidman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighbors Make Reports  </P> <P> Neighbors commonly report such units to city building inspectors because the  dwellings often pose sanitation and other hazards, such as poor plumbing,  exposed wiring and bootlegged gas lines.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, renters who are disabled, 62 or older or have children  would receive $5,000. Single adults would receive $2,000.  </P> <P> A tenant who reports his landlord to building officials would be eligible to  collect relocation assistance if inspectors ordered the tenant to vacate an  illegal unit for safety reasons, according to Mel Bliss, chief of the Bureau of  Community Safety.  </P> <P> City officials and tenant attorneys did not express concern over this  possibility.  </P> <P> "We have to attach a financial penalty to those who rent illegal units,"  Zeidman said.  </P> <P> Although the number of illegal dwellings in Los Angeles is not known, a Los  Angeles Times investigation in May, 1987, revealed that about 42,000 illegal  garage dwellings shelter about 200,000 people throughout Los Angeles County.  The garage homes, an outgrowth of the region's lack of affordable housing, lie  in a swath of mostly low-income Latino neighborhoods from Sylmar through East  Los Angeles into Long Beach, The Times study showed.  </P> <P> Landlords usually collect between $200 and $400 a month for a garage dwelling,  depending on the extent of improvements.  </P></p>

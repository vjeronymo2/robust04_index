			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Independent News takes 25% stake in Irish Press Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing and media company, has taken a 24.9 per cent stake in the Irish Press, Ireland's second largest newspaper group, in what is seen as a defensive move. Mr Conrad Black's Telegraph Group is also understood to have been interested in taking a stake in the ailing company, which is losing IPounds 300,000 (Pounds 295,000) a month. Independent, headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, is anxious to prevent a takeover of the Irish Press by non-Irish interests which could introduce low-cost production and threaten sales of Independent's titles, which dominate the Irish daily, weekly and provincial markets. Although the Irish Press said it was looking for additional investors, Independent is expected to have a say on who they will be. Mr Richard Bruton, Irish minister for enterprise and employment, has requested details of the investment in order to decide if it has to be approved under Irish monopolies legislation. The stake is just under the 25 per cent level above which it would automatically need government approval. Independent has paid IPounds 1.13m for 24.9 per cent of the two operating companies in the group, Irish Press Newspapers and Irish Press Publications. Also, it has provided a secured loan of IPounds 2m for working capital which has assured the imm-ediate survival of the papers. The investment was not made in the holding company, Irish Press, as it is currently involved in legal proceedings with a previous investor in the Irish Press, Ingersoll Irish Publications, owned by Mr Ralph Ingersoll, a US businessman.</p>

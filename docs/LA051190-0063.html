			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> COUPLES LEADS WITH 69, BUT AVERAGE SCORE IS 78.9  </P> <P> Fred Couples was quick to admit that "a lot of luck was involved" in a  wind-blown three-under-par 69 in Thursday's first round of the Memorial  tournament.  </P> <P> His was the only sub-par round of the wet, cold, windy day when the average  score was 78.9.  </P> <P> Winds gusted to 40 m.p.h. and caused a wind-chill factor in the 30s. Some rain  squalls and occasional hail were added.  </P> <P> Greg Norman was tied for second at 73 with Hale Irwin, Lanny Wadkins, Corey  Pavin, Don Pooley, Peter Persons and Jay Delsing.  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, the tour's leading money-winner for the year, shot an 88.  </P> <P> "I have only two things to say. WD," Calcavecchia said.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus had a 78 and said he played very well. Two-time U.S. Open  champion Curtis Strange shot 80, 43 on the back. Former PGA champion Jeff  Sluman played the front in 46 and picked up.  </P></p>

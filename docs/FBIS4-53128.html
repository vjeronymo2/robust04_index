			<p>BFN     [Text] National Security Council [NSC] chief Gen Charan  Kunlawanit strongly opposes any foreign assistance to the  Cambodian army, and has warned that military aid will only  prolong the war in Cambodia.    An informed government source said Charan made his views  known during a visit by the Australian secretary for foreign  affairs about two weeks ago. The source quoted Charan as saying  that providing arms is not the best way to achieve a lasting  peace in Cambodia.    Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk recently called for foreign  military aid, saying it was the only way the end the war with  the Khmer Rouge, and named Australia, France and the United  States as likely providers.    Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said yesterday that  Canberra considered it "wholly legitimate, and consistent with  the Paris Peace Accords, for the Cambodian government to seek  such assistance from the international community in order to  maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity".    He said Australia is considering Cambodia's request for  weapons but will consult and take into account the views of  other interested countries, including Thailand.    Charan also expressed concern that the poorly-paid and  ill-disciplined Cambodian troops will eventually sell off the  foreign arms.    Sarot Chawanawirat, deputy permanent secretary for foreign  affairs, said the Cambodian government was entitled to seek  help, but Thailand believed that providing arms to Cambodia  would only prolong the fighting there.</p>

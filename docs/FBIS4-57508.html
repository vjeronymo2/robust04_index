			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Amid the island's economic  crisis, Cubans are looking for practical solutions to their most  pressing problems, a subject that will be broached today in  neighborhood assemblies in Havana.    Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly of  the  People's Government (parliament), told National Television's  channel six that all officials who have any responsibility  whatsoever in the social development process must attend the  neighborhood assemblies.    Crombet said that "we do not want monologues or useless  meetings" and added that the meetings to discuss daily problems  will be attended by everyone from representatives of  administrative organizations in each neighborhood to directors  of schools, hospitals, clinics, and stores.    He admitted that things are not working the same everywhere,  thus the government must place greater emphasis on the big  cities to handle difficulties expeditiously.    The first assembly of District 40, located in the Havana  municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, was held today.  Initiatives were proposed at the meeting to improve the  community.    District Deputy Mario Rios commented on his experience at  the  assembly and said he presented problems to the community so  solutions could be found collectively.</p>

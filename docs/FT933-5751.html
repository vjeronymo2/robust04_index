			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Czech economy set for recovery THE Czech economy will begin its recovery in the second half of this year and expand more rapidly in 1994, according to Mr Jiri Pospisil, the monetary policy director at the Czech National Bank, writes Patrick Blum in Prague. 'Private consumption is growing. The government is relaxing its restrictive policy and we expect a rise in public consumption in the second half. There has been a rise in imports of investment goods, and the construction sector is doing well,' he said. A 4 per cent fall in industrial production for the first six months exaggerated the impact of temporary factors, he said. Many businesses closed for inventories before the country's split and the introduction of value added tax. An estimated 30-40 per cent drop in exports to Slovakia was offset by export growth elsewhere.</p>

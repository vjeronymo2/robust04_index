			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan has promised to closely study the  status of U.S. firms subject to the secondary Arab boycott of  Israel, but there will not be a blanket removal of companies  from the so-called blacklist for the time being informed sources  said Wednesday [19 January].    The sources, commenting on ongoing contacts between the  Jordanian government and European and American governments  seeking to end the secondeary boycott, said Jordan did not feel  that the time is opportune to removing the secondary list  altogether.    "Jordan has promised a case-by-case consideration of the  companies involved on the basis of its own national interests  and the interests of the company involved, but it will not  extend a unilateral removal of the secondary boycott at this  point in time, said one source.    The primary Arab boycott of Israel bans Arab dealings with  Israeli companies as well as companies based elsewhere but owned  partly or wholy by the government of Israel or Israeli nationals.    The secondary boycott applies to companies that deal with  Israel or have investments in Israel or use Israeli components  in their products.    The U.S. and several European countries have adopted  legislation to punish companies complying with the requirements  of the Arab Boycott of Israel Bureau.    In simpler terms, it means that any company providing a  certificate that it is not Israeli-owned and its products do not  include Israeli components and the ship carrying their products  does not call at Israeli ports could face stiff fines. These  documents are required by the Arab government enforcing the  boycott, and consignments unaccompanied by these certifications  could be denied entry altogether into their countries.    A lifting of the secondary boycott was one of the key themes  of a recent visit to the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State  Ron Brown, who held talks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, the  occupied territories and Egypt.

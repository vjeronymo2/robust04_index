			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRESS AND PROCRASTINATION;  </P> <P> BUSH'S NICARAGUAN PLAN BUYS TIME BUT PERHAPS LITTLE ELSE  </P> <P> The bipartisan accord on Nicaraguan policy unveiled last Friday by President  Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the congressional leadership is  an impressive and welcome achievement, yet it may be illusory and could presage  trouble ahead.  </P> <P> The new consensus, engineered personally by Baker over the past few weeks, is  impressive because it has sharply narrowed the range of debate in Washington  over Nicaragua. For the first time in years, it is now possible to imagine a  sustainable national approach. Bush and Baker have acknowledged that the Reagan  Administration policy of seeking the overthrow of the Sandinistas has failed.  After almost a decade of bitter conflict between Democrats and Republicans and  the executive branch and Congress -- as well as within both branches and  parties -- there is now some real prospect that Washington can concentrate its  attention and energy on other issues.  </P> <P> This new consensus is possible in part because of broad agreement in Washington  on the security and political objectives of U.S. policy: to prevent Nicaragua  from becoming a Soviet military base, to protect Nicaragua's neighbors from  subversion or attack by the Sandinistas and to promote political opening and  movement toward democracy in Nicaragua. Up to now, however, agreement on these  broad principles -- evident already in the agreement two years ago between  President Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) -- failed to  produce a bipartisan policy because of important continuing differences over  criteria for the evaluation of progress toward these goals, as well as strong  disagreement over the means to achieve them, and because of the deep distrust  between Congress and the executive branch.  </P> <P> The Bush-Baker team managed to produce a heretofore elusive consensus by  demonstrating astute flexibility on matters of substance and of procedure. The  Administration has accepted the point made repeatedly by congressional  Democrats -- that the aim of U.S. policy need not be to oust the Sandinista  regime or force it to "cry uncle," as long as Nicaragua's actions do not  threaten important American interests. And the Bush-Baker team, by conceding to  Congress a chance to review and evaluate Administration policy next November,  has won a chance to speak for U.S. policy in Central America without perpetual  congressional dissent.  </P> <P> Congressional Democrats, for their part, have been persuaded, at least for now,  to trust that Secretary Baker will give diplomacy a real try in Central  America. They are willing to provide further non-military assistance to the  Contras, in part as a means of pressuring the Sandinistas to negotiate with  their opponents. And most Republicans, suspicious of any move to negotiate with  the Sandinistas, are going along with the Baker proposal because aid to the  Contras will be sustained until next February, at which time the Sandinistas  promise to hold free and fair national elections should be tested. The right  believes that the scheduled elections, if held, will provide an opportunity to  weaken and perhaps mortally wound the Sandinistas; if the elections are put off  or blatantly rigged, conservative Republicans expect to build support for  renewed military aid to the Contras.  </P> <P> For all these reasons, the Administration's proposal for humanitarian aid to  the Contras will probably be approved by a wide margin in both Houses. After a  series of cliffhanger votes during the past several years, with the Contra aid  spigot being turned on and off, the Bush-Baker team has succeeded in enlisting  broad support for its policy for almost a year in advance.  </P> <P> The undoubted virtues of the Bush-Baker strategy are that they open the door to  a much more pragmatic regional approach and gives both the Administration and  Central American diplomats some room to maneuver. The problems with this  approach, however, are that it puts the consideration of security issues on  hold, postpones any effort to promote regional economic recovery and leaves the  Contras and others uncertain about eventual U.S. policy -- while Washington  waits for a democratic opening in Nicaragua that could take years to  accomplish.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's plan, unfortunately, makes far more sense in terms of  Washington's politics than in terms of Central America's realities -- or even  of the fundamental priorities of U.S. policy. The danger is that by focusing on  democracy as a goal -- one that all Americans can embrace -- the crucial need  to reach security agreements reducing the Soviet and Cuban presence in  Nicaragua may be postponed. Another problem is that the accord fails to define  any criteria for judging adequate progress toward democracy. For congressional  conservatives, the democratization of Nicaragua is still tantamount to the  Sandinistas' defeat. In any event, it is unlikely that Nicaragua's Marxists  will become Jeffersonians or that Nicaragua will soon resemble Vermont.  </P> <P> If, as is entirely possible, the Sandinistas foreclose the immediate  possibility of losing power, the conservatives will predictably return to  arguing that U.S. interests require the Sandinistas' ouster. The debate in  Washington will then be back close to square one.  </P> <P> The fact is, Congress and the Administration still have not really decided  whether -- as President Bush put it -- "to claim the right to order the  politics of Nicaragua." Until this question is faced, Central America remains  likely to demand an inordinate share of Washington's attention.  </P></p>

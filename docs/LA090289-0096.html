			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAWFORD CONVICTED OF THEFT  </P> <P> Willie Crawford, son of the former Dodger of the same name and a highly  regarded UCLA football player who was dropped from the team this week, was  convicted of theft Aug. 22 in Beverly Hills Municipal Court, court records  show.  </P> <P> Crawford, 19, was sentenced to 24 months' summary probation and ordered to pay  a fine of $352.50. As part of a plea bargain to the misdemeanor charge, he was  ordered by the court to pay $1,494.30 to Nordstrom department store and $298 to  Lisa Papetti, a UCLA student.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, UCLA announced Friday that Damion Lyons, a junior cornerback from  Berkeley, has been suspended for the season.  </P> <P> Lyons and teammate Roman Phifer, a junior linebacker from Pineville, N.C., face  misdemeanor battery charges in the beating last May of a fellow student. Phifer  also has been suspended for the season.  </P> <P> In the Crawford case, Papetti reported to UCLA police on June 7 that a backpack  containing her belongings, including a checkbook and several credit cards, had  been stolen from outside a campus cafeteria.  </P> <P> On June 12, Crawford was detained by Beverly Hills police officers, who found  in his wallet Papetti's driver's license and a credit card issued to her.  </P> <P> Police said that a forged check drawn on Papetti's account was used to pay for  a pizza that was delivered on June 7 to a dorm room shared by Crawford and  teammate Kerry Ferrell, a freshman split end from Piscataway, N.J.  </P> <P> Also, said Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox, charges totaling $1,494.30 were  made on Papetti's account between June 7-12 at a Nordstrom department store in  West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Crawford, who could not be reached for comment, paid Nordstrom that amount on  the day of his sentencing last month, according to the district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Prosecutors explained that under the summary probation agreement, Crawford will  not be under supervision of a probation officer.  </P> <P> A three-sport star at Beverly Hills High, Crawford came to UCLA as a high  school football All-American. After red-shirting last season, he threatened  last spring to overtake Eric Turner, a returning starter, and move into the  starting lineup.  </P> <P> Crawford's father, who retired from baseball in 1977, compiled a .268 lifetime  batting average in 14 major league seasons, including 12 with the Dodgers.  </P></p>

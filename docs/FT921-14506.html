			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Looking down the wrong end of the barrel - The expensive habits of the former Great Western Resources chief THE residents of Friockheim, a small Scottish village north of Dundee, have a sure-fire way of knowing when Dan Pena is entertaining at his castle home: they listen for the nocturnal gunshots. For Mr Pena, chairman and chief executive until recently of Great Western Resources, the troubled US-based oil and gas company quoted in London, likes to take some of his visitors hunting - at night. Positioned on the raised back seat of his four-wheel drive buggy, guests are driven around his 156-acre estate at high speed, gunning for rabbits. But these days, Mr Pena - who proudly displays big game trophies, including a stuffed buffalo, in the castle rooms - may feel as though he is on the other end of the barrel. Great Western shareholders, unhappy with the collapse of the company's share price from 238p in August 1990, to 8p last night, have forced his departure from the company he founded 10 years ago. Mr Pena makes no bones about it, he did not want to go. 'I was terminated without cause,' he says unashamedly. The story is a familiar one to Pena, who was unseated from his previous company, JPK Industries, following a 'boardroom split' in 1982. As with Great Western, the board members decided in Mr Pena's absence to vote him out of the oil refining and marketing company. A former Wall Street whizz-kid with Bear Sterns - and alleged to be the US investment bank's youngest vice-president back in the 1970s - Mr Pena has trodden a controversial path during his time in London. He set up Great Western just months after his abrupt departure from JPK, with Dollars 820 and based in his son's nursery in Los Angeles. Two years later, in 1984, the company was floated in London with a board including the former Governor of New York state, Mr Hugh Carey. Some years later, the Greenwell oil analyst who had helped to float GWR joined as a non-executive director. His name was Peter Lilley. Mr Lilley quit when he became a member of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. Even in the early years, analysts relate that Mr Pena was a larger-than-life figure who kept a pistol in the drawer of his office desk. Stories about Mr Pena's lifestyle are the stuff of legend. He has even been known to attend an exclusive health clinic in Switzerland which uses sheep placenta injections as a method of physical rejuvenation. A fitness fanatic, Mr Pena is proud of his imposing physique. Many of the tales about Pena's taste for the high life were behind increasing shareholder dissatisfaction with the way he ran Great Western. 'He thought nothing of ordering Pounds 250-Pounds 300 bottles of wine when he was in London,' said one close associate who dined with him at Le Gavroche. 'And the company was paying.' Shareholders, including the normally reclusive Kuwait Investment Office, formed a coalition to force his removal when it became apparent that Mr Pena had received more than Dollars 2m in expenses and compensation, in addition to his pay, during fiscal 1990. Of that, Dollars 1.4m was subsequently converted into loans by the company without shareholder approval, as required by the UK stock exchange. Mr Pena claims the company was unaware it needed such approval. With some bitterness he notes a comment from one shareholder that, had GWR not fallen foul of its largest customer, the South Carolina Public Services Authority, no-one would have cared how much he received in corporate money. The group lost some Dollars 32m in revenue from coal shipments to SCPSA which withheld payment because of a dispute over contract pricing. The deal now being hammered out by GWR and Mr Pena's lawyer - he says defiantly he has hired the highest-paid plaintiff lawyer in the US 'just as a safeguard' - will involve the repayment of Dollars 1.4m of loans. GWR is determined that the loans will be repaid from his pay-off and Mr Pena is equally determined to get his golden handshake - no matter how. 'I'm a litigious person,' he says with some relish. 'Litigation keeps people honest.' Until 1989, Mr Pena worked for GWR without an employment contract, living off a relatively insignificant salary, the dividends paid on his stake, and independent means. It was not until entrepreneur Mr Lawrence Hockey-Sweeney offered to buy Mr Pena's 43 per cent voting stock that the board decided to issue contracts. 'Shareholders thought it was a good idea at the time,' says Mr Pena. GWR's dividend policy has come under attack recently by the very shareholders who benefited for so many years. 'One begins to wonder whether one was being fed a line,' said one significant shareholder who prefers to remain anonymous. 'The argument was that there was more emphasis on dividend policy in the UK.' Mr Pena acknowledges that some shareholders preferred to see the dividend go into exploration - which is more usual in oil and gas companies. But he adds that the dividend policy had been designed to draw in a broader shareholder base. Meanwhile, Mr Pena was able to fund the Dollars 1m purchase and Dollars 4m refurbishment of a run down Scottish castle in 1984. The castle is now owned by an off-shore trust the indirect beneficiaries of which are, in Mr Pena's words, the Pena progeny in perpetuity. Mr Pena - of Hispanic origin and the son of a California policeman who he claims has been linked to the CIA - now makes his home there for some four months a year. He has even taken to wearing the Guthrie plaid on occasion. Guthrie Castle, a rambling Victorian castle, boasts a leisure centre, a squash court, and is furnished to a high - and expensive  - standard. Mr Pena is particularly proud of the portraits of himself and his wife - to whom he has renewed his marriage vows three times - which he commissioned from Mr Howard Morgan. Both hang in the castle, one a regal portrait of the lady of the house, the other a dark moody rendering of Mr Pena and his dog Driller, with the castle in the background. Both portraits have been exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery. When asked if he now intended to retire to the seclusion of his Scottish estate, Mr Pena replied that 'anything is possible'. Even political office. Having once considered running for the governorship of California, Mr Pena's ambitions are obviously boundless.</p>

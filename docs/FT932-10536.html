			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / IG Metall to put on more strike pressure IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will step up its strike action in eastern Germany next week by holding further ballots in three states and by calling out more enterprises in Saxony and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. Beginning on Monday, two more enterprises in Saxony will be called out on strike, as well as 'many more' in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. At the same time, ballots will be held in the metal and engineering sectors of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. If the vote in favour of strike action is over 75 per cent, east Germany industry could soon be paralysed. Over 38,000 workers from 61 metal and engineering enterprises and nine steel plants are now on strike. Union officials yesterday said the strike would continue until employers reinstated a contract signed with IG Metall in March 1991. The contract, aimed at equalising western and eastern German wages by next year, would have meant pay increases of over 20 per cent for the metal, engineering and steel sectors throughout the five east German states. Wages are now about 60 per cent of west German levels. However, IG Metall said negotiations between employers and the union in the Saxon capital of Dresden were expected to resume 'very soon,' adding that these talks 'hold the key' to ending the strike. The Dresden talks were broken off last Tuesday after the two sides failed to reach a compromise on how long, if at all, the timetable towards income parity could be put back.

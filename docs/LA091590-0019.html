			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ZOLTAN ROZSNYAI, CONDUCTOR, DIES AT 64;  </P> <P> MUSIC: ORCHESTRA LEADER FLED HUNGARY IN 1956 AND LATER BECAME MUSIC DIRECTOR  FOR THE SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY.  </P> <P> Zoltan Rozsnyai, United States International University music director and  conductor of the school's International Orchestra, died in his sleep at his  home here early Monday morning.  </P> <P> He was 64; death was attributed to a heart attack.  </P> <P> Born in Budapest, Hungary, Rozsnyai first came to international attention as  founder and conductor of the Philharmonia Hungarica in 1956. That was shortly  after he fled to Austria during Hungary's failed revolution that year. Rozsnyai  recruited fellow refugees for his orchestra, based in Vienna. The Philharmonia  Hungarica toured Europe and North America and recorded extensively for the next  10 years.  </P> <P> Rozsnyai made his U.S. debut in December, 1956, as guest conductor with the  Minneapolis Symphony. He became an American citizen in 1967, the same year he  accepted the post of San Diego Symphony music director. Under his leadership,  the local orchestra achieved full professional status, and he conducted the  orchestra's first commercial recording on the Vox label. He resigned as music  director in 1971, citing frustrations over funding and excessive competition  from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which played several dates a year in San  Diego.  </P> <P> After the San Diego Symphony's executive committee tried to extend his  retirement date to 1972, many of his musicians threatened to resign, saying  they lacked confidence in his leadership.  </P> <P> Retired violist Joseph Wagner of Chula Vista, who joined the San Diego Symphony  in 1954, recalled that Rozsnyai "was ambitious in attempting difficult larger  works and helped the orchestra to grow."  </P> <P> In 1977 he was to found a Golden State Opera company in Los Angeles but the  project never materialized.  </P> <P> From 1978 to 1984, Rozsnyai was music director of the Knoxville Symphony, where  he led the orchestra's participation in the 1982 World's Fair.  </P> <P> In 1985, he was recruited to develop USIU's International Orchestra, a 50-piece  ensemble made up of young professional players recruited for a two-year  graduate program in orchestra performance. Most of the members -- who are not  paid but receive room and board and earn master's degrees -- have come from the  People's Republic of China, with a smattering of European and North American  students filling out their ranks.  </P> <P> The International Orchestra made its debut in La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium in  June, 1987. During the academic year, Rozsnyai led the orchestra in monthly  concerts in La Jolla, downtown San Diego's Lyceum Theatre and the San Diego  College Avenue Baptist Church. Among the soloists who played with the  International Orchestra were Ilse von Alpenheim, Gustavo Romero and Anthony  Newman, who premiered his piano concerto with the group.  </P> <P> Rozsnyai is survived by his wife, Alyze Dreiling, International Orchestra  concertmaster, whom he married a year ago. They had one daughter, Alyze  Francesca. He is also survived by three other daughters, a son and four  grandchildren from other marriages.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF changes tack in bid for LTV business THOMSON-CSF of France, which has spent weeks seeking ways around US government hostility to its attempted takeover of LTV's missiles business, has now agreed to take a minor, passive role in an LTV bid being mounted by Loral, the fast-growing US defence business. Loral said yesterday that it and Thomson had agreed in principle to offer Dollars 260m for the LTV division, with Loral paying Dollars 230m for a 94 per cent stake and Thomson paying Dollars 30m, both for a 6 per cent equity interest and convertible debentures which could ultimately take its stake up to 9.9 per cent. Thomson's original bid for the missiles division encountered strong opposition in Washington, on the grounds that the French state-owned company might leak US military secrets to foreign powers. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a review body chaired by the Treasury, was apparently poised to recommend that President Bush block the deal when Thomson withdrew it and tried to find a more acceptable equity structure. The new bid keeps Thomson's stake under the 10 per cent level which normally triggers a CFIUS investigation, but Loral was reported yesterday to have volunteered to submit to such an inquiry anyway. Thomson would have no directorships or 'other managerial prerogatives' in the business, Loral said. Mr Bernard Schwartz, its chairman, said the Department of Defense and the Treasury Department had given the new scheme a 'favourable reaction.' Any final deal would still be subject to approval by the US bankruptcy court which has control of LTV's assets. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986. The court gave its approval to the original Thomson bid last April. Under that deal, Thomson agreed to pay Dollars 300m for the missiles division, while the Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment group, and defence contractor Northrop would pay Dollars 150m for LTV's aircraft business. The new package would still be worth Dollars 450m, but one report last night said the Carlyle offer for the aircraft side would be raised from Dollars 150m to Dollars 190m, offsetting the Dollars 40m drop in the Thomson offer. Loral, which has a substantial missiles business, has become a Wall Street favourite thanks to a strategy of aggressive expansion through acquisitions at bargain prices. Mr Schwartz said the acquisition of the LTV division would contribute 'positively' to Loral's earnings this year.</p>

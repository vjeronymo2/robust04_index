			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 6 Feb (Notimex) -- Today  the nongovernment organizations (NGO'S) accepted a proposal to  create a security cordon around negotiations between government  and Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) representatives.    Yesterday, Saturday, the armed group requested that in light  of an imminent dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, and the  EZLN, the NGO'S could lay out a security cordon which would  prevent both sides from interfering in the physical space of the  dialogue table.    Gerardo Gonzalez, spokesman for the Coordinating Board of  Nongovernment Human Rights Organizations (CONPAZ) in this city,  indicated this group's interest in also becoming a permanent  observer of the Chiapas peace process. He added that the  security cordon would be implemented either on foot or by using  vehicles operated by CONPAZ members, the Red Cross, the Health  Secretariat, and nongovernment human rights organizations which  will cover the area where the talks will take place. The CONPAZ  representative indicated that the objective is to observe all  movements of troops and aircraft, as well as national and  international correspondents sent to cover the dialogue. He  added that this will serve to prevent any irregularities which  may affect the first rapprochement to ensure peace and  reestablish legal order in the region.    "(Today) we expect to deliver the EZLN acceptance letter to  [Monsignor] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas  dioceses and national mediation commissioner, as well as to  Camacho Solis." He mentioned that the letter was sent to all  representatives of the 130 nongovernment organizations in the  country inviting their representatives to participate in  implementing the security cordon in order to ensure the dialogue.    Gonzalez believes the communities of San Miguel, the  municipality of Ocosingo, and the city of Comitan are ideal  sites for the talks aimed at setting the foundations of a true  reconciliation between Chiapas inhabitants and state and federal  authorities.    The spokesman for CONPAZ, an organization which consists of  approximately 11 local groups, was interviewed at the conclusion  of a citizen's march for peace and reconciliation that ended  with a meeting in this community's central plaza.    As of the start of the negotiation process between the peace  commissioner and the EZLN, under the mediation of Bishop Ruiz,  both sides have agreed to initiate a dialogue based on a  prearranged agenda. The dialogue is aimed at solving the  Chiapas Indian community problem.    Beginning on 1 January the EZLN staged an uprising in four  communities of the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, and  presented demands for Indian grievances.    It is expected that this Sunday Camacho Solis will announce  the date and place where the first direct talks will take place.</p>

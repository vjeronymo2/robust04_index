			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [20 April PASASON Editorial: "Steps of Development of </F> Lao-Malaysian Relations and Cooperation"]    [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai  Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed, prime  minister of Malaysia, led a delegation of the Malaysian  Government to pay an official, friendly visit to the LPDR from  16 to 18 April. The Malaysian Government delegation was  honorably welcomed at an official ceremony. It was also  accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon  and the multiethnic Lao people everywhere it visited.  Noteworthy is that during the visit, H.E. Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir bin Mohamed and his delegation paid a courtesy call on  H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, which proceeded  in an atmosphere of close friendship. The delegation also  visited various places of economic, historic, and cultural  significance in Vientiane capital and Luang Prabang Province.    Official talks between a high-level LPDR delegation led by  H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and a high-level Malaysian delegation led  by H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed were held at the  prime minister's office in Vientiane. The talks proceeded in an  atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding.  During the talks, the two sides informed each other about  domestic situations, lines, and policies in their respective  countries which they considered a firm basis for further, ever  more vigorous development of Lao-Malaysian relations and  cooperation in various fields, both in the state and private  sectors, to bring about concrete benefits to the two peoples.  The two sides discussed and exchanged views on various issues,  including promoting investment between Laos and Malaysia, an  issue in which the Malaysian side is interested. Following the  talks, the two sides agreed to step up delegation exchanges at  all levels. During the visit, a seminar on the foreign  investment atmosphere in the LPDR was also organized. The  Malaysian side also assured the Lao side of its willingness to  render assistance in training Lao cadres. Part of the  assistance will be directly provided by the Malaysian Government  and the rest will be in the form of funds from a third country.  Noteworthy is that the two sides have reached an agreement on  repayment between the Bank of the LPDR and Bank Negara of  Malaysia -- the central banks of the two countries. This  agreement, together with the agreement on promoting and  protecting investment which was signed in 1992, serves as a firm  basis and marks a historic milestone for the further, ever more  fruitful promotion and expansion of the existing good and  friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and  the two peoples of Laos and Malaysia. Another significant point  is that the prime ministers of the two countries believe that  Laos and Malaysia have maintained sufficient conditions to  promote and expand relations and cooperation in all spheres in  the immediate future as well as in the long-term period.    The multiethnic Lao people wholeheartedly hail the glorious  success of the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation on  this visit to the LPDR. The visit is considered a new step of  development in relations and cooperation between the two  countries. The success of the visit also serves as a basis for  the two countries to increasingly promote, expand, and  strengthen friendly relations and cooperation in various fields,  which will thus contribute to establishing and promoting peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation in this region.</p>

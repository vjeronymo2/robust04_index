			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: CU's growth policy Insurance companies have a poor record of managing expansion. The market might therefore wonder whether Commercial Union can deliver a decent return on the Pounds 428m raised yesterday. Having taken on an additional Pounds 1bn premium income last year, the company is moving at speed. Yesterday's full-year figures show the early benefits of the premium increases which have been implemented both in the UK and abroad. The danger is that capital committed to the market from here on will arrive just in time to catch the next down-swing in the insurance cycle. CU might argue that competitive pressures will be slow to re-emerge this time around. Composite insurers have raised over Pounds 1bn either from rich parents or, in the manner of Sun Alliance's convertible bond on Tuesday, from the capital markets in the last year. But that replaces only a fraction of the capital sucked out by losses since the late 1980s. There is certainly no sign yet of UK rates starting to soften. With so many of the opposition disabled by mortgage indemnity losses, the opportunity to snatch UK market share must look too good to pass up. Although expanding life assurance sales in relatively unknown markets like Spain and Italy carries risks, it might provide valuable balance to the more violent swings in general insurance. Judging by the 2 per cent rise in the shares yesterday, the market is willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. But the competition is unlikely to just sit back and watch. By bringing its results forward to launch the rights issue, CU was keen to be at the front of the queue for funds. Too many more cash calls from insurers will be a signal to clear out of the sector.</p>

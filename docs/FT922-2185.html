			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Market Report The premium for LME cash ZINC over three-month metal closed at Dollars 86 a tonne compared with Dollars 136.25 on Tuesday. At one stage it narrowed to around Dollars 70 under the pressure of continued liquidation of nearby positions, prompted by the Monday announcement of limits on the daily backwardation. The market is starting to reflect its unspectacular demand levels and high stocks after three months of being supported by the developing June squeeze, dealers said. LME COPPER closed at the highest level for seven months, encouraged by an early break through previous resistance levels. Traders said an absence of recent Chinese selling on rises by three-month copper to around Dollars 2,280 a tonne prompted early short covering that touched off buy stops. Comex copper futures were extending gains at midday. New York raw SUGAR prices were sharply ahead at midday on strong trade house buying, constructive chart factors and continuing sentiment that nearby supplies are tight. London COCOA managed by the close to claw back some of the ground lost earlier, when trade selling sent the second position contract tumbling to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 523 a tonne.</p>

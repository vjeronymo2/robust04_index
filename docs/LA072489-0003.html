			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARK BILL FOR CHILD CARE?  </P> <P> Congress is so close to passing landmark child-care legislation that it must  keep inching forward despite threats of a presidential veto or efforts by some  House members to adopt a minimal program.  </P> <P> The Senate and a key House committee have passed bills that differ in some  specific ways but are so alike in basic approach that they can and should be  merged into significant legislation. It is time for Congress to act to help  fill the growing need for better child care.  </P> <P> In late June, the Senate passed the Act for Better Child Care Services, known  as the ABC bill, that provides $1.75 billion for a combination of tax credits  to parents and grants to states to increase child-care programs and to help  parents pay for care. In so doing, the Senate rejected a presidentially backed  substitute that would have relied solely on tax credits. The bill also requires  states to set safety standards for child-care programs.  </P> <P> Days later, the House Education and Labor Committee approved HR 3, the Child  Development and Education Act of 1989. The bill provides $1.78 billion for a  variety of children's programs, including subsidies for child care. It differs  from the Senate bill in that it calls for a major expansion of the Head Start  preschool program and provides financial incentives for school systems to  develop more child-care programs.  </P> <P> In a separate action this past week, the House Ways and Means Committee  approved tax credits for child care. That's good, but that committee's bill  contains only $400 million a year to expand the supply of day care and improve  its quality. That's far less than what the Senate passed or what is contained  in HR 3. Thus, the Ways and Means Committee bill alone will not be sufficient  to provide real improvement in child care. Groups like the Children's Defense  Fund hope to win commitments soon from House members to combine the tax-credit  bill and HR 3. That way the House would go to a conference committee with the  Senate with the strongest possible package.  </P> <P> Most of the principal players are in familiar roles of leadership. Rep.  Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education and Labor  Committee, is one, and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), a longtime advocate of  improved child care, is another. But one key figure is a surprise. He is Sen.  Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who has been severely criticized for his role and  deserves special commendation. Hatch, a conservative, told an interviewer: "I  think I'm doing what's right. I started looking at the statistics and the  facts, and when you do, you ask, 'What are we doing to our families?' You've  got to be concerned about the parents who just don't know what to do."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, President Bush does not yet share Hatch's insight. Bush says he  will veto any ABC-type bill. He prefers to let parents decide with their  dollars what kind of care they want. But the small tax credit he has in mind  would leave parents with minimal care and do nothing to help create badly  needed new programs. Parents want and deserve a better choice than the one the  President offers. Congress should give it to them by passing a combination of  the solid measures now before it.  </P></p>

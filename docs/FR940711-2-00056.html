			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Groundwater/Drinking Water_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following concerns regarding the effects of municipal solid waste landfills on groundwater and drinking water in the State of Florida: (1) Florida's present municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately protect high quality groundwater and the State should prohibit landfills from being located in sensitive areas, such as above underground sources of drinking water, and (2) there is the possibility of leachate discharges from municipal solid waste landfills contaminating drinking water wells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The federal criteria require that groundwater be monitored for constituents at a distance no more than 150 meters (approximately 500 feet) from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property boundary, whichever is less. The point at which groundwater is monitored is to be chosen considering several factors, one of which is whether the groundwater is used for drinking water. Florida's program meets these standards. Florida has made revisions to their requirements to include all of the contaminants for which the federal standards require monitoring. Florida also requires periodic sampling of leachate generated by the landfill to determine which contaminants would be of concern in the event of a release to the subsurface. This analysis is not required by the federal criteria. Further, as previously mentioned, Florida requires monitoring of groundwater and corrective action if groundwater is found to be contaminated at a distance not to exceed 100 feet from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property boundary, whichever is less. Again, Florida's 100 foot distance is more stringent than the federal criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding landfills being sited in the vicinity of drinking water intakes, the federal criteria for locating municipal solid waste landfills are very general and include restrictions (but not necessarily prohibitions) to locating municipal solid waste landfills in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and areas in close vicinity to airports. The State of Florida's regulations have been deemed adequate in that they meet the minimum federal requirements. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 do not address drinking water intakes with respect to locating landfills. Further, EPA cannot  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> require <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Florida to adopt more stringent requirements to receive approval of their program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Health/Risk Assessment_Comments were received during the public comment period presenting the concern that Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately assess the adverse impact on human health resulting from exposure to landfill leachate in drinking water. It was suggested that Florida be required to evaluate human health effects from chronic exposure to contaminants released from municipal solid waste. Addressing this issue was beyond the scope of EPA's review of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting program. However, the types of complex health studies that are referenced are generally conducted as research projects by organizations and health scientists trained in this field. Such work is ongoing in federally-funded laboratories, universities and other research organizations. On occasion, these studies are conducted in community populations that are known to have been exposed to environmental contaminants over an extended period of time and that claim to have a high level of health problems believed to be associated with the contamination. With the multiple stresses and health problems that typically exist in a community, it is extremely difficult to prove a causal association with a specific environmental exposure. Such health studies are complex, difficult to interpret and often inconclusive. Therefore, a requirement for health evaluations are not typically included, per se, in regulatory permit programs but rather these programs use toxicity and risk assessment information to develop the technical permit requirements that would be health protective. Florida's municipal solid waste landfill program was developed in a manner which satisfactorily meets the above requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Public Participation_Comments were received during the public comment period petitioning for ``corrective action to redress inadequate public participation in development of Florida's Solid Waste Management Plan.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under EPA's rules for public participation, a state, in its development of rules for a Subtitle D program, has the option of following the requirements of the state's administrative procedures act, if one exists. Florida does have an administrative procedures act and the State complied with its requirements in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, Florida has complied with EPA's rules for public participation. In addition, EPA has provided public participation opportunities in its review of whether the Florida program is adequate when compared to the criteria of 40 CFR Part 258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Environmental Justice_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that there should be an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting rules prior to approval of Florida's program. There is concern that (1) Florida's program was ``developed with grossly inadequate provisions for participation by persons most threatened by toxic pollution of their water supplies'' and (2) Florida's present program fails to provide equal protection to people obtaining drinking water from private wells (low-income communities were specifically referenced).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Franco-German ERM rift denied by finance ministers MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, joined forces yesterday to quell talk of a Franco-German rift over the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. The two ministers were meeting in Paris with their central bank chiefs for a session of the Franco-German economic council. They stressed that they regarded Monday's decision by European Community finance ministers to widen the trading bands for ERM currencies as a temporary measure. Mr Alphandery, whose government's franc fort policy of maintaining a strong link between the franc and the German D-Mark is under severe strain, said the Brussels agreement was 'an imaginative, but temporary' solution which would be reviewed by another meeting of the Franco-German economic council in the autumn. Mr Waigel also stressed the 'temporary' nature of the decision and predicted that ERM bands were likely to narrow again before the end of the year. Both ministers were at pains to claim that relations between France and Germany, far from weakening, had been strengthened by the crisis. Mr Waigel, who last month abruptly cancelled a meeting with Mr Alphandery following controversy in Germany over remarks by the French minister concerning the franc's performance, said the EC could not have reached the 'excellent solution' without France's co-operation. 'I want to lay to rest all these rumours about the so-called deterioration in Franco-German relations . . . I can testify that during this period of tension on the markets, the Franco-German couple once again proved its solidity,' said Mr Alphandery. Their comments followed Monday's admission by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French primeminister, that the Brussels negotiations had been strained. It has been widely asserted in recent days by EC officials and by political observers in both countries that the Franco-German alliance is under intense pressure. According to one authoritative report in Paris, the Brussels talks were twice imperilled by disagreements between the two countries. Mr Alphandery, who had appeared apprehensive on Monday at Mr Balladur's press conference, seemed more confident yesterday. Mr Alphandery and Mr Waigel faced the battery of television cameras with resolute smiles. Mr Alphandery said there was evidence that France was emerging from recession. He said that the economy had stabilised in the second quarter after two successive quarters of decline. 'The worst is already behind us in France, as it is in Germany,' he said. Meanwhile Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, tried to assuage concern about the impact of the D-Mark's rise on the German economy by stressing that fluctuations in the ERM currencies, including the D-Mark, had been relatively slight since the Brussels decision.</p>

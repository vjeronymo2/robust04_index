At least  until now. Because of the affair surrounding Eurometal, this  reputation has been somewhat damaged. Because the artillery  shells supplied to Turkey by this company are suitable "against  soft and hard targets." And the latter means human flesh.    More striking power for less money. That is the idea behind  the plan to produce weapons jointly within NATO. One of these  plans involved a joint Netherlands-British-Turkish artillery  shell factory. This is advantageous, thanks to the reduced  wage costs in Ankara, but sensitive, because of the ever greater  grimness of the war violence perpetrated by the Turkish Army  against the Kurds in the southeast.    In spite of that, in the late 1980's the Netherlands  Government did make a choice in favor of this cooperation. NATO  even considered the transfer of the ammunition production to  their southern allies as a kind of development assistance  because it involved industrializing countries.    The Netherlands partners included, among others,  Philips, which helped the Turkish Aselsan plant  develop its own production line for military communication. And  Daf was involved in the production of Turkish armored  vehicles.    In exchange, when the Netherlands purchased rocket launchers  in America in 1987, the then-Secretary of State Van Houwelingen  tried to bargain for participation by Netherlands arms  manufacturers in Turkish-American projects.    Since 1980, the United States has given Eurometal  an exclusive license to manufacture artillery shells for M-483  model Howitzers, and to this effect a cooperation agreement was  concluded with British and Turkish companies. This project was  fully supported by the authorities involved.    Since 1987, the Netherlands Government has even held  negotiations with Eurometal in the name of the British and the  Turkish Governments about the production of the artillery shells.    Yet, until now this had really been only a  British-Netherlands business with a slight German coloring; the  shell casings came from the Netherlands, other parts from  England, and the assembly took place at the German branch of  Eurometal in Liebenau. But it was agreed that as of 1993 this  assembly would take place in Turkey.    There were only two problems: until that time, the Turks had  to continue purchasing their artillery shells from Eurometal (in  Germany). And the assembly line of the Turkish company in  Kirikkale had to be set up with the help of Netherlands  personnel. No export license is required for the latter, at  least as long as it remains limited to verbal support. It is  hard to believe that not a single piece of paper or photocopy  was involved, but a year and a half ago, in response to  questions raised in parliament, Minister Van den Broek stated  diplomatically that "no permit had been granted, however," for  the concrete transfer of technology. But the German Government  did not dare to grant an export license for the artillery shells  coming off the assembly line in Liebenau, even though the main  contractor, Eurometal, had committed itself through contract to  supply a first 18,000-unit shipment to Turkey.    The Bundessicherheitsrat, which includes the  chancellor and the Ministers of Internal, Foreign, and Economic  Affairs and of Defense, prohibited the export. Meanwhile, it  appeared from a German television broadcast (on 23 November  1992) that the majority of the 18,000 artillery shells were  already completed in Liebenau. The shipment was to take place  before Christmas.    During the week before Christmas, while Germany continued to  say "no," Van den Broek did grant Eurometal ("after careful  checking of the applicable criteria") an export license for the  shell casings related to the Turkish shipment. Apparently the  equipment standardization within NATO had progressed further  than the policy standardization between the Netherlands and  Germany.    For a while, the matter ended up in an impasse.    A year ago, Van den Broek's successor, Kooijmans, claimed in  the Second Chamber that the assembly of the 18,000 artillery  shells in Liebenau had not taken place and that hence there had  been no export to Turkey.    The German Government continued to refuse the delivery and  that was painful for the Netherlands, because it apparently did  not have matters in its own hands in terms of its cooperation  projects within the context of NATO. It was also annoying for  Eurometal because it could not meet its commitment to the Turks.    The only thing Eurometal could do was to ask the Turks for  understanding, to close the assembly line in Liebenau as soon as  possible and to ship it (via the Netherlands) to Istanbul.  Then the problems could be solved as soon as possible in  Turkey itself.    The Germans also asked the Turks for understanding and  admitted that it might be possible to find a way out, if only to  save less eye-catching German-Turkish contracts.    According to a spokesperson for Eurometal, the 18,000  artillery shells completed in Germany will return to the  Netherlands. In order not to make the matter too sensitive,  Minister of Defense Rulus ter Beek will probably purchase the  shipment. Because as soon as the Netherlands engineers in Turkey  are ready, the Turks will be able to manufacture their artillery  shells (a total of 206,000) themselves. Although with parts from  the Netherlands and England.    The closing of the production line in Liebenau did not do  Eurometal in Germany any good . The Landesregierung  of Lower-Saxony (a coalition of Greens and the SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany]) and the opposition (CDU-FDP  [Christian Democratic Union-Free Democratic Party]) are both  furious, albeit for different reasons. The Left feels that it is  incredible that the German Government's refusal to allow the  export of the artillery shells is being circumvented by and via  the Netherlands. The statement was made in the  Bundesrat (the German First Chamber) that by granting  a permit to export the factory to "the Netherlands," Minister of  Economic Affairs Guenter Rexrodt is waging war against the  Kurdish people. Rexrodt's ministry initially defended itself  by stating that nothing was known about the actual final  destination: the Netherlands was the culprit. But the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs in the Hague does not accept this charge.  It has a copy of the permit application made by Eurometal,  which shows that the Germans knew that the Netherlands was only  an intermediary stopping point. And it is making this known.  Furthermore, the transaction "came up" at the ministerial level,  although it was agreed not to make this matter public. The level  of pain had to be kept low, but given the veiled accusations  this did not quite succeed. "We are curious to see how the  German Government will react to our response," was the reserved  comment made by one diplomat.    An insider in the Hague blames the German behavior primarily  on domestic pressure rather than ethical purity. Reference was  made to a German-Turkish cooperation project whereby Germany is  helping Turkey with the modernization of old 155mm Howitzers.  Following modernization, the guns are particularly well suited  for the M-483 artillery shells. Incidentally, two years ago the  Germans offered this kind of artillery shell to the Turks.    The words unfair competition are even mentioned:  it was not due to moral correctness that the Germans were not  cooperating with the artillery shell exports, but because they  would have preferred to see their own Rheinmetal  rather than the Netherlands Eurometal export the artillery  shells. The much less famous German-Turkish Howitzer project is  still on track, but the artillery shells have been politicized  to such an extent that not a single individual wants to continue  burning his fingers on them. The CDU-FDP opposition also sees it  this way and they are furious because the hypocrisy of the  German Government is providing money to the Netherlands and  costing jobs in Liebenau.    Based on the responses given by Minister Kooijmans in the  Second Chamber there also appears to be something strange. Up to  now he, as well as his predecessor Van den Broek, had always  talked about setting up a final assembly line in Turkey. What  was meant was a line like the one which up to now existed in  Liebenau. But Turkey will receive two assembly lines. The  Liebenau line is intended for the assembly of components, and  now, according to the Netherlands Government, the final assembly  line is to come from the Netherlands. On this subject, Eurometal  refuses to "make any comment."    But it is enough to know that Minister Van den Broek did not  provide correct information to parliament on 12 October 1992.    It is a fact that the reputation of the Netherlands as a  relatively well behaved arms exporting country has been somewhat  damaged by the affair. When even the  Bundessicherheitsrat feels that the artillery shells  and heavy artillery could be used in the struggle against the  Kurds, it is a little strange that the Netherlands considers  this "less probable, given the condition of the relevant  terrain." After Sarajevo, they really ought to know better here.    Eurometal itself has not operated skillfully either. Even  the respectable DIE ZEIT has noted that the company, of which  the Netherlands is still a major shareholder, has placed  advertisements in the Turkish defense press for these artillery  shells, which are so suitable "against hard and soft tar  gets." The latter words do not refer to tanks but to human  flesh.    "You obviously mean the Kurds," company spokesperson Weenink  responded helpfully when asked about this. "Those artillery  shells are far too good for that."</p>

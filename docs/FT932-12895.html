			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Mitsukoshi slips into red as sales fall 3.9% MITSUKOSHI, Japan's most famous department store yesterday reported a Y2.16bn (Dollars 19.5m) pre-tax loss for the year ended February. The company blamed the fall in consumption plus a shift away from the luxury goods which Mitsukoshi is famous for. Mitsukoshi is facing tough competition from a string of newer retailers. The results reflect the difficulties which Mitsukoshi has had in cutting costs in the face of a downturn in sales. It is bearing a heavy depreciation charge for aggressive expansion in the late 1980s. The Japan Chain Store Association yesterday reported that sales last month were 4.6 per cent down from the year before, the seventh consecutive monthly fall. The decline was led by a 34 per cent fall in sales of household goods. Mitsukoshi swung from a Y10.9bn pre-tax profit to the Y2.16bn loss on a 3.9 per cent decline in sales to Y842.4bn. Mitsukoshi said it would pay an unchanged annual dividend of Y6 per share. It forecast it would move back into modest profit in the coming year. Mitsukoshi's vulnerability to a fall in sales contrasts with Daimaru, another department store operator, which reported a 23.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y4.6bn on a 6.3 per cent fall in sales to Y569.8bn. Matsukaya department store group reported pre-tax profits for the year to the end of February fell to Y3.8bn from Y10.2bn in 1992 on sales of Y491.3bn, down from Y501.9bn. Nagasakiya, the leading supermarket chain, reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of Y2.37bn in the year ended February, its first loss since listing on the Tokyo stock market in 1963. It sales were 3.8 per cent down at Y494.52bn.</p>

[Unidentified correspondent] Ground, naval, and air units of  the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic  Revolution Guard Corps [IRGC] took part in this stage of the  exercise under the joint Fath command. In the third stage of  the Fath-3 exercise, battleships and frigates of the Navy and  naval units of the IRGC -- including the Marine Brigade, Kowsar  Naval Brigade, and the Qader Logistics Brigade -- attacked to  recapture the areas in the southern coastline of Khuzestan,  which had been occupied by the imaginary enemy, with support  from fighter-bombers of the Air Force of the Armed Forces and  heavy artillery fire from the Ground Forces of the IRGC.    Also, the sea-air high-flying helicopters of the Navy and  gunboats of the IRGC attacked the vessels of the imaginary  enemy. In order to achieve predetermined objectives,  paratroopers of the airborne committee [as heard] of the IRGC,  in coordination with the Air Force, conducted airborne  operations behind the lines of the imaginary enemy and prepared  the ground for landing paratroopers and commandos.    An informed military expert in the Fath command headquarters  said: The Fath-3 exercise is one of the biggest -- and the most  unprecedented -- joint exercises involving the three branches of  the forces of the IRGC and the Armed Forces of the Islamic  Republic of Iran that has taken place in the waters of the  northern Persian Gulf.</p>

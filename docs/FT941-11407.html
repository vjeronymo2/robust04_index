			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / People: CentreGold entices player from Sega CentreGold, the Birmingham-based publisher and distributor of electronic computer games which was floated in October 1993, has notched up something of a coup in the software entertainment world by tempting a player from Japanese games giant Sega. Nobuhiko Ishihara, 42, is leaving his post as general manager with Sega Enterprises to become right-hand man of CentreGold's chief executive, Geoff Brown. Ishihara was a key figure in Sega's successful campaign to win hearts and minds of children across Europe. He joined Sega from an NEC subsidiary in 1987; in August 1990 he came to Europe where he successfully established a consumer division, including building a European research and development programme. Working closely with Sega's president and chief executive, Ishihara was responsible for licensing property rights (both into and from Sega) and for the establishment of a third party publishing programme in north America and Europe. CentreGold has thus recruited a senior figure with ready access into the nerve centre of one of the world's biggest computer games manufacturers. Moreover, with imminent technological developments that will greatly expand the entertainment software market, CentreGold sees the appointment as giving it an extra dimension of market knowledge and strategic planning.</p>

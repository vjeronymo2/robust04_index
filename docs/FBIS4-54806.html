			<p>BFN     [Text] On 4 May President Zhelyu Zhelev received  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas,, who is on an official  visit to Bulgaria. Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov  reports on the main topics discussed during the talk:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] There are no political  differences between the two countries. This is a prerequisite  for intensifying relations between the two countries, especially  in the trade and economic sphere. We hope that this will be  achieved.    President Zhelev asked Alatas to influence the Islamic  Conference Organization to drop the Bulgarian Turks issue from  its agenda. This issue has been on the organization's agenda  for several years already. This is a a total anachronism,  because the rights of the Bulgarian Turks have been fully  restored. They are among the members of the parliament and in  the organs of the municipal power, and it appears that the whole  issue is now obsolete.    Alatas promised to raise the issue during the organization's  next session in Tunisia, because, according to him, the  organization has other more important issues that it must  resolve.

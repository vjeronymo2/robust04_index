			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Bank of France cuts interest rates by 1/4 point THE Banque de France yesterday cut its two benchmark interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and said it had recovered the reserves it used to support the franc during the currency crisis in September. The reductions, the first for just over a year, bring the intervention rate, at which the central bank does most of its lending to the banking system, to 9.35 per cent and the five to 10 day repurchase rate, for borrowers of last resort, to 10.25 per cent. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the cuts marked victory in the battle to defend the franc and would encourage consumption, investment and economic activity. The leading state-owned banks, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais, yesterday led a 20 basis-point cut in commercial base rates to 9.65 per cent. They were followed by the private sector Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France, much earlier than most economic analysts had expected. Commercial banks had lost heavily in recent weeks because they kept base rates unchanged during a period when money market rates climbed steeply, and were expected to recoup their losses before reducing base lending rates. 'This is obviously a political move,' said Mr Christopher Potts, senior economist at Banque Indosuez. 'Their arms have been twisted by the treasury. There is a very strong message here - that the government is worried about the economy,' he said. The move could help quell fears among some French businessmen and in some parts of the right-wing opposition that the Socialist government's hard franc policy was choking economic growth. Economic analysts believe the French central bank could drop rates further by the end of the year if the Bundesbank cuts its own rates. At present French three-month money market rates are 57 basis points above those in Germany. Paris is hesitant to push its rates unilaterally below Germany's because the last time it did so, in October 1991, the resulting pressure on the franc was so heavy the French government was forced to raise interest rates a month later. Barclays Bank yesterday launched an investment income paying cheque account for French clients, to replace the interest paying cheque account banned by the government last month. Interest paying cheque accounts are forbidden under French law, to protect the tradition of not charging clients for processing cheques and to hold down banks' cost of funds. The new account automatically places a proportion of the balance in an investment fund, units in which can only be sold on clients' written consent. Victory in battle for franc, Page 2</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE FACES LOSING A SIGN OF THE TIMES -- MATTEL'S  </P> <P> The landmark Mattel Toys sign, for years visible to motorists traveling past  Hawthorne on the San Diego Freeway, may soon be history.  </P> <P> A Mattel Inc. spokesman said Thursday that the company is negotiating to buy a  15-story, 330,000-square-foot office building in neighboring El Segundo to  replace its aging corporate headquarters in Hawthorne. The company will sell  its Hawthorne property if it moves to El Segundo.  </P> <P> The company, founded in Hawthorne 44 years ago, hopes to make the move by 1991.  </P> <P> "This specific El Segundo site is the focus of our activity at this time,"  Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth said Thursday. "It's a site that makes a lot of  sense to us."  </P> <P> Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue said the city will miss Mattel.  </P> <P> "It's sort of a sad day," Jue said. "Mattel has been an identity here in  Hawthorne since they started."  </P> <P> Mattel, visible because of the giant, illuminated sign perched on top of its  building, owns about nine acres and leases 26 more acres next to the San Diego  Freeway. Toys, including the company's hugely successful Barbie doll, were once  assembled at the site until manufacturing operations were moved overseas years  ago.  </P> <P> Hawthorne officials recently earmarked the land for a massive redevelopment  project, and Mattel had said at first it planned to renovate and occupy its  six-story office building as part of the project. The redevelopment project  calls for retail and office buildings, restaurants and a hotel to be built on  the property owned and leased by Mattel.  </P> <P> However, Mattel decided to pursue buying the El Segundo building and  transferring its 1,300 employees there because of the disruptions associated  with construction, company officials said. Also, Bozarth said, it is "more  economical" for the company to move than to stay.  </P> <P> The building that Mattel is negotiating to buy is at Grand Avenue and  Continental Boulevard. Vacant since it was constructed in 1987, it was part of  a larger project known as the Grandway and included a hotel and restaurant.  </P> <P> Mattel said it would not discuss details of its negotiations with the  building's owner, Sutter Hill Ltd. of Northern California.  </P> <P> As for Mattel, it wants to have a rooftop sign in El Segundo, too. Indeed, it  has asked the city's Planning Commission to allow it to erect at least two  500-square-foot signs on top of the building to display the company's name and  logo.  </P></p>

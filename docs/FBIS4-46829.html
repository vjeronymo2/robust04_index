			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. Davydov: "Wages--on Time; From a Conference </F> Call in the Ministry of Railways"]    [Text] The continuing drop in transport operations  and the inoperative payments mechanism do not leave hopes for a  quiet life for the railroad workers. Despite the fact that hauls  of freight and passengers are being steadily achieved, the  sector's economic situation is very alarming. As First Deputy  Minister O. A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent  conference call, approximately a third of March wages had not  yet been financed by 12 May, although based on the dates it was  already time to distribute those for April.    We have written more than once what the reasons are for such  a situation. The problems among problems is the shortage of  "live" money in the revenue accounts of the railroads due to the  clients' inability to pay. It has already become a rule that in  the best case half of the funds earned is received in money and  the rest is mutual write-offs, the products of debtor  enterprises, etc. But in order to pay the entire March wages  and, let's say, half of April's before the end of May, no less  than 924 billion rubles, which represents 57 percent of all  earnings from transport operations, needs to be collected in the  accounts.    If one considers that in April the railroads received less  than 42 percent of the planned earnings in cash, then it becomes  clear how difficult a task remains to be resolved. It is  difficult to expect positive results without laborious daily  work to reduce debts, cut expenditures and increase revenues and  without bringing the contingent of service personnel in line  with the volumes of transport operations, reducing outlays from  non-intact hauls, fines for delays in the delivery of freight,  etc.    And the fact is that one needs to finance not only the wage  fund of the railroads and the plants, but also to settle  accounts with the funds from the withholdings for social needs  (social insurance, the pension fund, medical insurance, etc.--39  percent all told) and with taxes into the state budget.    The circumstance that on a number of railroads an unfounded  wage increase, so to speak, more than the right which the basic  wage agreement grants, has been permitted, exacerbates the  situation. Thus, the growing expenditures for these purposes to  a certain degree have become the catalyst for prolonging the  time periods for settlements with the labor collectives. They  exceeded the wage fund (relative to December 1993) during the  first quarter on the October and Sverdlovsk railroads by more  than R14 billion. The overexpenditure on the West Siberian and  Far Eastern railroads is two times less, but also very  substantial. The rates, as we can see, exceed what has been  planned.    The Ministry of Railways and the trade union central  committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the  accelerated indexing of wages further complicates the task of  liquidating payment arrears. Especially as the right to  accelerated indexing was envisaged by the basic wage agreement  only for the first quarter. However, the leaders of the Gorkiy,  Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk and certain other mainlines have already in  April carried out a 12-17 percent increase in wages, although  the forecast of the growth in consumer prices (in accordance  with which indexing in the second quarter should be carried out)  was no more than 10 percent and actually came to less than 9.    All this has been negatively reflected in the attempts to  liquidate the wage arrears. For now they are distributed on time  only on the Moscow and Kaliningrad railroads. This is a serious  problem for almost all the remaining railroads. Which, as a  matter of fact, has been confirmed by the statements of the  leaders of the mainlines during the conference call.  Nevertheless, the roads have supported the strategic line  proposed by the ministry--to enter into a normal rhythm of wage  distribution by Railroad Workers Day.    Briefly, the essence of the strategy comes down to the  following. Wages for March should be fully paid before 20 May,  for April by 15 June, for May by 5 July, and for June prior to  30 July. Thus, we will enter into a normal payment regime with  the June wages. That is, one needs to recover R3.3 billion in  money from the clients, which represents 48.9 percent of planned  earnings during this period, in two and a half months. The task  is extremely complex but, as the discussion has indicated,  feasible.    It was especially emphasized that the amount designated is  sufficient provided that not a single ruble goes for other  needs. There can be no such thing in life and that is why the  task has been set of recovering no less than 60 percent of the  earnings in money. And, what is more, of more fully utilizing  other sources for obtaining money.    First, selling the products received on the debts' account  quicker. This can yield about R100 billion every month.    Secondly, through other receipts (local revenues, penalties,  fines, various services, etc.) the monthly increase can come to  no less than another R60 billion.    And, finally, the ministry has called for the more active  recovery of debts from so-called other clients. For the system  as a whole they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult  matter, but transportation can no longer continue to carry the  debt. As O. A. Moshenko has emphasized, write-offs, debts,  earnings--all must now be specifically accounted for and each  railroad chief must have a detailed plan on his desk for whose  implementation daily monitoring is required.    The conference participants have come to the conclusion that  for the system as a whole receipts of "live" money into the  revenue accounts of the railroads need to be increased by 6  percent, which will permit the financing of wages in conformity  with the schedule that has been adopted. But this is on the  average. And the Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and Baykal-Amur roads  need to have 65-75 percent more such earnings. The collectives  of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East Siberian, Far Eastern  and Kuybyshev railroads also have to put in some serious work in  this area.    One cannot hush up the fact that the situation at the  sector's plants is even worse than in transport itself. Of  course, the amounts required here are of an order smaller but it  is not easier for the working people of the enterprises for that  reason. However, funds for the payment of wages to the workers  of the Ministry of Railways' plants are also called for in the  figure of R3.3 trillion indicated above. Serious complaints have  been expressed to the leaders of the shipping roads which  occasionally "forget" about their financial obligations relative  to the transit roads. Here's a special question for  you--recovery of debts from the railroad administrations of the  CIS countries, which are already reaching R400 billion.    In summing up the conversation that had taken place, the  first deputy minister called upon the leaders of the mainlines  to display greater exactingness towards clients and to not  by-pass non-traditional revenues which however directly "knock"  against the railroad workers. And the main thing is to search  and find unordinary ways of increasing revenues and cutting  expenditures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatol Awcharenka] </F>   [Excerpts] The first half of Butrus-Ghali's second day in  Belarus was devoted to Chernobyl problems. The UN secretary  general and members of his delegation began their working day  quite early. At 1000, they met with Deputy Prime Minister Ivan  Kenik, chairman of the State Committee for Problems of  Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe. Different kinds of  assistance rendered to Belarus by the world community were  discussed. Both sides also spoke about the coordination of  efforts to study and alleviate the radiological, medical,  socioeconomic, ecological, and psychological consequences of the  Chernobyl disaster. In my opinion, Mr. Butrus-Ghali very  precisely pointed out that Chernobyl is a symbol of both  international solidarity and security.    The secretary general was then received by Belarusian Prime  Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mecheslaw  Hryb. International experts drafted projects for developing  industries in the Chernobyl zone, and this issue was also  discussed in the course of the meetings. Belarus requested that  the United Nations allocate membership fees to finance those  projects. [passage omitted]    Mr. Butrus-Ghali was startled by the fact that although the  disaster had occurred on Ukraine's territory, 70 percent of the  radioactive fallout affected Belarus. One in every five  Belarusian citizens is suffering from the aftermath of the  Chernobyl accident. Meanwhile, the corresponding figure in  Ukraine is one in every 30 citizens.[passage omitted]    The secretary general underlined: Belarus will receive my  support so that the issue of Chernobyl is not removed from the  UN agenda.[passage omitted]</p>

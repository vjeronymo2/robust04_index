Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters believed the treatment of unpaid charges for non <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds, as prescribed in the June 8, 1993 final regulations, should be rescinded in compliance with the statutory treatment for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund purposes. Two commenters believed the requirement penalizes institutions by reducing the amount of institutional charges they can retain. Three commenters asserted that the requirement unfairly leaves students owing large balances to the institution which would otherwise have been paid by Title IV, HEA program assistance, and this result obviously is not fair and equitable under the statute. Three commenters requested the Secretary include late disbursements of State, private, and institutional aid as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges, if these aid sources have published late disbursement policies under which a withdrawing student can be paid. Two commenters suggested the Secretary include late disbursements of unsubsidized Stafford Loan program funds and all Direct Loan program funds as amounts that can be used to reduce a student's unpaid charges. Two commenters believed the consideration of late disbursements when determining unpaid charges is inappropriate and should not be allowed under the refund requirements. One commenter suggested that, because the requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount the institution can retain does not apply to statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations, the requirement should also not apply to voluntarily  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations that are not required by the Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The public was previously invited to comment on requirement to subtract unpaid charges from the amount the institution can retain in response to the December 23, 1991 NPRM. The comments and responses on this issue, including the decisions and rationale of the Secretary, are included in the June 8, 1993 final regulations which included the requirement. The required treatment of unpaid charges for the purposes of this section, except for the calculation of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund under the statute, reaffirms the basic principle of student financial aid: the family (or student) makes its contribution first before financial aid is expended. Although some students may have to pay more toward institutional charges than they originally expected, due to the fact that they withdrew and became ineligible for a portion of the aid they expected to receive, this is more equitable to those students who have responsibly fulfilled their financial obligations to the institution. The Secretary does not believe this issue warrants reconsideration in the context of the February 28, 1994 NPRM. The administration of private and institutional student aid funds is not within the control of the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary cannot guarantee the availability or delivery of these funds and cannot allow institutions to use late disbursements of these funds to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary agrees, however, that institutions should be allowed to use late disbursements of State student aid to reduce a student's unpaid charges, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite of having withdrawn. The Secretary wishes to clarify that an institution which chooses to count a late disbursement of State student aid in this manner will be liable for that amount if it is not disbursed to the student within 60 days after the student's date of withdrawal, as defined in &sect;668.22(i)(1), and will be required to recalculate the Title IV, HEA program refund and return any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts or to the lender within the deadlines specified in &sect;688.22(g). The Secretary agrees that institutions should be allowed to use allowable late disbursement amounts from unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and Direct Student loans to reduce a student's unpaid charges. The Secretary does not believe the treatment of unpaid charges for the purpose of statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations should be extended to voluntary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.22(f)(2)(ii) has been amended to include allowable late disbursements of State student financial assistance, unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. A corresponding change has been made to &sect;668.22(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters disagreed with the Secretary's proposal to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine what portion of the refund must be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs. These commenters believed this change is grossly unfair and negates the concept of equal partnership between the Federal government, the States, and the institution in providing student financial assistance. Six commenters believed the proposed treatment will cause all parties who contribute to a Title IV, HEA program recipient's educational costs_States, institutions, private sources of aid_to lose their contributed funds to the Title IV, HEA programs in the event of a withdrawal. These commenters believed these other parties will therefore be reluctant to pay any of their funds to recipients of Title IV, HEA program assistance. These commenters asserted that such a policy would unfairly penalize State, institutional, and private sources of aid, and Title IV, HEA program recipients. One commenter reported that State programs are already deciding to avoid the Title IV, HEA program refund calculation by withholding their monies until after the refund period has passed; such a practice will be detrimental to Title IV, HEA program recipients who withdraw and owe large balances that would have been paid by State assistance, had it been disbursed on time. This commenter urged the Secretary to prevent the negative effects of this policy by amending the definition of ``financial aid'' (for the purposes of calculating the student's unpaid charges) to include State and private assistance that can reasonably be expected to be awarded, even if it has not actually been received at the time of withdrawal. One commenter supported the Secretary's rationale for removing the fraction in relation to refunds, but did not support extending that interpretation to repayments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary wishes to further clarify that the Amendments of 1992 specify in section 485 that refunds must be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs first. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify that refunds may be returned to other sources of student assistance only after the refund is returned to the Title IV, HEA program funds in the specified order of allocation. The Secretary has no authority to alter this requirement. The Secretary recognizes that some States, institutions, or private sources of aid may deliberately withhold funds from otherwise eligible students who have received Title IV, HEA program assistance. This is a decision over which the Secretary has no control. The Secretary does not believe the definition of ``financial aid'' can be amended in the manner suggested by one commenter, as such a change would be difficult to regulate. The Secretary feels it is appropriate, for consistency with the spirit of the law and to reduce administrative burden, to extend the interpretation of the law to repayments as well as refunds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

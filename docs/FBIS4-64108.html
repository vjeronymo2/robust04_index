			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (May 25) TURAN--The pressure on the opposition  after May 21 when President Aliyev addressed refugees grows.  The opposition leaders were arrested and detained.    For two days, official newspapers have been publishing  appeals by President Aliyev to Azeri citizens. The citizens of  the Republic in their letters demand "to bring the country in to  order and severely punish the culprits". On May 24, AZERBAIJAN  newspaper published a letter from 960 Lachin refugees. The  letter reads that "the dregs of the PFA [Azerbaijani People's  Front] do not allow us to restore peace to the region. The  earlier you stifle them the better. You must take drastic  measures against them. We are ready to come to Baku and to hang  them from the central square. Dear President Aliyev, we ask you  not to prevent us from hanging the traitors and enemies of the  nation. It will be the most just trial of the 20th century".    A meeting of labourers of the Agdzhabedinskiy region adopted  a resolution which was read out on the Baku's first television  channel on May 24. The resolution put forward the following:  To ban the activity of all newspapers and media except state  ones, the activity of all political parties, to make the 17  deputies, who on May 18 left Parliament session in a token of  protest against the position of the speaker, answer for their  activities. Unofficial sources report that it was the  Presidential staff who ordered the citizens of the regions of  the republic to send telegrammes to President Aliyev with a  request to bring the country to order.    The press centre of the Musavat party says that a battalion  of soldiers from the Geranboynskiy region will be sent on May  28, the Day of Independence, to Baku to take the control over  the situation.    Arrests of opposition supporters, the ban on activity of the  opposition and independent media and beating of deputies are not  accidental. On May 12 President Aliyev held a meeting at which  the resolution concerning harrasment of the opposition was  adopted. The end of this campaign will be dissolving of  Parliament, introduction of s [as received] Presidential  government, dissolving of parties and so on.    Many observers believe that the campaign has already begun.</p>

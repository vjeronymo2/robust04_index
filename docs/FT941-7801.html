			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Greening the Gatt The environment is set to become a big issue in global trade policy. But the question confronting members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is how precisely to deal with it. The solution that seems likely to be chosen at the April ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, convened to confirm the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, is establishment of an exploratory committee on trade and the environment with loose terms of reference. That must be the sensible way to proceed. The 118 nations that took part in the Uruguay Round agreed last December that a comprehensive work programme on trade and the environment should be put to the ministers. Since then they have come to realise that there is no agreement on a committee's precise mandate or lifespan. Environmentalists are understandably unhappy with this, since they fear that such a committee will dodge the issues. Equally understandably, developing countries fear that green attitudes mask a rabid new form of protectionism. Since the international trading regime can only be based on consensus, an agreement to explore issues must be the starting point. What makes this not just essential, but right, are the difficulties of the issues. Environmentalists want, for example, the right to discriminate between identical products, on the basis of how they are produced. They also want the power to impose anti-dumping duties on goods whose production involves low environmental standards. Both these demands, questionable enough in themselves, could evidently turn into excuses for increased protection. Rank hypocrisy is another risk. People in the north complain, for example, about the way developing countries are cutting down their rain forests, so exacerbating global warming. But they tend to forget that the 15 per cent of the world's population in rich countries generates 60 per cent of the gases responsible for global warming. While consistency between trade law and multilateral environmental agreements must be secured, anything beyond that should be approached with caution and humility. The starting point is an open-minded exploration of such questions as the proper diversity in environmental standards, possible remedies for international environmental spillovers and the degree to which product prices reflect their full environmental costs. Any new committee could not do better than start from the principles outlined last December at the end of the Uruguay Round. Among them was the statement that 'there should not be, nor need be, any policy contradiction between upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system on the one hand, and acting for the protection of the environment . . . , on the other'. This reconciliation is achievable but its negotiation will, like the Uruguay Round, require years rather than months.</p>

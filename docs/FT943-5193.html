			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (10): A force to be reckoned with - Profile / Ericsson Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications equipment supplier, is without question the dominant force in the international cellular infrastructure market. It has a significant foothold in every major market, and its sights are firmly focused on new opportunities - notably new digital systems, mobile data and fixed cellular systems. Ericsson owes its success to the classic Machiavellian combination of fortune and exertion. The company's cellular division grew out of SRA, a well-established military radio joint venture between Ericsson and Marconi. Marconi chose to sell its 30 per cent stake in 1981, the year SRA entered the cellular mobile market; whereupon the venture became an integral part of Ericsson. The radio division's rapid expansion thereafter owed much to Ericsson's existing marketing and distribution networks worldwide. It built on the success of its public telecommunications products - notably the AXE switch, which is now installed in 105 countries. Furthermore, Scandinavia has been the world's most dynamic cellular market since the launch of the mobile phone. Sweden tops even the Nordic league with 10 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants. Cultural factors are partly responsible; but early agreement on a common Nordic cellular standard - NMT  -provided a significant boost, as did the mid-1980s decision to liberalise the supply of cellular handsets, a step taken in Japan as recently as this year. The extent to which Ericsson acted as a catalyst for these developments is debatable, but the benefit it has derived from them is unmistakable. The bald figures tell all. In revenue, Ericsson's radio communications division last year overtook public telecommunications as the company's largest division, accounting for 41 per cent of sales. The division's sales amounted to Dollars 3.1bn - a 73 per cent increase on 1992. The first half of this year saw a still more dramatic surge of 78 per cent in pretax profits, powered by a 60 per cent rise in radio communications sales. Sales of mobile telephone systems and terminals were up 80 per cent. 'Everyone in the mobile industry has been successful with the massive cellular growth of recent years,' says Mr Kurt Hellstrom, president of Ericsson radio systems, with a modesty befitting the division's plain and functional headquarters at Kista, a northern suburb of Stockholm. Nonetheless, he is quick to identify the 'strong suits' which have made Ericsson outstanding. 'We realised early on the potential for cellular mobile technology, and we were fortunate in having strong in-house divisions in all the main areas needed to develop a portfolio.' Ericsson's radio division has never rested on its inherited laurels: it has been quick to exploit new market opportunities and has not stinted on the large R&amp;D outlays critical to innovation in the sector. R&amp;D spending in the radio division is running at about 20 per cent of sales. Ericsson is the only supplier to have developed widely-used digital systems based on the world's three standard digital systems - GSM (in Europe and beyond), D-Amps (in the US), and PDC (in Japan). In January, more than half of the world's 1.3m GSM subscribers were linked to Ericsson systems. Last year, it responded to the acute shortage of digital GSM handsets by rapidly increasing its own supply - output rose by 150 per cent last year - although it had previously treated the handset business as marginal. Motorola of the US remains the largest handset manufacturer, but Ericsson claims now to be the world's leading supplier of digital pocket telephones. Ericsson is the international company par excellence: its Swedish sales amount to only about 10 per cent of the total. It is important, however, to get behind the slogan and to understand the meaning of 'international' in the Ericsson context. Although the radio division has indigenous marketing, R&amp;D and technical support staff in all its principal markets, Ericsson's senior management is almost exclusively Swedish and most of its manufacturing is carried out in Sweden. Some companies go international by recruiting foreigners, others by inducing an international mind-set into home-grown managers. Ericsson, like most of Swedish industry, is emphatically in the second camp, and has long fostered close links with all the country's technical universities. About two-thirds of the radio division's blue-collar workforce is located in Sweden, mainly at plants at Kumla, west of Stockholm (for handsets) and Gavle, 160km north of Stockholm (for infrastructure). Another plant in Visby, on the Swedish island of Gotland, is being expanded for infrastructure. The only large plants abroad are at Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures equipment for the AMPS system, and is the main centre for land mobile radio, and at Nanjing and Guangzhou in China, where local content is in effect a condition of entry. Increased production is unlikely to lead to a significant increase either in blue-collar staff or in plants abroad. Five years ago it took three hours to assemble a cellular handset; now it takes about 15 minutes. It is the same story with radio base stations. As for overseas production, Ericsson recently designed, built and installed a cellular network for the Digital Phone Group, a new competitor to NTT in Japan, in 18 months from the placing of the order. It was a record, and the entire production took place in Sweden. 'It is speed of production most customers want, not local content,' says Mr Bjorn Bostrom, production director. 'The closeness between design and production is the key. Today, when you design a product, it has to be manufactured instantly and in high volumes: production lines are becoming more complex, so the need to have your development and production staff in close contact is increasing.' More than a quarter of Ericsson Radio's Swedish workforce have degrees, many of them higher degrees. More important than production abroad is the dedicated teams working with customers to design and install their networks. 'This raises tricky questions of confidentiality and intellectual property,' says Mr Hellstrom. 'Certain operators still think that to have a vendor and to have a monopoly over them is an advantage. We, on the other hand, want to put our R&amp;D people to use with as many customers as possible - and it is to their advantage, too.' Ericsson sees three new large cellular markets on the horizon: mobile data; fixed cellular systems to replace copper or even fibre in the local loop; and a mass consumer market for cellular phones and cordless communications. It is difficult to predict their growth rates, but safe to assume that Ericsson will play a key role in all three.</p>

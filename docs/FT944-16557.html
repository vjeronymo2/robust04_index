Four recent contracts range from telecommunications and engineering to food processing. Davy McKee (Stockton) won a contract for the supply of a direct reduction iron plant at Tianjin with a loan value of Dollars 22.5m and finance arranged by West Merchant Bank. This was the first ECGD dollar buyer credit to be arranged for the People's Construction Bank of China. The largest contract is for an optical fibre network project which will link cities in the provinces of Hunan and Hubei with Chonqing. The loan value is Dollars 51m with ANZ Grindlays Bank as the lead bank. Humatt Engineering won a third contract to supply three chicken processing plants in Yantai, Penglai and Guzhen. The plants, with a loan value of Pounds 7.9m, are follow-on projects resulting from the success of two similar installations at Ronqcheng and Qingzhou last year. The loan was arranged by Samuel Montagu on behalf of Midland Bank, the lead bank, with the Overseas Development Administration providing a grant of Pounds 4.2m. Midland Bank was also the lead bank and Samuel Montagu arranged the loan for the fourth contract for air preheaters for a power station at Gao Bei Dian in Beijing. The contract was won by Howden Sirocco. China has been one of ECGD's top markets for many years and currently has the third highest exposure for all markets with Pounds 1.5bn insured.</p>

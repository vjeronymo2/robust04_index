			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: UK engineering group in Dollars 40m private placement VINTEN, a small UK-based engineering company, has raised Dollars 40m of 10-year money through the US private placement market to refinance all its outstanding debt. The deal is the latest from a growing line of small European companies which have secured long-term dollar finance privately from US insurance companies at rates below those available elsewhere. Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said that the company had refinanced its entire short and medium-term debt, a large part of it taken on as a result of two acquisitions this year, as well as raising additional cash. The money has been provided by a single unnamed US insurance company. The 10-year notes issued by Vinten pay a yield of 6.72 per cent, 120 basis points above Treasuries. Vinten turned to the US private placement market in part because it could not secure such long-term finance any other way. 'Our view is that now is as good a time as any to fix long-term borrowing,' Mr Baggott said.</p>

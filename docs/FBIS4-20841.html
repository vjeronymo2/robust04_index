			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Deal With United States Is </F> Advantageous"]    [Text] The "uranium deal" with the United States is  advantageous to Russia, Nikolay Yegorov, Russian Federation  deputy minister of atomic energy, believes. It will help  Russian enterprises to survive.    On his return from Washington, where he signed an  appropriate  document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov  disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able  to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium  concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium  worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no  deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992  whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at  prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the  deputy minister emphasized.    Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S.  markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises  to improve their position. A special feature of the new  agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales  whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a  similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is  sold to consumers.    "The next two years will be especially difficult for  Russia,"  Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely  convertible currency will come in very handy."  <H5>  Russian Industry To Stop Production </H5> <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry  will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium  by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is  planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was  reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United  States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry  of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to  operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7).  But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and  heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to  regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase  out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost  completed. District power plants will be built instead.    Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with  weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from  dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium  stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no  sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium.    However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the  economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors  and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan  believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United  States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The  United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds,  without giving guarantees of money, he said.  <H5>  Pessimistic Outlook for Global Missile Defenses </H5> <F P=106> [Article by political scientist Aleksandr Savelyev: "Joint </F> Ballistic Missile Defense: It Is Essential To Shed Illusions"]    [Text] More than two years have elapsed since the president  of Russia proposed the creation of a global system of protection  against ballistic missiles based on international cooperation.  It was a question of partnership primarily with the United  States in this sphere. In the summer of 1992 the idea came up to  acquire new precise forms and was reflected in the documents on  the results of the top-level meeting of the leaders of Russia  and the United States. The creation of working groups, which  were to have formulated recommendations for the implementation  of this program, was announced, after which the parties could  switch to specific action to strengthen both their own and  international security.    But the enthusiasm of the supporters of this idea, of those  who believed that the main purpose of a GDS [global defense  system] should be to combat ballistic missiles directly by way  of the creation and deployment of an efficient ABM system, was  dampened. As ascertained shortly afterward, neither Russia nor  the United States intended going beyond the framework of the  Soviet-American treaty limiting ABM systems concluded in 1972 --  the ABM Treaty. And this meant that the sphere of a defense  system was from the outset narrowed down to combating only  nonstrategic ballistic missiles: After all, the ABM Treaty  prohibits the creation, testing, and deployment of ABM systems  and componentry intended for combating strategic ballistic  missiles, except for those of a fixed-ground basing mode. They  may only be deployed in a specified area in a strictly limited  quantity.    True, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs attempted to  portray matters such that the ABM Treaty does not prevent the  joint creation and deployment even of strategic antimissile  defenses inasmuch as it limits, allegedly, only national, not  international, programs in this sphere. But in connection with  the Clinton administration's manifest lack of interest in  systems of combating strategic ballistic missiles and the shift  in American policy toward tactical ABM systems, such statements  had no in any way serious effect. And discussions are under way  in Geneva within the framework of the meetings of the SCC  [Standing Consultative Commission] as to what specifications of  tactical antimissile systems could permit a judgment to the  effect that they do not conflict with the ABM Treaty.    Last year saw the elimination of the SDI program, which by  that time had been transformed into a global system of  protection against limited strikes and could have been the basis  for a GDS, and the organization handling its implementation. The  "tactical" part of this program, which was preserved, was  transferred to the category of conventional departmental efforts  and is now under the control of the U.S. Army.    Thus the United States and Russia are as yet concentrating  their attention on questions of the ABM Treaty, and the idea of  a GDS has gone no further than talk and general discussion,  although the sphere of tactical ABM defense remains open for  cooperation. Neither the United States nor West European  countries and states of the Asia-Pacific region have by any  means lost interest here in highly efficient ABM systems capable  of combating ballistic missiles, the threat of whose  proliferation long since became a reality.    But not everything is going that smoothly here either. Thus  the United States is making persistent attempts to push onto  foreign markets its upgraded PAC-3 Patriot system and also the  THAAD [theater high-altitude area defense] tactical ABM system  which is being developed. A serious competitive struggle, which  is being conducted according to all the rules of the market, has  developed here between Russia, which is offering on foreign  markets its S-300, and the United States. Specifically,  representatives of the United States are attempting to discredit  the S-300, voicing doubts as to its effectiveness. Statements  are being made, for example, to the effect that inasmuch as the  S-300 has not undergone testing according to the standards  accepted in the United States, the declared efficiency of this  system is dubious. For its part, Russia could put pressure on  the THAAD program at the discussion in the Standing Consultative  Commission, championing stricter limits on tactical ABM systems.  This, incidentally, is what the American side greatly fears  inasmuch as, in the opinion of a number of Western experts, the  United States' main mission at these discussions is the removal  of the THAAD system from the ABM Treaty limitations.    At the same time, on the other hand, trends toward a  broadening of cooperation in this sphere are intensifying in the  West. Thus, according to press reports, NATO could in the very  near future approve a plan of the creation and deployment of new  tactical ABM defenses, which are to be an integral part of an  expanded NATO ABM system. A European ABM would be developed on a  joint basis. The West European countries are making no secret of  their fears here that the United States will attempt to a  greater extent to sell NATO its THAAD system than perform joint  work on an equal basis. The United States, on the other hand,  reluctant to remain aloof from so important a program, believes  that a THAAD system could be merely the basis for the  development of European ABM defenses. The start of an entirely  new program on a joint basis cannot be ruled out here.    As far as Russia is concerned, the United States and NATO  are  hardly prepared to accept it as a partner in the creation of  tactical ABM systems. And it is not only a question of Russia  being a potential competitor for these countries on the  antimissile technology market and not even of the political  instability in our country still forcing the West to treat the  prospects of closer rapprochement with Russia, in the military  sphere included, with a certain wariness.    What is most important, rather, is the fact that all these  programs are being implemented and will be implemented within  the framework of the competitive military preparations of the  United States and NATO. They are closely linked with the  existing structure of the armed forces, of which they are to  become an organic part. In other words, the tactical ABM systems  are being made primarily "for themselves" -- for the fulfillment  of definite and specific assignments which are an integral part  of more general military plans of the said countries, which,  incidentally, are very far removed from the idea of the creation  of a "global" defense. From this viewpoint the programs of  tactical ABM defenses are not in the least distinguished from  other military programs of NATO being implemented both  independently and within the framework of the  military-industrial integration of the bloc. It would seem  unlikely under these conditions that the United States would  begin in parallel one further program in this sphere, but in  conjunction with Russia this time. Not to mention the additional  costs. It is a question here of the priorities of policy in the  sphere of military-technical cooperation, which are  unequivocally both considerably more to the west and more to the  east of Russia's borders.    But what will become of the idea of the creation of a GDS  put  forward at the top level of the leadership of Russia and the  United States? No global system of defense of the world  community in the direct meaning of this word will be created in  the foreseeable future. It could at best be a question only of  the creation of some new international structures of the Nuclear  Risk Reduction Center type which are united by the common name  of GDS and which are no more than a system of the exchange on a  permanent basis of the corresponding information connected with  the proliferation of ballistic missiles and the world  operational situation. But even this program of pseudo-defense  has enjoyed practically no development in the past two years.    In the face of the growing danger of the ever-increasing  proliferation of missile and nuclear weapons the two leading  states, which could counterpose to it not only a diplomatic but  also a defensive, protective mechanism, are deliberately  shunning this. Tactical ABM defenses, even if things get this  far, could hardly in the long term be a guarantee of security.  In addition, having confirmed the restrictions on the creation,  testing, and deployment of strategic ABM systems and attempting  to draw a line between strategic and tactical ballistic  missiles, in terms of warhead reentry velocity, in particular,  Russia and the United States are providing a good reference  point for the states endeavoring to possess missile weapons. It  will now be perfectly clear what missiles an ABM system could  not combat. There is just one conclusion: It is such missiles  that need to be acquired.</p>

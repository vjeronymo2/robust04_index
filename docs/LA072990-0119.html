			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL LAND GIVEAWAY: FINDING CULPRITS IN LOST SPACE  </P> <P> Jim Krembas of Laguna Niguel is not a bad fellow. I almost voted for him. The  fact that he signed away the Salt Creek Park to developers is not his fault.  </P> <P> He didn't do it deliberately, he says.  </P> <P> Moreover, he claims that he read it but didn't understand what he was signing.  (That's the kind of man we want running our local government. He's honest!)  </P> <P> Maybe he couldn't read it properly because he's near-sighted, which is not his  fault, or maybe he didn't understand it because it was written in legalese  which nobody understands (except lawyers and they don't tell, claiming  privilege like a priest). So we can't blame him for not being up on legalese  talk.  </P> <P> Perhaps he felt that Laguna Niguel had enough parks, and parks could cause  fathers and mothers to bring their children and waste time when they should be  working and being productive. (It's far-fetched, but it's an argument.)  </P> <P> Jim Krembas says there was no relation between his actions as a public official  and his wife's employment with the builders, Taylor Woodrow Homes. I believe  him. I don't think his wife is related to Taylor Woodrow Homes. Now, I want to  ask, if someone you did a little favor for approaches your wife and offers her  a good job, would you make her stay home and bake cookies?  </P> <P> So let's hear it for Jim Krembas!  </P> <P> DAVID DE KOVEN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

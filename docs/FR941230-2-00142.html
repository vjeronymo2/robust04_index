The main focus of this program is to prevent child abuse and neglect through the creation of parent support groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lowcountry Children's Center, Inc.*_$250,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lowcountry Children's Center, Inc., (the Center) is a community-based program that offers services to children who are victims of violence. The Center is a nonprofit organization located in Charleston, South Carolina. Its mission is to coordinate full range of services for abused and victimized children and their families. A major goal of the program is to restore child victims and their families to a healthy level of functioning. Client services currently offered by the Center include: Initial assessment, psychological testing, and individual, group, and family therapy. Other services include: Lay and expert testimony in court hearings, investigative/law enforcement services, on-going multidisciplinary case coordination and case tracking, professional training, and case and program consultation. The funding requested from OJJDP will allow the Center to complete the array of services necessary to create a model comprehensive program of intervention for these children and their families. The Center will also focus on program evaluation and research to determine effective interventions in particular types of case_enabling the model created by this funding to be fully evaluated and, if successful, replicated. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community-Based Alternatives_New Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communities attempting to refocus their juvenile justice resources on serious, violent, and chronic offenders will be assisted in developing comprehensive programs for juvenile offenders that combine accountability with treatment and rehabilitation services. These sites will be planning and implementing as many elements of OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy as resources permit. If successful, they will serve as models for other jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communities will also receive assistance in developing a continuum of community-based care for offenders who do not present a threat to public safety. For example, a program is proposed that would provide alternatives for females in the juvenile justice system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At-Risk Youth in Public Housing Communities_$2,000,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is designed to help communities build coalitions to reduce gangs and violence in public housing developments in partnership with public and federally subsidized housing residents. Fiscal year 1995 funding will establish the program in public and federally subsidized housing developments in the five Safe Futures Program sites. Under this program, community-based groups that can demonstrate a successful record of providing services to public housing youth and residents would be eligible to receive funds to develop a community coalition to address the needs of youth at risk for gang involvement. Program components would include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Prevention and intervention activities directed at elementary school through high school gang violence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) onsite technical assistance to community-based groups, including members of the local public housing resident association as well as residents who are parents of youth to be served. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each applicant would conduct a community assessment of current conditions and programs directed at youth and at preventing violence and establish a planning committee composed of residents and representatives from those sectors of the community which the residents believe can help reduce youth violence. If funded, the committee will plan, develop, and initiate its local program. At the end of the initial period, committees that have successfully organized an active community coalition, identified needed resources, and implemented one or more projects with youth of the community would be considered for continuation funding by OJJDP. It is anticipated that through an interagency agreement between OJJDP and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, funds and support will be provided for the technical assistance and training component of this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comprehensive Community-Based Services for At-Risk Girls and Adjudicated Juvenile Female Offenders_$400,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program would focus on providing comprehensive, gender-specific prevention, intervention, treatment, and alternative services that include an intensive aftercare component for juvenile female offenders and girls who are at high-risk of entering the juvenile justice system. The program would be part of the Safe Futures Program. Applicants must assess existing community services for at-risk and adjudicated female juvenile offenders and document the need for a new or improved comprehensive prevention, intervention, treatment, or alternative service project in their target area. An aftercare component would be required to assist juvenile female offenders who are returning to the community from an out-of-home placement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While intervention services should be provided in the least restrictive environment, the increase in arrests of female juvenile offenders indicates that community-based intervention is not always possible. In order to offer needed prevention and intervention services to as many juveniles as possible, this program would focus on girls in nonresidential and nonsecure residential programs such as day treatment and group homes. Up to $80,000 would be available to each of the five Safe Futures grantees to coordinate service providers in the community, assess existing services, identify local resources to supplement funded services, and provide training for project staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bethesda Day Treatment Center_$320,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pennsylvania's Bethesda Day Treatment Center is a private, nonprofit agency established to provide intensive day treatment and a variety of other services that promote the social adjustment of juvenile offenders in the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For four years, OJJDP has provided funds to the Center to develop and document intensive, outpatient, community-based treatment and care centers for juveniles at risk of delinquency and those who have been referred to court and are in the preadjudication or postadjudication stages of the juvenile justice system. Center services were initially designed to help youth in rural areas or small towns who committed offenses related to family supervision and control. More recently, the program has demonstrated its effectiveness in larger cities, including Kalamazoo, Michigan and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with juveniles who commit serious delinquent acts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bethesda Day Treatment Center's services include intensive supervision, counseling, and coordination of a range of services necessary to develop skills that enable youth to function appropriately in the community. Services are client, group, and family focused. Client-focused services include intake, casework, service and treatment planning, individual counseling, intensive supervision, and study skills. Group focused services include group counseling; life and jobs skill training, cultural enrichment, and physical education. Family focused activities include family counseling, home visits, parent counseling, and family intervention services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Day treatment services are cost effective, about 50 percent less than secure placement, and pose a minimal risk to community safety. Also, this approach can be implemented quickly. With management systems and funding in place, it takes only 6 to 9 months from startup to full implementation of a program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bethesda Day Treatment Center will offer to replicate the day treatment model in the five Safe Futures Program sites. Successful applicants will be eligible to submit applications to the Bethesda Day Treatment Center for up to $30,000, with a $30,000 local contribution, to receive training and technical assistance. Other local jurisdictions will also be eligible to receive services from the grantee under the same terms. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

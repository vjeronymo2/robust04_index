			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Subtle Doctor moves into Italy's political front line: Giuliano Amato, trying to form a government in Rome POLITICIANS rarely make the transition from backstage brains to frontline responsibility. But this is the challenge now facing Professor Giuliano Amato since he agreed last Thursday to form an Italian government. With his glasses perched precariously on the end of his nose and his aloof air, the 54-year-old constitutional law expert has always looked more at home delivering academic lectures than giving speeches at Socialist party meetings. He talks quietly and listens silently. After being given the unusual part-time job of Albania's chief debt negotiator last year, he shied away from publicity when most of his colleagues would have made a meal of this exotic task. The only enemies he has created are those envious of his formidable intellect, who feel he is too clever by half. Ever since Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, drafted him to run the prime minister's office in 1983, Prof Amato has been dubbed 'Dr Sottile' (literally the 'Subtle Doctor', but it also refers to his 'slight' figure). Although he subsequently held the key finance portfolio as treasury minister from 1987 to 1989 and is the deputy leader of the Socialist party, he is best known as the behind-the-scenes organiser, planner and thinker for Mr Craxi, who owed much of his success as prime minister to Mr Amato's tireless work and meticulous grasp of detail. His experience at the Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister's office, cemented a strong mutual respect between the two and Mr Amato has remained extraordinarily loyal. He even accepted the unpleasant task of acting as special commissioner to investigate corruption in the Milan branch of the Socialist party knowing this included the affairs of Mr Craxi's son and brother-in-law. But no one questioned either his impartiality or his respect for Mr Craxi. And when Mr Craxi last week recognised the cards were stacked against his own candidature, it was he who suggested Mr Amato should stand in his place. These links with Mr Craxi are important now for two reasons. Prof Amato needs to show that he is not a stalking horse for Mr Craxi's thwarted ambitions to acquire credibility. Second, he needs to insulate himself from the possibility that Mr Craxi and the Socialist party might be further implicated in the Milan corruption scandal, with its affect on other judicial investigations into Italian political corruption. On the latter point, Mr Amato should be reasonably well protected. In a world of corrupt politics, his reputation is one of patent honesty. Demonstrating his independence from Mr Craxi will be more complex. Traditionally, party bosses have sought to control the prime minister and dictate his cabinet. However, the financial plight of Italy, with rapidly deteriorating public finances and the lira under severe pressure, combined with the unprecedented weakness of the parties after the elections, has changed the rules of the game. The situation requires an emergency austerity programme, followed by electoral reform. All the parties recognise this and accept the idea of a more 'technocratic' cabinet. In essence, decisions are being forced upon Italy and Mr Amato has to execute them. To all intents and purposes, he will be forming a government of national salvation with initially limited objectives. The fragmented nature of the new parliament is unprecedented and obliges him to operate on the basis of broad cross-party support. Otherwise the government will not last. As it is, on the most optimistic scenarios, Prof Amato's task may be no more than to carry out essential measures ahead of an early general election in, say, 14 months. In this situation, his curious hybrid experience as academic and politician could prove the right mix. He began his career as a university lecturer after a postgraduate degree at Columbia University in New York, but he was soon acting as a legislative adviser to the Ministry of Planning. In the late 1970s he ran the research department of CGIL, the main trades union federation, dominated by the communists - a reflection of the strong socialist roots he inherited from his civil servant father. He stepped back into the administration, helping to reorganise the running of the cabinet office before steering a commission examining state share-holdings. He also acted as special adviser to the European Community on regional policy before standing as a Socialist deputy in 1983 for Turin. He was once quoted as saying: 'As treasury minister I am realising that everyone treats the budget like a Christmas tree from which they all feel entitled to take something.' Now, he has the unpopular task of forcibly removing the hands from the Christmas tree - or, perhaps more appropriate, the till.</p>

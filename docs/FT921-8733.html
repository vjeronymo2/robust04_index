			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / The Queen: in defence of the realm THE ARTICLE headlined 'The tourist in her own country,' by David Cannadine, which appeared on the front page of the Weekend FT on February 8, provoked a strong reaction from our readers. The debate continues here with a selection of letters from those who disagreed with his views on the Queen and the monarchy. Several readers questioned his credentials for writing the article. Cannadine, who is professor of history at Columbia University, New York, is in fact an Englishman. He is author of The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy and is writing a book on the constitutional monarchy. ***** From Mr SL Mayer Sir, David Cannadine has been living in the US too long. Never since the latter days of Victoria has a monarch been so popular as the present one. While it is perfectly true that her extended family may get up to occasional tricks which neither her people nor Her Majesty approve, it is also fair to say that members of the Royal family have had a bad press in the past and now have a very good one, and rightly so, because of continued dedication, hard work and service to their country such as that given by the Princess Royal. During World War II, Stalin enquired how many divisions the Pope had. Less than 50 years later, the state over which Stalin ruled has disappeared. But the papacy lives on, having played a rather important moral and ethical role in the Soviet Union's and the eastern bloc's demise. The Queen and the institution of the monarchy have this role in the English-language world; one of moral suasion and example shown by Her Majesty as well as many of her family, of devotion to duty, dedication to human and British values in a world which is not necessarily dedicated to any values at all. Since these values are shared by the entire Anglophone world, and admired by many who are not part of it, the Queen, as head of the Commonwealth, is the living symbol of all that is good which has gone before and which endures still; among these values are freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, democratic institutions and human values based on Christian ideals. These thoughts are universal and transcend both place and time. The Queen and the monarchy represent them all. In an ever-changing world, the people of the world and the people of Britain revere both those ideals and the sovereign lady who best and most loyally represents them. This does not mean that the institution of monarchy cannot or should not change. It may well be that the taxation issue will be altered, as it was in 1936; that the Royal family, now more extended than ever, may be pared down from public subsidy. But the Queen is probably the best-informed person in the kingdom and is certainly the longest high-ranking public servant, having now spent 40 years in the highest office. Far from being out of touch with her people, she is in constant touch with them and the peoples of the Commonwealth. Britain has an influence in the world, even today, which far exceeds its industrial power or population figures. It has this influence largely because of its monarchy and its Queen. I would imagine that 50 years from now, when the armies of Nato are confined to history as much as the power of the Warsaw Pact is now, and when other empires and great powers have waxed and waned, the institution of the British monarchy will remain, exercising its considerable moral influence over both Britain and the English-speaking peoples. Sydney L. Mayer, Connecticut, US ***** From Mr AC Teljer Sir, The article by David Cannadine examining the Queen's role might be fashionable in certain circles and possibly well-intended as an appraisal. It is, nevertheless, to a large extent misguided. If the 'old,' out-of-date imperial monarchy flourished from the time of Victoria's Golden Jubilee until the present Queen's accession, what of the profoundly majestic and noble kinship shown by the Queen's late father during the Second World War, and her parents' obvious involvement in their nation's sufferings? Kindred spirits, indeed - not lofty imperialists] The simple point Mr Cannadine has missed and failed to acknowledge is that the monarch, preferably a compassionate and indulgent one - which the Queen certainly is, however outmodish or 'limited in her social vision' he deems her - is there not only to reflect a nation's principles and role in the world, and to be involved in active and creative patronage. She is also to be uniquely there in showing her subjects, whether they be naturally British or of other races from other shores, that nearness of the state is available to all in her presence; not as a tourist in her own country (a ridiculous notion), but as an official of destiny within a dynasty undiluted by common dimensions by co-operating for the nation's good. Perhaps patriarchy or matriarchy in itself may prove outmoded, or even undesirable in modern technological society - reverence of one kind or another never will. Professor Cannadine may dislike the monarchy, or royalty in general. I believe he will always be in a small minority and that this particular band of blue bloods will always be indispensable to certain societies for a very long time into the next millennium. He asks: 'What is to be put in its place?' I say, nothing. Better the 'sycophantic mythology of imperial ornamentality' than the shallow conventionality of republican vapidity. AC Teljer, The Netherlands ***** From Mr Charles Spink Sir, Who is David Cannadine that you should not only give him the front page of the Weekend FT, but support him with such insulting caricatures? It is typical of the British press that probably no other country would print such disparaging rubbish about the monarchy and the British people. Charles Spink, Morpeth, Northumberland ***** From Mrs A. Robeison Sir, 'The tourist in her own country' was in appallingly poor taste. The aspersions the author casts on the Queen's personality and achievements are inaccurate, unwarranted and especially disgraceful. A. Robeison, Shrewsbury ***** From Sir John Stokes MP Sir, I am sure I am not alone among your readers in not taking too kindly to a lecture from a professor in an American university about the British monarchy. There are so many misconceptions in the professor's article which show that he completely misunderstands how ordinary English people feel about the monarchy. He patronises the Queen for her undoubted virtues, but then says she 'is conservative enough to regard most change for the worst,' thus sharing the views of at least half her subjects. Does the Professor think that a Queen full of radical views would be more appropriate? I dispute the professor's contention that our national identity has been weakened. It may have been so among the intelligentsia with whom probably he mixes, but not among people in pubs, factories etc, where patriotism still lies deep. Would a nation which is losing its way have undertaken and won the Falklands War with all the great risks involved? Or sent such incomparable forces to the Gulf War which earned the unstinted admiration from our American allies there? As for 'the old ways of doing things - ceremonial grandeur' - ordinary people love it. The ceremonies emphasise our long history and cohesion as a nation. Many continental countries would love to have a history such as ours and I am quite sure the British people will never agree to the bureaucrats of Brussels destroying our monarchy. The professor says that the British monarchy has lost its way, but I fear it is the professor himself who has lost his way. John Stokes, House of Commons, London SW1. ***** From Mr JA Philips Sir, How nice it would be if the Queen were to grant an audience to Professor Cannadine. I'm sure that he would pretty soon find that, like Mr Heath, he was 'expendable'. JA Philips, Somerset</p>

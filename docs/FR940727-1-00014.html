This proposal would require installation of two new circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This proposal is prompted by a report of smoke in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flight deck due to a lighting transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lighting transformer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by September 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;74&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advises that an incident occurred on a Model HS 125&hyph;700B series airplane when a 6 volt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output circuit from the flight deck lighting transformer on Panel 'RY' overheated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-circuited to ground. This resulted in a release of acrid smoke in the flight deck.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation revealed that the 6 volt output circuit was not protected by a fuse or circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaker. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke and fire in the flight deck  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 125&hyph;700A series airplanes are similar in type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design to Model BH/HS 125&hyph;700B series airplanes, the FAA has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 125&hyph;700A series airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.24&hyph;310&hyph;3544A&amp;B, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 14, 1994, which describes procedures for installing circuit breakers in the 6 volt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output circuits of two flight deck lighting transformers. The purpose of the circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breakers is to provide circuit protection for the 6-volt output wires and to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overheating and short circuiting. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel 'RY.' The actions would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $212,100, or $1,050 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

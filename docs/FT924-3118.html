			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean gives Gummer mixed reaction to banana proposals MR John Gummer, Britain's farm minister, made a hurried trip through the Caribbean at the weekend to try to mollify growing regional concern over new UK proposals for the marketing of bananas when the single European market is created next month. In his wake, the reaction in the region was mixed, with expressions of hope that the new proposals would guarantee the market access which the Caribbean producers want, following indications that Britain will suggest the EC use tariffs instead of quotas for banana imports. Mr Gummer's whirlwind visit, in which he met representatives of the Belize, Jamaica and Windward Islands banana industries in separate meetings over two days, was intended to explain the proposals which Britain, as the EC president, hopes to present to next week's meeting of the community's farm ministers. A statement issued by the St Lucian government said the Windward islands were 'satisfied' with the new British proposals which 'addressed the concern of the Windward islands and other Caribbean producers and meet Europe's obligations enshrined in the Lome Convention, while not offending the terms of the GATT negotiations now approaching completion'. The meeting in St Lucia was attended by Mr John Compton, the prime minister of that island, and Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica, and ministers from Grenada and St Vincent. The statement said the Windward islands were 'satisfied that the Gummer proposals represent a serious attempt to break the deadlock and provide a satisfactory solution to the banana problem.' Mr Marshall Hall, chairman of the Banana Export Company of Jamaica, said he would be surprised 'if there is a change of direction on the banana policy at this late stage'. He said that if this were so, Caribbean producers would insist that the provisions of the Lome Convention be respected. The convention is a trade treaty between the EC and members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group. The banana protocol of the convention says the EC will undertake to ensure that ACP banana exporters are left in no worse a position by changes in the market for the fruit. 'We have said to the British that it is clear nothing can be agreed by January 1, and that we therefore need a marketing regime which must be similar to the one in place now,' said Mr Hall. However, some industry representatives in the region say the 'tariffication' of the market being proposed by Britain goes against earlier commitments that markets will be protected, and that this latest change will satisfy only the Latin American producers who have been arguing against the use of EC import quotas. The minister told the House of Commons last week that the UK and France had planned 'intermediate measures' to protect the exports of traditional suppliers; and that the UK was not tied to any one method but was instead 'tied to an end'. The European Commission had earlier suggested the use of quotas to guarantee the market of the traditional suppliers of the ACP group. But Mr Gummer is reported to have told the Caribbean political leaders and banana industry officials in the meetings over the weekend that no agreement on the Commission's proposal was possible because quotas were not acceptable to several EC members, including Germany, Belgium and Denmark. Mr Gummer also told the Caribbean producers that in light of an expected agreement between the US and the EC on trade in farm products, a GATT waiver to allow banana quotas would be difficult, and that a 'GATT-compatible' agreement on bananas was needed. There will be no solution to the problem by the January 1 deadline, the minister said, but the UK had devised a plan which would allow Caribbean and other ACP banana producers some protection after the Europe single market was effected. There is reluctance in the region to give details of what Mr Gummer proposed in the meetings. The British minister is reported to have explained to the Caribbean leaders and the banana industry representatives that the new proposals which would see tariffs on ACP fruit, with country-specific tonnages being allocated for fruit from ACP producers and with agreed quantities to be imported from other sources, mainly from Latin American countries. Caribbean representatives in the several meetings told Mr Gummer that they preferred the original European Commission proposals for the application of quotas, but that if this were not possible, then they would be comfortable only if the tonnages for Latin American fruit were low, and the tariffs to be applied were high.</p>

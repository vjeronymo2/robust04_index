			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Gilts: Auction statement ends speculation on full funding THE BANK of England's announcement last week that it is to hold a gilts auction on August 26 came as little surprise to the market. It was in line with the bank's unofficial schedule of an auction every two months. It did, however, end recent speculation that it may abandon the full fund rule as a means of easing monetary conditions. The rule obliges the authorities to fund the government deficit in full by sales of debt outside the banking and building society sectors. The market reacted favourably to the bank's decision to issue long-dated stock with a 15-year maturity. This was both what traders expected and wanted, and they expect an auction of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury 2017. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The reason for issuing at the long end is that is where most of the demand has been recently. It has been the UK institutions - life assurance and pension funds  -that have been the big buyers.' The bank said the amount and terms of the auction would be announced on August 18 at 2.30 pm. Although the latest monetary figures from the bank show overseas demand for UK government stock picked up in June, the big increase this year in the amount of gilts issues has been absorbed mainly by domestic investors. The long end remains attractive. The inflation outlook is encouraging and domestic investors have more faith than overseas investors in the government's ability to withstand the clamour for devaluation. Last week, the spectre of a no vote in the French referendum on ratifying the Maastricht treaty cast a pall over all European bond markets. Gilt prices were also affected by sterling's weakness, although they ended mostly unchanged on the week. This week traders expect prices to drift lower ahead of the auction on August 26, in spite of more good news on inflation. A string of statistics this week on the UK are forecast to show the real economy remains in recession, but that the battle against inflation continues to be successful. The producer prices and retail prices indices are expected to show a further fall in the rate of inflation, as is a forecast drop in May's rise in annual average earnings to 6.25 per cent from 6.5 per cent. The gilts market paused for thought last week when the Treasury announced it was cutting National Savings interest rates, to avoid mortgage rate rises by building societies. Although this means the government will have to sell more bonds to fund fully the public sector borrowing requirement, the decision had little impact on gilts. This is because the contribution of National Savings to funding is well ahead of the government's unofficial target of about Pounds 6bn for the year. Last month National Savings contributed Pounds 600m, bringing the total for the first four months of the financial year to about Pounds 2.1bn. Analysts believe gilts sales will therefore have to be higher, but not significantly so. Lex, Back Page</p>

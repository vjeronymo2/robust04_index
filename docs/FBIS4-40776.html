			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olga Nikitina, journalist and director of the </F> Saratov Regional Environmental Committee: "Poisons at Shikany"]    [Excerpts] Who trusts it? Nobody, it seems -- at least  when it comes to chemical weapons. Russia was one of the first  countries to sign the convention to abolish chemical arsenals  (on 13 January 1993), but the suspicions remain. Every other  week the United States accuses it of having no intention of  eliminating the arsenals but of in fact planning a superweapon.  The decree with which Boris Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy  Kunzevich, chairman of the Chemical and Biological Weapons  Affairs Committee, was not very reassuring. "He authorized the  shipment of a dangerous load through an inhabited area,"  spokesmen explained. That was a mere pretext. Kunzevich  (formerly director of the military laboratory at Shikany, which  we discuss below) pointed out that the administrations of the  places where the arsenals are located are refusing to grant the  Army permission to get rid of the substances on the spot, so it  is impossible to eliminate them. Even the Russians no longer  trust Russia. There are many "converts" among scientists (we  interviewed engineer Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov), and many local  communities are prepared to mobilize. Meanwhile 40,000 tonnes  of toxic substances lie in arsenals all over the country. Apart  from nuclear weapons, they constitute the most colossal  accumulation of means of destruction that exists on Earth at  present.    The chemical history of Shikany -- an ancient possession of  the Orlov-Denisov nobility in Volskiy province in the region of  Saratov -- begins in 1924. [passage omitted]    After the war, Shikany, which has a population of 12,000,  was  divided into two parts. Shikany 1 is assigned to the Industry  Ministry. It is the location of the State Institute for Organic  Synthesis Technologies, housed in a small building. For the  past 30 years it has been one of the main research centers into  the most harmful substances for civilian applications. Shikany  2 is the location of the Scientific Experiments Institute and  the Defense Ministry's test range for weapons and chemical and  radioactive defense methods.    After decades of experiments, nobody can say what has been  absorbed by the grass and trees of this area, which covers  almost 400 square km, nor what kind of deposits have formed at  the bottom of the lake that is the source of the Bagayka stream,  which debouches into the Volga. With regard to the Volga, which  crosses the area, it should be kept in mind that on the opposite  bank from Shikany 1 and 2 there lies the village of Gornyy,  where the Army has located deposits containing over 1,000 tonnes  of toxic substances. Although the military carries out regular  checks, the conservation of these toxic substances has now  become extremely dangerous; the deposits are old, the containers  are no longer secure, and although the construction of a  terminal to reduce the toxicity of the substances has been  announced, it will take a long time yet.    All this information has emerged gradually from the  population. After the statements by Vil Mirzayanov, a number of  "betrayers of state secrets" emerged, some of them within the  local authorities and among the technicians of the Shikany  laboratories. The first was Vladimir Petrenko -- reserve major  and member of the local council -- who recounted how in the past  he had allowed the effects of certain substances to be tested on  himself; he was followed by Vladimir Uglev, a chemical engineer  at Shikany, who defended Mirzayanov. Then the inhabitants of  the area formed a movement "Against the Chemical Threat," to  protest their position of hostages of the military industry.    All this brought about a new awareness among the Russian  public which, though more than justified, ultimately rebounded  against us members of the Environmental Committee. As well as  in the Saratov region, there are major deposits of chemical  substances also in Chuvasha and Udmurtia. It seemed clear to us  that these substances must be rendered harmless or eliminated in  their present locations and that such a burden could not be  transferred to others. However, the republics of Chuvasha and  Udmurtia have banned any elimination of chemical weapons on  their own territory.    So all that was left to the Saratov region was to dictate  the  conditions drawn up by the local authorities together with the  regional environmental committee and a group of experts: to  eliminate only the substances already present in the region; to  draw up a plan for the social development of Gornyy and Shikany;  to compensate all the inhabitants for the threat of  environmental damage; to create a regional center to monitor  work carried out against any pollution. These proposals were  sent to the government and to Parliament, but no reply has yet  been received. The inhabitants of the Saratov region remain  alone with their anxieties.    Meanwhile, the experimental scientific center at Shikany  has also fallen victim to the economic crisis. In February it  ceased its activities, offering its staff a choice between  seeking another job or taking an enforced vacation. Since staff  had not received their wages since December, there was an  immediate "exodus": Of the 2,500 staff, there are now only  1,500 left. Apart from unemployment, the inhabitants of Shikany  have also discovered that they are "prisoners" of the Defense  Ministry, which owns almost one-third of the entire province.  It is therefore forbidden to privatize either the land for  farming or the apartments. For the same reason it is forbidden  to construct private factories or workshops that could provide  employment.    "Thank God," Nadezhda Saratov, mayor of Shikany, said, "the  Defense Ministry still has the money to pay the wages of the  staff at Shikany 2. But it is impossible to distinguish the two  halves of the town, even though they are in the charge of  different ministries: The people are the same and so are their  problems, and they all share the same anxiety about how the  elimination of the chemical deposits will take place."    Last summer many inhabitants of Shikany and the surrounding  area reported skin infections, especially those who were  outdoors when it rained. In February six soldiers serving at  Shikany 2 were admitted to hospital with pulmonary edema.  Fortunately they all survived.    It may be just a coincidence, but the inhabitants of Shikany  are now accustomed to being suspicious. They therefore  immediately connected these events with the fact that the  "chemical friendship" with the Germans has been revived. A new  agreement has been signed between Russia and Germany, and  Germany has already sent to the area a mobile laboratory and  complete equipment for eliminating the toxic substances. Many  years ago the Germans helped us to create chemicals for death,  and now they want to help us to eliminate them. In 1915 they  tried to use gas on the river Ypr, now it seems that all toxic  substances must end up on the banks of the Volga. According to  incomplete data, along the banks of our great river there are 29  centers for the production of chemical weapons, nine test  ranges, and 24 deposits. Who will help us to eliminate this  evil force?</p>

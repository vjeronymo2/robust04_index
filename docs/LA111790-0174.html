			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> COMPANY PROMOTES VIDEOS AS DEVELOPERS' BEST SELLING POINT  </P> <P> Developers may think they've tried just about everything to line up a financial  backer in these troubled times, but they probably haven't yet resorted to  videotape. But if a local company has its way, developers will soon be starring  in videos that could probably be titled "It Came From a Tustin Industrial  Park."  </P> <P> A perky press release from a company called Global Video Marketing in Costa  Mesa says it will put a videotape of clients' real estate projects into the  hands of people all over the world with money to invest. The company claims  that at least two local developers have profited this way.  </P> <P> "Video is the ideal medium for reaching out to the individuals, institutions  and syndications of sophisticated financiers worldwide who are investing in  American real estate," says Gene Growbridge of Global Video.  </P> <P> But if you're a developer in search of money, be sure and wear your best suit.  One of the big selling points of video, says Global, is that the potential  investor not only gets a good picture of your project but also of you.  </P> <P> "In real estate, the first thing you're selling is yourself, not your building  for sale or a joint venture opportunity," says Daniel Hopsicker, another Global  Video executive.  </P></p>

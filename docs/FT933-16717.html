			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Council's computer dispute resolved A COSTLY three-year legal dispute has been settled over the assets of a council's privatised computer services business which went into liquidation. Former officials of the local authority subsequently faced fraud charges. West Wiltshire district council, based in Trowbridge, privatised its computer systems division in 1989 as West Wiltshire Information Systems, a company run by Mr Gerald Garland, the council's former chief executive, and other ex-council officials. The council received no cash for the business, which was independently valued at between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m. The new chief executive, Mr Don Latham, called in the district auditor who produced highly critical reports which resulted, after legal advice, in the council cancelling its own contract with the company and taking back the business. The company went into liquidation in July 1990 and a police investigation started. The subsequent dispute has been between the council and the liquidator, Mr Robert Buller of Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, over the ownership of soft-ware. Under the terms of the settlement the council will retain those rights but will make payments, plus interest, which will allow the claims of 35 creditors of the company who are owed more than Pounds 200,000 to be met in full. Shareholders, who are principally the directors, will receive nothing. Mr Latham said yesterday that the litigation had cost the council Pounds 750,000 but the council now had undisputed ownership of the business, which made a surplus last year of Pounds 2.5m. Mr Garland and seven others have been bailed to appear in court on fraud charges in October. The council also has a civil claim seeking to recover a total of Pounds 779,000 from seven of the defendants.</p>

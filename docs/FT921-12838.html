			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei extends recovery to second day running SHARE prices fluctuated on option-related trading, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher, up for the second day running for the first time this year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which gained 3.2 per cent on Wednesday, added another 46.60 to 21,5180.72 after a high of 21,794.17 and a low of 21,440.53. Volume fell to 250m shares from 270m, as most institutional investors remained inactive. However, traders said that the total number of orders had risen sharply, reflecting a rise in individual interest. Gainers led losers by 654 to 331, with 161 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks rose 6.97 points to 1,610.78 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.09 to 1,239.01. Speculative activity by options players dominated price movements, as options traders are entitled to exercise contracts every Thursday. The Nikkei saw volatile movement, as holders of call options, or buying rights, tried to push it up while market participants with put options, or selling rights, were seen selling stocks to lower the index. Rumours that financial authorities had requested life assurance companies to support the market added some cheer, and some banks and individuals were seen small-lot buying. However, traders said that buying by foreign investors, which had previously supported international blue chips, had disappeared. Some high-technology issues lost earlier gains. Sony closed down Y10 at Y4,260 and Fujitsu, Y20 at Y800. Hitachi, which rose in the morning on forecasts of a recovery in the US semiconductor market, finally finished unchanged on profit-taking by institutional investors. However, some issues in the sector gained on bargain-hunting and hopes of a recovery in the US economy. TDK surged Y150 to Y4,660 and Fanuc added Y60 to Y4,350. Investment trust selling depressed Nippon Steel, which fell Y4 to Y352. Investment trust groups, which face redemptions of unit trusts sold to investors three years ago, have started to liquidate holdings because of the lack of a new inflow of funds. Paper stocks were actively traded on hopes of recovery in the industry's profits. Jujo Paper rose Y16 to Y635, but Oji Paper, which gained on Wednesday, fell Y8 to Y873 on profit taking. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 255.86 to 22,979.34 in volume of 46.1m shares. The market posted broadly based gains on active buying by individuals and foreign investors. Roundup Hong Kong stood out while other Pacific Rim markets remained mixed. HONG KONG soared to a record close on a report that counter-revolutionary charges against the former Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang had been dropped. The Hang Seng index put on 75.12 to 4,625.84. Turnover was heavy at HKDollars 3.52bn, up from HKDollars 2.31bn. An official Chinese denial of the Zhao Ziyang report came after the market had closed. SEOUL rose as high interest rates, which had attracted money away from the market, showed signs of easing. The composite index closed 21.19 higher at 667.47 as turnover climbed to Won631bn from Won462bn. Three-year corporate bond market yields have fallen to around 17.95 per cent from a 1991 peak of 19.6 per cent. AUSTRALIA saw mixed trading with offshore institutional and some domestic selling leading the market back down after earlier gains. The All Ordinaries index rose 4.0 to 1,635.5 as turnover eased from ADollars 281m to ADollars 259m. One analyst said that Asian institutions were selling, and returning to their domestic equity markets. 'They see Asia coming out of the recession before Australia, and some want to take full advantage,' he said. SINGAPORE closed mixed after profit-taking emerged to pare early gains in moderate trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,545.72, up 4.42. NEW ZEALAND broke a four-day losing streak, the NZSE-40 index rising 3.58 to 1,476.16. BANGKOK reported heavy trading in property and finance issues, as turnover rose from Bt8.49bn to Bt10.89bn and the SET index ended 7.55 higher at 780.26. Tanayong, a property company, topped the most active list as it rose Bt12, or 10 per cent, to Bt132 with Bt1bn of shares changing hands. JAKARTA saw active trading, in volume of nearly 10m shares as the index rose 0.42 to 256.58. Brokers said much of the activity came from local investors who had shunned the market for the past eighteen months in favour of high interest bank deposits. BOMBAY closed with the BSE index at 2,150.41, up 17.59 but down from the day's high of 2,184.99. Speculative demand was sustained but analysts said that state-owned investment institutions sold heavily in all major stocks, smothering the rally.</p>

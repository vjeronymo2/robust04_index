			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Reuters Having outperformed the market over the past two months Reuters share price faltered last week, suggesting it may be due for a correction. Despite its best efforts, the company has yet to convince the City that Globex, its new out-of-hours trading system for futures and options, will be a real money-spinner. In the context of a company with first-half profits of Pounds 187m, revenues from the project are still trifling. The lingering concern is whether Globex will make a substantial contribution to earnings until well into the second half of the decade. Granted, the number of terminals installed appears to be on target and the system's technical performance is well up to scratch. Yet revenue growth from transaction charges is slow, due to low trading volume. Globex is not the only weapon in Reuters' armoury, although the prospects for the Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange trading system are equally obscure. There is ample scope for cutting costs, but a price earnings multiple of 22 times last year's earnings demands a growth rate unlikely to come from increased efficiency. The new focus on television, evidenced by the company's involvement in the consortium bidding for ITN, makes strategic sense but will hardly match the high margins and rapid growth which it has enjoyed from financial market products. There is also the question of what the company should do with its rising cash pile: distribution to shareholders in the form of a higher dividend could be a sign Reuters is abandoning its status as a growth stock.</p>

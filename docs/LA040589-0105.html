			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLAMOUR'S 50TH BIRTHDAY PARTY: IT'S STILL FLYING HIGH  </P> <P> It was 50 years ago this month that Glamour magazine (then dubbed Glamour of  Hollywood) debuted on newsstands, giving the country's females a monthly bible  of fashion trends and other girly advice.  </P> <P> A half-century later it's still doling out fashion tips, in addition to job  strategies, relationship advice and bedroom etiquette.  </P> <P> Monday night at DC3 (the much-written about Santa Monica Airport restaurant)  the magazine celebrated its birthday. Guests crowded into the airy marble and  wood eatery just as the sun was setting.  </P> <P> As they dined on oysters and crudites, a bank of video monitors broadcast  vintage Glamour covers (which would look retro-hip if done today) and  interviews with former cover girls like Cybill Shepherd as speakers blasted  hits from '60s girls groups and current top-40 hits.  </P> <P> Women chatted about how Glamour-isms have pervaded their language and remarked  how they regularly point out Glamour Do's and Don't's, talk about how to spend  Private Time and how to solve their Sticky Situations of the Month. Upon  hearing this, publisher Jack Kliger cried, "Oh my God! We've become an  institution!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Art Director  </P> <P> Although Kliger wasn't around when the first issue of Glamour hit the stands,  Charlotte McNamara was. The magazine's first art director was flown from her  home in Mexico to attend the party.  </P> <P> "I can't believe the time has passed!" she said, and recalled, "We wanted so  badly to make it stand out on the newsstands. I think it would still stand out  on the newsstands today."  </P> <P> Added the now-retired McNamara, "They tell me I was the first woman art  director of a major publication in the United States. But there was a lot of  prejudice against women in those days. At one point I wanted to work at Gourmet  magazine because I love to cook, but I was told that they wanted to hire a  man."  </P> <P> In 1975 a Rutgers co-ed named Sheryl Lee Ralph was named a Top Ten College  Women winner. Back then, Ralph planned on a career in medicine; today she's an  actress who has appeared in "The Mighty Quinn" and "Skin Deep."  </P> <P> "You know," Ralph said, "with all my credits, the one thing that always gets  mentioned is the fact that I was a Glamour Top Ten College Woman. The  magazine's been very supportive (of my career), at every plateau they've been  there. How many editors of magazines take the time to drop you a note to wish  you well?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Food Was a Draw  </P> <P> Others seen drifting back through the restaurant's many rooms were Glamour  Editor Ruth Whitney (wearing gold "50" earrings), supermodel Beverly Johnson,  West Coast Editor Daina Hulet, plus various fashion industry reps, models, and  girls who just looked like models.  </P> <P> The food was a definite draw. Since the restaurant has been written up in  countless reviews, guests were eager to try out the various dishes: grilled  swordfish with lemon butter, filet mignon with potatoes and horseradish sauce,  grilled chicken with herbs, Caesar salad, and a chocolate, vanilla and  strawberry cake with "50" written in raspberries.  </P> <P> The majority practiced fashion do's in this crowd, which dressed in post-work  chic. Some women opted for little black suits, accessorized with hats or  monster cables (known also as the Chanel look), or pant suits. Men wore trim  suits and "conversation ties," patterned with an interesting design or picture  that instigate conversations ("Hey, where'd you get this? . . .").  </P> <P> The one fashion don't stand-out was a man with glitter in his bushy, blow-dried  hair. Maybe he needed his subscription renewed.  </P></p>

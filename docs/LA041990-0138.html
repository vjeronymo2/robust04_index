			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP AND FEINSTEIN AGREE TO TWO TV DEBATES  </P> <P> John K. Van de Kamp and Dianne Feinstein agreed to debate on live, prime-time  television twice next month -- staking the outcome of a long and closely  matched Democratic primary race for governor on 120 minutes of daredevil  political TV.  </P> <P> The decision, announced by the two campaigns Wednesday, runs contrary to the  modern trend in California politics, in which televised debates are avoided as  too venturesome, too hard to control and too apt to be decisive in a close  contest. Political researchers said they could find no contemporary precedent  for such televised, pre-primay debates among the major contenders in a  California governor's race.  </P> <P> But self-confidence and the lack of a breakaway front-runner -- and, maybe, a  dash of hard-headedness -- apparently provided the right chemistry to enliven  this mostly lackluster contest between Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor  of San Francisco, and Van de Kamp, the 54-year-old state attorney general.  </P> <P> "We look forward to a fair and interesting debate," the two candidates said in  joint letters of acceptance.  </P> <P> Their agreement calls for a Sunday, May 13, encounter on KPIX-TV in San  Francisco to be offered for simulcast on KRON-TV, also in San Francisco. It is  unclear whether it will be offered to stations outside the Bay Area. The second  debate will be Monday, May 21, at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, sponsored by the  League of Women Voters, with simultaneous feeds to stations in other cities.  Each debate is to be an hour long, in the familiar format which has the  candidates questioned by a panel of hand-picked journalists.  </P> <P> Aides to the candidates said they had been assured by the stations that the  debates will occur in prime time. No restrictions were placed on subject  matter.  </P> <P> Political professionals were quick to suggest that the two debates in this  particular race may be of profound importance. Some of their reasons why:  </P> <P> The candidates have swapped leads in public opinion polls and taken turns  riding the momentum of the moment, but neither has shown a sure-footed ability  to run in front. The timing of the appearances puts the two in view of  Californians just as large numbers of voters find their interest awakening in  the race. Neither contender seems able to raise commanding sums of money that  could dominate the advertising airwaves. And, frankly, neither candidate has  developed stirring themes.  </P> <P> "There is no sense of who they really are as people. . . . These debates will  allow people to assess -- without a filter -- just who these candidates are and  who they like. And like is going to be real important in this election," said  Barbara O'Connor of the Institute for the Study of Media and Politics at  Sacramento State University. "Neither of the candidates is very likable as they  have been packaged so far."  </P> <P> O'Conner, the League of Women Voters and other experts said there is no record  of a televised pre-primary campaign debate on live television among the major  candidates for governor. In the past, there have been so-called "joint forums"  among candidates of the same party, but nothing on the order of an event that  could reach millions, live, in a single hour.  </P> <P> Democratic political consultant Kam Kuwata, who is affiliated with neither  campaign, said: "It will be a major defining event of this campaign. With the  candidates there side by side, voters have a chance to comparison shop."  </P> <P> Debates tend to take surprising turns and end up hinging on one single moment  or a memorable line, making it risky to guess what is ahead. But observers  following this campaign closely agree that the two candidates come to the  studio stage with different strengths and potential weaknesses.  </P> <P> Feinstein is mediagenic and has a knack for presenting herself as both emphatic  and sincere. She has stumbled on occasion, however, when it came to knowledge  of state government. Van de Kamp, on the other hand, is extremely conversant  about state government. But the camera is not nearly as friendly to him, and he  tends to sound too lawyerly.  </P> <P> Back in February, Feinstein had proposed six debates, and Van de Kamp accepted.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Van de Kamp expressed some bitterness that the campaigns were  able to agree only on two. During staff-level negotiations, he said, both  campaigns first agreed on a compromise four debates -- two on television, one  without cameras for print reporters and one with radio journalists.  </P> <P> "We have been informed that Dianne Feinstein is now unwilling to participate in  even this scaled-down version of her challenge. That is regretable," said Van  de Kamp in a cover letter released Wednesday.  </P> <P> Feinstein aides said Van de Kamp dallied in getting his side to the negotiating  table, leaving not enough time for more than two debates.  </P></p>

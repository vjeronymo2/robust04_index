			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR BOARD OKS CONCEPT OF SAN PEDRO OFFICE COMPLEX  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners took several important steps  toward approving construction of an office complex on port-owned property in  downtown San Pedro Wednesday, but nevertheless declined to give its full  commitment to the project.  </P> <P> By a 4-0 vote, the board accepted a conceptual master plan for the development,  ordered an environmental impact study and authorized port officials to pay a  consultant as much as $879,000 over the next three years to help oversee the  project.  </P> <P> But the board members -- particularly Commissioner Ronald Lushing -- made it  clear Wednesday that they are not yet convinced the development should be built  on the scale outlined in the master plan, which was drafted by yet another  consultant who received $204,000 for the work.  </P> <P> The plan envisions a heavily landscaped, two-block complex that would encompass  the port's current headquarters, a new visitor center and a new 11-story office  building that would be occupied jointly by port employees and tenants.  </P> <P> The complex, which would force the abandonment of a portion of Palos Verdes  Street, would be the last major project in San Pedro's downtown redevelopment  area. The 200,000-square-foot office building would be roughly the same size as  the Sheraton Hotel now under construction a few blocks away.  </P> <P> Lushing, however, said he wanted more information on whether there is a market  for that much additional office space in San Pedro. He successfully pressed the  board to agree to review the scope of the project before an architect is hired  to design it.  </P> <P> "It seems to me," Lushing said, "that all of us need to decide, before it goes  to an architect, what the project should be."  </P> <P> In an interview after the meeting, Chief Harbor Engineer Vern Hall said the  port staff intends to use the master plan as a guideline for the "maximum  project" the port would build.  </P> <P> Hall said the new consulting firm, URS Consultants Inc., will provide the port  with architectural and engineering expertise. Although the port does have  architects and engineers on its staff, Hall said they are unaccustomed to  building commercial developments and in any case would not have the time to  devote to the proposed office complex.  </P> <P> He said the commissioners' decision to withhold final approval of the master  plan should not affect the port's efforts to find an architect to design the  project and that he expects an architect will be selected by next April.  </P> <P> The commissioners' reluctance to give their full backing to the master plan was  a disappointment for San Pedro's business leaders, who for years have been  pushing the port to develop the vacant parcel across the street from Harbor  Department headquarters.  </P> <P> After the commissioners' vote, Leron Gubler, executive director of the San  Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, said the business community's "gravest  concern is that we get a commitment to this project."  </P> <P> Gubler said the additional office space is essential to the rebirth of downtown  San Pedro. He noted that some corporations have left the community for Long  Beach because there was no place for them to expand.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is create a corporate climate here," Gubler said. "In  order to do that, you've got to create a critical mass. We want to get enough  business in here so that we don't lose business."  </P> <P> Plans for the port office building have been kicking around since 1983, when  the Harbor Department paid the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency $4.3  million for 2.6 acres of property in the Beacon Street Redevelopment Area, an  urban renewal effort launched by the CRA in 1969.  </P> <P> The property, which fronts Harbor Boulevard, adjoins a parcel the port already  owned.  </P> <P> The agreement between the CRA and the port called for the Harbor Department to  select a developer and submit basic plans for the parcel by Aug. 7, 1984. After  numerous deadlines came and went, the port selected a Hollywood firm as a  developer, only to ditch that company in August, 1988. At that time, the port  declared it would build the office tower itself.  </P> <P> The current timetable calls for construction to begin in the spring of 1992 and  to be completed in the mid-1990s.  </P></p>

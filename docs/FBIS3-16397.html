			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of </F> the Armenian Supreme Council, with Grigor Geuzelyan; in Yerevan  on 14 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Geuzelyan] The Babken Ararktsyan-Rasul Guliyev  meeting continues to be the focus of attention of reporters,  politicians, and public [words indistinct]. The news conference  held by the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments  provided the most documentary evidence about that meeting.    Considering the importance of the event and broad audience,  I  have eliminated the reporters' questions during the news  conference, and I thought it appropriate to quote Ararktsyan's  words as completely as possible.    [Ararktsyan] A meeting took place between me and Rasul  Guliyev, chairman of the Azerbaijani parliament, on the  Idzhevan-Kazakh road on 12 March. This was our first meeting.  During our first telephone conversation, I congratulated Mr.  Guliyev on being elected chairman of the parliament. We had  agreed at the time to meet at an opportune time. The  opportunity arose at this time. I think that the talks were  constructive in nature, and we agreed to discuss matters  pertaining to the future, and basically not to brood over, or  analyze, or examine past events. I could say that basically the  talks centered around these matters. Naturally, we could not  have delved into details and examine details. Therefore, we  divided the talks in two: global matters, including the  approach of the two sides to the Karabakh problem. Also, on our  part we had our own specific proposals, which I will inform you  about.    As regards the first problem, the sides confirmed once again  that they favor a peaceful resolution of the problem, and that  the establishment of a stable and guaranteed peace in the region  is a priority. And only then start negotiations on the status  of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is in conformity with CSCE Minsk  Group's initiatives which are enshrined in the schedule on  urgent measures worked out in Vienna.    The next one was that Nagorno-Karabakh should fully  participate in the settlement process of the problem. As you  know, in this case too, the Vienna schedule notes that  Nagorno-Karabakh is a party to the conflict, and that this in  itself does not imply any political consequences.    Next, the sides agreed that international organizations, in  particular CSCE, should take part in the peace process, and  various countries -- as you know Russia has its own proposals  and initiatives -- could come forward with their own initiatives.    That the Lachin humanitarian corridor should always be  functional was also raised.    I again repeat, these were the global issues raised, we have  not gone into detail, which is the work of the diplomats.    These were the main global issues on which we (?agreed).    In addition to that, our side, the Armenian side, guided by  the fact that the atmosphere of mutual confidence should be  restored [words indistinct], made a unilateral proposal.  Specifically, that Armenia is ready to make its communication  routes available for transportation of (?certain) goods from  Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Let me say that this is not a new  proposal. Our government had proposed to Turkey more than a  year ago that Armenia is ready to make its communications routes  available for the transportation of freight to Nakhichevan.  This is a reply to the claims of certain circles that  Nakhichevan is allegedly also under blockade.    The second concrete proposal, which was made for the first  time, was that Armenia is unilaterally ready, without any  preconditions, to make its communications routes available to  bring (?fuel) and power to Nakhichevan. We are ready to enter  into technical talks even this very day or tomorrow to realize  this plan.    These are in general the issues raised [words indistinct].  As regards these last two proposals, the Azerbaijani side will  study them and reply [words indistinct]. I repeat that we have  placed no preconditions as regards these concrete proposals, and  (?they) could be implemented very quickly [words indistinct]    [Geuzelyan] The chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council was  asked many questions. Let me mention only one, the most  interesting one. Asked if he believes that peace could be  achieved this year, Mr. Ararktsyan said:    [Ararktsyan] I do not want to engage in predictions. I am  trying to do concrete work as much as possible. It is clear  that this is the most important issue and we should exert all  efforts to attain peace, of course, an honorable and just peace.

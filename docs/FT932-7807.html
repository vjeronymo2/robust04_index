			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Control agrees with creditors laden property, pubs and brewing group, announced agreement in principle with its major creditors yesterday on restructuring proposals which would enable its shares to resume trading by the end of July. The proposals, which will be subject to shareholder and bondholder approval, are designed to provide the group with what Mr John Kerslake, finance director, described as 'a one year breathing space,' while it embarks on a new business plan aimed at reducing gearing and strengthening the balance sheet by converting debt into equity. Control's shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p since October 1991, when the group's offices were raided by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the investigation into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The group was not under investigation, but Mr Nazmu Virani, its former chairman and chief executive, was arrested in March last year in connection with BCCI. Since July last year the group has been operating under a series of 30-day standstill agreements with its banks, led by Barclays, while the restructuring negotiations were conducted. The centerpiece of the proposals is a new business plan under which the bulk of the group's assets would be sold in a 'controlled programme of disposals' with the proceeds being used to repay the group's Pounds 148m bank debt in full. The asset sale would include the group's mixed property portfolio which, it is hoped, would be largely sold by mid-1995, the group's UK and Spanish hotel operations and the Belhaven brewery in Scotland and 61 Scottish pubs. In addition the group's Swiss franc bondholders will be offered a mixture of new 8 1/4 per cent deferred interest bonds and cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares in exchange for their existing securities. If the restructuring is approved at an extraordinary meeting on June 14, Mr Sydney Robin will step down as chairman and chief executive, and be replaced by Mr Howard Dyer, a consultant to the group since September who has been responsible with Mr Kerslake for devising the proposals. Under these the group will be renamed Ascot Holdings and will focus on the leisure industry, initially on the group's existing English pub estate which will be streamlined. The estate currently comprises 588 tenanted pubs across the country. Under the plan a streamlined initial core of 150 English pubs would be kept. Presenting the proposals, Mr Kerslake emphasised that there were substantial risks inherent within the restructuring proposals, but the board believes they represent the only practicable means for the group to continue to trade.</p>

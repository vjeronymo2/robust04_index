			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek gave CTK on Tuesday [12 April]  a written statement denying that Havel had started to shun  interviews with news agencies.    The statement came in reaction to press commentaries  criticizing the Presidential Office's announcement that it would  not mediate Havel's interviews for news agencies. The statement  was reported on April 8 by REUTERS and CTK.    "There are no changes in dealing with requests for  interviews," Spacek wrote.    Turning to the REUTERS information that Havel would shun  interviews with news agencies because his office could not  control the published text, Spacek wrote: "In my personal  discussion with the REUTERS correspondent...I said that we  preferred papers to agencies, but no 'strict' ban was mentioned."    This is at variance not only with the REUTERS report, but  also with the written statement which Spacek gave CTK on March  25 after it requested an interview with Havel.    "On principle we provide interviews only to media about  which  we are sure when, where, and in what shape the interview will  appear. With agencies we do not have the opportunity to approve  the final shape of the information in which it reaches the  reader." Nevertheless, Spacek allowed for the question to be  left open.    On March 25 Spacek said that an interview given to an agency  involved "risks due to which we have not granted any interview  to any agency since the president assumed his post (in January  1993)."    But in his statement yesterday Spacek said that REUTERS had  been given answers to its questions three months ago.    Spacek also wrote yesterday that as Czech President Havel  had  granted a total of 149 interviews to the media from 21 countries.    He also wrote it was not true that Havel would not grant an  interview before the April 15-16 meeting of seven Central  European presidents in Litomysl, East Bohemia.    According to Spacek, Havel gave one interview yesterday, and  another will be granted today. But Havel's health condition and  busy schedule did not allow him to grant an interview to REUTERS  immediately after it was requested. Spacek did not mention  CTK's request for an interview.    The originally announced attitude of the Presidential Office  to agencies was criticized by the Czech independent daily MLADA  FRONTA DNES yesterday. It said that the statement that the  president would not grant interviews because the Presidential  Office could not control the published text created the  impression that the Castle (seat of the president) wanted to  assume the right to control the independent press. The paper  also wrote that "the decision seems to have come more from the  minds of the ruling Castle bureaucrats than from the  president's."</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: RESURRECTING MOZART'S MUSICAL SPIRIT  </P> <P> With the emphasis nowadays on period-performance Mozart or sleek,  small-orchestra Mozart on modern instruments, the sensibilities are easily  rattled by an encounter with the composer the way he used to sound.  </P> <P> An extreme example of Mozart past is found in a CD reissue of the "Jupiter"  Symphony recorded by Sir Thomas Beecham and his Royal Philharmonic shortly  before the venerated conductor's death in 1960 (EMI/Angel Studio 69811).  </P> <P> What once (we are told, and may even dimly recall) sounded bright, energetic  and stylish is bloated, coarse and ponderous today -- all the more so for  Beecham's insistence on improving Mozart's finale by inserting an alien  trombone part, an expanded timpani part and, ultimately, the most egregious  ritardando not of the composer's invention in the history of recorded music.  </P> <P> The companion piece, Beethoven's Second Symphony, responds well to the burly  energy of Beecham &amp; Co. and is presented in a form the composer might  readily have recognized.  </P> <P> Whereas Beecham is stingy with "Jupiter" repeats, Riccardo Muti, who leads the  Berlin Philharmonic (on EMI/Angel 47465), is generous indeed. Which is the  extent of his involvement with Classical style in this thickly textured,  spasmodic reading.  </P> <P> As fillup, Muti and the far too numerous BPO strings inflate the little  Divertimento in D, K. 136, with heavy attacks and gratuitous repeats.  </P> <P> The Symphony No. 29 in A, K. 201, with its airborne melodies and delicate  scoring, is an impressive vehicle for the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra under its  music director, the ubiquitous Iona Brown (Omega 1004).  </P> <P> Listeners familiar with Brown's work will find here the same expert string  balances and buoyancy that mark the playing of the Los Angeles Chamber  Orchestra. Brown's program is, however, unlikely to win awards for originality.  The prospect of yet another string divertimento (both K. 136 and K. 138 are  included) and "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" does not make the pulse race.  </P> <P> Period specialist John Eliot Gardiner and his English Baroque Soloists  orchestra have lately added to their substantial discography trim, peppery  traversals of the "Paris" Symphony, K. 297, with its two different minuets, and  the glorious C-major Symphony, K. 334, with the minuet (K. 409) presumed to  have been intended for what Mozart ultimately left a three-movement work  (Philips 420 937).  </P> <P> Gardiner and his orchestra also continue their now nearly complete recorded  series of the Mozart piano concertos with the ever insightful, erudite and,  most important, lively Malcolm Bilson at the keyboard.  </P> <P> The latest installment (Deutsche Grammophon Archiv 423 595) offers the intimate  Concerto in A, K. 488, and the grand, endlessly surprising Concerto in E-flat,  K. 482. In the latter, in spite of a performance that could hardly be bettered,  one begins to sense that the light-toned 18th-Century piano is losing its  struggle for primacy in the face of the composer's ever-increasing demands for  orchestral sonority.  </P> <P> The modern piano has no problems, of course, competing for sonic dominance with  a modern orchestra -- again, Brown and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra,  performing with silken polish. But Swiss pianist Brigitte Meyer proves a  dulcet-toned, miniaturizing cipher in K. 488 and in the deep, dark Concerto in  E-flat, K. 271 (Omega 1003).  </P> <P> There is no shortage of personality in Mozart's four Horn Concertos, with  additional fragments, as presented by Lowell Greer, principal hornist of the  Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, which joins him here under the jovially  energetic direction of Nicholas McGegan (Harmonia Mundi 907012).  </P> <P> Greer obtains a variety of tone and color from his valveless blunderbuss that  might be the envy of many performers on the modern French horn. One feels not  so much the arduousness of his task as his pleasure in conquering its  exigencies.  </P></p>

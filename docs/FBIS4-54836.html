			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- We are ready to  cooperate with the contact group and to negotiate on a political  solution, but we will not attend a new conference on Bosnia  unless the sanctions are lifted; that is, we cannot accept  negotiations under unequal conditions, Radovan Karadzic, the  president of the republic of Srpska, told TANJUG today after his  meeting with Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British  foreign office in Belgrade.    The international community must say clearly whether it  considers it more important to restore peace or to keep the  sanctions in place, Karadzic said. If it is more important to  the international community to keep the sanctions, then their  main aim is to exhaust the Serbs economically, militarily, and  politically, and not to restore peace.    The talks, which lasted about one and a half hours at the  British residence [in Belgrade], were also attended by republic  of Srpska vice president Nikola Koljevic, assembly chairman  Momcilo Krajisnik, and Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa  Buha. According to Karadzic, they discussed the possibilities  of reaching an agreement on a cessation of hostilities and an  overall political settlement, as well as on the current  situation in Gorazde and Brcko.    Karadzic said that the Serb side was ready to cooperate with  the contact group if the group was preparing a new conference on  Bosnia, adding that he would have a meeting with them tomorrow,  but he expressed doubt as to whether the group had enough  authority and could adopt a more flexible stance. Asked if  there was a fresh approach to the conference, Karadzic said that  the new joint standpoint of the international community was  still undefined. If one listens to Kinkel, one could see that  the international community, above all the European states, are  not united regarding the solution to the Yugoslav crisis,  Karadzic said.    The international community, as Karadzic said, has to  abandon  the concept of defining the territories by percentages.  Percentages are meaningless. We are prepared to give five  percent of the [Bosnian] territory for the urban core of  Sarajevo, which amounts to half a percent. That is why we  propose talks on the viability of two new states, Karadzic  pointed out.    He reiterated that the Serbs wanted their state and that in  the name of peace they were prepared to make such a territorial  deal that would ensure the viability, i.e. the economic and  military defensive capacity of their own [Bosnian Serb] state's  borders as well as the borders of the Muslim-Croat federation.  According to Karadzic, the issue that is unacceptable to the  Serb side is bringing the Serb corridor, i.e. Posavina [northern  Bosnia], into question.    Stressing that the corridor is a vital issue for the Serbs  because of the encirclement [Serbs in Krajina and Bosnia are  encircled by Muslims and Croats] and defense of the borders,  Karadzic reiterated: We will not accept any changes in Brcko's  status but we fully accept a cessation of all hostilities and we  have offered the Muslims a cease-fire in the Brcko area. If the  Muslims do not accept, the Serbs will proclaim a unilateral  cessation of hostilities and will not respond to the attacks  except in the case if they were really endangered. UN monitors  will be able to make their own judgements in such cases.    The talks with Hogg, as Karadzic said, clarified the Brcko  situation, while it had been agreed in yesterday's talks with UN  envoy Akashi that three to four observer teams be stationed on  the Serb side in the vicinity of that town in order to report  accurately to the international community on who was carrying  out offensive operations. Asked what the objective of the  attempts to adopt a new UN resolution on the creation of an  exclusion zone around Brcko precisely at a time when  preparations were under way for a new conference on Bosnia was,  Karadzic replied: All this is aimed at exerting pressure on the  Serbs.    If we correctly view the creation of an exclusion zone  around  Brcko, this would mean that the Muslims and Croats would have to  withdraw their heavy guns to a distance of 20 km from that town.  However, we have been in Brcko since the beginning of the war.  Life is going on normally there, schools are open, stores as  well, and the frontline is far away, Karadzic explained.    There is no need to create an exclusion zone around Brcko  because the Serbs are not asking for anyone's protection, he  added. But if someone believes that the proclamation of an  exclusion zone would imply that the Serbs would have to leave  Brcko, they should know that this will not happen and that we  will defend our right in the corridor at all costs, to the last  Serb in the republic of Srpska.    As far as Gorazde is concerned, Karadzic believes that the  crisis is over but that the only sensitive issue now is the  safety of Serbian civilians. This should be resolved through  the presence of the Serbian police, working in close  collaboration with and under the supervision of the United  Nations. There will be no other Serb forces in the agreed three  km radius, and this should also apply to the Muslims, the  republic of Srpska president emphasized.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Department of Health (DOH) reported yesterday  an outbreak of typhoid fever cases in Camarines Sur in the Bicol  region and a big drop in the number of measles cases in Region  12 (Central Mindanao).    In a report to Health Secretary Juan Flavier, the regional  field health office in Region 12 said last January 1994, there  were only three measles cases admitted to the Cotabato Regional  Hospital compared to the 49 cases in 1993 in the same month.  There was one measles case last February.    Flavier attributed the 95 percent decrease in the admission  of measles cases to the previous National Immunization Day (NID)  programs held nationwide.    The immunization coverage for measles in Region 12 -- Sultan  Kudarat, Lanao del Norte, and North Cotabato -- is 91 percent.    Also, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) told  Flavier the number of typhoid fever cases is rising in Sibobo,  Calabanga, and Camarines Sur.    A team sent to the province last 1 February told Flavier  that  there were 34 identified cases in the area. The victims, whose  ages range from 4 to 64, got sick after drinking contaminated  water from a shallow well.    Flavier said 90 percent of children aged 12 to 59 months in  the country got high-dose Vitamin A capsules during the  nutrition service of the DOH dubbed "Araw ng Sangkap Pinoy [Day  of Philippine Constituent]" last 16 October.    About 86 percent of pregnant women nationwide got iodized  oil  during the same health program.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Books: The perils of stardom laid bare - Anthony Curtis follows Judy Garland down that yellow brick road to the end of the rainbow JUDY GARLAND by David Shipman Fourth Estate Pounds 17.99, 522 pages ELDERLY Judy Garland fans - there still are quite a few of us around - find their addiction excellently served by television. Her films frequently come up at times like nine in the morning and two in the afternoon. Now that I have learnt how to work our video, I tend to view them later in the evening and they usually prove highly rewarding nostalgia. There is also - to coincide with this massively comprehensive biography, Judy Garland by David Shipman - a Judy season at the National Film Theatre lasting into October. Seeing the films again, and then reading about the tantrums that surrounded the making of them, offers a remarkable double-take. The peerless professionalism of what is captured on screen (certainly in the ones for MGM) seems to belie the image evoked by Shipman of a performer invariably late if she turned up at all, terrified of the cameras before they started rolling, capable of vicious verbal sniping at some of her closest colleagues and best friends, and so chock-full of alcohol, barbiturates and other assorted drugs that frequently shooting would cease while she was rushed off to a nearby clinic to be nursed back into workable shape. It is a frightening story, every bit as harrowing as the parallel one of Marilyn Monroe. These two feminine movie-idols rarely met but closely identified with each other. After Monroe's death Garland remembered Monroe at a Hollywood party, following her from room to room, saying: 'I don't want to get too far away from you. I'm scared.' Garland replied: 'We're all scared. I'm scared too'. By the time of Summer Stock (1950), the film Garland made towards the end of her contract with MGM, with Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers in his pre-Bilko days, she had a serious weight problem. The movie tried, with its perfunctory plot about some actors putting on a musical in a barn, to revive the girlish ingenue figure she had radiated in those early Andy Hardy family movies when she was competing with the more sophisticated young women surrounding Mickey Rooney, and also to recall her first great success as the rainbow-orientated Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. And it all works light-heartedly well, with Judy's 'Get Happy' sequence, the song composed earlier by Harold Arlen, the high-spot of the picture. Yet that had to be shot - after Garland had come out of hypnosis - three months after the rest of the film. 'Her breath,' Shipman says, 'reeked of paraldehyde'. The main shooting, according to Charles Walters, who directed it, was a nightmare: 'God, she was a problem . . . She'd come storming in and say 'Look, buddy, if you expect any acting out of me, forget it]''. But her magic, when finally caught on screen, was such that her private excesses were always forgiven; until the final straw, which came through her vacillations over the movie of Annie Get Your Gun, and then walking out of Royal Wedding in which she was to have performed with Fred Astaire. Her behaviour then broke the studio's corporate back and she was finally out. Garland made more movies after the firing, including the memorable A Star is Born (which lost money first time around) for Warner Brothers, but they were largely mediocre. Her main post-MGM career consisted of a series of triumphant personal appearances, singing her heart out, live, over a range of numbers with amazing variety of attack, in venues like Carnegie Hall, the Hollywood Bowl and the London Palladium. The latter was her favourite stage: she was always acclaimed by her loyal British following, the audience's tears flowing as copiously as hers. But just as she had become camera-shy in the studios, now she suffered from stage-fright, and became increasingly unreliable as a live entertainer. At first the precariousnesses of her performances became a negative asset, audiences willing her to continue and cheering her at the end if she succeeded in somehow getting through the show. But as she became more and more incapable of delivering the goods, this asset soon dwindled to nothing. Her weekly television show for CBS was a disaster. Yet, great trouper that she was, her ability to bounce back, after spells in hospital, continued almost until the end, with her undertaking taxing tours of Europe and Australia when she was practically in a wheel-chair. She died in 1969 aged 47 and Dollars 4m dollars in debt. The book is full of legendary names, all of whom at one time or another were Garland's friends. Humphrey Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall summed her up in these terms: 'She was a complicated woman of tremendous wit and intelligence who had survived a distorted childhood and distorted marriages which left their mark . . . It was hard for her to think beyond herself - it had been that way too long'. Shipman is an omniscient movie-historian and has researched the book impeccably. He traces Garland's origins and her career as a child-performer. She was born Virginia Gumm and before she was 10 she was out there as Baby Gumm doing a song-and-dance act with her two older sisters. Their father Frank was a local theatre manager who moved to the Los Angeles area. He was secretly gay, like several of the men Garland would either have affairs with, or would indeed marry, including her second husband, Vincente Minnelli, the director of her smash-hit movie, Meet Me in Saint Louis. Her most sustained marriage was her third, to Sidney Luft, Jewish and decidedly straight, a rough, tough fixer and gambler who managed her affairs in the post-MGM period, and by whom she had a daughter and a son. Garland re-enacted her stormy relations with her formidable mother Ethel in her role as mother to her own children, especially with her older daughter Liza, the one by Minnelli. That relationship was one from which Garland drew great strength both on stage and off; but it was also one from which she felt a constant threat of being superseded. No family has room for more than one mega-star. The Liza-Judy conflict is only discreetly touched upon here. It will, I would hazard, one day be the basis of a major Hollywood film. Nothing was ever straightforward in Garland's life. Here it is in full, in a dispassionate book that gives a shattering insight into the perils of stardom.</p>

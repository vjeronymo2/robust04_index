			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Private View: Liberator of the inner voice THE HUMAN voice is like a musical instrument which gives colour and sense to words - when it is played well. Yet most of us in the developed world, it seems, have forgotten how to play. We spend a lot of time and money on our physical appearance: on our faces, hair, our figures, clothing and deportment. This, we proclaim, is the sort of person I am. Then we open our mouths and convey . . . nothing. Why? Because the human voice is not only a speaking machine; it is also a weapon of defence and of attack. Fear of ridicule and desire for respect lead to muscular tension, poor breathing, strange postures and an unnatural voice that betrays our real intent. That, at least, is what Patsy Rodenburg says. She has some claim to speak. She is head of voice training at the National Theatre and the Guildhall School in London and gets rave reviews from actors and directors. She has worked worldwide, studying not only actors but businessmen, barristers, prisoners, politicians and chimpanzees (for the film Greystoke.). I felt she was studying me. So I asked her, in a voice which sounded suddenly not quite my own, how she could tell when a person was speaking badly. 'You find yourself listening to the voice instead of listening to what they say. Or they will complain of losing their voice, or that the voice is not reflecting their thoughts and feelings.' Rodenburg is the sort of person who gets no peace at parties. People confess that they are ashamed of their voices, that they feel boring, cannot command attention, are scared to speak in public, cannot express themselves. They gravitate to her as if she were a psychiatrist - which, in a sense, she is. 'I can't deal with the psychological things,' she said. 'But I can deal with the physical things which will often affect the psychology. The terrible thing is that when you talk about somebody's voice, you're talking about their whole being. The voice is actually the tip of the whole of you. That's why, when people mimic you, even if it's kindly, it's painful.' As small children, she said, we have naturally good posture, breathe easily and speak out. But we soon develop bad habits. Boys learn macho postures, girls begin to sag. 'Some women remember how they started to collapse through the spine, crossing their arms to hide their breasts, for example.' We develop vocal mannerisms. Little girls put on nice voices to wheedle daddy; boys, seemingly under greater pressure to be clear and adult, may begin to stammer. Four out of five stammerers are boys, according to US research. Patsy Rodenburg herself had a slight speech impediment as a child. 'The muscles of speech are very complex and they have to be flexible, to sort of dance. I don't think I spoke much and then when I did, I just couldn't get the words out. So I was sent to an elocution teacher. I'm glad I did it, but I hated it. 'But at least it's given me a perspective on how I don't want to teach. You see, I believe we all have language within us. But whether we feel we have the right to use it is another issue.' Illiterate people were often extremely good speakers. A speech therapist at Broadmoor, the asylum for the criminally insane, told her that when murderers unburden themselves they speak with astonishing eloquence. 'He said they speak poetry.' At the other extreme there is the 'professional' voice. The hospital consultant, the clergyman, the air hostess, the hotel receptionist, the salesman: they all have one. It is a defence mechanism, Rodenburg explained. 'It's a voice that says 'I'm caring about you but I'm not caring absolutely about you. Don't get too close.' I think journalists often do that voice.' Do they? I replied, quickly dropping into a lower register. Then there is the barking voice of the senior manager who talks at, not to, his juniors and is hurt by accusations that he never listens. 'I call it the vocal push. Although we can hear everything that's said, we don't listen because we're being battered over the head by the voice. People not used to speaking in big spaces will automatically push, rather than just breathing and focusing and waiting for the words.' With a British general election looming, I asked if she could detect liars by their voice. 'Yes. Maybe the pitch will go up a bit and the breath will change. Something will change in the voice.' Can you tell from a politician's voice whether you would vote for him? 'I think so, yes. I just want to say to some politicians, if you learned to relax and open your voice we would listen more to what you are saying.' What advice would you give John Major? 'Well, he has to free up his voice because it drones on. He's very tight in the neck and the face. It's like a mask on him. The area round the cheeks is very important because it opens the upper harmonics. Even if he is wanting to sound interesting he can't. I wonder whether he has changed his accent and doesn't feel happy with it.' And Neil Kinnock? 'He's a good speaker, except he gets very tight. You can see him go very red in the face and the veins start coming out on his neck. I don't think he really breathes much so he sort of gets clamped around the throat. If you're speaking three or four times every day, that's quite athletic. You're doing the equivalent of an actor playing Lear.' What about Paddy Ashdown? She laughed and looked coy. 'Well, I think he's very good. Actually I taught him a bit. All I did was just loosen him a bit around the shoulders and the neck and into the face. On camera his face was closing, crinkling up.' Britain's best-known elocution student is, of course, Margaret Thatcher. Rodenburg said the result was pretty bad. The former prime minister had pushed her voice down to make it sound better and 'de-voiced' it to make it sound sympathetic. She had also mastered the unhealthy trick of breathing against the flow of her words in order not to be interrupted. Women develop different habits to men, Rodenburg said. 'It comes from years of feeling that you can't say what you want. When it does come out it will often come out in a very shrill or emotional way.' She cited the problems of women in India who teach large classes of children when at home they speak hardly at all, and the ease with which Portuguese women wail all day over a corpse. 'On the other hand, since women's liberation, women are taking on a lot of male qualities. In fact I think they've probably gone too far in pushing down on their voices. A lot of women today are not listening, they're just driving through. 'Men have historically been much freer to breathe in and speak out. They're much more 'on' their voices. They finish thoughts, they finish words. But recently I've noticed men adopting some of the female habits of devoicing and hesitating and being emotional. A lot of my women friends complain that their men are crying a lot.' I asked her about voice and class. 'The voice matters most to the middle classes, because they make the rules. There are upper class voices that are completely incoherent, but we don't interfere with them. When people have power you are forced to listen.' Does the Royal Family have a problem? 'Yes, they do. They hold their voices back.' She demonstrated. Self-confidence can liberate the voice, as well. 'You hear posh-sounding people in Mayfair restaurants; their voices are carrying not because they are actually louder but because they are just letting them out. What they say might be complete rubbish but they really believe they're interesting.' Rodenburg thinks it can be harmful for people permanently to change their accents, even if a few need to acquire 'received pronunciation' to go into the theatre. Would the country be a better place if everyone found their own voice? 'Yes. We would be freer, we would be breathing better, we wouldn't have so many headaches. More important, most psychologists would agree that if we can speak about ourselves we have a better control of our world.' Would the crime rate go down? 'I would argue so, yes. People will kick things and smash things because they can't make sounds or use words to explore what they are feeling. I mean, we are in such a state that people with money will spend it going to a therapist merely to talk about themselves.' When you talk about people finding their voices, do you mean that in a political sense as well as a physical one? 'Yes, I do. But on a very simple level. If you use your voice correctly and naturally, you never feel it. It's effortless. And if you start speaking with that energy people will listen to you, so you start to have power. 'There is no such thing as a naturally bad voice, only bad habits. I believe that underneath we are all very eloquent.'</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL FIRM'S CASH CRUNCH HURTS SOME TOURISTS' TRIPS  </P> <P> Financial problems at an Encino travel company left at least 70 Americans to  fend for themselves in the Orient after hotels and other tour businesses  refused to honor their prepayment vouchers, a company official said Monday.  </P> <P> Tourists arranged their luxury tours through Hemphill Harris Travel Corp. But  because of Hemphill's problems, hotels in Hong Kong, Bali and other Oriental  sites refused to accept vouchers from Hemphill, said Michael Jay, a vice  president of marketing for Westar Acquisitions Corp., Hemphill's parent  company.  </P> <P> The tourists were forced to put up money out of their own pockets to return  home, continue their trips at their own expense or seek the help of another  travel company, he said.  </P> <P> "My understanding is that nobody was stranded and left any place, that  everybody is home or on their way home," Jay said.  </P> <P> Jay said he thought that the only tourists affected were those on trips to the  Orient.  </P> <P> However, another tour operator, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, said it was asked by  travel agents to help an eight-member American tour in Australia that had  booked their trip through Hemphill.  </P> <P> Hemphill has been struggling since the summer, when its business suffered a  severe blow due to the civil strife in China in early June, Jay said.  </P> <P> "We had to refund massive amounts of money to customers because we could no  longer conduct those tours in China," he said. Since then, "we've had a severe  cash shortage" and the company fell behind on some payments to hotel operators,  Jay said.  </P></p>

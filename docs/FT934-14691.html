			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / People: Eric Anstee puts his energies into Eastern Electricity Eastern Electricity has tempted Eric Anstee away from his senior partnership at Ernst &amp; Young management consultants; he is joining the privatised utility as its group finance director. Anstee, 42, is no stranger to the energy sector. His experience includes a stint at the Treasury, between 1983-86; he was seconded there as a commercial accounting adviser, in particular working on the privatisation of British Gas. In 1990 he was an adviser to two of the 12 regional electricity companies - not Eastern Electricity, however - in the run-up to their privatisations. But Anstee does have previous connections with Eastern, having led a team of Ernst &amp; Young people providing statistical support to the company some 18 months ago, in the middle of a government regulatory review of the industry's supply and price mechanism. His other posts with Ernst &amp; Young included three years in Singapore as a senior manager where he was involved with commodity trading. Anstee has been with Ernst &amp; Young for 19 years and a partner since 1984. He takes over at Eastern from Richard Leveritt, who is retiring after 23 years with the company. Leveritt will stay on the board until December 31; Anstee is working for Eastern on a part-time basis until he takes over full-time on January 1. Meanwhile, at Ernst &amp; Young, Keith Stein, 47, is stepping into Anstee's shoes as the partner in charge of the privatisation, energy and utilities group within its management consultancy practice. Stein (far right) has been with the firm since 1977, when he joined its financial management wing. More recently, he has led several of the firm's international privatisation projects in eastern Europe, including the voucher privatisation schemes in the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Romania. One of the newest privatisation projects Stein will now be overseeing is an agreement signed between Ernst &amp; Young and the Egyptian government just two weeks ago.</p>

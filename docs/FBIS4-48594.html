			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Estelle Randall and Farouk Chothia] </F>   [Text] Former state president F W de Klerk ceded control of  a third of the land in KwaZulu/Natal to Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini in a highly secretive deal the day before he was  voted out of office last month. The transfer of three million  hectares scattered throughout the province was effected in terms  of the KwaZulu Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act, passed by the  KwaZulu Legislative Assembly and assented to by De Klerk on  April 25 this year.    In terms of the legislation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, the  sole trustee, will administer all tribal land in the province --  with the cost of administration being borne by the new regional  government. It covers all the land for which the KwaZulu  Legislative Assembly was established in 1971 and land acquired  by the KwaZulu government under various proclamations and laws  since then.    It appears that under pressure from the KwaZulu government,  De Klerk moved to prevent KwaZulu-administered tribal land from  falling under state control -- the automatic effect of the new  constitution, which kicked in on April 27 -- in an apparent sop  to the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in exchange for its  participation in the April poll.    A source close to Andre Fourie, the former minister of  regional and land affairs, said the land transfer had been part  of negotiations between the National Party government, the ANC  and the IFP.    But ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa, who played a key  role in the negotiations leading to the IFP's participation in  the elections, denied this: "The Ingonyama Trust doesn't mean a  thing to me; I'm hearing about it for the first time. I doubt  very much that Nelson Mandela would have known about it. You  are drawing a blank from me."    President Nelson Mandela's office was yesterday unable to  comment, as was the office of Zwelithini.    ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal also appeared dumbfounded when  approached this week. Regional supremo Jacob Zuma said he knew  nothing of the transfer, and knew of no one else in the ANC who  was aware of it. "It is surprising that this happened just  before the election."    And in a furious reaction, ANC Midlands spokesman Blade  Nzimane said: "The fact that this was done behind the backs of  people and through an illegitimate bantustan structure seems to  indicate that it was aimed at undermining any constitutional  accommodation of the king by the ANC.    "It seems to have been aimed at ensuring that KwaZulu  retained actual control of the land even if it was disbanded."    Also unaware of the transfer was Roelf Meyer, the NP's  [National Party] central constitutional negotiator; Conie de  Villiers, director-general of land affairs -- who said "nobody  consulted me about this Act" -- and the new Minister of Land  Affairs, Derek Hanekom, who said he was "shocked" by the move.    "Effectively the land that was KwaZulu is no longer state  land," Hanekom said. "It's in private ownership, held in trust  by the king." He added: "My ministry will be raising the issue  politically and will be carrying out a full investigation to  find out on whose ultimate authority the transfer was affected.    "We have consistently tried to get a moratorium on the  transfer and sale of state land, but we never thought bantustan  land would be transferred.    "There are potentially grave political implications and  we're  deeply concerned." He hinted that the National Assembly might  overturn the legislation.    Some IFP sources described the formation of the Ingonyama  Trust as a "house-keeping arrangement" between Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and De Klerk's governments before their demise -- and  an attempt to protect the monarch from possible ANC rule in  KwaZulu/Natal.    "The chances of the land ever being alienated (from the  king)  are now remote in the extreme," said an IFP source.    Zuma insisted the formation of the Ingonyama Trust was not  part of the agreement that brought the IFP into elections. "We  made an elaborate proposal for the monarchy so far as  KwaZulu/Natal is concerned which we still have to iron out in  the provincial constitution."    Observers believe the legislation has far-reaching  implications: it means that future governments in the province  will have to gain Zwelithini's permission -- or the permission  of his chiefs or any other representative he charges with  decision-making responsibility over the trust land -- before  engaging in any development on the land in question. It means  that land earmarked for redistribution in terms of the ANC's  land reform plans is no longer available to the central state.    Barely 300,000ha [hectares] of state land is now available  for redistribution.    The formation of the trust also consolidates the  relationship  between Zwelithini and chiefs, as they will now be reliant on  him for development in their areas -- and will reduce the  prospect of an ANC-led government in KwaZulu/Natal winning major  support among IFP- aligned traditional rulers.    Lawyers contacted yesterday stressed the land deal had not  gone before the Transitional Executive Council which had  overthrown other land decisions. They also said that a  challenge to the land transfer could be mounted. In terms of  court precedents, changes to the ownership status of state land  could not be made without consultation with the effected parties.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DUKE TRIES TO REACH THE TOP THIS TIME  </P> <P> When players on the Duke University basketball team talk about the school's  success in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament during the  past five years, they don't speak in terms of a dynasty.  </P> <P> "A legacy," senior forward Robert Brickey called it last week.  </P> <P> The legacy continues this week at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, where the  Blue Devils will play in their third straight Final Four and their fourth in  the past five years.  </P> <P> Duke, the first school since Houston to reach the NCAA tournament semifinals  three years in a row, will meet Arkansas on Saturday. Georgia Tech plays  Nevada-Las Vegas in the second semifinal.  </P> <P> But this legacy is filled not only with remarkable achievements, but also with  lingering frustrations. Duke has not won the national championship.  </P> <P> Asked Monday what he remembers most about the previous two trips, senior  forward Alaa Abdelnaby put it succinctly. "Losing," he said.  </P> <P> Though Abdelnaby will be trying to erase the memories from Kansas City, Mo.,  and Seattle, and Duke fans also will be trying to forget Dallas in 1986, Blue  Devils Coach Mike Krzyzewski says that this team should be judged on its merit.  </P> <P> "For me, each team is different," Krzyzewski said Saturday, after the Blue  Devils had beaten Connecticut, 79-78, in the NCAA East Regional in East  Rutherford, N.J. "I just want to make sure we make the most of our opportunity,  win or lose."  </P> <P> This Duke team is quite different from the past three that have made the Final  Four. In many ways, it is perhaps the biggest surprise of any of Krzyzewski's  recent teams to have gone this far.  </P> <P> "When you look at the Duke teams that have made it to the Final Four, this one  has to stand out as the least likely," said Tommy Amaker, point guard on the  1986 and 1987 Final Four teams and now an assistant coach. "It's had a lot of  ups and downs. At times, it hasn't had the most confidence."  </P> <P> This is a team that has had more distractions and controversy, on the court and  off, than most in recent Duke history. "It's been a crazy year," Abdelnaby  said.  </P> <P> There was a midseason knee injury to Brickey, a nationally publicized X-rated  tirade by Krzyzewski directed at members of the school newspaper and  Henderson's blowup at his teammates after Duke lost to Georgia Tech in the  semifinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.  </P> <P> Henderson used a few expletives to describe what he perceived as a  Devils-might-not-care attitude of his teammates during their late-season fold.  </P> <P> Asked last week about the incident, Henderson said: "What I said after Georgia  Tech is something I've said to my teammates during the season. It's something  that we have discussed. I'll never open up to the press like that again."  </P> <P> But Henderson's message apparently woke up some of his teammates. Abdelnaby  became a dominant force inside during the first four games of the NCAA  tournament. Freshman point guard Bobby Hurley played more under control. And  the whole team seemed more focused.  </P> <P> "I think we played with more emotion," said Brickey, who pulled his left  hamstring in the victory over the University of Connecticut. "I think we're  playing as well going into the Final Four as we ever have."  </P> <P> For his part, Krzyzewski refuses to liken this Duke team to those of the recent  past. If anything, the only constant has been Krzyzewski.  </P> <P> "It's not fair to these kids," Krzyzewski said. "You don't have the same team,  the same personalities. It's not like a pro team that goes to the Super Bowl  three years in a row."  </P> <P> Said Amaker: "The only similarity is that this team is also in the Final Four,  but that's the most important similarity to have. It's like going to school  after an older brother or sister. If they've done well, the teachers say, 'Why  can't you do as well?' But this team has a chance to do something that no other  Duke team has done."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the comparisons will be made. And the questions will be asked,  most specifically: Is making the Final Four good enough? And, if not, when does  catching the bouquet become tiresome?  </P> <P> Krzyzewski will prepare his team not only for the Razorbacks but also for the  media onslaught. He knows that this team will be reminded of the Final Four  disappointments.  </P> <P> "That's my job, to make sure they're not thinking about those teams before they  go out to Denver," Krzyzewski said. "Why should Bobby Hurley feel that  pressure? Why should Phil Henderson feel it? If Phil and Alaa were as good last  year as they are now, we would have won it."  </P> <P> "That's like asking someone who's made a million dollars, why haven't you made  $2 million?" asked Henderson, one of three starters on this year's team to have  played in two Final Fours. "It's a big achievement, and nobody should take that  away from us."  </P> <P> Said Brickey: "There's no pressure on us to win this time. We have a goal in  mind. We have our eye on the prize. But, as a senior, I think anything less  (than a national championship) would give me a shallow feeling."  </P> <P> And what if the Blue Devils were to win? What if Duke erased its past  disappointments and found itself cutting down the nets at McNichols Arena come  Monday night? Krzyzewski knows that somebody wouldn't be satisfied completely.  </P> <P> "I'm sure if we win it, I'm going to be asked, 'When are you going to win it  again?"' he said.  </P> <P> That is probably a question Duke won't mind answering.  </P></p>

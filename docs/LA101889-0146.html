			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERNATIONAL KIDNAPING TRIAL OF COVINA MAN  OPENS  </P> <P> A well-to-do Covina chiropractor was described by a prosecutor at his  international kidnaping trial as a man with a violent temper who threatened to  kill a former girlfriend and her daughter to recover more than $100,000 in  money and property he said he was owed.  </P> <P> Rolando Peralta, 51, is on trial in Los Angeles federal court, accused of  masterminding the kidnaping for ransom last June of a dental student in Mexico  City in order to force her mother, Indiana Robleto, to pay Peralta the money he  said he was owed.  </P> <P> Peralta, his secretary, Socorro Contreras, and her boyfriend, Rigoberto  Herrera, are charged with international hostage taking, conspiracy and  extortion in the abduction of Maria Robleto, 22, who was released after a  $40,000 ransom was paid. Robleto, a Maywood dentist, paid the ransom but it was  unclear where the funds came from.  </P> <P> Although the abduction occurred in Mexico, the case is being tried in federal  court here because U.S. laws take precedence and because Peralta was arrested  here.  </P> <P> In opening statements to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam said  Peralta was a "vile-tempered" man who threatened to kill Indiana Robleto in  telephone conversations with her that were secretly recorded by the FBI.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Anthony Brooklier told jurors that Peralta was "set up" by  Robleto because she hated him because of their failed love affair. He also  argued that the abduction never took place, contending that Maria Robleto  cooperated with her alleged kidnapers.  </P></p>

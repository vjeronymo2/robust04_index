			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Competition cases jam eases THE European Commission managed to cut its backlog of competition cases by nearly a third last year. The Brussels authorities have been heavily criticised by lawyers and companies for the time it takes to examine routine deals under EC treaty rules which outlaw cartels and abuses of a dominant position. The Commission's annual report on competition reveals that 1,562 such cases were still being examined on December 31 1992, compared with 2,287 a year earlier. Some 399 new cases were taken on during the year, compared with 388 in 1991. Since 1988, there has been a 55 per cent reduction in the backlog, as the Commission has tried to accelerate internal procedures. Brussels already applies strict deadlines to merger cases, but the competition directorate says it is not yet possible to introduce internally binding deadlines for the bulk of general cases.</p>

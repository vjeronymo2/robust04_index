			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The delegations of the Slovene and Croatian  parliamentary commissions for international affairs met in  Ljubljana this morning. The Croatian delegation was led by Dr.  Zarko Domljan and the Slovene by Zoran Thaler. Nadja Pengov  reports:    [Begin Pengov recording] The topics of today's talks, which  were assessed as good, covered more or less three issues: The  position of both countries in Europe, mutual relations, and  dangerous signals that have recently been coming from Italy.  Regarding the first, both states share similar goals, they are  merely in different positions, the position of Slovenia being  better today due to objective circumstances.    What about mutual relations? We did not hide the fact that  some problems exist, it was stated, however, these are not such  as to damage the otherwise good relations between the countries.  The delegations concluded that the work of the commissions for  borders and the agreement on border cooperation should be  accelerated. The Slovene side particularly singled out problems  connected to property. This agreement is already prepared,  however, Croatia is making it conditional on the resolution of  issues concerning the nuclear power plant and the debts of  Ljubljanska Banka.    During the talks they also touched on the speculation that  Dr. Zarko Domljan was negotiating a  Slovene-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina federation with an  unidentified Slovene politician. It was established that this  was a hoax. Dr. Domljan explained his vision about future  relations between the countries by saying that Slovenia is a  priority for Croatia, that the countries must link up solely on  the basis of interests, into a sort of a customs, monetary, or  some other type of union. [passage omitted]    Relations with Italy. The degree of consensus between  Slovenia and Croatia is most important here. There will be no  alteration of borders and this is out of the question. The  agreements must be observed. There will be no new negotiations  about the prevailing agreements.    The question of compensation for the former property of  exiles [optanti] has been solved and the countries will not  negotiate this here either. The governments of both countries  should agree as soon as possible on the amount of compensation  that Slovenia and Croatia should pay. Once this is done, they  will, because of Italy's [word indistinct] which does not  provide an account number to which the debt could be paid, do  this themselves and inform the Italian side where its money is.  Dr. Zarko Domljan here stressed the importance of Slovenia and  Croatia having a joint action strategy on these issues. [end  recording]</p>

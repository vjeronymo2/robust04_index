			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Matsushita to head Japan's central bank: Sakura Bank adviser nominated after long wrangle inside government The Japanese government last night nominated as the next governor of the Bank of Japan Mr Yasuo Matsushita, a former career bureaucrat who is now an adviser to Sakura Bank, one of the country's largest commercial banks. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, told a midnight press conference that Mr Matsushita would replace Mr Yasushi Mieno when the five-year term of the current central bank chief expires next month. The appointment comes at the end of an unusually long wrangle within the government over the choice of governor. Mr Matsushita, himself a vice finance minister in the mid-1980s, was thought to have been the favoured choice of finance ministry officials. But Mr Takemura, in a display of independence, had expressed doubts about the appointment and insisted on considering other candidates. His announcement, which is subject to formal cabinet ratification, means the ministry's views have prevailed. Mr Takemura was quoted as saying that Mr Mieno 'strongly recommended' Mr Matsushita, who was chosen because of his international experience and outstanding career in finance. Mr Matsushita joined the ministry of finance in 1950 after graduating in law from Tokyo University. He rose through the ranks and ascended to the top job, vice minister for finance, in 1982, but subsequently left the government for the private sector. He is not expected to depart significantly from the policies of Mr Mieno, who has presided over one of the most turbulent periods in Japanese financial history. On taking office in 1989 the governor raised interest rates in order to burst the speculative bubble of asset price inflation of the late 1980s. When that policy led to the country's deepest recession since the second world war, Mr Mieno cut rates sharply. They now stand at their lowest level ever in nominal terms, though with inflation now negative, monetary policy is still regarded by many economists as tight. The governorship is normally alternated between Bank of Japan and finance ministry officials. Mr Mieno was a lifelong central banker, and so Mr Matsushita's appointment would continue the pattern. An indication that he was on the point of securing the job came earlier yesterday when Mr Matsushita, who had been the favourite, resigned from the vice-chairmanship of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. He had served one three-year term there and had been expected to serve a second, but such an appointment would be incompatible with his new role. Mr Matsushita is due to take over on December 17. The senior deputy governor will be Mr Toshihiko Fukui, currently a Bank of Japan executive director responsible for monetary policy. Observer, Page 17</p>

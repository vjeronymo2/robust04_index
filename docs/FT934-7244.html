			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cost of job cuts forces NTT to slash profits forecast NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, the world's second largest telecommunications company, yesterday warned that its full-year profits would be more than halved because of Japan's recession and the costs of workforce cuts. The company estimated that pre-tax profits would fall to Y106bn (Dollars 991m) for the year to next March - Y43bn lower than its original forecast - from Y247.2bn in 1992. On top of this, NTT will make a Y19bn extraordinary charge for the costs of voluntary redundancies, as part of the 30,000 job reductions it is seeking over the next 10 years. This will bring pre-tax profits after extraordinary charges down to an estimated Y87bn for the full year, said NTT. NTT yesterday posted a pre-tax profit of Y103.94bn in the first half-year to September, down 1.8 per cent on the same period of the previous year, on operating revenues of Y2,911bn. Net profits fell 10 per cent, from Y45.59bn to Y40.94bn. The continuing slide in income from dial calls, sluggish sales of new telephone lines and the impact of the reduction in telephone charges made in June 1992, produced a 1.7 per cent decline in operating revenue in the first half. Competition to attract new customers is intensifying, said NTT. It added that 'the Japanese economy as a whole has faced severe difficulties in the first half of fiscal 1993, due to prolonged economic sluggishness brought on by stagnant private consumption and lowered corporate capital investment'. Another factor was the revenue lost following the spin-off of NTT's mobile telephone division in July 1992. Adjusting for this, underlying group operating revenues rose fractionally, by 0.7 per cent by comparison with the first half of 1992. However, the spin-off, plus a reduction in the workforce, helped to reduce operating expenses by 1.3 per cent to Y2,746bn. The group said it would make 'significant efforts' to protect market share and it would push ahead with streamlining plans.</p>

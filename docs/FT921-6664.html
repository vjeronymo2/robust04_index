			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Review of Berlitz could lead to sale BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), said it has hired the Wall Street stockbroking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ) to conduct a strategic review that could lead to the sale or recapitalisation of the company. Berlitz said DLJ would consider alternatives, including the sale of all or part of the company. Another option would be the continued New York Stock Exchange listing of Berlitz as an independent company. Mr Joe Rodgers, Berlitz chairman, said the company's committee of independent directors had decided to expand DLJ's role from a more narrow previous assignment. Any recommendations from DLJ will nonetheless be difficult to implement in the near-term. MCC, which nominally owns 56.5 per cent of Berlitz shares, is itself operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law in a complex arrangement that requires co-ordination between New York and UK court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell empire. At present, most of MCC's 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake is actually in the hands of five US and European banks and companies that received the stock as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. The pledging of the Berlitz shares was discovered last year after MCC had announced the sale for Dollars 265m of 56.5 per cent of Berlitz to Fukutake, the Japanese publisher. Earlier this month, Berlitz adopted a 'poison pill' scheme designed to deter an unwanted change in the control of the company. Macmillan has meanwhile brought injunctions against the banks that received Berlitz shares from Mr Maxwell to prevent them from selling the stock.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Cardiff pins its hopes on the waterfront: A Pounds 152m barrage project that is hoped will create 23,000 Welsh jobs PRELIMINARY WORK will start today on the Pounds 152m project to build a  3/4  mile (1.1km) barrage across Cardiff Bay as a crucial part of the regeneration of the city's waterfront. Parliamentary approval for the barrage bill was completed on Wednesday evening after more than six years of argument and delay. Royal assent is expected today. The barrage, at the mouths of the rivers Taff and Ely, will create a permanent freshwater lake of 500 acres designed to improve the appearance of the bay, which becomes mudflats at low tide. Opposition has come from Friends of the Earth and other environmentalists who fear the loss of the area's distinctive birdlife and believe that houses could be damaged by rising groundwater. The scheme is the flagship project of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, which was set up in 1987 to regenerate 2,700 acres of derelict docklands. The barrage is expected to take four years to build. Seven contractors have been invited to tender for the main contract, which is likely to be awarded within the next six weeks with construction to start next February. Bechtel is acting as project manager. The corporation hopes the barrage will act as a catalyst for business and leisure development along an eight-mile waterfront. So far, work has concentrated on improving the infrastructure. The main office relocations to Cardiff Bay have been by the Dutch group NCM Credit Insurance, which is building a new UK headquarters, and Welsh Health Common Services Authorities. Plans include a home for the Welsh National Opera, a quality hotel, a science discovery centre, shops, restaurants and other attractions aimed at bringing 2m visitors annually to Cardiff Bay by the year 2000. Sir Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the corporation, said: 'With a water arena the size of the City of London, Cardiff Bay will capture the imagination of the world.' Mr Gwilym Jones, Welsh Office minister, said: 'The barrage forms the centrepiece of a regeneration strategy which offers the prospect of more than 23,000 jobs, 4,400 homes and Pounds 1.2bn of private sector investment. Its construction will give our capital a unique international identity.' The barrage bill was introduced by the government after the blocking of a private bill in 1991. Opponents held up its progress and won a number of environmental concessions, and the bill's approval was further delayed this year because of lack of parliamentary time. The bill now includes an enhanced scheme for protection from groundwater damage and safeguards agreed with the National Rivers Authority concerning flooding, water quality and fish protection. Up to Pounds 5.7m will be spent to create a bird reserve to compensate for the loss of feeding grounds. The barrage has five sluice gates and a fish pass to allow salmon to return to the rivers. Mr Alun Michael, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, which includes the bay, said that in spite of the parliamentary divisions the barrage had overwhelming support across the political spectrum. 'It was a Labour-controlled county council which set the ball rolling, and trade unionists and employers throughout south Wales recognise its vital importance to our region.'</p>

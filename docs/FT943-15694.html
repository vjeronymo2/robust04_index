			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / G7 cautious as US pushes for still freer trade The US yesterday ran into opposition from its chief trading partners about suggestions that they should launch a multilateral trade liberalisation effort at this year's world economic summit in Naples. Clinton administration officials have put forward vague proposals that the Group of Seven countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, together with the European Commission - should take the initiative to liberalise trade further, especially in the telecommunications sector. The idea from the US, which emphasised that the summit's agenda was still up for negotiation, is that the G7 should build upon the successful Uruguay Round negotiations completed earlier this year. However, Mr Terusuke Terada, Japan's foreign ministry spokesman, yesterday said that Japan believed priority should be given to ratifying the Uruguay Round to ensure it takes effect as planned at the start of 1995. That point was echoed by senior officials from the European Commission in Brussels. As final preparations were under way for the economic summit which begins this evening, Japan appeared to water down earlier suggestion from Mr Tomiichi Murayama, its recently appointed socialist prime minister, that the meeting should discuss the weakness of the dollar. Mr Terada said the summit was not really the place to discuss such a delicate question as currency fluctuations and this specific issue was not on the agenda. He did not exclude the possibility that currencies might be discussed by G7 leaders in the course of a general debate on the world economy. The capacity of financial market turbulence to disrupt the plans of the G7 leaders for a harmonious summit was graphically illustrated yesterday when Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, was obliged to interrupt a press conference on the summit to deny market rumours that his economic team was resigning. 'I can categorically deny this fact. You know these rumours sweep the markets', Mr Berlusconi said. He said he would seek the endorsement of fellow leaders for the creation of an international task force to intervene in cases where human rights were being grossly abused, such as in Rwanda. The idea has been coolly received in pre-summit discussions. But the Italian prime minister yesterday appeared determined to add this to an already crowded agenda. The summit is due tomorrow to discuss economic questions such as methods for getting the 35m unemployed in the industrialised world back to work, and safety measures for former Soviet nuclear power stations in the Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. Late tomorrow and on Sunday, the G7 leaders will be joined by Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Mr Berlusconi said yesterday that it was an important step forward to include the Russian leadership in a full discussion of world issues.

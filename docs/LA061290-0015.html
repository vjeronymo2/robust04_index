			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> SETTING HIGH MARKS ON WATER  </P> <P> While other parts of the state have been forced to deal immediately with the  dire consequences of the drought, Orange County for the most part has had the  luxury of merely being concerned.  </P> <P> Although the county's underground reserves could buy it time, the Board of  Supervisors and a number of municipal water districts have had the good sense  to urge voluntary conservation measures now. But San Clemente, which like other  places in South County has had rapid development in recent years, has been  unique in its foresight. Its water-rationing plan, which goes into effect  Friday, bears watching as a possible model for others at some future date.  </P> <P> A year ago this month, officials of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District --  which serves San Clemente, the Capistrano Beach district of Dana Point, San  Onofre State Park and the San Onofre Nuclear Power Station -- decided they had  seen enough when their reservoir plummeted in two months to less than half what  it had been. Although the city expects to get eventual help from a $114-million  South County pipeline project, it wisely decided not to wait. The city and  water district set the stage for the rationing plan, a building moratorium, a  new well and an agreement to reroute reclaimed water. The rationing plan in  particular merits some attention outside San Clemente because of its  reasonableness. Between Friday and Sept. 15, during the driest months, lawn  watering will be permitted only on odd or even days, depending on residents'  addresses. They will be limited to no more than 650 gallons a day, with fines  for violators. Developers face restrictions, too. Tougher measures are planned  if the level of the reservoir drops below specified levels.  </P> <P> Other municipalities in Orange County may not need to take such steps at this  point. But the lesson from San Clemente is that it makes no sense to wait until  the well runs dry to institute tough conservation measures.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] With the Liberian Transitional Council finally  installed on Monday [7 March] after much last-minute bickering  and wrangling, the disarmament process of AFL [Armed Forces of  Liberia], ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia], and NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces  should have begun today under the supervision of the expanded  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] force. There are reports that the AFL has  started the process, but there has been immense distrust between  NPFL leader Charles Taylor and ULIMO chairman Alhaji Koromah.  In Monrovia, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton asked Alhaji Koromah if he  had begun disarming his men.    [Begin recording] [Koromah] I will give my commander the  order as of today so that the arms can be given in. Already, I  have given orders that the arms in Kakata and Bong Mine should  be given in.    [Quist-Arcton] Charles Taylor seems to be very worried, not  disarming, until he sees evidence that ULIMO is disarming.  Clearly there is lingering mistrust between the two groups.    [Koromah] Whatever that may be, we are going by the  schedule.  We are going by stages as agreed to by the joint peace  disarmament committee, as agreed to by the implementation  committee of ECOMOG and when we agree to a schedule, ULIMO will  go by that. We don't necessarily trust Taylor. We know his  background; we know his record.    [Quist-Arcton] You are just saying that you don't trust  Taylor?    [Koromah] Of course not. Why should I trust him? Is that  surprising to you? [end recording]    So, ULIMO is beginning to disarm, but what about the NPFL? A  wild card there is the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] which has  been fighting Charles Taylor's forces in the Rivercess Region,  south of Buchanan and which is not a signatory of the Cotonou  Peace Accord and it seems that Charles Taylor is in some  difficulties. On the line Robin White asked him if had issued  an order to his troops to disarm.    [Taylor] Well, we are trying to still find out what is going  on here. As you know, the Council of State was sworn in and the  government is still not seated because the cabinet ministers  have still not assumed their offices. Our people informed me  this morning that they have been prevented from entering  ministries and agencies of government and so, we are not sure if  the government is fully seated. We are trying to see how these  things play in before we get into actual business.    [White] So you haven't actually ordered your men to hand in  their arms yet?    [Taylor] We have not given any such order. We are waiting  still for the government to take a seat. My ministers are at  risk. Right now in Monrovia, they have been stopped from  entering the building. You know, even in Britain, John Major  does not have a government unless he has ministers, is this not  correct?    [White] Some people might say that you are stalling, Mr.  Taylor.    [Taylor] We are not stalling. The ECOMOG people are in the  camp. You know, we are under attack right now. We are fighting  the LPC. In fact, the expanded ECOMOG that should be moving  into parts of Buchanan and the southeastern region have not  entered because of the heavy fighting. So, you know, it is like  a guy shooting at you and you are having a gun on one side and  the bullet on another side. So, all of these things are going to  come into shape. I do not think that there is any major  disruption and, I mean, these things take a little bit of time.    [White] You said there is fighting going on with the  Liberian  Peace Council in the Buchanan area. How extensive is that  fighting?    [Taylor] Very extensive. It is into and out of Buchanan,  into Rivercess and parts of Sinoe. There is very serious  fighting going on. No expanded ECOMOG has been able enter that  zone yet. There is very heavy fighting. And if you were to  call Monrovia, the Ugandans will tell you that they have not  been able to help them because bullets are flying and bombs are  going and there is heavy fighting there. So, that is the  problem on that side. On this other side, we are prepared to  begin disarmament. We are waiting for word from Monrovia  because our ministers have not taken seat, but we can still be  going forward because I think we have made a giant step forward  and we do not want to reverse the progress.

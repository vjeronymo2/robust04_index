The factor shall be calculated by subtracting the emission level at the selected test point from the emission level at the useful life point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The official refueling emission test results for each evaporative/refueling emission-data vehicle at the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor.

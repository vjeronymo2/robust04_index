			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Leading Article: Modernising the UK state MODERNISING the governance of the UK will be a central challenge for whichever government emerges on April 10. Demands for the reform of Britain's system of government are growing, yet the debate in the election campaign has been limp. On grounds of political efficiency alone, there is ample justification for reforming the management of the British state. The decline in local government has allowed central government to gather to itself overweening power. Parliament offers inadequate checks and balances to the power of the executive, leading to blunders such as the poll tax. Westminster itself is losing power to Brussels, yet behaves as if little has changed. There is now a well-established agenda of issues. Top of the list is Scottish devolution, which - barring electoral upsets - will be irresistible. The Scots should have home rule if they choose it in a referendum, provided they accept a reduction in the number of their MPs at Westminster to give them equal representation with English and Welsh voters. There is a pressing need to re-establish strong and accountable local government with a stable fiscal base. That includes an authority for London in order, at the very least, to deal with planning, transport, economic development and promotion. The wealth of quangos and opted-out bodies which run everything from the health service to individual schools must be made accountable. Questionable case The case for an assembly in Wales and regional government in England is more questionable, but if the Scots have their assembly, pressure for wider reform will grow. Increasingly, English regions feel disadvantaged in the EC, as Brussels relates to a Europe des regions. Even with devolution, however, Westminster would remain a tool for elective dictatorships. Fixed-term parliaments, freedom of information legislation, an elected second chamber and a bill of rights are all gathering support. So, too, is electoral reform for the House of Commons to ensure that no government is able to rule without the support of a majority of the electorate (one reason why every emerging democracy in eastern Europe has chosen proportional representation). A by-product would almost certainly be much greater political stability, with change incremental rather than by the swing of the political pendulum - something which business should welcome. Not immune Sadly - and despite the best endeavours of Charter 88, the constitutional reform campaign - these issues have not had the airing they deserve. The Conservatives deny that there is a problem. They claim virtue in resisting Scottish devolution, which could easily mean prolonged Conservative rule in England. However, a fourth-term Tory government will not be immune from the pressures for change from Brussels - or from Edinburgh. To his credit (and self-interest) Mr Paddy Ashdown has banged the drum for reform, arguing that constitutional change is a pre-requisite for solving the UK's economic and social problems. Labour has endorsed parts of the same programme, apart from a strange desire to write its own bill of rights rather than incorporate the European Convention into UK law. But there is a whiff of a play for the Liberal Democratic vote in this endorsement - Labour seems unable to provide convincing answers to the detailed questions about reform, such as the timetable for change and the functions of different tiers of government. Labour deserves credit, however, for setting up its commission on electoral reform, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant. Some think this a cynical exercise, certain to be shelved if Labour acquires an overall majority. But the first Plant report offers a cogent and erudite review of the options on electoral reform and the arguments for and against each. If Labour leads the next government (in or out of coalition), it should be held to its pledge to convert the Plant commission into an official review involving a wider spectrum of opinion. The next parliament is the time for careful debate and action on this vital topic.</p>

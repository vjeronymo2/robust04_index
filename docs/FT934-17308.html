			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Betacom back in black with Pounds 0.5m BETACOM, the telephone equipment supplier which is now 66 per cent owned by Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, reported a return to profit in the year to June 30. The company, which has reorganised its operations and capital structure in the past year, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 500,000 in the 12 months to June 30 compared with a Pounds 3.9m loss in the six months to June 30 1992. Last year the company changed its year end from December 31 to June 30. Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 12.1m for the year, compared with Pounds 4.25m in the preceding six months, and the group reported a small Pounds 57,000 operating profit compared with a Pounds 3.52m loss. Profits were further boosted in the full year by a Pounds 213,000 profit on the sale of joint venture investments in Germany and the Netherlands, and Pounds 246,000 in net interest receivable. Earnings per share of 0.83p compared with losses of 12.38p in the 1992 six month period. There is no dividend. Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's former corporate finance director who was appointed Betacom's chairman in July last year, said the year had been 'one of consolidation' during which the group eliminated its peripheral business to concentrate all its resources 'on improving our core business in consumer telephones and communications products in the UK.' In the UK Mr Ashcroft said Betacom 'disposed of significant quantities of slow moving products resulting in a much better mix of inventory at the year end,' and will be releasing a number of new products this autumn. The group, which has also restructured its banking facilities, ended the year with net cash of Pounds 3.2m compared with an overdraft of Pounds 2.6m a year earlier.</p>

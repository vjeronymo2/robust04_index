			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Prchal: "Signs of Slight Improvement </F> Have Become Visible in the Slovak Republic's Economy"]    [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has told  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that signs of slight improvement in the  economy have appeared in Slovakia in the past few months,  particularly in the chemical and rubber industries.    When asked what merit his government, which assumed office  about three months ago, deserves for this, the prime minister  said that he would not quantify it. "For us, it is important to  strengthen even more the positive elements that are beginning to  appear in the economy, and thus to improve the stability of our  economic development as rapidly as possible. We have the  prerequisites for this. We have made a firm decision to keep  the state budget deficit and inflation at a certain acceptable  level and to deal with unemployment with our development  programs, particularly in those regions where unemployment is  highest," he said.    Asked in which areas his government wants to support the  positive elements of economic development, the prime minister  said that it would release additional funds from extra budgetary  sources, particularly from the proceeds of privatization, to  support, above all, construction activity, the completion of the  comprehensive housing construction work, and small and  medium-size enterprises, which are to become the engine of the  Slovak economy, and also the construction of roads and other  communication links and certain railroads.    He said that the goal this year is to bring to a complete  halt the decline in gross domestic product, cut inflation to 13  percent (from 23.1 percent last year), and to keep the budget  deficit at 14 billion Slovak korunas. "We intend to continue  our tight fiscal policy," he stressed.    "Apart from some positive statistical data, we have the  slightly negative signal that the volume of investment in the  Slovak Republic has declined," he added and drew attention to  the fact that Slovakia provides a number of comparative  advantages for foreign investors--for instance, comparable  qualified labor is 40 percent cheaper than in Poland, 25 percent  cheaper than in Hungary, and 10 percent cheaper than in the  Czech Republic.    As regards the volume of investment in Slovakia, the Czech  Republic is third, with its volume of 13 percent after Austria  (23 percent) and Germany (21 percent). Jozef Moravcik  commented: "I believe that this could be better, but this is a  matter, above all, for Czech investors to consider."    Regarding the report that the IMF is to provide a  stabilization loan in July and to the question of whether this  decision will also have political significance for his  government in the preelection period, Moravcik said: "Above  all, I attach economic importance to this credit. Its  importance lies in the fact that Slovakia has been positively  evaluated by this renowned financial institution and thereby has  acquired better and more advantageous conditions in dealing with  other financial institutions."</p>

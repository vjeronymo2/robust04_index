			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Danish opposition urges fiscal expansion: Hilary Barnes on political reasons behind the nervousness of the country's financial markets DENMARK'S minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government is facing strong political pressure to adopt a more expansive fiscal policy in order to combat 11 per cent unemployment and invigorate an economy which has been plunged into uncertainty by the electorate's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on European union in the June 2 referendum. Although the Folketing, Denmark's parliament, does not meet again until October, there is speculation about a possible winter election, contributing to nervousness in the Danish financial markets. But Mr Poul Schluter, who will celebrate his tenth anniversary as prime minister in September, denies that he will call an election, which is not due for another two years. 'I consider it highly unlikely that the negotiations over the 1993 finance bill will lead to an election,' he said last week. The parties calling for a more expansive fiscal policy - the Social Democrats, the Radicals and the Socialist People's Party - point to the large current account surplus as evidence that there is plenty of room for manoeuvre. The first-half surplus was about DKr12.4bn (Pounds 1.14bn). It is expected to exceed DKr20bn for the year, or rather more than two per cent of gross domestic product. However, uncertainty caused by the Maastricht referendum is the main reason why the government is reluctant to adopt a more expansive economic policy. So far, the main impact of the Maastricht vote has been felt in the financial markets. The yield gap between Danish and German government bonds has widened from 0.8 percentage points just before the vote to about 1.4 points. The all-share price index has fallen by over 12 per cent this year, the worst performance in Europe, with most of the decline taking place since the referendum. Several large Danish companies  - among them Lego, the toy company  - have postponed investment plans because of the referendum result. Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive of the country's largest bank, Den Danske Bank, said recently that business in general has put investment plans back in the drawer for later reconsideration. Most economic indicators, however, remain positive. 'We have one of the strongest economies in Europe, and we mean to keep it that way,' said Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, economy minister. Inflation this year is about 2.3 per cent, and is expected to be about the same in 1993. The trade surplus is about 6 per cent of GDP, with the value of exports so far this year up by about 6 per cent. The central government budget deficit this year will be about DKr35bn, and only considerable budget savings will keep it to that level in 1993. However, the total public sector budget is expected to show a small deficit this year after several years of surplus. But Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister, says that as long as the situation surrounding Denmark's status in the EC remains uncertain the government cannot relax its tight grip on fiscal policy. It is thought unlikely that the Radicals, the small centre party which holds the balance between the socialist and non-socialist parties in the Folketing, will risk toppling the experienced team of Mr Schluter and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Liberal Party leader and foreign minister, until the Maastricht problem has been resolved, more especially as Denmark will hold the chairmanship of the European Council for six months from January 1. THE Danish Ministry for the Economy reduced its 1992 GDP growth forecast to 1.3 per cent, as a result of the adverse effects on business confidence of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty and a severe drought, which has hit agricultural output. In April, the Ministry predicted a 2 per cent growth rate this year. According to a new economic survey published yesterday, exports are still expected to perform well, rising by 4.3 per cent in real terms. But an April private consumption growth forecast of 2.5 per cent was cut to 1.5 per cent and business investment is now expected to fall by 6.2 per cent, compared with a decline of 3.8 per cent forecast in April.</p>

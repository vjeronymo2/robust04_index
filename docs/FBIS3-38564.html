			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sama Confirms Payments to </F> Communists; Strong Denial"]    [Text] Milan, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- An allegation advanced early  in December when he claimed he had been told of an illegal  contribution of 1 billion lire, or about 600,000 dollars, to the  Italian Communist Party at the end of 1980s was confirmed by  former Montedison Managing-Director Carlo Sama here today.  "It's totally false, and even ridiculously implausible,"  commented Massimo D'Alema, a top official at the Democrat Party  of the Left, the Communist Party's successor.    A statement from the party also denied "in the most drastic  terms" that any form of finance had ever reached the Communist  or Left Democrat Party from the Ferruzzi group or late  Ferruzzi-Montedison tycoon, Raul Gardini, who committed suicide  on July 23 last year.    Describing Sama's testimony as "false, denigratory and  slanderous," the statement also charged that it was a "good  addition" to various manoeuvres going on as the campaign for the  March 27 general elections gets under way.    Asked to confirm his earlier testimony at the hearings here  against financial whiz-kid Sergio Cusani, a key figure in the  acquisition of funding for the Ferruzzi-Montedison group's web  of bribery, Sama said it was Cusani who told him about the  payment, while Gardini confirmed the story.    In December, Sama said that it was Gardini, his  brother-in-law, who had disclosed the payment to him, telling  him that the money had served to soften up the major left-wing  opposition party in view of tax breaks for the merger between  Montedison and ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]  chemical interests to form Enimont.    Today's Left Democrat statement pointed out that, as in his  earlier testimony, Sama was unable to specify whether the  "hypothetical billion" was handed over, nor who did the handing,  nor to whom: "Once more, he calls as his witness someone who is  no longer able to testify."    D'Alema and Achille Occhetto, ex-Communist and now Left  Democrat party secretary, admit to having dined with Gardini and  Sama twice in 1989, but say their conversations concerned solely  the state and future of the Italian chemical industry and made  no mention of party funding. The tax break to sweeten the  Enimont deal never got through parliament, in part thanks to  Left Democrat opposition, removing one of the conditions under  which the Ferruzzi family was prepared to pursue the venture and  helping tip the family against Gardini, who eventually went his  own way when his plans for the Ferruzzi group to dominate  Italian chemicals fell apart.    According to Sama's testimony, however, Cusani disclosed the  payment when the two of them travelled by train to Switzerland  for talks with financial consultant, Giuseppe `Pino' Berlini,  who handled an important slice of the Ferruzzi family's  under-the-counter operations outside Italy, including the  channelling of funds to the parties and individuals receiving  bribes.    Sama claimed that Berlini told them the Ferruzzis had only  113 million dollars in their account with him, compared to 178  million the previous year. On the return journey, he said  Cusani told him of the payment to the Communists. [passage  omitted]</p>

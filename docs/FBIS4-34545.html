			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, the so-called North American Development Bank  (Nadbank), an institution created within the framework of the  North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] was formally  created. The fundamental objective of this new institution will  be to manage funds that are earmarked for social and  environmental improvement projects to be implemented along the  border between Mexico and the United States.    Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe and U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen presided over the signing ceremony as well as the  Nadbank's first Board of Directors meeting. The signing  ceremony took place before numerous Mexican and U.S. business  representatives at the San Antonio Convention Center. Secretary  Aspe commented on the joint efforts by each nation's government  to improve environmental and infrastructure conditions along the  common border.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was selected as  president of the Nadbank's Board of Directors, called on the  private sector to participate in the development of the projects  proposed. The Nadbank will initially operate under a 10-year  plan that encompasses projects totalling nearly $18 billion and  will combine private as well as public resources.    Also present during the signing ceremony were Mexican  Finance  Deputy Secretary Guillermo Ortiz and Erminio Blanco, under  secretary for international trade negotiations of the Commerce  and Industrial Development, among other officials representing  both nations.</p>

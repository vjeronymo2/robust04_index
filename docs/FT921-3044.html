			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Midwest applies litmus test: Today's presidential primaries THE Rust Belt, as the Midwest is often unkindly called, still matters in American politics for one very simple reason. Enough people live here to ensure that nobody is going to become president of the US without winning at least a share of these states in the November general election. No strategy based exclusively on the south or the far west, or even the two combined, can have other than a faint hope of success. For those seeking the Democratic party's nomination, especially for those from other parts of the country, the Midwest is the litmus test of political acceptability. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas and former California governor Jerry Brown hail from the south, the north-east and the west respectively and all, having won at home, need to show they can score away. Here the audience does not view them as favourite sons. It wants to know more about them. It is also often said that the Midwest is the microcosm of America's current problems. It contains ailing manufacturing industries, run-down inner cities plagued by drug addiction, ethnic and racial strife, overstretched hospitals and underfunded schools. The reality may be better than the awful picture sometimes portrayed, but nobody is claiming that an economic and social Garden of Eden has been rediscovered on the shores of the Great Lakes. So it is to Illinois and Michigan, which vote today, and to Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, with later primaries, that the three Democrat contenders come with hope - and trepidation. They can be made here as legitimate candidates, or they can be broken. To a much lesser extent the same applies to the two Republicans. In reality, Illinois and especially Michigan must constitute Mr Patrick Buchanan's last real stand to regain, as he puts it, 'the conservative heart and soul of the Republican Party' from the apostasy of President George Bush. He could go on after losing badly here, even to California in June, but increasingly people will stop listening. In Chicago the anecdotal evidence is they already have. The same risk attaches to Mr Tsongas on the Democratic side. There is a lot of admiration for the honesty and directness of the Tsongas message. At least he says the country must pay a price for its excesses. But his relative lack of money and organisation seem to be underlining the more widespread perception among Democrats that a Greek from Massachusetts, who has already been hammered by Mr Clinton in the southern primaries, simply cannot win in November. If political organisation means anything, which it still does, though less than it used to, in these two states, Mr Tsongas cannot be sanguine about the outcome today. This does not apply to Mr Brown for two reasons: he is better known and he can run on shoestring finances. Moreover, if there is inchoate rage out there about the system, which there is, then Mr Brown, inveighing against the establishment in all its forms, is actually the man who can tap it best. He has, after all, literally nothing to lose and, to the disaffected, he makes some kind of sense. He can also wound and goad, as Mr Buchanan has President Bush. In the television debate on Sunday night here, he launched an extraordinary, vicious attack on Mr Clinton, waving a Washington Post in the air and claiming that the governor of Arkansas and his wife, a prominent lawyer in the state, had no sense of propriety. Mr Clinton was patently outraged, especially by the onslaught on his wife, and explained that, since he became governor, she had not shared in any of the partnership proceeds that her law firm, the oldest west of the Mississippi, had earned from its dealings with the state. His defence was measured and perhaps the watching public, exhausted from a day of wall-to-wall college basketball play-offs, will have concluded Mr Brown overstepped the mark. But the Brown point was to suggest yet again that for this, and other, reasons, it is Mr Clinton who is genuinely unelectable against Mr Bush. And this is why Illinois and Michigan matter most of all to Mr Clinton, over and above the number of delegates he may win and the proof that can prosper in primaries outside the south. He has to inspire confidence in his party not only that his smoothly articulated policies make sense but also that he is not a fatally flawed personal vessel. It is improbable in the extreme that Mr Brown will be seen as a viable alternative, and unlikely that Mr Tsongas will, regardless of how both do today. But anything less than a solid endorsement of the governor of Arkansas will encourage the growth of the ABC (anybody but Clinton) movement inside the Democratic party.  ----------------------------------------------------------------              MICHIGAN AND ILLINOIS PRIMARIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Illinois Population:                  11.4m Ethnic composition:          78.3% white                              14.8% black                               2.5% Asian                              (7.9)% Hispanic* Unemployment rate:      1988: 6.8%                     Feb 1992: 8.5% Bankruptcies:           1988: 31,472                         1991: 42,710 1988 Presidential vote: Republican: 51%                         Democrat:   49% Convention delegates:   Republican: 85                         Democrat:  164  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Michigan Population:                   9.3m Ethnic composition:          83.4% white                              13.9% black                               1.1% Asian                              (2.2)% Hispanic* Unemployment rate:      1988: 7.6%                     Feb 1992: 9.0% Bankruptcies:           1988: 15,623                         1991: 25,423 1988 Presidential vote: Republican: 54%                         Democrat:   46% Convention delegates:   Republican: 72                         Democrat:  131  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race Sources: Bureau of the Census; Burreau of Labor Statistics; American Bankruptcy Institute; Congressional Quarterly  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

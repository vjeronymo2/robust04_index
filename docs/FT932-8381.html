			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Row over Steinkuhler grows GERMAN politicians and rank-and-file trade union members last night called for the resignation of Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the IG Metall engineering workers' union, from board memberships for alleged insider-dealing in shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company. The affair also brought new pressure for an urgent law to ban insider trading on the German stock exchanges. Mr Steinkuhler, the leading trade union member on Daimler's supervisory board, has denied the insider dealing charge but admitted buying almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) worth of shares in the holding company, MAH. The shares increased in value by almost 20 per cent after a Daimler board decision to exchange them for full company shares. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic party in the ruling coalition in Bonn, said Mr Steinkuhler should resign all his supervisory board positions - in Volkswagen, Thyssen and Daimler-Benz - if there was any confirmation that he had abused his position. Mr Heiner Geissler, a deputy leader of the Christian Democrat group in parliament, and seven works councils at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Stuttgart, the automobile subsidiary of Daimler, said he should resign. A senior union official in east Germany, where IG Metall members are on strike, was clearly shocked by the allegations. There was also some sympathy, however, for Mr Steinkuhler, who has won a reputation as a tough and successful negotiator in more than six years as leader of the country's largest trade union. The pressure for legislation to outlaw insider trading, promised by the German government for the end of the year, was stepped up in Frankfurt yesterday.

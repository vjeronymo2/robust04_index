			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANSECO ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF HANDGUN  </P> <P> The off-field trials of Jose Canseco continued Friday when the Oakland  Athletics' injured outfielder was arrested and charged with illegal possession  of a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun on a college campus.  </P> <P> Canseco had his injured left wrist examined by a doctor at the UC San  Francisco's Laurel Heights campus when a passerby, walking through the parking  lot, spotted Canseco's bright red Jaguar, looked inside and noticed a gun lying  on the floor on the driver's side, according to police reports.  </P> <P> The passerby then notified campus police, who waited for Canseco to return from  his examination and booked him for investigation of possession of a loaded  firearm on university property, a felony.  </P> <P> Canseco was later released on $2,500 bail.  </P> <P> On the advice of his attorney, Canseco declined comment, but Athletic general  manager Sandy Alderson told reporters he had discussed the matter with Canseco,  who told him he was carrying the gun because of a recent threat made against  him and his wife, Esther.  </P> <P> "In our conversation, Jose expressed some concern on his part over the safety  of him and his wife following an incident that occurred a couple of weeks ago,"  Alderson said.  </P> <P> Already this spring, Canseco has been charged with driving his car 120 m.p.h.  in Florida, running a red light during spring training and committing three  other traffic violations.  </P> <P> "We are not happy with these series of incidents, a series of possible  violations of the law," Alderson said. "We don't like the kind of message it  sends to our fans and to the Bay Area.  </P> <P> "My evaluation of Jose is that he is a very naive young man who doesn't grasp  the magnitude of the interest in him as an individual or the consequences of  not abiding by the same rules that apply to you and me.  </P> <P> "I am embarrassed for the organization, but I'm not totally unsympathetic to  Jose. He has to come to grips with his own notoriety."  </P> <P> Canseco's court appearance has been scheduled for April 27.  </P></p>

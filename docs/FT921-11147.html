			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A hesitant start to the year FT-SE Index: 2,571.2 (+20.4) Though London's traditional January rally did not amount to much - just 78 points on the FT-SE - the market has now risen 10 per cent from its Christmas low. This makes up all the ground lost in the preceding six weeks, when the market realised that its hopes of economic recovery were premature. After one false start, the latest rally may with luck prove the real thing. Alternatively, one could point out that the market is still well within the trading range established in the year since the Gulf war. It would only take a lurch in sterling or a couple of bad opinion polls to send it smartly down towards the lower end again. Politics apart, the defensive stocks such as pharmaceuticals are by general consent fully valued; a further strong rise would therefore need the cyclicals to join in. Having been wrong-footed lately in opposite directions by Lonrho and Rank, the market may be slow to push individual recovery stocks, especially with the results season in the offing. On the international front, investors also have to cope with a German steel strike and fresh suggestions that US interest rates are not falling any further. For the UK market to keep rising at its recent rate, quite a lot has to go right.</p>

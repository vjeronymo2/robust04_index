Radovan Karadzic is offering to negotiate the demilitarization  of Sarajevo. Jacques Merlino spoke to him this evening:    [Karadzic] Yes, we plan, within the framework of the overall  arrangement for finding peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  particular in Sarajevo, to place Sarajevo itself under the  jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of 30 years.  But only Sarajevo itself, because what is most important for us  is to guarantee the security of the Serbian areas of the town so  that they are not attacked, and also to avoid the kind of  massacres which have already been suffered in other  Serb-populated areas. We intend to do everything possible to  ensure that peace is found first in Sarajevo and then throughout  Bosnia.    [Merlino] Do you accept the order to pull back your heavy  artillery and to place it under UN control?    [Karadzic] If peace comes to Sarajevo, Serbian artillery,  just as Muslim artillery, will effectively be controlled by  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at locations decided upon by  UNPROFOR. Having said this, without signing an overall peace,  it is impossible for us to completely withdraw our artillery.  We are for peace but the Muslims are not. They want to  continue the war, and we therefore need the guarantee that the  Muslims will also withdraw their heavy weaponry.</p>

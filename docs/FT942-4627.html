			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / East Germans look to widen their horizons 'You bet I am going to vote in the European elections,' said Ms Gisela Bose, a 58-year-old mother of three sons. 'And I will tell you why. We have to keep the Nazis out. A low turn-out will play into their hands.' As an east German, this is the first time Ms Bose has had the chance to vote in these elections. Yet she and many of the residents of the Rosenfelder Ring housing estate in Friedrichsfelde, a socially-mixed district of east Berlin, cannot name their European parliament candidates. 'We have no idea who they are or what they look like,' said Ms Bose. 'They never come around here. I have never seen any of them campaigning. The only thing we know about the European parliament is through the television. I haven't a clue what any of the candidates stand for.' Mr Gunther Kombino agrees. 'Nevertheless, I will vote. But at my age - I am 65 - the European elections mean very little to me. They are more important for my children. They like to travel,' he said. 'I could not do any of that when the Wall divided Germany. If we have a bigger Union, they will be able to travel without any bother. Maybe we should expand Europe to the countries of eastern Europe, and to Switzerland, and to Scandinavia. By the way, who is standing in our district?' One of the candidates is Mr Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. Mr Ebeling, 60, lives in a large bungalow on a quiet, tree-lined street just a 10-minute walk across the tram tracks from the Rosenfelder Ring estate. He holds different views about how the European Union should be enlarged and what values it should hold. 'I support some degree of enlargement. But it should extend to the Christian countries with humanist values. I don't think I would go beyond the Urals.' A former theologian who, in the heady days of German unification, tried to set up in eastern Germany a sister party of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, Mr Ebeling would also like to see a ban on parties such as the far-right Republicans, and even the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to east Germany's former Communist party. 'They are not democrats,' he said. Mr Norbert Glante, his Social Democratic counterpart in Potsdam, does not believe in drawing up new borders in Europe. 'The European parliament should try to open up borders with eastern Europe and Russia. It is really important for the east Germans to have more trade and better contacts with the east. We are all in Europe together.' If the 41-year-old former technician is elected - and his chances are high since his constituency around Brandenburg is SPD - he would lobby for more funds for roads and infrastructure from this part of eastern Germany to the east. Yet, however much the voters and the candidates differ on where Europe starts and ends, they share one common aspiration: EU countries should have a united policy on crime, security and youth. 'Now the borders are open, there's so much crime and the youth are being dragged into it,' said Ms Bose. 'Then they start drifting into neo-Nazi groups and start getting violent. This cannot continue. This is a European problem.'</p>

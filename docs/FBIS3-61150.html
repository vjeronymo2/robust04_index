			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Karen Nersisian, head of the finance and </F> credit department of the Council of Ministers of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, by HAYLUR correspondent Shushanik  Abrahamian; date and place not specified]    [Text] The Armenians of Artsakh face the reality of  changing their currency. Doubts about whether we will remain in  the Russian ruble zone or whether we will adopt the Armenian  dram have been finally settled. The Council of Ministers decided  to put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert.    Karen Nersisian, head of the finance and credit department  of  the council of ministers of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic,  answered the question of HAYLUR correspondent Shushanik  Abrahamian.    [HAYLUR] Mr Nersisian, a decision has already been made to  put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert.    [Nersisian] The exchange of currency will take place in  Stepanakert in the same way it will proceed in Armenia.    [HAYLUR] Have any preparatory steps been taken, because the  people of Artsakh were in chaos in the preceding days?    [Nersisian] Yes, we have also created exchange boards. There  is also a central board which is headed by Minister of Finance  Spartak Tevosian.    All the money safes have been sealed so that there will be  no  circulation of the old currency. A special commission has been  sent to customs inspection points so that there will be no flow  of old currency from the outside. The corporations and  enterprises of the republic have been given instructions to  create their own appropriate boards.    [HAYLUR] You said that the exchange of currency will proceed  in the same way as it will in Armenia, that is, 1 dram will be  exchanged for 200 rubles. There are no collective farms in  Armenia. How will the workers of collective farms [in Karabakh]  be paid for their labor?    [Nersisian] There are many special cases which have been  taken into account. Eventually everything will come out fine.    [HAYLUR] What about the case of people who are serving in  the  army or on the front?    [Nersisian] The army also has its exchange board which will  take care of everything.    I think that everything in our republic will proceed  smoothly  without any unnecessary confusion.</p>

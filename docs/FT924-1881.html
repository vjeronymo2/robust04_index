			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / French acknowledge US command in Somalia FRANCE yesterday closed ranks with the US by stressing that its soldiers in Somalia were under US operational command and that their mission was primarily to escort food and medicine rather than to seize arms. A conflict between respective French and US missions arose out of an incident earlier this week, when French soldiers were ordered by a US officer to return a machine-gun to Somalis who were said to be guarding food supplies for an international aid agency. This drew criticism from the French government which said that disarming the Somali population was in line with the United Nations mandate. But in Paris yesterday the defence ministry underlined that the 350 French troops at present in the country were under the effective command of the much larger US force. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that 'when French troops find arms in the areas they control, they will take them,' leaving the impression that they would not actively seek out weaponry for seizure. Nevertheless, French support for a more active military role in both Somalia and Bosnia is underlined in a CSA opinion poll published today. Eighty-two per cent backed such a role in Somalia and 67 per cent in Bosnia. France has 4,500 soldiers in the ex-Yugoslavia. Leslie Colitt adds from Berlin: A prominent US foreign policy adviser has said the US military intervention in Somalia had other objectives besides the outgoing administration's desire to alleviate starvation. Mr Robert Hunter, a National Security Council member under former President Carter, said the struggle over future planned reductions in US defence spending also played a role.</p>

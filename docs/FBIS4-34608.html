			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Domestic air travel has been complicated by a pilots  strike. A total of 85 percent of domestic operations have been  suspended and the economic effects of the strike are already  being felt.    Here is Jaime Garcia, chief of operations at the El Dorado  International Airport in Santa Fe de Bogota, on the emergency  plan that is being implemented today in the nation's airports.    [Begin Garcia recording] The emergency plan in the airports  is being implemented by some airlines that are cooperating to  enable passengers to reach their destinations. The domestic  airlines cooperating are Intercontinental de Aviacion and Islena  de Aviacion, Satena, and there are a few Aires flights. [end  recording]    Intercontinental de Aviacion today covered its normal  routes,  that is, from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Popayan, Barranquilla,  and San Andres, among others, for a total of 19 daily flights.  Likewise, there are 19 other flights from other cities to Santa  Fe de Bogota. Islena de Aviacion is operating special routes  from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Medellin, and San Andres.    Nevertheless, 80 percent of the nation's passengers travel  on  Avianca, and this company does not have agreements for the  transfer of passengers. Therefore, if you have an Avianca  ticket and decide to travel on another airline, you will most  likely have to purchase a new ticket. Meanwhile, Ases and  Avianca announced they have hired foreign pilots to fly their  international routes.</p>

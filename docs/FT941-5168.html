			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Personal View: Two may be a crowd - Does the UK need a stock market for entrepreneurs? Sir Andrew Hugh Smith offers his views For more than 200 years, the London Stock Exchange has been the main source of equity funding for UK companies. That function is still its central role. Yet recently, concerns have been expressed about the capital-raising options open to smaller companies, which are the motor of economic recovery. City investors, company directors, politicians and venture capitalists all have different solutions to the problem of improving capital availability for small businesses. The stock exchange is committed to playing its part in providing all suitable companies with access to capital. The question is how that can best be achieved. The stock exchange has to balance its statutory obligation to ensure investors are adequately informed about companies with the unavoidable regulatory cost to the businesses themselves. It is often assumed that the cost of a listing on the stock exchange, typically between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000 - mostly paid to legal and other advisers - could be greatly reduced in an alternative market. But this could be done only by decreasing the level of investor protection. The readiness of investors to commit funds might then be correspondingly reduced. Last year the stock exchange set up a working party to investigate whether the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market would create a gap in the funding arrangements for small companies and, if so, what might be done. The working party proposed replacing the USM with an 'enterprise market' that would have a regulatory regime similar to that of the Official List and the USM. The working party's contribution was valuable, but its report adduced little hard evidence of the demand for an alternative market of this kind, or of the needs it should meet. Nor did it solve the problem of initial costs. Recent press comments suggest that the stock exchange has rejected the enterprise market proposals. This is untrue. Like any business planning a new venture, the stock exchange has commissioned research into the needs and concerns of small listed and USM companies, unquoted companies which may be considering a flotation, professional advisers and investors. The stock exchange also wants to find out whether investors would accept less detailed disclosure in the listing particulars and a lower level of regulation. If not, it would be difficult to make any new market substantially different from the Official List. An additional question is how far regulation could, in practice, be reduced within the European Union regulatory environment. It is worth recalling that the stock exchange established the USM in 1980 to provide young, entrepreneurial companies with the means of raising equity finance. It offered access to public capital to companies which could not qualify for a full listing, at much lower cost. It was a great success for some years, because of those qualities. But the distinction between the USM and the Official List was later eroded as a result both of EU legislation and of lower costs arising from changes in the official listing procedures of the stock exchange. These changes coincided with the downturn in the UK economy, and interest in the USM fell away rapidly. Other distinctions between the Official List and the USM - and indeed the working party's recommendations - are, in practice, illusory. For instance, the Official List is open to companies prepared to release 25 per cent of their shares into public hands, with a market capitalisation of as little as Pounds 700,000. In fact few, if any, companies of this size would find public capital a cost-effective way of raising finance. The total cost of listing makes this option uneconomic for most companies valued at only a few million pounds. Although USM companies need release only 10 per cent of shares into public hands, many have chosen to release 25 per cent or more to avoid illiquidity. The stock exchange has already taken steps to broaden the types of companies which can join the Official List. The revised Yellow Book rules, published last year, extended access to research-based scientific companies without a three-year trading record. Several companies have used these particular rules successfully, and a working group is considering further refinements to the mutual benefit of companies and investors. The record shows how the stock exchange already supports smaller companies. Of 180 new businesses listed last year, 58 were capitalised at Pounds 50m or less - a widely accepted delineation of a smaller company. There are now 860 of these on our main market, nearly half of all domestic listed companies. The stock exchange is committed to providing access to publicly subscribed capital to the broadest range of UK companies. We are actively examining how that range can be increased. In doing so we have to consider not only the interests of companies seeking capital, but of those who can provide it, not least so that they can have the confidence to invest.

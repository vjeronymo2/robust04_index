			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATASTROPHIC CARE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Who is Edwin M. Yoder Jr.?  </P> <P> His words "rapacious" and rapacity refer more to his own twisted concepts than  to those of the elderly. My generation has fought several wars. Those who  survived have received little pay or acknowledgment. We have paid our taxes,  apparent and hidden, for generations.  </P> <P> Inflation has overtaken our fixed incomes. Now it takes a month's income just  to pay our car insurance. We have stood uprightly for our families and our  country. Are we now to grovel for medical care that will let us die with  dignity and peace?  </P> <P> Who is Edwin M. Yoder Jr.?  </P> <P> HOWARD HENSCHEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

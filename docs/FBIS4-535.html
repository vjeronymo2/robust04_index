The first  stage goes from April to June. During this period, the  government is obliged to do the following:    1. To provide financing for the organization of elections;    2. To conclude a social pact;    3. To adopt an electoral code or a charter of parties, to  set up all the constitutional institutions, to establish a  national reconciliation council, to reorganize the territorial  administration department, to set up security forces for the  conduct of the elections, to carry out a voters' registration  exercise, to draw up electoral boundaries, and to appoint an  electoral commission and a human rights commission.    The second stage will cover a period of two months, August  and September. This period will be used for the material  preparation of the referendum preceding the elections. The  third stage involves an enlightenment campaign for the  referendum. The fourth stage is the organization of the  referendum. In December, there will be an election campaign for  legislative elections which will be held in January. In  February, there will be a presidential election campaign for  elections in March.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its Title III programs; therefore, changes in outcome measures will be deferred until the results of this critical assessment are available. Governors will continue to be required to set an entered employment rate standard for their Title III programs and are encouraged to establish an average wage at placement goal. At the same time, the Department will be exploring ways to use performance standards to improve the quality of services provided to dislocated workers, and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 204(d) of JTPA, older worker programs are now subject to performance standards. However, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. Outcomes for these programs focus on increasing employment and earnings similar to those programs serving other disadvantaged adults. Because field evidence suggests that older workers are much more likely to remain employed once they are placed in jobs, employment and wages will be measured at program completion rather than at a later follow-up period. Together, these measures underscore the employment focus of the program, particularly in jobs that are higher paying. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To comply with the legislative provisions, the Department considered adding specific outcome measures for hard-to-serve participants and separate outcomes for in-school and out-of-school youth. In the interest of avoiding a proliferation of performance measures and limiting local flexibility in programming, additional measures for these three separate groups were not established. Rather, the requirement to promote services to hard-to-serve individuals will be addressed from an incentive policy perspective and the issue of in-school and out-of-school standards will continue to be addressed through the performance standards adjustment process. When judging service delivery area (SDA) performance and awarding incentive funds, States will need to design incentive policies that will promote more effective services to out-of-school youth and reward placements into jobs with employer-assisted benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The policy of excluding cost measures from incentive awards will remain unchanged; however, States are reminded of the integral role of financial oversight in program management. States are also encouraged to utilize available administrative data to relate overall costs of job training to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. The Office of the Inspector General will be collaborating with ETA in developing a mechanism for measuring the program's return on its investments. The wider JTPA community will also be invited to participate in this effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 1, 1994, proposed revisions to the performance standards for JTPA Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Title III, and newly instituted section 204(d) performance standards were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 59 FR 9910. Interested parties were invited to submit written comments through March 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Labor (DOL) received 96 written comments on the proposed performance standards issuance. Eighteen of the letters explicitly endorsed the overall direction which the Department is taking in establishing performance standards policy for Program Years 1994 and 1995. In general, the majority of comments requested clarifications or raised issues about specific aspects of the proposed requirements. While the concept of imposing a hard-to-serve ``gate'' for incentive awards eligibility received support, its application to terminees rather than enrollments drew considerable local and State criticism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following summarizes the major issues raised by the commenters and the Department's respective responses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Participants Rather Than Terminees as the Basis for Determining SDA Eligibility for Incentive Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department specifically sought comments on whether the hard-to-serve ``gate'' for incentive award eligibility fully addresses the need to emphasize this population in the performance standards system, and whether compliance with the gate should be measured against those enrolled in training or those completing the program. A majority of those commenting on this issue agreed with the Department's approach of restricting eligibility for incentive awards to those programs that enroll in training at least a minimum (65%) hard-to-serve adults as well as youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, fully three-fourths of States and SDAs submitting comments specifically recommended that the basis for the gate should be participants (all individuals served during the year, including those still enrolled at the end of the program year) rather than terminees. Basing the 65% hard-to-serve level on program terminees was seen as pressuring SDAs to ``manipulate'' their terminations. Local programs can manage the recruitment process to ensure that adequate numbers of hard-to-serve are enrolled. Ensuring comparable numbers of hard-to-serve individuals will graduate each year is more problematic because of the clients' varying training needs. Participants with multiple barriers typically need to remain in programs longer than those with fewer barriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department concurs with the arguments made for changing the basis of the incentive award ``gate'' from terminations to participants. Particularly compelling is the rationale that hard-to-serve participants need longer-term interventions and the adverse effects that such a gate might create in prompting SDAs to terminate participants prematurely. Thus, beginning in FY 1994 for SDAs to become eligible for incentives, at least 65 percent of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> both <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the SDAs' Title II&hyph;A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Title II&hyph;C (in-school and out-of-school combined) participants receiving training, and/or other services beyond objective assessment, must be hard-to-serve. For the purpose of determining compliance with this requirement, those individuals with SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor are to be included as well as participants in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in five percent-funded projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further reinforce JTPA's focus on serving hard-to-serve participants, the Department encourages Governors to design incentive policies that explicitly promote increased service to that group. For example, Governors may wish to adjust themselves based on the degree to which SDAs exceed the incentive eligibility ``gate'' or on a sliding scale of continuous improvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Improved Service to Out-of-School Youth and Employer-Assisted Benefits Incentive Award Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> About 30 percent of all commenters mentioned this issue. Most of the comments requested additional guidance and clarification on how these two items could be incorporated into incentive award policies and asked whether Governors could ignore or ``zero weight'' either one of them in the awarding of incentives. The Department is sensitive to concerns about establishing incentive criteria without sufficient information on the program's prior experience in placing individuals in jobs with employer-assisted benefits; or in the case of out-of-school youth, in the absence of effective program models that have a positive impact on a youth's long-term earnings potential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

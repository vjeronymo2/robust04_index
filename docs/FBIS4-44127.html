			<p>BFN     [Text] The joint Cyprus-Greek military maneuvers will be  held in October within the framework of the unified defense  doctrine. According to CyBC's [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  exclusive information, the Greek Air Force and Navy will  participate in the exercise. The decision to hold the exercise  was made during the recent visit and talks in Athens by Defense  Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis. It is possible that this  exercise will be combined with the National Guard annual  maneuvers codenamed Nikiforos.    A group of staffers are working on the exercise plans, which  are expected to be ready in August and everything will proceed  on the basis of what has been agreed upon in Athens. Military  sources have told CyBC that the communications sector is  considered particularly important for the success of the  exercise as well as for the unified defense doctrine in general.  According to the same sources, direct communications with  parallel safeguards for confidentiality are also being studied.    According to CyBC information, all the diplomatic missions  both in Nicosia and in Athens have demonstrated particular  interest in the exercise.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Can house prices get off the floor? - John Authers asks if the market is set to recover A GHASTLY hush has fallen on the housing market. Investors, homeowners and potential homebuyers are standing back, waiting to see if house prices can take off again. The silence, compared with previous loudly proclaimed false dawns, is because everything that can be done to stimulate the market has already been done. If the housing market followed the same economic rules as other markets, it would already have recovered. But houses have special characteristics, which fuelled house price inflation at the end of the 1980s, and which might stifle recovery. Potential first-time buyers have access to historically low interest rates and house prices which have dropped sharply since the boom of 1988. In the last two decades, houses have rarely been cheaper in proportion to income. If they buy a house for between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000, the Budget has relieved them of the burden of 1 per cent stamp duty. House prices are sending confusing signals. The Halifax house price index fell in the first two months of this year, logging an overall annual fall of 7.2 per cent. But the Nationwide index rose 1 per cent in March. Further possible bad news comes from the Adams Residential Property Index, which is compiled by James R Adams, a market research consultancy, by monitoring housing completions made by solicitors. It shows completions at an all-time low of 59,963 for February. This is usually the worst month of the year for completions - but last year, the figure was 69,943, and in 1991 it was 83,150. In 1989, it was more than 100,000. Optimists about the property market can call on figures released by the Halifax building society, the UK's biggest lender, in evidence. Halifax says that Halifax Property Services, its estate agency, had its best month for two years in February, although the sales it made will not be reflected in completions figures for some months. Halifax's research of potential first-time buyers found that since July last year, when base rates were at 10 per cent, 34 per cent more were seriously considering buying, including 130 per cent more of those currently renting. Other lenders report a similar experience. Abbey National and Nationwide have had increased applications, which have yet to convert into sales. If all these people go through with their purchases, the housing market could at last have the volume to fuel a recovery in house prices. Whether they do so will depend on confidence. People need to believe in the housing market before it can pick up again. John Ginnarlis, of PA Consulting Group, says there used to be two separate demands for housing: as a commodity and as an investment. After several years of falling prices, people only want property as a commodity. Can the market ever recover, given that confidence has taken such a blow? Joe Egerton, of Economic and Regulatory Analysts, points to extra structural difficulties. First is the problem of 'negative equity' - when the value of your house would not pay the costs of paying off the loan. Once transaction costs and high mortgage indemnity premiums are taken into account, many people who could sell their house for more than the outstanding mortgage have a disincentive against moving. The bubble of people who bought at a younger age than they would normally have done deprives the market of its usual quota of first-time buyers. The people who would normally have fuelled a recovery are instead 'well and truly locked in,' said Egerton. A survey by NOP shows that in the six months to September last year, first-time buyers made up 34 per cent of the new mortgage market. In the boom-time of 1987, they accounted for 56 per cent of mortgages. On a practical level, Egerton points out that many of the conversions and other cheap properties bought to 'get on the housing ladder' in 1988 are now in poor condition and, therefore, harder to sell. Many of these properties have moved into a rental 'black market', let at low prices to friends, of the owners, making reliable statistics of the rental market impossible to compile. Egerton says, 'there definitely is a recovery in sales,' but this applies only to quality properties at reasonable prices. Even this is an improvement on a year ago. However, Egerton's arguments suggest that a repeat of the boom of 1988 is impossible - the demand does not exist to sustain it. James Morrell, economic adviser for Charterhouse, has a more positive view. He believes that increased volume is important in pushing house prices up. 'There's about a year's time lag between the change in volume of transactions and a change in house prices,' he says. On that basis, this could be a good time to buy, as the bottom may have been reached. The figures for volume look like a trough, and may be followed by greater activity if the cautious report from lenders are correct. Morrell is confident: 'People who are planning to go into the market would be a bit unwise to dither much longer.' Even so, a small recovery this year would leave prices at the same level they reached in 1992 - therefore showing a loss, in real terms, once inflation is taken into account. Housing still does not make sense as investment alone, and poor quality housing, as many of the buyers of 1988 would agree, should be avoided.</p>

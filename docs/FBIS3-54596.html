			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Serious Meaning of a Childish Threat"] </F>   [Text] It would have been wrong to presume that Pakistan  would sit silently after both sides agreed to disagree at the  recent India-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks. By putting  conditions before the talks, Pakistan had already made its  intentions clear that for the time being it is in no way  interested in normalizing relations between the two countries.  However, the warning given by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar  Asif Ali during his visit to Uzbekistan that a war may break out  in South Asia cannot only be described as fuel to keep the  controversy alive. The statement has been given under a  well-planned policy which aims on the one hand to keep public  opinion in Pakistan with the government, and on the other to  inform the comunity of nations that if it did not keep in view  the Pakistani interests, the situation may well get out of  control.    As reported, the Pakistan foreign minister during his stay  in  Uzbekistan has drawn a blueprint of nuclear war in South Asia.  He has threatened that if the Kashmir controversy is not  settled in line with Pakistani interests, India and Pakistan may  go to war for the fifth time and that nuclear arms may be used.  The threat, perhaps, is given to underline that a desperate  Pakistan can resort to anything at its disposal. It is true  that in terms of international diplomacy such threats can only  be described as childish, but it cannot be fully ignored in view  of the the way Pakistan has been constantly hurting Indian  interests. By assisting terrorists in Punjab and Kashmir,  Pakistan has only shown its hostile attitude against India.  Pakistan was also behind the bomb blasts in Bombay last year.  Evidence has often come to light about Pakistan's encouragement  of communal violence in various places in India. Hence, the  Pakistan foreign minister's threat should be taken seriously,  not because we should be afraid of Pakistan's so-called nuclear  capability, but because of the fact that Pakistan has launched a  diplomatic offensive against India. We are capable of  confronting Pakistan's military might and this has been proven  many times in the past. Today, however, the need is not as much  about displaying our military strength as showing diplomatic  skill and capability.    Our biggest need today is to clearly define our objectives  and put them before the world in no uncertain terms. This is  all the more imperative if the world is to view the Indian stand  in the right perspective regarding Kashmir. We have to make it  clear that Kashmir is an integral part of India and that we are  ready to take all steps to defend our territorial integrity. We  also must explain to the world how normal life has been  disrupted in Kashmir due to Pakistani-sponsored terrorism. The  way Pakistan is abetting terrorism is no less than any war by  itself. In such a situation, India not only has to make its  stand clear, but it must categorically state that its policy  objectives are not surrounded by a mist of uncertainties. Our  attitude should not reflect a lack of self-confidence. This is  essential to project our stand to the world community. We also  cannot ignore the fact that countries like the United States  want to view Kashmir issues from the Pakistani viewpoint. This  is why it is necessary that we become more active on the  diplomatic front than in the past. While on the one hand it is  essential to make it known to Pakistan that India cannot be  cowed down by threats, on the other it is also essential to  explain to world opinion that Pakistan's stand regarding Kashmir  is not only illogical, but dangerous as well. The language of  threats being used by Pakistan may well be childish, but it is  also full of dangerous consequences. The Pakistan Government  could resort to any adventure to strengthen its position within  the country. This is why it is all the more necessary that we  clearly define our stand regarding Pakistan and avoid ad hoc  policies. Vacillation will create doubt about our polices which  will weaken our stand. Our aim should be clear and our sight  straightforward.</p>

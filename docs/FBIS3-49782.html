			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by unidentified correspondent in Geneva] </F>   [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On one side we have Croatia's  efforts for peace and a call for peace by the European Union,  and on the other side the Muslims are maneuvering with the war  option and the display of force. [passage omitted]    Late this afternoon Minister Granic held talks with Haris  Silajdzic.    [Begin Granic recording] "The European Union has sent a  (?memorandum) in which it warns all the sides to make all  possible efforts to achieve an urgent end to hostilities and an  agreement. This is probably one of the most important days of  the Geneva negotiations. If no agreement is reached, there is a  big chance that the war will intensify even further.    Croatia is making extreme efforts to bring about an end to  the conflict and, in the spirit of the agreement that President  Tudjman proposed to President Izetbegovic, primarily an end to  the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims, and to reach an  agreement between them. Croatia is also making efforts to  normalize relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of  mutual recognition and of certain necessary preconditions. That  was the main topic of all the talks today, the lengthy talks  with Prime Minister Silajdzic and with the Bosnian Muslim  delegation." [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

According to opposition newspapers, the money was  distributed  by supporters of the presidential group to "buy the consciences"  of parliamentarians so as to disrupt deliberations at the HCR-PT  and prolong the political impasse in Zaire. On the other hand,  the SALONGO daily, close to the former single party, the Popular  Movement of the Revolution [MPR], charges that the opposition is  distributing $300 per head to "buy votes for Tshisekedi"    The HCR-PT has been meeting since 23 January to decide on  the  accords concluded between the presidential group and the radical  opposition to extricate the country from its political and  institutional crisis. Deliberations continued in commissions,  and then resumed in plenary session on 28 February. Since then  the meetings have remained blocked over a disagreement between  the presidential group and the radical opposition on the future  prime minister. The radical opposition supports Etienne  Tshisekedi, elected prime minister by the Sovereign National  Conference, but his appointment was later revoked by Marshal  Mobutu. The Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC), which is  the driving force of the presidential group, wants the new prime  minister to be chosen henceforth by the HCR-PT.    According to the opposition press, the FPC has been  distributing money to encourage an "impasse" in the  deliberations of the HCR-TP in order to bring about a new  political crisis. Such a situation, according to the  opposition, could allow Marshal Mobutu to arbitrarily choose a  new prime minister from his camp.    This theory is contradicted by circles close to the FPC,  which recall that the head of state himself had expressed a wish  to see the future prime minister "come from the opposition" and  that he has described the Birindwa government as "only a  caretaker government." These circles also claim that radical  opposition parties "are trying to rally their scattered troops  with money to avoid a rout for Tshisekedi."</p>

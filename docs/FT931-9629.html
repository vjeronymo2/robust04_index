			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Hard nut Having helped Bill Clinton to beat George Bush, Stan Greenberg wants to do the same for Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress. The new US president's campaign adviser has offered to work for the ANC ahead of South Africa's first multiracial elections, expected next year. Greenberg has a particular interest in the country; he was a visiting lecturer at Witwatersrand University, Johannesburg, for a year in the 1970s. But ANC leaders, who've yet to decide on his offer, may still think his experience falls short of the task. After all, if the ANC is to win, it needs to crack problems far tougher than were Clinton's. The first is getting people to register as voters; millions are illiterate with no experience of elections and little of democracy at all. A second is teaching them how to vote under the complicated proportional representation system. The knottiest is preventing violence from harming the party's chances.</p>

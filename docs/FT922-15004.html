			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: New rescue plan for Forsta Sparbanken THE SWEDISH government announced a new SKr7.3bn (Dollars 1.2bn) rescue package for Forsta Sparbanken, the troubled savings bank which was hit by heavy credit losses in the property and construction sectors last year. Bankers and Finance Ministry officials have spent the past week in meetings in order to work out a way of saving Forsta after the bank announced its credit losses for 1991 were even bigger than originally projected. Credit losses reached SKr5.7bn instead of the SKr4.5bn which the bank had forecast in October, and Forsta reported a SKr5.49bn operating loss for the year. Its troubles have been complicated by the fact that it is one of the 11 regional savings banks which planned to form a single large savings bank group this year with the aim of seeking a stock market listing in 1993. Complications arose because Forsta received an emergency SKr3.8bn loan from Sparbanksgruppen, the savings bank group which will help form the new banking group. The loan was guaranteed by government. According to banking regulations, Forsta could not join the new savings bank group while still keeping the loan from another part of the new group. However, yesterday's package resolved Forsta's problems by proposing: The parts of Forsta's loan portfolio expected to cause major losses will be put into a separate subsidiary of Forsta and Sparbanken Sverige The subsidiary will try to dispose of the loan portfolio. The government has agreed to lend SKr3.8bn to Forsta's owner, a foundation, which will transfer the loan to Forsta. The funds can later be used to pay back Sparbanksgruppen's original SKr3.8bn loan. The government loan is interest-free until the end of 1995, and thereafter carries an interest rate of 4 per cent. The 11 savings banks foundations which own Sparbanksgruppen will raise up to SKr3.5bn in the market. The borrowing will be guaranteed by the government and can take the form of a bond or loan. Forsta will receive this as an injection of shareholders' capital.</p>

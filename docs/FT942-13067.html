			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World outlook for jobs 'gloomy' The world outlook for jobs and wages remains gloomy, with growth in employment internationally failing to match the growing labour force, the International Labour Organisation said in its annual report yesterday. The world labour force is growing by 43m would-be workers a year, it said, but average per capita income fell last year for the fourth year in succession. Slow growth in the developed market economies was passed on to developing countries through falling demand and lower commodity prices. Except for the swiftly growing East and South-East Asian economies, employment levels could only be sustained by falling wages. Long-term unemployment had increased sharply across Europe. Some 28.1 per cent of unemployed people in the UK had been without jobs for more than a year. In Ireland the percentage is 60.3, in Germany 45.5 and in France 38.7. This contrasts markedly with Sweden (4.4) and Finland (9.1). Employment conditions, said the ILO, would continue to be determined by two important characteristics: economic globalisation, allowing capital to seek cheap and productive labour anywhere in the world, and liberalisation affecting most of the OECD economies and many former communist bloc countries. 'For millions of workers around the globe, employment prospects will, at best, remain uncertain for years to come'. The ILO is raising concerns about the number of deaths among workers using pesticides and agricultural chemicals, particularly in developing countries. The report said an estimated 4m third world workers showed signs of pesticide poisoning. Some 99 per cent of deaths caused by agro-chemicals occurred in developing countries which used only 20 per cent of the world's pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers. Disasters such as at Bhopal tended to obscure the damage caused by daily handling of chemicals.</p>

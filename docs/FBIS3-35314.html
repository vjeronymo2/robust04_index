According to the summons issued by the Ministry of Justice  Palace on 5 Dey [26 December] for 'Abbas Salimi-Namin, managing  director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the trial is scheduled for 1000 on  8 Esfand [27 February] this year at Tehran Penal Court 2, Branch  199.    In this summons, the charge against the managing director of  KEYHAN-E HAVA'I is said to be "publishing lies."    Sa'idi-Sirjani began his complaint against KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's  managing director in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March  1990], when an article criticizing his writing in the newspaper  ETTELA'AT was published in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. Investigation of  this case was begun in earnest at that time by the Ministry of  Justice. The managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been  summoned several times to give explanations to the public  prosecutor, and according to the most recent summons, his trial  is to begin in the month of Esfand.    After questioning the managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I  and listening to his explanations, the special investigator for  this case determined that Sa'idi-Sirjani's claim could not be  pursued and announced that the investigation of the case was  closed, but the Tehran deputy prosecutor canceled the  investigator's opinion and reopened the case.    Sa'idi-Sirjani is among those who are interviewed on foreign  radio programs such as the BBC and the Voice of America, usually  about cultural, social, and sometimes political matters, and his  writing is published in Persian-language newspapers published  abroad.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Regional press tipped as growth industry A DETAILED analysis of the UK regional press predicts strong growth in the sector once economic recovery gets under way. Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, recommends no less than 12 regional publishing groups as either buys or holds. Five of the com-panies are picked as buys for both the short-term and the long-term. The five companies are: Johnston Press, the Scottish local newspaper group which has expanded into England; Southern Newspapers, pub-lishers of the Southern Evening Echo in Southampton; The Daily Mail and General Trust, owners of the Northcliffe group of regional newspapers; Reed International, owners of Reed Regional Newspapers; and United Newspapers, owners of United Provincial News-papers. Mr de Bellaigue, in his last publishing study before his retirement, says investors should look at the regional press because 'it is a classic recovery sector with 70 per cent of revenues coming from advertising.' Apart from high operational gearing, which means that higher advertising revenue converts mainly into profits, regional papers have strong cash-generating properties and have 'the enviable margins' of companies dominating their markets. Panmure Gordon does however issue a health warning in the shape of the danger that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, might impose value added tax on newspapers and books. Mr de Bellaigue argues that regional newspapers will inevitably face increased com-petition from the electronic media. The longer term strengths of the industry include the conservatism of many of its customers and the scope for further improvement of margins.</p>

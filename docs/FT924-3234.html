			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories warned on debate time for Finance Bill LABOUR has warned the government not to use the move to a unified Budget next year as an excuse for curtailing the Commons' ability to discuss the Finance Bill. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, is to announce within the next week the government's plans for the December Budget in a year's time. The announcement will come in a letter to Mr Nick Brown, an opposition Treasury spokesman, who last week raised with Mr Dorrell Labour's concerns that the government would seek to cut the period in which the Finance Bill was before parliament, and would deal with technical matters in secondary legislation rather than in the bill itself. That warning has been underlined by opposition MPs organising extended debate on a number of technical financial measures - which would normally get little or no discussion - as a sign of what might happen if ministers ignored their concerns. The opposition argued that dealing with technical matters in secondary legislation would be unsatisfactory because such measures cannot be amended and because discussion on them is strictly time-limited. It also said that if the gaps between the different stages of parliamentary debate on the Finance Bill were shortened, then other organisations would be less able to offer advice on whether the drafting accurately reflected government intentions. Labour is now broadly satisfied with the private assurances from Mr Dorrell that ministers do not intend to reduce the time available for the bill, but plans to raise a further point about arrangements for MPs to consider economic forecasts outside the budget process. At present, the Treasury publishes economic forecasts both at the time of the Budget in spring and in the Autumn Statement. Once the two events are combined in a unified Budget, Labour will seek a set-piece economic debate at July to provide a second forecasting occasion. The government intends the second Budget next year to take place some three months earlier than the traditional March Budget arrangements, with the Finance Bill completing its passage through parliament perhaps by late May.</p>

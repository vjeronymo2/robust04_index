This  was a result of joint strenuous work of experts for a year  because border issues demanded urgent settlement.    The adoption of a such a document for the first time is an  evidence of strengthening of mutual respect, sovereignty of each  of the member states and the development of friendly relations  between them, as well as the positive changes in international  relations as a whole.    The conclusion of this agreement means for us that Mongolia  has reached a full agreement on state border issues and thus  laid the foundation of its stability, Zhalbuugiin Choinkhor,  Mongolian minister of foreign relations, told ITAR-TASS.    Russia and China with respect to Mongolia demonstrated  respect for such important international principles as  inviolability of its state borders, its independence and  territorial integrity. The historical importance of the present  agreement lies just in all this, the Mongolian minister of  foreign relations stressed.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): Don't leave your heir on a shoestring - Wills &amp; inheritance tax YOU MAY hate the idea of writing a will. But if you do not, the state will write it for you. And you may not like what it says. British intestacy rules may be fine by you, but you should check. English, Scottish and Northern Irish law vary on the precise arrangements if you die without writing a will. In England, if you leave a spouse behind you, they will receive your entire estate if it is less than Pounds 75,000. If it comes to more than this, things get baffling. If you have no children, your spouse receives the house, its contents and any personal effects. After that, the spouse will receive the first Pounds 125,000 of the estate, and then half of the residue beyond this. If you have surviving direct relatives - parents, brothers and sisters  - then the remainder is shared between them. If you have children, the spouse only receives Pounds 75,000, plus a life interest in half of the residue. The other half of the residue is split between the children, once they reach the age of 18. If these rules do not suit you, call a solicitor and write a will. This is only the first step towards guaranteeing your heirs a healthy inheritance. If you are wealthy, it may pay to enter the labyrinthine world of estate planning. The future for inheritance tax (IHT) is more uncertain than for any other form of taxation. Conservatives have hinted that the Budget will see radical reform, possibly the doubling of the threshold before tax is payable. A Labour government would make similarly radical changes, in the opposite direction. It wants to change IHT into a recipient-based tax, related to the amount received by individuals, rather than the total amount eft in the estate - thus encouraging people to distribute wealth more widely in their wills. While politicians are making up their minds, it is best to look at the current regime and work from there. The main points to bear in mind are: There is a threshold of Pounds 140,000 before any IHT is payable. Amounts above this level are taxed at a single tax rate of 40 per cent. Money left to a spouse is tax-free. The Pounds 140,000 threshold can be given in addition to this exempt bequest. You can make a gift of up to Pounds 3,000 each year, exempt from all IHT in addition to all other reliefs. You can carry forward unused exemption for one year, but you must use up all of your current year's exemption before using any exemption carried forward. 'Small gifts' of up to Pounds 250 can be made to any number of individuals in a year without affecting your overall allowance for the year. Thus, if you gave the maximum to 12 people you would have given away Pounds 3,000, without eating into the additional Pounds 3,000 annual exemption. Regular gifts out of income, which can be proved to the Revenue not to affect seriously your standard of living, are exempt. Bequests to charities, political parties and various other non-profit-making organisations are exempt. Gifts to individuals or to various trusts can be exempt, if they are made more than seven years before death. These are 'potentially exempt transfers', because they lose some, or possibly all, of their exemption if the donor dies within seven years of making the gift. Tax on gifts of above the threshold allowance is subject to 'tapering relief' - the longer the donor survives, the less tax will be applied. There are so many loopholes here that some accountants call IHT a 'voluntary tax'. How you go about minimising it depends on how much you are prepared to give away. The three main weapons at your disposal are trusts, whole-of-life policies, and back-to-back schemes. All have advantages, but carry costs: Whole-of-life policies are best if you do not want to give anything away. A couple can take out a joint whole-of-life policy with a sum assured, equal to the amount they expect to have to pay in inheritance tax on the estate. When the second parent dies, this policy automatically pays the children's inheritance tax for them (see also L for life assurance). Life policies for the elderly are not cheap - a couple in their late fifties could expect to pay annual premiums of around Pounds 7,000 to cover a liability of Pounds 250,000. You should also beware of high commissions and costs. But the approach has the benefit of simplicity. Trusts are subtler, and potentially more useful, if more expensive. They come in bewildering varieties, but the basic idea is that money gifted to a trust, over which you may be able to exert a certain level of control, can count as having left your estate for IHT purposes, provided you cannot benefit from the money yourself. A typical IHT plan buys an insurance bond and puts it in trust. You can also use an insurance bond as a package for an existing portfolio, which will be preferable in many cases. Back-to-back policies are commission-rich. You buy an annuity, automatically slashing the value of your estate. You then use the annuity both for income, and to fund (you guessed it) a whole-of-life policy. This pays out to your heirs, when their IHT liability has already been slashed by the annuity. Take advice from solicitors, accountants or other fee-charging advisers before taking any action. This is a deeply emotive topic, and you should not be rushed into doing anything you do not want to do.</p>

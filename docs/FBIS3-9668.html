			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Colonel General  Momcilo Perisic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, visited  the military high school in Belgrade today. [passage omitted]    Perisic said in a statement: "Despite the economic blockade  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and numerous  pressures, society's scientific research and military-industrial  complex is doing its utmost to contribute to the maintenance of  the necessary level of the Yugoslav Army's combat readiness. In  conditions of the existence of objective difficulties and the  lack of financial resources, it is thanks to the  self-sacrificing involvement of scientific personnel and the  consolidation of the military industry that we are succeeding in  following contemporary achievements in the world in the field of  armaments and military equipment. In keeping with this, the  army's existing combat systems -- which to the greatest extent  are the result of our own research and technological-technical  potential, together with the rational use of military resources  -- are making possible the successful defense of the  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the FRY.    "In the context of the further modernization of the Yugoslav  Army, we are devoting particular attention to the air force and  air defense, as well as to increasing the efficiency of  artillery and armored facilities. The perfection of missile  systems is developing in terms of increasing their range and  military effectiveness, as well as in improving their guidance  systems. As a result of all this, the Yugoslav Army, inspired  by great patriotism, is in a position to confront any potential  aggressor and inflict intolerable losses on him."</p>

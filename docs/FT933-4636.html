			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Arts: You have the right to speak British - Television OVER dinner with his father a four year old boy asks 'Daddy, do you know what the police say when they arrest you?' and the man, who has spent a considerable part of his adult life watching crime series on television, replies 'They usually say 'You're nicked''. But the child insists that that is not right: 'They say 'You have the right to remain silent'' and he adds a number of other clauses, mainly about the right to consult a lawyer. What the boy is quoting is not the standard British caution, but its American counterpart (known , if I remember my Ed McBain correctly, as the Miranda rules). Serve on a British jury these days and you are likely to find that your fellow jurors' ideas about the law consist of one part folk myth rooted in English common law, and nine parts US legal procedure picked up from the small screen. This rather than, or as well as, the ubiquity of Diet Coke and Mickey Mouse is presumably what French intellectuals mean when they growl about 'American cultural imperialism'. Neither the child's parroting nor the jurors' misunderstanding is surprising when you look at the quantity of US drama on British television screens. At the weekend television's autumn season began to crank up, thank goodness, and one of its first offerings was a 90-minute drama in a new batch of 'Screen One' on BBC1 called Wide Eyed And Legless. It would be difficult to imagine anything more English. Julie Walters played Diana Longden, a woman paralysed by a mysterious illness which necessitates steel cages on both hands, obliging her husband Deric (Jim Broadbent) to dress her and wheel her to and from countless hospital consultations, showing up the medical profession's ignorance and impotence without any effect upon their arrogance. Though driven repeatedly to the brink of suicide, Diana maintains a jaunty front for the sake of Deric and their children, and Deric, as their son remarks, worships his wife. The spirit and attitude of this drama bring to mind the Ealing comedies; it is heroic on a domestic scale. It is also chirpy, melancholy, sentimental, eccentric, and gritty. Above all, thanks to Jack Rosenthal's script (from Deric Longden's two autobiographical books, Diana's Story and Lost For Words) it is funny. Deric's relationships with the loyal women at his decrepit lingerie factory are endearing and funny. Deric's mother, played by Thora Hird as the world champion of the non sequitur, is funny. Asked 'Are you Deric's mother or Diana's?' she replies 'Possibly', and upon being told 'That's not Lawrence it's Kenneth' she says 'Well I knew it was someone of Arabia'. Eventually Deric meets and fancies a blind novelist named Aileen Armitage (another good performance, from Sian Thomas: this one will win awards). Diana wills them to one another and then drowns herself in the bath. This drama brought to mind other British television productions from years ago: On Giant's Shoulders about thalidomide boy Terry Wiles, for instance, and Trevor Griffith's work Through The Night, which had much to say about the superciliousness of doctors. They too were on a small scale, yet they too were powerful. All three, in a manner typical of the best of British television drama, dealt with worlds which we either inhabit or could find ourselves inhabiting. There are many US television dramas of which the same cannot be said, even in relation to American viewers, for instance Lonesome Dove, a six-hour Western, shown last week by BBC1. In line with modern cinema tradition, at least since Heaven's Gate, it looks vividly authentic: sand, dust and bright light; primitive conditions, baggy and ill fitting clothes, dirty people and ramshackle buildings. It is one of those rare cowboy films full of cows (like Red River) and, as with Rawhide, the cattle drive is, at least ostensibly, the locus of the drama. In spite of that it feels diffuse and unfocused, more like a soap opera than a mini-series, in the sense that there are countless sub-plots yet no central story. Watch long enough and (again, as with soap opera) this ceases to matter since the characters themselves become so familiar and engrossing that they serve as a substitute for plot. It will be said of Lonesome Dove, as it has always been said of Westerns, that although set in the 19th century it is really telling us about our own age, and for Americans there is probably some truth in that: the casual use of guns, the cheapness of life, the acceptance of vigilante vengeance do, by all accounts, apply as much or more today as in the days of Wyatt Earp. But it is to US society that they apply, not (yet, anyway) to ours, even if Americans do make their television programmes in our language. Happily this is not a world that we live in. Of course that does not mean that British viewers cannot be entertained by Lonesome Dove; the BARB figures may well tell us that more viewers watched it than watched Wide Eyed And Legless. Perhaps the same applies to another US mini-series, Cruel Doubt, shown on ITV last week, though I doubt it and hope not. This was an example of what seems to be emerging as the dominant genre within the world of American mini-series: weird and horrible crimes committed in suburbia, somewhere behind those big unfenced lawns running down to pavements where winsome 'kids' do wheelies on thousands of dollars worth of advanced carbon fibre technology. As so often with these series, this one was based upon a real case. A teenage college boy who is a heavy user of drugs and an obsessive player of dungeons and dragons, draws his friends a diagram of his family's house so that they can murder his parents and he can inherit their money. No doubt we ought to be aware of such crimes; there is a tendency for most things American to cross the Atlantic eventually, but journalism would seem the best means of conveying such information. It is hard to see how anyone except the mentally disturbed or a particularly morose and spiteful teenager could possibly find Cruel Doubt entertaining. For some reason BBC2 has chosen to describe its mini-series, Love And Reason as a 'satire' about 'the rough and tumble of politics', although there was nothing in the opening episode that looked remotely satirical. So far it has been a story about factional bickering within the Labour party in the 1980s and the question of whether to modernise in line with Kinnock's policies or stick to Keir Hardie style flat-cap socialism, even if the caps are being worn by women. The trouble is that we have seen this sort of material handled so much better in GBH and, so far as inner-city corruption among planners and councillors is concerned, Muck And Brass. If the human story of sexy Lou Larson becomes more dominant the drama may become more compelling, but sticking with Labour's internal wrangling would seem like death. Labour's tribulations in the 1980s appear more dated than Lloyd George's selling of honours. So although Love And Reason portrays a world we have lived in, it feels utterly old fashioned and remote. It should surely not be asking too much for British television to offer us, in addition to an avalanche of American material and all those steam train romances, some drama that engages us in the world where we now live. Wide Eyed and Legless was a good, indeed excellent, start, but much more will be needed if this autumn season is to be a memorable one.</p>

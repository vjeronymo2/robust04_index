			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Chamber of Deputies headquarters today the  leaders of the parliamentary political parties belonging to the  Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] held a meeting that was  also attended by CDR Chairman University Professor Emil  Constantinescu. The communique issued after the conclusion of  their meeting points out that considering that until now no  direct answer has been received from Romania's president in  connection with the request to present his stance in Parliament,  the gathering of signatures of CDR parliamentary representatives  is progressing to begin the procedure of suspending President  Iliescu from his office.    The communique also says that depending on the way debates  on  the education draft bill and the draft bill on the restitution  of nationalized dwellings continue in Parliament, the CDR will  decide whether it is opportune to commence a parliamentary  strike.    According to our correspondent Ioana Perdichi, during  today's  meeting they also agreed that a censure motion against the  government should be introduced during the current parliament.  They also sanctioned the draft of the censure motion text,  which is to be submitted for discussion during the bilateral  talks to be held with the Democratic Party [PD].    The parliamentary groups of the CDR and the PD held a met  this afternoon and elaborated the joint action strategy of the  opposition. They decided to continue to gather signatures for  the procedure to suspend President Ion Iliescu from his office  and agreed -- in case the president explicitly rejects the idea  of giving explanations in Parliament -- to actually begin the  aforementioned procedure.    Regarding the censure motion, the leaders of the opposition  parliamentary factions agreed that a censure motion should be  introduced against the activity of the government, worked out  the text of the motion, and agreed that the document is to be  forwarded to the competent parliament bodies after the necessary  number of signatures is gathered.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Kohl tries to stir CDU fighting spirit: Chancellor launches offensive against SPD in election marathon Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany sought yesterday to galvanise his ruling Christian Democratic Union out of pre-election pessimism and to take the offensive against the opposition Social Democratic party. With an hour-long exhortation to the party faithful, abandoning his usual careful text and speaking off the cuff, he accused his opponents of threatening to take Germany back into isolation at the heart of Europe, unable to play its full role on the international stage. He stepped up his campaign against the opposition for allegedly preparing to recognise East German citizenship in the mid-1980s, a move which would have undermined the entire process towards unification, he said. He warned that the real alternative to the present ruling liberal-conservative coalition was a 'red-green' coalition between the SPD and the Green party, which would make Germany unpredictable and drive away investors. It was a personal tour de force to revive the spirits of his CDU, facing a string of election setbacks before the national poll in October. It earned the Chancellor a seven-minute standing ovation from an audience desperate for the prospect of a political revival. The three-day party conference in Hamburg is supposed to approve a weighty new party programme, called Freedom and Responsibility, as the foundation of its cam-paign through no fewer than 19 elections in the next eight months. Yet Mr Kohl's speech contained no programme: it was rather a presentation of his own personality, as the chancellor who delivered unification and who had come to enjoy the trust of states-men throughout the world, as the key to an election victory. He insisted that he was fighting for outright victory, but on the platform of the present coalition. He denounced those who were already arguing in favour of a 'grand coalition' with the SPD. It was a speech overwhelmingly about foreign policy, and his own role in promoting European union, to which he restated his absolute commitment. He denounced attempts to water down the party's European policy, and remove its commitment to a 'federal' future for the European Union. He insisted that German unification had proved possible only as the counterpart of European union. It was Germany's unshakeable commitment to European integration which had persuaded its European partners, as well as Russia and the US, to back the process of German unification. 'The Social Democrats want to lead our country back to isolation,' he said. 'But isolation must never again become a concept in German history.' It was a speech to inspire the party faithful, dispirited by election setbacks last year in Hamburg, where the CDU dropped 10 percentage points to only 25 per cent support, and in Brandenburg in east Germany, where it dropped to third place, behind the former communist party. It was still not enough to head off some sharp criticism from the floor, with speakers demanding more policies to attract young voters, more to counter the opposition's accusations that the government is determined to dismantle the welfare state, and more to woo back the disenchanted voters of eastern Germany. But it was just enough to get that standing ovation, and that was what Mr Kohl required for the television cameras yesterday.</p>

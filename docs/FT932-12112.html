			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (8): Civic pride that survived the devastation of war - Stuttgart and Karlsruhe BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG did not come into existence until 1952, created by the merger of three smaller states occupied after the war by French and US forces, writes DAVID WALLER. The state's three largest cities - Stuttgart, Mannheim and Karlsruhe - all have the distinction of once having been state capitals (of Wurttemberg, the Palatinate and Baden respectively.) The three towns were bombed heavily during the war, with the result that little of the historical city-centres remain. But regional pride - and regional rivalries - are still sharply defined. STUTTGART, state capital of Baden-Wurttemberg, is at the heart of what the locals call Swabia, a region which is more than just the geographical area of Wurttemberg in the eastern part of the state - or indeed of the ancient Duchy of Swabia. It also describes a state of mind - one which has helped Baden-Wurttemberg develop into the prosperous region that it is today. The Swabians are the Scots of Germany - invariably Protestant, they are frugal, work hard and like accumulating capital. Gifted engineers and mechanics, 'they believe that if they should do something they should do it right,' says Mr Manfred Rommel, Mayor of Stuttgart. He says that it is no accident that Hegel, the inventor of dialectical philosophy, was born in the city: 'Swabians have their heads filled with all sorts of incompatible ideas which they struggle to reconcile with one another.' Passionately independent, they also love red-tape which creates a race of what Rommel calls 'frustrated bureaucrats'. Today's Swabians may still combine a job in one of the Mercedes factories with a little vineyard in the hills surrounding Stuttgart. When they have tired of work they can take advantage of the city's rich cultural life: Stuttgart's theatres, concert-halls and especially its world-famous ballet under Marcia Haydee and Richard Cragun are booked out for months in advance. KARLSRUHE, the former capital of Baden, was founded only in 1715 when a certain Margrave Charles of Baden-Durlach built a palace there to escape his wife and entertain his mistresses. It still retains a relaxed atmosphere, which owes as much to its historical origins as to its proximity to the French border. After the war it was made home to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, but this has not dispelled resentment toward the state government in Stuttgart. Karlsruhe likes to see itself as Baden-Wurttemberg's technological centre. It benefited from the activist investment policies promoted by Mr Lothar Spath, Baden-Wurttemberg's prime minister until January last year, which helped to endow it with a wealth of scientific bodies.</p>

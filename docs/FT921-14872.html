			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Demand for credit shrinks as consumers repay debt THE RELUCTANCE of British consumers to borrow, reflected in official figures released yesterday, underlines expectations of a slow economic recovery. Demand for credit shrank in the three months to November, when consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 216m. This compared with net borrowings of Pounds 183m in the previous three months. In November, the latest monthly figure available, consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 33m on credit agreements with finance houses, building societies, and on bank credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system. This followed a net repayment of Pounds 76m in October. According to the seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office, November was the fourth successive month in which consumers made a net repayment. The previous increase in outstanding credit was in July when consumers added Pounds 187m to their overall debts. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers in November was Pounds 3.74bn  -the lowest since June. In October new credit advanced was Pounds 4bn. Consumers, chastened by rising unemployment and high interest rates, appear to be making the repayment of expensive debts accrued in the 1980s a priority. Although the low credit figures are bad news for the government, which is hoping for a consumer-led recovery, government ministers will have been heartened by a small upwards revision in retail sales volumes for November. Revised figures for retail sales in November, seasonally adjusted, showed a 1.3 per cent increase on October. However, in the three months to November the volume of retail sales was down 0.3 per cent on the previous three months. Household goods, which are particularly sensitive indicators of consumer confidence, were down 2 per cent on the previous three months, while clothing and footwear were down by 3 per cent. Lack of consumer confidence was further highlighted by the figures for credit card debt where the amount outstanding increased by Pounds 50m in November against Pounds 69m in October. In the three months to November the amount outstanding increased by only Pounds 45m, compared with an increase of Pounds 173m in the previous three months. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in London, said he expected to see the emphasis on paying off debts continue into this year. 'Consumer spending is being maintained by the run down of personal sector bank deposits rather than through increased borrowing,' he said. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said economists were taking a very cautious view of consumer spending, and consequently revising their GDP forecasts downwards.</p>

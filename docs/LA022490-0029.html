			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> THREE COUNTY TEAMS SHOOTING FOR SUCCESSFUL SEMIFINAL DEBUTS  </P> <P> The Ocean View, La Quinta and Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball teams will find  themselves in unfamiliar positions when the Southern Section playoffs continue  Saturday night: Each will be making the school's first appearance in the girls'  playoff semifinals.  </P> <P> Ocean View (26-2) will play Buena (25-0) in a 5-A game at Ventura High School;  La Quinta (25-3) will meet Palm Desert (25-2) in a 4-A game at College of the  Desert, and Rancho Alamitos (20-3) will play San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande  High School.  </P> <P> Ocean View, the fourth-seeded team in the 5-A division, faces a difficult task  for several reasons. Buena, the top-seeded team in 5-A, has plenty of playoff  experience. Last year, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals. They have been  semifinalists four times before in the 4-A division, finalists five times,  champions in 1979 and '84 and state champions in Division I in '83 and '84.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs have advanced to the playoffs in each of Coach Joe Vaughan's 16  years. Vaughan has the best record (351-29) in the state among girls' coaches.  </P> <P> Buena has lost only twice at home in the past 10 years, to Santa Barbara two  seasons ago and to state champion Brea-Olinda last season.  </P> <P> The good news for Ocean View is that although the game is a home game for  Buena, at least it won't be played in Buena's gym. All semifinal games are at  alternate sites. The game will be played at Ventura High School.  </P> <P> Ocean View has a definite height advantage with 6-2, 185-pound Jennifer  Sullivan (17.4 ppg, 14.6 rebounds) and 5-11 Tracy Wolfe (13.3 ppg, 9.5  rebounds).  </P> <P> In the 4-AA:  </P> <P> Ventura (18-9) vs Loara (16-10) at Savanna High School -- Loara has come on  strong in the playoffs, upsetting Mission Viejo in the quarterfinals and  second-seeded Woodbridge in the second round. Loara is led by 6-1 junior center  Tracy Titus (16.6 ppg, 10.9 rebounds). Jennifer Leonard, Liz Redman and Kristin  Thibodeau provided strong support, and senior guard Lisa Nakazono runs the  point.  </P> <P> Ventura, like Loara, is unseeded. The Cougars upset third-seeded Westlake in  the second round before eliminating Edison. They are led by 5-7 junior guard  Cori Herman (16.45 ppg), an adept three-point shooter, and 5-9 sophomore  forward Denise Rea (9.5 ppg).  </P> <P> In the 4-A:  </P> <P> La Quinta (25-3) vs Palm Desert (25-2) at College of the Desert -- La Quinta  has dominated the not-so-tough Garden Grove League, winning nine straight  titles. But in the past, the Aztecs have faltered when they met tougher  competition in the playoffs.  </P> <P> Not so this season.  </P> <P> The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia (33.4 ppg, 11.8 rebounds), a 6-1  guard-forward-center who last year led the state in scoring. Heather Brannan, a  5-11 senior forward, averages 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Palm Desert starts a good-sized lineup including leading scorers  Tisa Read (5-10) and Brenda Joyce (5-10) each of whom average about 12 points.  Senior guard Christie Dammer, whom coach Randy Housken calls the best defensive  guard in Southern California, will attempt to stop Jalewalia.  </P> <P> In the 3-AA:  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda (28-0) vs Alemany (20-6) at Esperanza High School -- Top-seeded  Brea-Olinda has trounced two playoff opponents. The Lady Cats, the defending  division champions, are led by state player of the year Aimee McDaniel and  all-state guard Tammy Blackburn.  </P> <P> Alemany, the fourth-seeded team in the division, is led in scoring by 5-2  sophomore Rachel Corelli (10 ppg).  </P> <P> Palos Verdes (26-4) vs. Estancia (14-12) at University High School -- Unseeded  Estancia has come on strong in the playoffs, upsetting third-seeded Lompoc in  the quarterfinals, thanks to a school-record 42-point performance by junior  guard Melody Earle.  </P> <P> Patrice Lumpkin, a 5-10 forward, averages 12.6 points a game. Forward Monique  Sweet also provides some solid play.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes has won the Bay League title and reached the playoffs the past  three seasons, advancing to the 4-A semifinals last year. The Sea Kings have a  definite height advantage with three starters at least 6 feet tall.  </P> <P> Lisa Humphreys, a 5-10 senior forward leads the Sea Kings in scoring with 15.2  points.  </P> <P> In the 3-A:  </P> <P> San Dimas (16-6) vs Rancho Alamitos (20-3) at Bolsa Grande High School --  Rancho Alamitos, the top-seeded team in the division, is led by Jenny Newsome,  a 5-9 senior who averages 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. San Dimas relies  heavily on inside scoring, which should contrast strongly with the Vaqueros  up-tempo style.  </P> <P> Natalie Kramer, a 5-11 senior center, and Shelly Baughn a 5-11 junior post  player each average 15 points a game.  </P> <P> South Hills (19-5) vs. Costa Mesa (15-11) at Estancia High School -- Costa Mesa  is undoubtedly the Cinderella team of the division. The unseeded Mustangs were  third in the Pacific Coast League, but they are in the semifinals after  upsetting third-seeded Bellflower convincingly and defeating Notre Dame of  Sherman Oaks in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> The Mustangs are led by Orange County's best freshman -- Olivia DiCamilli.  </P> <P> DiCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds but she's scoring more  points in the playoffs. Junior forward Rachel Ward averages 10.8 points and  senior guard Thuy Nguyen, a three-point threat, averages 11.1 points. Senior  Michele Bryant runs the point and junior Robin Nichols is the fifth starter.  </P> <P> Second-seeded South Hills defeated at-large Yucca Valley by 14 points in the  second round, then edged Cabrillo, another at-large team, by six points in the  quarterfinals.  </P> <P> In the 2-AA:  </P> <P> Santa Ynez Valley (20-3) vs Santa Margarita (20-6) at Saddleback College at 7  p.m. -- Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team in the division, meets its  stiffest competition in top-seeded Santa Ynez Valley.  </P> <P> The Eagles are led by sophomore Kristen Mulligan, the only Santa Margarita  player who averages in double figures (22.1 ppg).  </P> <P> Santa Ynez Valley has plenty of height. Amy Kisling (5-11) leads Santa Ynez  Valley with 14.2 points a game, followed by 5-11 Amy Gillingham (11.2 ppg) and  5-2 Jenifer DeMatteo (11 ppg).  </P></p>

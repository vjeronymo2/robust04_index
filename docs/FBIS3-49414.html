			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Over 2,000 people, many more than planned, took  part in the Komarno mass rally of Zitny Ostrov. [passage  omitted] Evelyn Forro has sent a report from the scene:    [Begin recording] [Forro] [passage omitted] The Hungarian  nationality community in Slovakia considers it indispensable to  its development that its members be able to use their mother  tongue where 10 percent of the population is Hungarian, and  Hungarian should be an official language, together with Slovak,  where they are in the majority. [passage omitted]    At the news conference following the rally, Komarno Mayor  Istvan Pasztor said they are patient. They wish to hold  discussions. If these do not succeed, they will wait for the  next parliament.    At the session, the Hungarian nationality representative of  the Party of the Democratic Left proposed a supplement to the  stance--namely, that the participants should declare that no  danger whatsoever threatens Slovak autonomy, sovereignty, and  the borders. This proposal was not taken into consideration. In  answer to my question at the news conference, the mayor said the  reason they did not vote on it was that, in their view, these  points, in a different formulation, have figured in the stance.    The participants of the Komarno meeting have asked the  Council of Europe to mediate between the Slovak Government and  the Hungarian minority. [end recording]</p>

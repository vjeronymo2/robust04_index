			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["AL-THAWRAH Issues" column by Muhammad 'Ali Buzah: "Going </F> Too Far and the Need for Retaliation"]    [Text] It seems that the massacre perpetrated against the  Palestinian people inside the holy Ibrahimi Mosque last February  was only the beginning. It was another test balloon through  which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the international  community's reaction to and influence on the course of events.  Despite the existing peace process and all attempts at  self-restraint by the Arabs, these events are becoming  increasingly tragic and bloody and -- due to the Israeli policy  -- are placing the region at the point of no return, moving it  toward a catastrophic conflagration that could take place at any  moment.    All news agencies and political observers were unanimous  that  the events that have taken place in Hebron during the past 24  hours and the large-scale Israeli military operations carried  out by thousands of occupation forces -- operations which turned  the city that has been besieged for one month into a battlefield  targeting congested Palestinian areas and in which houses next  to the mosque were destroyed by rockets and anti-tank missiles  -- are a new massacre. These events and military operations show  that last month's massacre was only the beginning and that the  perpetrator is different only in name. There is no difference  between a regular soldier wearing a helmet and an armed settler.  The settlers are the backbone and the reserve of the Israeli  military force; they are also the spearhead and tool of  expansion, aggression, terrorism, and organized crime.    The new massacre in Hebron coincided with the endeavor of  the  Clinton administration, in the form of moves by U.S. coordinator  Dennis Ross in the involved capitals, to activate the peace  process and to give momentum to the obstructed peace process, as  well as in the wake of Security Council Resolution 904. In  addition, the new massacre coincided with the feverish Israeli  military escalation against the cities and villages in southern  Lebanon. Israeli crimes and killings have reached even school  children. All this does not hold out any hope that Israel will  succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect the points of  reference, that it will respect the resolutions of international  legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon belligerence  and racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped  lands and rights.    These events present new evidence of the aggressive nature  rooted deeply in the Zionist strategy and of its impossible  coexistence with peace. These events also emphasize the need to  exert international pressure, to abandon quiet diplomacy, and to  adopt the language of force in order to make the rulers of  Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a  just and comprehensive peace with which all occupation injustice  and evils will end and rights will be returned to their owners.    Israel's practices and continued bloody terrorism have  raised  many important questions regarding peace, its feasibility, and  the credibility of those responsible for implementing the  resolutions of international legitimacy and for maintaining  world peace. Israel's practices and bloody terrorism constitute  a serious threat that needs a firm and swift response from the  international community and the U.S. sponsor -- whose role,  initiative, and interests are being targeted -- to champion  credibility and resolutions that are still being violated openly  so that Israel will not remain above the laws of the  international community and above questioning and punishment.    We do not need to wait longer to see more massacres and  slaughtering by the Tel Aviv rulers who kill every opportunity  for peace. We, as well as the world, want to see the  resolutions of international legitimacy implemented  expeditiously in order to protect and secure the citizens in the  occupied territories. A firm stand should be taken to curb  Israeli aggression and to force it to withdraw from all occupied  Arab territory.</p>

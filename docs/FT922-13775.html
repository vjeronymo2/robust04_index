			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Dr Pepper/Seven-Up set to make share offering DR Pepper/Seven-Up Com-panies, the third largest producer of soft drinks in the US, is planning to float its shares on the stock market. The Dallas-based company said yesterday that in two weeks it intended to file the necessary registration statement for an 'initial public offering' (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog. The proceeds of the offer, which is expected to involve the issue of new shares in the company, would be used to reduce debt and retire preferred stock. The company was formed through the merger of the Dr Pepper holding company and Seven-Up in 1988. The combination created a third force to compete with the two giants of the soft drinks industry, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Dr Pepper and Seven-Up were both purchased in 1986 by separate investment groups, led by the same Dallas-based investment firm. Even prior to the merger, management of the businesses was integrated to some extent, and production centralised. Dr Pepper/Seven-Up currently employs around 905 people and has its production operations in St Louis, although the corporate headquarters is in Dallas. Its turnover last year increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 600.9m, while operating profits were Dollars 138.2m, up 12 per cent on the previous year. Aside from institutional shareholders, who are significant equity-holders, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up's management holds a 19 per cent interest in the company, making it the single largest shareholder at present. Ahead of the filing, the group declined to say how many shares might be issued or what sums it expected to raise.</p>

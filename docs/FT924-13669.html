			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (1): A question of character - Devon's previous over-reliance on agriculture, tourism and defence has been lessened. Improved links with the rest of the UK and Europe are still needed, however, to encourage further investment DEVON has a dilemma. As economic development planning by local authorities and the private sector increasingly extends the employment base away from traditional industries, the problem is how to preserve the county's essential character. A number of influences caused the local economy to prosper in the 1980s: the boom in the UK's national economy; overspill from the overcrowded south east region; an increase in defence spending, and a growing appreciation of the importance, for business location, of a good environment. Changes were launched, seeking to avoid over-reliance on Devon's three staple industries: agriculture, tourism and defence. Substantial successes were achieved, particularly in attracting service industries to the Exeter area and electronics and light engineering to Plymouth. Then came a series of reverses, and pressures on the local economy again increased. The county's primary industries took a hammering; tougher farming and fishing regulations, inaugurated by Brussels, were implemented; tourism patterns changed as more people travelled abroad; big defence cuts were introduced. The 'peace dividend' arising from the end of the cold war, warmly welcomed politically, has meant a steady rundown in defence related industries which are particularly important to Plymouth. Devon has been trying hard to replace these traditional employers, vigorously encouraging inward investment and new business start-ups to create a broader spread of economic activities. Recession has clearly affected the effort, as it has in the rest of the UK. But there are signs that the diversification already achieved has lessened the impact of the recession on Devon. The county should now be well placed to take advantage of any economic upturn. However, there are longer term problems which remain to be solved. A variety of influences are all likely to have a significant impact on the development of the local economy: Devon's geographical position on the UK's southwestern tip; the challenge of competition from the forthcoming Channel tunnel; liberalisation of eastern Europe, with its low wage economies; introduction of the single European market. There is increasing concern that, as the UK integrates more with continental Europe, areas such as Devon might be perceived as being increasingly peripheral - and might lose out accordingly, in terms of new investment and companies relocating to areas closer to - or actually on - the European mainland. The recession has added urgency to the task of reshaping the local economy, now being addressed by both the local authorities and the private sector with a mix of measures designed to ensure that Devon offers the right facilities and employee skills when investment confidence picks up. Mr Richard Clark, chief executive of Devon county council, says: 'We have to maintain the health of our traditional industries but we also need to attract new employers and improve our links with the rest of the UK and Europe.' Mr Clark believes that greatly improved communications, including faster road and rail travel, an excellent education system (the county now has two universities - Exeter, and the recently upgraded polytechnic at Plymouth) and the county's well regarded quality of life will all contribute towards widening its employment base. One difficulty has been that Devon has lacked a consistent voice. A plethora of organisations meant that potential target companies became confused - and the county's message dissipated. Attempts are being made to deal with this criticism by setting up a powerful West Country development agency along the lines of those for Scotland and Wales, charged with devising a single development strategy. Responsibility for promoting and developing the local economy is now spearheaded by the local authorities - which have a reputation for being pro-active - by the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which has responsibility for inward investment from overseas, and by the Devon and Cornwall Training and Enterprise Council (TEC). The TEC, established in 1990 as a private sector body responsible for the local delivery of training and business development initiatives, is one of the biggest in the UK, directing money and expertise into a wide range of services. Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the TEC and managing director of Waterford Crystal, says there are enough people in the area who understand the challenges - and the priority which must be given to creating new jobs. 'We have to stimulate economic development as our number one priority, and that means shouting hard . . . people in the rest of the UK do not always see us as we are. They see a holiday area, and tend to gloss over the problems we face.' There is often less of a problem with potential overseas investors - once the initial perception of Devon on the fringe of Europe has been overcome. Since its inception in 1985, the development bureau has attracted projects creating 3,000 new jobs, and safeguarded 2,000 existing ones. Some important Japanese and US high-tech companies have been enticed into the region, and Mr Ken Martin, chief executive of the bureau, is now setting his sights on Europe - particularly Germany. Relatively few European companies have considered Devon, or, indeed, the south west region, as a UK base. But many jobs are required to make good the current and potential losses from the cutbacks in defence spending. Many parts of the south west, and Plymouth in particular, have suffered significantly; there is little prospect of a reversal. Employment at Devonport dockyard, for example, has slipped steadily from 11,000, when its management was taken over in 1987 by DML, a private consortium, to 5,000. To add to local worries, rumour is rife that nuclear submarine refitting work will be concentrated in future at a single UK yard - Devonport could lose out to its rival, Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Plymouth City Council and local business leaders warn that this would be disastrous for the whole area, resulting in the possible closure of the dockyard, with the knock-on loss of 15,000 jobs among local suppliers. The county council has just applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for the retention of assisted area status for Plymouth and Bude, and for its reintroduction for Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, Bideford, Torbay, and Totnes. Success would bring substantial grants to improve local infrastructure and to attract inward investment - along with the prospect of further grants from the European Community. Devon is primarily a small business economy, with 90 per cent of its companies employing fewer than 10 people. There is also a large degree of self-employment, particularly in agriculture, fishing and tourism. It has been obvious for years that, to take account of changing economic trends, there would have to be substantial shifts in the county's infrastructure. Assisted area status for the less favoured areas would also help a great deal. The enterprise culture of the 1980s has turned sour, and the recession has begun to affect the small business sector especially badly, by sharp increases in business rates, the cutback of capital from traditional lending sources, a reduction in farm incomes and less spending by visitors. The hope is, however, that the recession will be just a temporary blip in the progress made in reducing Devon's dependence on traditional industries. The county's strategy is to plan for growth, targeting industries such as electronics, light engineering, financial services, pharmaceuticals, and health care, which are environmentally friendly and will not mar Devon's many - and much-loved - attractions.</p>

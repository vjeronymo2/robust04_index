			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / This Week: Sport CRICKET: Australia A v England, December 13, Benson &amp; Hedges World Series one-day game, Melbourne. England v Zimbabwe, December 15, in the same series, Sydney. Oh the humiliation should England lose to Australia's 2nd team in Melbourne. FOOTBALL: Draw for the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup and the UEFA Cup, December 14, Geneva. European Championship qualifying matches: Wales v Bulgaria, December 14, and Greece v Scotland, December 18. Chelsea and Arsenal, the last two English clubs left in European competition, will be hoping to avoid each other in the European Cup Winners Cup draw on Wednesday. Good news for Chelsea last week when striker Mark Stein scored in a reserve game against Watford. Stein has been out of action since this year's FA Cup Final. Being English, his return will help Glenn Hoddle's problems with the no-more-than-three-foreign-players European rule when the competition restarts in March. Another Chelsea striker who will be happy is John Spencer, called up for the Scottish squad to face Greece on Saturday. Meanwhile, Wales have enlisted the services of that well-known Welshman Vinny Jones to add some steel to the squad for Wednesday's Bulgaria game.</p>

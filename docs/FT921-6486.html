			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Rise in US orders fails to lift gloom on economy US DURABLE goods orders rebounded last month, but the recovery was not enough to eclipse December's sharp plunge and failed to convince financial markets that any sustained economic recovery was under way. The Department of Commerce said durable goods orders rose 1.5 per cent in January to Dollars 119.6bn, following a 5.1 per cent drop in December. New orders for industrial machinery and equipment gained strongly, climbing 6.3 per cent to Dollars 21.1bn. Orders for transportation equipment rose by 1.2 per cent to Dollars 29.4bn - helped especially by the aircraft sector - while electrical and electronic goods orders fell 4.9 per cent to Dollars 17.4bn, after four consecutive months on the rise. The rebound in durable goods orders exceeded private sector economists' forecasts. However, in conjunction with the previous month's marked decline it provided no conclusive evidence of an economic upturn. Meanwhile, markets remained dazed by Tuesday's dramatic plunge in consumer confidence. The Conference Board, a New York-based business consultancy, announced then that its consumer confidence index had fallen for the fifth month in succession - to its lowest level since 1974. However, Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, said yesterday that the drop in consumer confidence was driven by politics, and that he saw signs of an economic upturn. If the volatile defence sector is excluded, durable goods orders showed a stronger gain in January, rising 3.6 per cent. However, economists noted that the backlog of unfilled orders fell by 0.3 per cent in January to a level 3.7 per cent lower than a year ago. This undermined hopes of a recovery spurred by industrial orders in the pipeline. A Senate committee yesterday voted to give Mr Alan Greenspan a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, despite criticism that he has not done enough to stimulate the economy, Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

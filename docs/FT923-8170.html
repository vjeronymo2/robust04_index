			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Boost for Cardiff docklands NCM CREDIT Insurance, the Dutch company that paid Pounds 70m for the Export Credits Guarantee Department's short-term business last December, is to locate its headquarters in Cardiff's docklands development. It will lease a 115,000 sq ft building being erected by Grosvenor Waterside, property arm of Associated British Ports. As a result of the sale, NCM has had to move out of Crown premises in Cardiff that are open only to government or non-profit-making organisations. NCM's decision means Grosvenor Waterside has attracted two large concerns to its 160-acre development within Cardiff Bay. Last year, the Welsh Health Common Services Authority, a public-sector body, announced that it would take an office block nearby. The NCM decision is a boost for the Cardiff Bay project, set up five years ago to redevelop 2,700 acres of Cardiff's docklands.</p>

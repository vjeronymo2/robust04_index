			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: The Comedians - Theatre What a piece of virtuoso playwriting Trevor Griffiths's The Comedians is. It is a comedy about comedy and comedians, an expose of different kinds of funny men, and a serious play about the values that underlie comedy. Six comics take evening classes in stand-up comedy from old comic Eddie Waters; they do their acts, for an outside judge, before a northern working-men's club audience; and afterwards they hear the results. Though this play dates from 1975, and is about the Britain (the world) we all have known, it still feels like a completely new type of play. The six comics, each completely convincing, give us wholly different 'acts'; and the most masterly - the most truly witty - proves to be the least funny. Sometimes The Comedians reminds me of the way that Shakespeare places a play within a play, telling us about the nature of entertainment, revealing as much about audience as players. But Griffiths's style, overtly addressing moral and sociological issues, is plainly of our time. The fact that he never turns didactic is a sign of his respect for the audience. This is drama that makes sure you do think, but doesn't try telling you what to think; Griffiths is a true artist. Until well into the second half, you still are not sure what sort of play this will turn out to be; it can put a laugh on your face, wipe it straight off, shame you for having laughed in the first place. 'One of the virtues of having a system of values,' said Virginia Woolf, 'is that you know exactly what to laugh at.' Griffiths makes you question your values by questioning your laughter. This production, deriving from Leeds's excellent West Yorkshire Playhouse, is directed by Jude Kelly - currently the Playhouse's artistic director and formerly director of the National Theatre of Brent. Every switch of tone, every nuance, makes its effect, and the casting is flawless. My only cavil would be that a few patches in the classroom scenes are played too slow and heavy, whereas more speed and lightness would make them more funny, more natural and just as telling. A few of the pauses and crescendi in the final scene, conceived for theatrical/expressive force, lack the truthfulness the play is talking about. As the most audacious of the student comics, Gethin, Tim McInnerny - so versatile an actor - shows the killer instinct of the true virtuoso. Anyone who has seen this actor will know that he has an exceptionally long neck (as Sir Andrew Aguecheek with the RSC last year, he looked, with his long blond wig, like Alice shooting up to a new height), and here that neck, turning suddenly in mid-act, can have a brilliantly deadly effect. He makes Gethin's rage, his alertness, his northern accent, his mime and verbal skills all utterly real. But this is an ensemble performance, and every role is beautifully played. None is funnier than Willie Ross as the tired old club secretary. (His toupee alone deserves a medal.) But he and all his colleagues show that being funny is secondary to being honest. Here is a marvellous production of one of the very finest plays of the last 20 years.</p>

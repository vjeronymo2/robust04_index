			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAITS OF TWO ARTISTS;  </P> <P> PRESENT AND PAST;  </P> <P> HENRIETTA SHORE;  </P> <P> A RETURN FROM OBSCURITY  </P> <P> Henrietta Shore is back. Sort of.  </P> <P> In 1986, about a quarter-century after the artist had died penniless and  forgotten in a San Jose sanitarium at the age of 83, Shore was the subject of a  full retrospective of paintings, drawings and prints at the little Monterey  Peninsula Museum of Art in Northern California. (She had moved from Los Angeles  to Carmel in 1930.)  </P> <P> Subsequently that exhibition traveled south, without fanfare, to the Laguna Art  Museum, where it was seen by Michael Quick and Ilene Ford, curators at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art who last year acquired two pictures by the artist  for the museum's collection of American painting and sculpture.  </P> <P> And finally, the Turner Dailey Gallery on Beverly Boulevard is currently  showing 15 paintings, nine lithographs and six pencil drawings -- the first  gallery presentation of Shore's art in 39 years.  </P> <P> If this modest but nonetheless noteworthy spurt of activity doesn't exactly  seem to constitute a tidal wave of enthusiasm and acclaim, that depends on what  you're comparing it to. Weighed against the voluble fanfare surrounding Georgia  O'Keeffe -- the painter (or should I say saint?) whose name is most often  murmured in the vicinity of Shore's radiant, and frankly strange, floral  paintings -- these recent developments hardly register at all. Yet, compared to  the near total obscurity in which Henrietta Shore has languished since before  World War II, they add up to a veritable tsunami.  </P> <P> Who was Henrietta Shore? The question is not so simple as it seems. This  largely unknown artist turns out to be something of a paradigm for an entire  era in modern American art.  </P> <P> Her biography certainly can be sketched with relative ease. Born in Toronto in  1880, the seventh and youngest child of a comfortable bourgeois family, she  went to New York at 20 to study painting with society painter William Merritt  Chase. The apprenticeship was brief. Soon she switched to more rigorous and  demanding classes with Robert Henri, whose admonitions to paint from the  immediate world at hand would mark Shore's art for the rest of her life.  </P> <P> Following a "grand tour" of European capitals and a stint at a London art  school, Shore joined her brother and his wife on an extended journey to  California in 1913. (Her departure meant that, by a few short months, she  missed seeing New York's landmark exhibition of European modern art, the Armory  Show.) In Los Angeles she decided to set up a studio, exhibited her work  wherever she could and helped to found the Los Angeles Modern Art Society. She  stayed for seven years.  </P> <P> In 1920, just as women in the United States finally got the vote, Shore  returned to the East and co-organized the New York Society of Women Artists.  (She also became an American citizen.) Missing California, she returned to Los  Angeles in 1923 and stayed another seven years, eventually moving to the  Monterey Peninsula, where she worked until the beginning of the war.  </P> <P> Through middle age Shore enjoyed at least a modest success. She won prizes,  garnered gallery and museum shows on both coasts (and one in London) and was  the subject of a small, 1933 monograph with essays by the impresario Merle  Armitage, San Diego Fine Arts Gallery director Reginald Poland and, most  notably, her colleague and friend, the photographer Edward Weston.  </P> <P> From 1939 on, details are sketchy. Although Shore lived for another 24 years,  no postwar paintings by her hand are recorded with any certainty, and the  circumstances surrounding her commitment to a sanitarium in the late 1950s are  vague. Whatever the facts, her quiet brand of modernist easel painting was  emphatically swept away in the years following the war, by the arrival of New  York School abstraction and its West Coast variants. Outside the narrow realm  of occasional academic research, we've seen neither hide nor hair of it since.  </P> <P> Until lately. The return of Henrietta Shore is by no means complete, but that  it's happening at all deserves a careful hearing.  </P> <P> Together, the two paintings at LACMA and the exhibition at Turner Dailey reveal  a typically provincial artist of undeniable skill who worked hard, blossomed  late and was possessed of occasional flashes of dazzling brilliance.  </P> <P> Shore did not begin to come into her own as a painter until she was about 40,  while two-thirds of the 15 paintings in the gallery exhibition were made in the  decades before (only five are dated after 1920). Portrait studies such as  "Meditating," circa 1910, and "On the Street" -- undated, but redolent of  Robert Henri and the cheery grime of his so-called Ash Can School aesthetic --  are prosaic examples of period style, as are the few conventional landscapes in  the show. By sharp contrast, the 1929 "California Cactus" is an exquisitely  riveting picture.  </P> <P> Except for a late cycle of murals, all Shore's work is small. "California  Cactus" is no exception, but it's nonetheless powerful for it. Against a  shallow ocher ground, two flame-tipped succulents and a pair of leafy stems  fill the space, rather like animated pinwheels. One cactus, reserved and  demurely elegant, is shown in upward-reaching profile at the rear, while the  second, showier plant is rendered frontally, as if it had somehow miraculously  turned to meet the spectator's advancing gaze.  </P> <P> Through carefully modulated tones, the leaves of this latter cactus get  progressively brighter and more radiant as they approach both the frontal plane  of the picture's  </P> <P> space and the center of the plant; there, at the compositional nucleus, an  eye-shaped bud of golden hue stares resolutely back. A nearby pair of sinuous  tendrils, which occupy the foreground between the painting's unblinking "eye"  and our own, begins to register an aura of exploratory searching. These  California cactuses may be mundane desert plants, but Shore has masterfully  orchestrated them to exude a numinous quality of bristling, sentient awareness.  </P> <P> Shore was by no means a prolific artist. In her mature work she painted slowly,  laying on oil colors -- green, violet, orange, magenta, cerulean -- in thin,  carefully built up, seemingly brushless glazes. Reflected through transparent  color, light seems magically to glow from within the deepest recesses of the  canvas. This extraordinary quality of illumination connects her to, on one  hand, the conservative and fashionable plein-air landscape painters of the day,  and, on the other, to progressive photographers such as her friend Weston.  While her best paintings blew away the mawkishly nostalgic revery of so-called  California Impressionism, they productively engaged in rigorous dialogue with  Weston's luminous photographs.  </P> <P> At LACMA, the abstraction called "Life" (circa 1921) shows how downright  peculiar Shore's visionary images could certainly be. This vertical canvas  features two jack-in-the-pulpit-like forms, from which emerge white,  streamlined, faceless bodies, one male and the other female. In the gray field  between them arises a dark blue, biomorphic form (imagine the shape of an  attenuated peanut). This blue shape, which flickers between being a negative  space and a positive form, erotically suggests both a cave-like opening and a  swelling tumescence.  </P> <P> "I have worked to develop the gift of understanding of nature," Shore wrote to  her brother, Egerton, in an inscription inside a copy of her monograph, "that I  might best use that gift through my drawing and painting to express the love  received from and given to God." The painting, "Life," employs modernist  devices to fashion an abstracted depiction of Adam and Eve.  </P> <P> Any understanding of Henrietta Shore and her art must take into account another  peculiar feature of this odd canvas, which seems to me decisive. The male  figure in the picture emerges from a cuplike stem, or calyx, which grows rather  awkwardly from an unseen place off the right edge of the canvas. By stark  contrast, both the female calyx and the central blue "spirit" grow directly  from an organic, abstract, red-orange shape, which is centrally placed and  certainly reminiscent of the floating leaf of a waterlily.  </P> <P> Indeed, a lily pad it may well be. (At Turner Dailey there's a small, handsome  lithograph of a waterlily, dating from the end of the decade.) But I looked at  this odd shape for a long while before I realized what else it resembles.  Unlike Adam, the abstracted figures of both Eve and the "spirit" are growing  from an old-fashioned painter's palette.  </P> <P> The fundamentally modernist idea that a painter could invent herself through  art became the pivotal realization for Henrietta Shore's work. Likewise, that a  woman could invent herself through art was the pivotal realization for  Henrietta Shore's life.  </P> <P> Shore's birth in 1880 had placed her, as a woman and as a painter, at a  decisive juncture in American society. By the end of the century, full-scale  industrialization was rapidly transforming women from robust producers into  passive consumers, while art -- the human ability to make things -- was  metamorphosing into leisure. Together, these twin developments caused the very  idea of painting to be feminized. In the mind of mainstream America, art of any  kind was becoming a less than manly thing to do.  </P> <P> The fact of Henrietta Shore's gender is of course the central reason for her  almost total obscurity today, just as it was basic to the cruel poverty and  suffering she was to experience in her own lifetime. The trauma of the  Depression generated a reactionary, no doubt inevitable elevation of artistic  traits associated with stereotypical masculinity, which re-emerged in the  postwar years as the "dynamism," "muscularity" and "action" of Abstract  Expressionism. The woman from California was swept into oblivion.  </P> <P> Shore's "Life" is certainly not among the greatest modern pictures of its time,  nor could it even be claimed among the handful of the artist's most  accomplished works. Those would come later, in stunning canvases such as  "California Cactus" and "Gloxinia by the Sea." (The latter I've seen only in  reproduction, but if this painting from the early 1930s is even half as  impressive in person as in a photograph, it ranks as Shore's consummate  masterwork.) Still, the historical significance of "Life" is equally certain --  especially for a city and a country whose artists have played an influential  role in framing feminist cultural issues since the 1960s.  </P> <P> This peculiar painting is also among the first direct pieces of evidence of the  full spread of early modernism into the provincial culture that was the United  States circa 1920. Furthermore, it's as clear a testament as could be imagined  to the utterly indivisible relationship between modernist artistic principles  and progressive social thought. The painting's new public home at LACMA, which  signals at least the nominal return of Henrietta Shore, couldn't be more  meaningful.  </P></p>

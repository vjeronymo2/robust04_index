			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Radio 1 promotion policy is defended THE BBC yesterday rejected claims from commercial stations that Radio 1 was breaching its licence by running extensive promotions with the record industry and other companies. 'There are strict guidelines about retaining editorial control, and we are completely clean,' the BBC said, although it admitted that Radio 1 'pushed to the limits of the guidelines'. The Association of Independent Radio Companies has written to the BBC and the Department of National Heritage claiming that outside companies have spent Pounds 1m a year on promotions with Radio 1 in return for publicity about their products. Commercial stations claim the promotions are a form of cross-subsidisation, with money earned through them being used to finance other BBC programmes. Radio 1 said yesterday none of its promotions violated its licence and denied the allegations of cross-subsidisation. The BBC said on-air promotions, such as competitions to win trips to meet bands, were 'editorially valid' and always involved popular bands which would be receiving Radio 1 airplay in any case - although the station admitted that the bands' records were likely to be played when a competition was promoted.</p>

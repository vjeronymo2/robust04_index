			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fu Jian: "State Lightens Burden of Farmers"] </F>   [Text] Unfair financial burdens of farmers have been  reduced since the central government tightened its control over  random charges last year but there is still some way to go  before the problem is completely resolved.    Following measures taken by the state, illegal levies and  labour duties imposed on farmers dropped for the first time last  year since the mid-1980's, according to the State Statistics  Bureau (SSB) and the Ministry of Agriculture.    Illegal levies--including various kinds of committee  charges,  administrative fees, and fines--dropped from 12.4 billion yuan  ($1.4 billion) in 1991 to 7 billion yuan ($804 million) last  year. Labour duties dropped to a maximum of 20 working days for  the average individual farmer.    Fees imposed on farmers for "collective funds"--to pay for  administration costs and welfare projects--declined from more  than 7 percent to 5 percent of farmers' income, the legal figure  stipulated by the central government in 1991.    In total, the reforms cut farmers' tax bills and fees by 1.2  yuan ($0.14) last year, a 2.5 percent reduction. At the same  time, farmers' per capita income in 1993 rose 14 percent,  reaching 921 yuan ($106), according to the SSB.    Before last year's reform, farmers had to spend 5 to 8  percent of their income on illegal charges, according to a  national survey by the Ministry of Agriculture. Their tax  payments totalled 10 per cent.    "Farmers have contributed a great deal to the nation's  economy but they have not received their due share of rewards,"  said Li Xiangang, division chief with the Department of Rural  Co-operative Economy under the Agricultural Ministry.    For years, the government's allocations, investment and  price  policies had focused on industrialization instead of agriculture.  <H5>  Disadvantage </H5>   Economic reform has delivered higher income to farmers since  the early 1980's, but much of that has been offset by various  levies imposed simultaneously. This has left farmers with a  sharp disadvantage in the distribution of national wealth.    Many local governments demanded collective funds exceeding  the stipulated maximum 5 percent rate. Many collected extra  fees for constructing public welfare projects, although the  farmers had already paid collective funds for them. In some  areas, farmers used to have as many as 130 different fees and  taxes to pay.    Illegal financial burdens have taken much away from farmers'  funds that could have been used to finance farm work. This has  disrupted normal agricultural production. In some areas, taxes  and fees intensified the contradiction between farmers and local  leaders.    The State Council passed an urgent circular early last year  to have local governments eliminate unfair levies imposed on  farmers. Officials from the State Council, State Planning  Commission, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, and  Ministry of Supervision checked all state documents on fee  collecting from farmers to see if they were legal.    Following the survey, the State Council cancelled 80 levies  and modified another 24 last July.    Similar examinations of local government documents involving  financial charges imposed on farmers have since been conducted  nationwide.    By the end of 1993, the items cancelled by central and  provincial governments reduced the total burden by 10 billion  yuan ($1.1 billion) nationwide, or 10.28 yuan ($1.18) for each  farmer, according to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture.    Cutting fees, however, does not remove the root of the  problem, said Li.    "If local governments' motivation for collecting excess  levies is not eliminated, illegal burdens may worsen again in  coming years," he said.    Local officials' achievements have been assessed mainly by  counting their regions' total output value, or the number of  construction projects completed, encouraging local authorities  to emphasize local industries, instead of agriculture. This  naturally resulted in the collection of funds from farmers for  industrial projects. If the evaluation system remains  unchanged, excessive levies in the countryside cannot be cured.    Statistics from the SSB also show that most farmers worry  about a renewed increase in illegal levies this year. Besides,  the invisible burden of the price scissors--the gap between  administratively imposed high prices for industrial products and  low agricultural goods--also constricts farmers. Agricultural  experts say it is crucial for the nation to reform systems for  redistribution and investment.    Chen Jiyuan, director of the Rural Development Institute  under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that national  policies for fiscal expenditures and wealth redistributing  should place greater emphasis on agriculture.    "Agriculture needs more investments," he said. "The prices  of  farm products should be increased while those of agricultural  machinery and fertilizers should be dropped."    The government has made some efforts to narrow the price  scissors. During the last 10 years the government has  substantially increased the prices of farm products three times.  The most recent one was implemented on June 10.    Both Li and Chen suggested that local cadres should be  evaluated according to more realistic figures, such as regional  grain output and farmers living standards.    Efforts should also be made to help strengthen the farmer's  abilities to protect themselves, said Li.    Many farmers have followed every requirement of their local  officials. They are unable to judge whether requirements are  legal or not.    The central government issued a regulation on the farmers'  charges and labour duties in 1991, stipulating that the total  amount of collective funds imposed on the farmers should not be  more than 5 percent of their previous year's total income.    But as much as 43 per cent of farmers in Northwest China's  Shaanxi Province know nothing about the regulation, according to  an SSB sample survey. About one-third of them do not know that  they can reject fines unless proper legal papers are provided.    Farmers should be better informed, said Li.    The Agricultural Ministry plans to broaden public  understanding of the nation's legal requirements.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: HK securities house disciplined PEREGRINE Investments, the Hong Kong-listed pan-Asian securities business, has been disciplined by the colony's stock market regulators for misconduct concerning three flotations handled by the company. Peregrine, which last year purchased 24 per cent of UK fund management group, Invesco MIM, has rapidly emerged as the largest independent merchant banking group in Hong Kong. It has strong commercial and equity links to some of the colony's leading businessmen, such as Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Gordon Wu and Citic's Mr Larry Yung. A public reprimand was yesterday delivered to Peregrine's broking arm over activities in the shares of three companies floated by the group's merchant bank. The Securities and Futures Commission also expressed concern that the listing rules had been breached in two of these flotations, where Peregrine failed to ensure that 25 per cent of the companies' shares were placed in public hands. The SFC published three specific allegations against Peregrine Brokerage. It was accused of: engaging in stock trading 'which was likely to be prejudicial to the interests of the investing public'; contributing to a restricted free-float in the shares of three newly-listed companies; and failing to adequately monitor client trading activities. Peregrine's dealing director, Mr Jimmy Pang, has had his licence suspended for 2 1/2 years, and fellow director Mr Peter Wong has also been publicly reprimanded. Mr Pang has left the group. Peregrine agreed to pay HKDollars 3.5m (USDollars 452,000) to a stock exchange compensation fund, 'in recognition of the SFC's concerns about the three areas of misconduct'. It also said it had taken steps to avoid repetition of 'these problems'.</p>

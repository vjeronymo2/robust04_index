			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Those Who Are Rumored To Have </F> Exercised Behind-the-Scenes Leadership in the Motorola Case,  Which Was Settled by Japan's Greater-Than-Necessary Concession"]    [Test] The Japan-U.S. dispute over U.S. access to the  Japanese cellular phone market was settled after the Japanese  side made a considerable concession. The cellular phone trade  agreement included a private-level accord between Motorola Inc.  and the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation [Japan Mobile  Communications Corporation] (IDO) and a separate  government-to-government accord. IDO has committed itself to  building many relay stations to expand its Motorola-system  cellular telephone network, while the Japanese Government has  pledged to "make the utmost efforts to support the completion of  IDO's commitments." IDO is expected to receive financial  assistance from its main shareholders, the Toyota Motor  Corporation and the Tokyo Electric Power Company.    How did it come about that Japan "has lavished hospitality"  on the United States by making the maximum concessions?    "Ichiro Ozawa was the key man," a government source said. He  confirmed that Ozawa was in constant contact with U.S.  Ambassador Walter Mondale to find some way out of the difficulty  while the negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Posts  and Telecommunications and the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative were making no progress.    The explanation given by the government source was as  follows: "Amid the disturbance caused by the announcement of a  tax-reform plan to replace the 3-percent consumption tax with a  7-percent national welfare tax, Ozawa assured Ambassador Mondale  that Japan will first carry out income tax cuts for three  consecutive years and increase other taxes later. However in  the end, it was definitely decided to limit the income tax cut  to one year, and Ambassador Mondale was greatly embarrassed by  Ozawa's misjudgment. So, Ozawa managed to square himself with  Ambassador Mondale by paving the way for a major concession to  the U.S. demand for comparable access to Japan's cellular  telephone market."    Some people advocate a contrary opinion, saying, "It is a  total overestimation to think that Ozawa has such influence."  Another government source disclosed that "What was decisive in  this case was Toyota's intention, rather than Ozawa's."    "Toyota, which is a major shareholder in the mobile phone  company, feared that if Japan did not yield a single point in  the cellular phone case, the friction in such sectors as  automobiles and auto parts might increase when the bilateral  trade framework negotiations resume. This is why the automaker  has strongly pressured IDO into making the maximum concessions  to the U.S. demand."    In any case, everyone is of the same opinion that a  "high-level political decision" occurred in the settling of the  dispute. For the United States, the cellular phone accord means  that the Japanese Government has guaranteed to the United States  access to the Japanese market.    This is no more than managed trade, and there is a good  possibility that the United States might ask to spread the  Motorola-type deal to other sectors. The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has deplored the cellular phone  agreement, saying, "Seen from a strategic point of view, Japan  made a big mistake that will form a source for future trouble."  What it says sounds right.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners and losers . . . The winners are qualifying investors who opened accounts before the end of 1992 (and maintain them until the completion date), children and trustees, who had been excluded first time round. Losers are borrowers and savers who opened accounts after 1992. Because far fewer people qualify, they will receive more. Investors - savers who are members of the society - will get, for each account, around 13 per cent of the balance and, if they have more than Pounds 100 at the end of December this year, a flat-rate payment of Pounds 500, up to a maximum of Pounds 13,500 for each account. Depositors will get similar amounts. The average payment to an individual will be about Pounds 2,000; payments are expected to be taxed as capital gain. If the balance on a share account was higher on April 20 than on March 31 this year, the percentage payout will be based on the lower balance of April 20 or completion day. Similarly, those who had a higher balance on March 31 will be paid 13 per cent on the lower balance of that day or completion day. Those with joint share accounts will not qualify for payment if the sole or first-named account holder died/dies between December 31 1992 and completion day, unless the surviving account holder qualifies in their own right on another account. Holders of Pibs and C&amp;G Channel Island accounts will get Pounds 500 and the 13 per cent.</p>

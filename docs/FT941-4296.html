			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mucklow rises to Pounds 5.28m and sees improvement A&amp;J Mucklow Group, the West Midlands property development and investment company, announced a marked increase in occupancy rates in the six months to December 31, along with an 8 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 5.28m. The company experienced a slight improvement in market conditions, according to Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman, and succeeded in letting 245,000 sq ft of its record 1.32m sq ft of vacant property, during the period. The company is also proceeding with its development programme, and has completed the 60,000 sq ft second phase of its Wednesbury development, of which two-thirds has been pre-let to the Post Office. Mr Mucklow said the pick up in the property market was at an early stage and 'there will be an inevitable time-lag before improving conditions are reflected in profits'. Net asset value per share was 145p at December 31, compared with 144p six months earlier, but this does not include any revaluation of its properties. Brokers estimate a year-end figure of about 165p. During the interim period, the company paid Pounds 1.14m for the purchase of freeholds on two leasehold properties, and raised Pounds 3.15m from the sale of a Weybridge office block, which represented a surplus over the June 1993 book value of Pounds 340,000. Operating profit on continuing operations rose from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 8.64m, because of a marginal increase in rental income, and a fall in operating expenses. An interim dividend of 3.0515p (2.9625p) is declared. Earnings per share amounted to 3.77p, compared with 3.3p.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (5): Sense of unease stalks the streets - Karachi's rapid expansion has produced ethnic tensions When an army jeep speeds through Liaquatabad market in Karachi, a machine gun jutting out across the bonnet, the crowds barely give it a second glance. After more than two years on the city's streets, army patrols have become a fact of life in Pakistan's commercial capital. But they have not brought peace. Since the beginning of the year about 500 people have died, mostly in gun-battles between rival armed gangs and the security forces. About 200 have died since early September. In one incident this month, a leading local politician was killed with his wife, sister-in-law and infant son, when gunmen sprayed their car with bullets. The next day, eight people were killed and 40 injured in revenge attacks and counter-attacks. Karachi is not a city in flames. In much of the sprawling metropolis of 12m, there are no signs of violence. During the day, the soldiers try to be discreet. Their patrols come out in force only at night, when the gunmen are also most active. Yet a deep sense of unease stalks Karachi. 'There is a feeling of uncertainty. A lot of people say that in the 1970s this was a wonderful place to live. They don't say that any more,' says Mr Suhail Abbas, editor of the Financial Post, a business daily. Mr SM Muneer, the president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, is more blunt. He told a press conference earlier this month that there was 'a complete breakdown of law and order.' The government recognises the urgency of the matter, particularly at a time when it is encouraging foreign businessmen to send executives to Pakistan - 'peace and tranquillity in the country is our top priority. We can't neglect law and order if we want economic development,' says Mr Iqbal Haider, the justice minister in Islamabad. The origins of violence in Karachi lie in the city's rapid expansion since independence and the frustrations generated by a constant influx of refugees and migrants. The biggest wave was composed of the Mohajirs  - people who fled India in 1947 to escape religious riots and start a new life in a Moslem country. These Urdu-speaking people established themselves as a majority in Karachi to the dismay of local Sindhi-speaking farmers. In the first years after independence, the work of building a new country kept the latent ethnic strains in check. But arguments over language and quotas for government jobs and college places gradually polarised the two communities. The Sindhis resented the well-educated Mohajirs' success in business; the Mohajirs hated their exclusion from power. They produced figures showing that despite accounting for about half the population of Sindh province, Urdu-speakers accounted for only 95,000 of 456,000 provincial government posts. Other conflicts also surfaced - between Sunni and Shia Moslems, for example, and between rival criminal gangs. But it was the large and well-organised Mohajir community that had the biggest impact. In the 1980s, Mr Altaf Hussain, a charismatic speaker, now 41, launched the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, which took control of the Karachi Municipal Corporation and won the lion's share of the city's national and provincial assembly seats. But successive alliances with Ms Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and with Mr Nawaz Sharif's Moslem League failed to bring the MQM tangible benefits. Frustration pushed militant factions towards political violence and to crime. With the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan over, guns were easy. Drug smuggling generated easy money. In June 1992, Mr Nawaz Sharif ordered the army to send 60,000 troops to restore order in Sindh, including 40,000 in Karachi. More than 400 MQM activists were killed in the first few months of 'operation clean-up' and hundreds of others arrested. The army promoted divisions in the MQM, and the growth of a strong faction called MQM (Haquiqui), which it encouraged to fight against the mainstream groups. MQM militants fought back. Mr Altaf Hussain, who was in London when the army started its campaign, refused to return for fear of capture - and continued to lead his movement from exile. This summer he was sentenced in absentia to 27 years' jail for alleged offences including murder and arson. The MQM has responded to military pressure with increasingly radical demands, including this year asking for a new province to be carved out of southern Sindh, incorporating Karachi. Ms Bhutto and her ministers rule out such ideas. Yet, government officials and MQM representatives are frequently in contact. Mr Shoaib Bokhari, the acting MQM opposition leader in the Sindh assembly, says: 'We don't want separation from Pakistan. We want equal treatment.' The violence obscures the fact that many of Karachi's problems are those of any fast-growing city. Water, sewerage, power and transport services are all inadequate. While the city generates about 60 per cent of central government revenues, little is ploughed back into Karachi. Mr Abbas, the newspaper editor, says, Karachi-ites are self-made dynamic people. He believes they will respond to the challenge posed by violence. But, like others, he is not sure how long this may take. For businessmen, it is a matter of deciding whether potential rewards justify the possible dangers. Many might agree with Mr Nisar Memon, the country manager of IBM, the US computer manufacturer, who says: 'It's a risk, but it's a containable risk.'</p>

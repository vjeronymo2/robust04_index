			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: More rows about the rough stuff - Screen IT BEGINS with a dust-storm on the horizon; swells to a giant twister; then howls through the land turning homes to matchsticks and humans to tumbleweed. It is turbulent and merciless; it is as regular as Christmas. The violence-on-the-screen debate, in case you have been on another planet, is back again. In the cinema, fate or chance or Hollywood have appointed 1993 the Year of the Shocker. Films like Reservoir Dogs, Man Bites Dog, Hellraiser 3 and next week's Candyman - the last two films courtesy of our own Clive Barker - ensure a high blood quotient in the cinema. Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer has re-opened debate in the video arena. And TV we know about from our own PM, though his idea of an average evening's viewing seems to differ from that of others. All this plus a new book, Hollywood vs America by Michael Medved (HarperCollins, Pounds 17.99), presenting in print the case for family values and the Moral Right: 370 pages of anger and sorrow on every supposed exemplar of movie mayhem, from A. Schwarzenegger to B. DePalma via M. Culkin. (The star of Home Alone gets a knuckle-rap for the way he treats burglars.) This row about rough stuff in the movies - let me leave the small screen to other specialists - returns every decade and brings out the worst and best in everyone. Twenty years ago it was A Clockwork Orange and Straw Dogs; ten years ago it was the video nasties. Now it is 'Should we or should we not encourage films about serial killers and snuff film-makers?' These two are the flavour of the season. And the season began last year with the big-screen release of films like Henry, GoodFellas and Basic Instinct, plus the startling Oscar-sweep of The Silence Of The Lambs. This year's New Violence builds on those examples, especially on Lambs and Henry. The first offered a documentation of the physical/surgical realities of a supposed serial killing case, plus a consultant psychopath (Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter) who mesmerised the world with his mixture of beast and boffin. The second aired the hitherto all-but-taboo topic of snuff movies and DIY voyeurism in the video age. Linking the two films, and their 1993 offspring, is the notion of murder not for gain but for sport, spectacle or (in Lecter's case) sardonic pseudoscience. Man Bites Dog has a 'hero' who records his own brutal killings on video-camera. Candyman has a serial psychotic who wields a hook. And the scene in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs which had hardened critics and fellow film-makers gasping in shock or even exiting the cinema featured a crook torturing a cop with a razor. What made this scene unnerving was not any physical explicitness: indeed the camera cut away at moment of impact between sharp instrument and about-to-be-severed ear. It was the fact that the torturer admitted to having no information he wanted to extract. He merely enjoyed torturing. Each new movie-making age finds a new stratum of evil to explore, and each new movie-going age must decide if the works on show are honourable or meretricious. If the second, the usual two-word charge sheet reads 'gratuitous violence'. But what marks out today's cinema of cruelty is that the phrase has lost pejorative point in an age when films featuring brutal or sadistic events are about the excitement that characters obtain from that seemingly motiveless cruelty. The phrase 'gratuitous violence' moves from a description of the film's sensibility to a definition of its subject. Years of censorship tradition and media moralising have decreed that murder, torture or beating are justified as a dramatic spectacle if there is a sound dramatic reason or motive. It can be for crime passionel or revenge; it can happen in the hurly-burly of a crime or robbery; it can be the cathartic rough justice meted out in last reel by hero to villain. What it cannot be is violence for fun. Hence the seminal brouhaha, two decades ago, over Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This featured a gang of London bovver boys who beat up whom they chose and how they chose, wafted from one attack-ground to another on a tide of sadistic impulse. When a series of 'copycat' crimes followed the film's release in Britain, Kubrick withdrew it and has not allowed it to be shown in UK cinemas again. It remains a moot point whether a film like A Clockwork Orange actually creates violence or gives a new style and direction to those already waiting to commit it. Those who rush to the censorship prescription disregard this point along with many others. To author Michael Medved's credit in Hollywood vs. America, he condemns the folly of official intervention. But like many denouncers of screen violence who also denounce statutory censorship, he is censoriously devoted to the notion that a broader type of copycatting exists: whereby impressionable filmgoers catch the 'general' habit of violence from a film even if they do not mimic the specific deeds depicted. The evidence - and Medved cites yards of it - still fails to prove that this broader form of imitation exists. It seems at least arguable that movies take their cue from life as much as, if not more than, life does from movies; and that the eruption in the early 1990s of films about violence for violence's sake is a response to a world where, long before the 1990s, the chronicling of cases involving crimes-for-kicks or obscurely motivated brutalities has occupied many a Western newspaper page. What disturbs us about films concerning violence-for-pleasure - those in which gratuitous violence moves from style to subject - is the seeming motivational void around the crimes or outrages and the viewer's inability to get a moral handhold on the subject. There is no easy catharsis in films like Reservoir Dogs or Man Bites Dog, as in the make-my-day violence dispensed by hero to villain in films from Dirty Harry to Under Siege. There is no supernatural get-out clause, as in a horror film where everything can be blamed on the Devil or the Beyond. Above all, there is no ready moral which we can extract after the film, which might make up for our bewilderment during it as we search for motive/reason/explanation. No ready moral except one. The box-office revenue proving that we the public are drawn to films like these, by the tens of millions, suggests in turn that violence-for-thrills is not really an arcanum at all. We all recognise, even when we most cry innocence or ignorance, the attraction and excitement of 'gratuitous' violence. And we all respond - licenced by the fantasy that we are watching fiction - to the queasy truth that lucid intelligence can co-exist with human bestiality (Hannibal Lecter). We also live in a world besieged day by day by the evidence of 'motiveless' crime or cruelty for kicks. Do the movies shape monsters or do monsters shape the movies? If the next frontier in the Cinema of Violence is the film where violence is its own reward and excitement, human beings might turn the light of enquiry onto themselves before shining it censoriously on a genre they pretend to condemn as alien when it may be a part, however small, of each of us.</p>

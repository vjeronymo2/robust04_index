			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA FOES FORM NEW MOVEMENT  </P> <P> Two prominent Solidarity activists who oppose union chief Lech Walesa formed a  new political movement Monday that sympathizes with the government and  advocates a popular vote for president.  </P> <P> The movement, called Democratic Action, said it would try to present a "strong  alternative," to the two-month-old Center Alliance that wants Walesa named  president by Parliament.  </P> <P> The movement's formation comes after Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and  Walesa declared a political truce in their feud over the pace of political and  economic changes.  </P> <P> About 90 people attended the founding meeting, including many of the 63  advisers and Solidarity activists who broke ranks with Walesa at a stormy June  24 meeting of the national Citizens Committee, which Walesa controls.  </P> <P> The group's leaders include Zbigniew Bujak, former Warsaw regional leader of  Solidarity and head of the Solidarity underground during the martial-law period  in the early 1980s, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Solidarity leader in Lower  Silesia.  </P> <P> The new movement scheduled a founding congress for July 28, and representatives  said they intend to meet with Solidarity members of both houses of Parliament  on Friday to invite them to join the movement.  </P> <P> Bujak and Frasyniuk were once regarded as Walesa's potential heirs within  Solidarity. But in recent months they have distanced themselves from him,  complaining about his autocratic style.  </P></p>

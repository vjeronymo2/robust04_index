			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Shows Broadway forgot - Andrew St George talks to Ian Marshall Fisher about lost American musicals Ian Marshall Fisher is an archaeologist: he discovers lost American musicals. Over the last few years he has unearthed fresh musicals from the New World and put them on display in London. His latest series of Lost Musicals, concert-studio versions of the shows Broadway forgot, has just opened at the Barbican. Six years ago, Fisher struck on the idea of reviving musical theatre overlooked by Broadway: 'anyone interested in musical theatre should be aware this stuff exists', he says. The great success of Lost Musicals, now in its sixth season, lies in a mix of strangeness and familiarity. Past revivals included Do I Hear a Waltz? (1965, Richard Rogers and Stephen Sondheim) and Lovelife (1948, Kurt Weill and Alan J. Lerner) which perished after 220 and 252 performances respectively. But should forgotten musicals stay forgotten? Will Fisher's grandchildren be reviving Carrie or Leonardo? Two arguments present themselves. First, Fisher says, 'The people who invented the musical theatre . . . we'll never see the stuff that died for them'; that is, the early songs, stagings and ideas which made later masterpieces possible. Second, Lost Musicals is a pure archaeology of the fashions and tastes which produced the musical: 'the fashion is now over, but there's still an appetite for the fashion.' And who says creaky shows cannot conceal one or two great songs? Fisher reviles English musicals, the 'cod-operetta Ivor Novello style', and concentrates on American failures, which he finds more interesting. This year, on a Pounds 36,000 budget (20 per cent up on 1993), the season begins at the Barbican Cinema with Let's Face It, an unlikely 1941 collaboration between Cole Porter and Herbert and Dorothy Fields; then Bloomer Girl (1944, Harold Arlen and EY Harburg), New Girl in Town (1957, Bob Merrill and George Abbott), Strike Up The Band (1927, George and Ira Gershwin and George S. Kaufman) - and Cole Porter's 1936 Red, Hot and Blue, a riotous comedy about a man searching for a childhood sweetheart identified by a waffle iron burn on her bottom in which the cast included Bob Hope and Ethel Merman. Since so little is known about the musicals, each show has a short introduction. Fisher has three musical directors, 250 performers (paid in 'tea and biscuits'), but no costumes, no orchestra, no scenery, no publicity, no advertising and no West End Sunday competition for the Barbican Cinema's 280 seats (all tickets are a demotic Pounds 11). Lost Musicals would make ideal radio; the shows should be recorded before they slip from sight again. Fisher keeps the lights on so the audience can make notes or follow the score. Are these revivals worth doing? He responds by talking about modern musicals, which are not to his taste: 'the style now seems to be give them spectacle. All there is today is Sondheim and Lloyd Webber.' Has he seen anything recently he likes? A rare pause. 'I'm thinking . . . that means no. There's nothing.' Fisher is drawn to the past by the 'vibrancy, excitement and daring' he finds in old American musicals. The search for new material has put him on terms with the Gershwin, Hart, Hammerstein, Porter and Kaufman estates and families: 'they all help me, it's heartwarming, it happens all the time.' He leans forward. 'Listen, in this project the stars are the writers.' Discover the Lost Musicals, Barbican, Sundays until 9 October (071 638 8891).</p>

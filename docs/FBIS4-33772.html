			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 11 Jun (EFE) --  Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle said today that the goal of  consolidating the Ibero-American community of nations continues  firm, "even though many presidents are about to complete their  terms." By this statement, Lacalle was alluding to his own case  and that of Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari, and Panamanian President Guillermo Endara.    The Uruguayan president was the first of the 22 chiefs of  state and government to arrive in Cartagena de Indias to  participate in the fourth Ibero-American summit that begins on  Tuesday.    "It is a pleasure to step on Cartagena soil and to confirm  that the objective we established for ourselves continues  forward," Lacalle commented. He also praised "the great work of  the government" of Cesar Gaviria who will end his term in  August. [passage omitted]</p>

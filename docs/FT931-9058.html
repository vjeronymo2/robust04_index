			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Bonds: World Bank adds to stream of Canadian dollar issues INTERNATIONAL demand for Canadian dollar bonds remained strong yesterday as the World Bank added to the stream of issues in recent weeks with a CDollars 250m offering of its own. The bank's five-year issue, which sold out quickly and went to a premium in early trading, took the total amount of Canadian dollar bonds issued this year to more than CDollars 6.5bn. Quebec's first global bond offering, a 30-year deal to raise at least CDollars 1bn, and reports of another prime name looking to borrow in the currency, are likely to keep the Canadian dollar at the centre of attention for some days to come. The World Bank's issue, priced to yield 23 basis points over five-year Canadian government bonds, was sold out before the Canadian market opened, meeting strong demand in the Far East and Europe. In the afternoon in London, the bonds were bid at 99.65, comfortably above their 99.54 reoffered price. With the Canadian government market performing strongly, the spread narrowed to around 22 basis points at the end of the day. The strength of the Canadian dollar swap market owes much to continuing demand from issuers. Yesterday's World Bank deal, which is believed to have been swapped, depressed the spread on five-year swaps slightly to around 70 basis points. Even at that level, though, the market is considered attractive: a borrower able to issue bonds at a yield spread of 50 basis points over the government market, for instance, would achieve a borrowing cost of 20 basis points under Libor. Quebec's global bond issue was said by lead managers Merrill Lynch and Scotia McLeod to have met strong demand from insurance companies and pension funds in the US and Canada. The bonds are expected to be formally launched once the US market reopens today, with a yield spread of approaching 90 basis points. Sanwa joined the growing number of Japanese banks to increase their regulatory capital by issuing perpetual floating-rate notes, through Sanwa Finance Aruba. In a structure similar to that used by other banks, the Dollars 300m of notes carry a margin of 75 basis points for the first five years, rising eventually to 175 basis points after 10 years. The bank can call the issue after five years. Such paper is generally considered an expensive option for the banks, though it is still said to be cheaper at present than raising money through subordinated loans from Japanese insurance companies, an alternative source of tier two capital.</p>

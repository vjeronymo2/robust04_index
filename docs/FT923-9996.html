			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Gardening: Such good English gardens in exile - Robin Lane Fox welcomes a new book which may prevent homesickness on the family holiday abroad THE MARIGOLDS are glowing in Italy; fibrous-rooted begonias are dotted like cats' eyes round France; Love lies bleeding on a thousand roundabouts within sight of the Mediterranean. Faced with all this foreign bedding, English gardeners on family holidays are preparing for a fortnight of exile. If they knew where to go, would it be better? Are there places abroad with the style which echoes their high ideals for the garden at home? Most of these echoes have been left by fellow English gardeners, busy abroad. The hunt for them is very much easier this year because of a notable new book by Charles Quest Ritson called The English Garden Abroad, published at Pounds 20 by Viking. From La Mortola to the Cooks of Portugal, its old photographs are well-chosen; the new colour ones are fun; the text surveys English gardens in Europe from Portugal to the French Riviera, from Malaga to eastern Sicily. Everyone will find an unfamiliar villa and little-known facts and practitioners of English gardening abroad: there was much more going on in the earlier part of this century than the famous lavishness of Miss Willmott in France or the amazing vulgarity of Cannes. Many books on this topic are either picture-boilers or the work of garden historians who have never been near a plant or would not know the English difference between middle and upper class. Charles Quest Ritson is something else. He has a profound knowledge of roses; his training extends from history to tax law and life with a plantswoman whose nursery stocks Prunus bessii and who describes Oxford University as second-rate. His book reads like a tightly-written brief, packed with his own research, a good line in passing comment and a sharp eye for expatriates' particular obstacles: soil, sun, and their heirs. He gives an excellent bibliography, which asks to be followed down rare avenues which he recommends. I have been relishing it at breakfast, a chapter at a time, and the view from my window of rain, long grass and English greenery has seemed wonderfully at odds with the dreams which he conjures up. Often, a dream is all that is left. This book is best at the specific, the family detail, the problems of water, or the botanical specimens to be found in great gardens of the past. It reminds us of great enterprises which cost fortunes and have now disappeared. At times, it is not entirely explicit about the level of gardening which remains. Its unwary readers might visit Ravello on the coast of Italy, expecting to find a living tradition of plantsmanship and maintained elegance. It is worth visiting the Scottish-based garden of the Villa Rufolo and the nearby Villa Cimbrone, home of the Yorkshire expatriate, Lord Grimthorpe, whose home society knew him as the Big Bad Wolf. The siting of these two gardens is still spectacular, on the edge of a steep cliff, but their planting is pretty awful and their upkeep is not distinguished. Further north, in the great garden made by the Hanburys at La Mortola, the story is even worse. As Quest Ritson comments more gently, its heir, the University of Genoa, has continued to make an frightful hash of its legacy, in spite of the attempts of English experts who have been consulted. France has a fabulous pair to our own Hidcote, the second home of Lawrence Johnston at La Serre de La Madonne. Very few gardeners have been allowed to visit its remains, but the reports are of a ruined framework, sad witness to a dream of the past. Quest Ritson well remarks that Italians know how to restore a ruin: they also understand concepts like ecology or botanical environment. They do not have a clue about artistic gardens of flowers which can evolve in a duet with committed gardeners. Not everything is lost and decaying. Quest Ritson has a sharp eye for neglected areas of genius, still alive and well. He appreciates the Botanic Garden in Palermo; he pays particular homage to Sir Peter Smithers and his remarkable garden at Vico Morcote, which includes almost every known magnolia. The two Wakefields, father and son, earn a large bouquet at Clos de Peyronnet; mention is made of Russell Page, the professional English designer abroad; the great garden at Ninfa and the Howards make a proper climax to the text; on Madeira, there are fond words for the Blandys and on Sicily for the Whitakers, active families whose gardens were built on fortunes from Madeira and Marsala wine, respectively. Sometimes, the air is so rarefied that I feel myself in a minority: 'Many have travelled to the Villa Taranto in June in the hope of seeing the rare Emmenopterys henryi flowering as nowhere else in Europe.' Perhaps we should join the crowds. My own guess is that the 21st century will see a great scattering of good gardens, newly made by young English owners who have opted for life in Europe and managed to cope with the absence of the best weed-killers in the smaller market towns. They will have made their fortune in the stock market boom of 1994-96: more women than ever before will be cashing in their chips and setting out with personal fortunes to lose their golden handcuffs in gardens of flowers which will make Monet look old-hat. They will revel in Quest Ritson's book and many of its bons mots. The French have always been puzzled that well-off English owners should want to work in person and let the garden make them dirty. At the great garden of La Mortola, Lady Forbes once wrote of her three golden rules: 'Never plant singly; do not mix families of plants, which, by the laws of nature, could never have grown together; study your colour-schemes.' In practice, as Quest Ritson aptly observes, she usually broke her own rules. Expatriates, he reminds us, tend 'to present as problems what in practice they see as opportunities.' From this familiar mentality, yet more good English gardens in exile are still to be born.</p>

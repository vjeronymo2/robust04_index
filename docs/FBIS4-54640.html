			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, May 2 (TANJUG) -- Strong Moslem artillery  attacks on Teslic, Serb-held town in northern Bosnia, on Monday  caused huge material damage, Bosnian Serb army sources have  said. The Moslems also launched mortar and infantry attacks on  Serb settlements and positions close to Doboj and in the region  of Mt. Trebava and infantry and artillery attacks in the area of  Mt. Ozren (all in northern Bosnia) the sources said. The  Bosnian Serb army was forced to strongly respond to the attacks,  it was said. Four civilians, wounded in Sunday's artillery  shelling of Doboj which killed four civilians, are out of  danger, the Bosnian Serb army said.    The Doboj Serbs have over the past month been under constant  Moslem fire which killed many civilians, but the shelling of  this town fails to draw the attention of the world public and of  the U.N. Protection Force. The Moslem offensive in northern  Bosnia aims to cut the corridor which links the eastern and  western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS). On Sunday and  Monday NATO planes have constantly been flying over Bihac  (western Bosnia) thus encouraging the Moslems to mount mortar  and infantry attacks on Serb positions, the Bosnian Serb army  sources warned.    On Monday the Moslems opened anti-aircraft and sniper fire  on  Bosnian Serb army positions in the upper parts of the Neretva  River valley, while the regular Croatian army units launched  mortar attacks on the Bosnian Serbs near trebinje (southern  Bosnia), it was said.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Major seeks to stress prospects for recovery Mr John Major last night sought to talk up the prospects for sustained economic recovery and pledged to hold down inflation. Speaking to executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New York, the prime minister said the government had set in place 'solid foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'. Seeking to dispel any impression in the US that the recovery might be in doubt, he said the end of the recession had left Britain in a much stronger competitive position. Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening. Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries in 1994. Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation. 'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it that way.' He added that low inflation was creating its own dynamic for investment and growth. But the government was determined to move further in sharpening Britain's competitive edge. Emphasising that education remains at the top of his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'. Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st century.' Stressing Britain's commitment to free and open trade, Mr Major said that the industrialised nations could not insulate old industries and old habits from global competition. In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.</p>

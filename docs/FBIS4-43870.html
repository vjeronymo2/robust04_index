			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] According to AFP, certain UN  military observers in Rwanda have received threats in Kigali.  They are UN peacekeepers from countries ready to contribute to  the French intervention. AFP refers in particular to Senegal,  Togo, and Congo. The UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda]  Command, quoted by AFP, specifies that the departure of these  soldiers is not planned at the moment, but that they are  nevertheless asked to be prepared for every eventuality.    While waiting for the French resolution on intervention in  Rwanda to be adopted by the United Nations, probably within the  next 48 hours, France has already sent a small military  detachment to eastern Zaire. Christophe Boisbouvier reports:    [Boisbouvier] Paris has in fact confirmed that 15 or more  French soldiers have arrived at the base of Goma, in eastern  Zaire, very close to the border with Rwanda. It is a forward  detachment and has the task of checking the runway before any  wide-bodied aircraft land there. The wide-bodied aircraft could  then make the shuttle trip between the operational platform of  Bangui and the base at Goma.    On the other hand Paris denies the report from our Belgian  colleague LE SOIR stating that French soldiers have already  crossed the border and are at Cyangugu, in the extreme southwest  of Rwanda, to renovate a runway there. This is untrue, the  French Defense Ministry states; we will not enter Rwanda until  the United Nations has given the go-ahead.    On the Zairean side, President Mobutu says he is ready to  facilitate the task of this humanitarian force by lending the  bases, but specifies that no Zairean troops will be involved.  This is not appropriate under the current circumstances, he  says. With regard to the Zairean opposition, Etienne Tshisekedi  says he is fiercely opposed to this operation. He accuses  France of attempting to put his old political rival, Mobutu Sese  Seko, back in the saddle. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin was the  guest of our colleagues at France Culture [radio station] this  morning. He responded to the accusations and the opposition  which, as we have seen, are increasing with regard to this  French plan for intervention in Rwanda:    [Begin Roussin recording] We are intervening because, in  fact, what we see, what we hear, what we read is intolerable.  It annoys me to hear France being constantly criticized and  people pointing a finger at France. We are all involved in this  business. The government takes the initiative and people still  point the finger at it. What do you expect us to do? Leave  things like that? Who is going to take France's place? Who is  taking the initiative at the moment? Nobody. We are there, we  are knocking at Europe's door and nobody answers. Nobody in  Africa has mobilized or has stood up to protest against this  genocide, even the neighboring countries, and now that we are  taking the initiative -- well, people can be critical of the  policy which we have carried out in Rwanda, but in any case we  are now getting involved to help save lives and we are on our  own. Even last night, if I heard the latest news correctly, it  was not a big success at the United Nations. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Michel Roussin, speaking on France  Culture this morning. The Cooperation Ministry has announced  that a member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is in Paris  today to meet French political officials. As we know, the RPF  opposes French intervention, while on the government side this  idea has met with a favorable response. This is what Martin  Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge d'affaires in Paris, explained to  Ghislaine Dupont:    [Begin recording] [Bissaba] In view of the situation in  Rwanda, which is truly catastrophic -- many people have died on  both sides, in the area controlled by the government and in the  area controlled by the RPF -- and also in view of the fact that  the two sides have not been able to reach agreement on halting  this real human tragedy which is shaking the whole world, well,  I believe that the French initiative is welcome.    [Dupont] Do you not think it would have been desirable for  this protection force to be organized, made up, just of UN  peacekeepers, in fact a beefed up UNAMIR force rather than a  force which will apparently be made up mainly of French troops?    [Bissaba] At the moment what we need is a force that can  stop  the Rwandan tragedy and, as you will know from following the  deliberations at the UN, this is taking far too long. As you  can see, with every minute that passes, more lives are being  lost in Rwanda, so I believe that as an emergency measure this  French initiative is really welcome, because if we had to wait  for the UN procedures to come to an end I think we would have  wasted a lot of time.    [Dupont] France says that this humanitarian protection force  will give aid to both sides, it will be impartial. Will the  government forces allow Tutsi refugees who are still in areas  controlled by them today to be evacuated?    [Bissaba] I believe that the Rwandan government in any case  has given an undertaking that the massacres may be halted in the  areas it controls [as heard], it gave a firm promise to this  effect in Tunis, and I believe, and furthermore according to the  information in my possession, the situation is gradually calming  down, so I do not see why the Rwandan government would refuse to  allow the intervention forces to reach the Tutsis. [end  recording]    [Announcer] That was Martin Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge  d'affaires in Paris.</p>

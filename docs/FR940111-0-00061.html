The implementation plans were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposals. No comments were received pursuant to these proposed actions. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revisions to the North Dakota and Utah SIPs for establishing a PROGRAM in each State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule will become effective on February 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at: Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Laura Farris, Mail Code&hyph;8ART-AP, USEPA Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405, (303) 294&hyph;7539. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background of Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States of North Dakota and Utah submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. In order to gain full approval, the State's submittals must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses required by section 507(a);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process which is required by section 507(a)(3); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP required by section 507(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Submittals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of North Dakota has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAM elements. N.D.C.C. sections 23&hyph;25&hyph;02 and 23&hyph;25&hyph;03 grants the Department the authority to undertake the elements of the PROGRAM. The Governor, through Executive Order 1992&hyph;5, established the Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel. The North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories (the Department) formally adopted the SIP revision on October 23, 1992, which identifies a plan to implement the PROGRAM. This SIP revision is being added to the North Dakota SIP as section 12. The North Dakota PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of North Dakota on November 2, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness. In a letter dated December 15, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January 18, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter dated February 2, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its SIP revision section 12.5 to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State has met the second PROGRAM element by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office of the Chief of the Environmental Health Section effective April 6, 1992, as stated in its SIP revision section 12.3. The State has met the third PROGRAM element through Executive Order 1992&hyph;5 dated May 21, 1992, issued by the Governor of North Dakota, which established a Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of North Dakota, and by outlining in its SIP revision section 12.4 the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally, the State of North Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in section 12.2 of the State's SIP revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Utah has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required PROGRAM elements. Section 19&hyph;2&hyph;109.2 of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended authorizes the Utah Air Quality Board to establish a SBAP, and create a Compliance Advisory Panel. A new section 17, which is a plan for implementation of the SBAP, will be added to the Utah SIP. R307&hyph;2 of the Utah Air Conservation Rules incorporates this SIP revision by reference. The Utah PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Utah on November 9, 1992, with supplemental information sent on November 5, 1992, and January 11, 1993. EPA notified the State in a letter dated December 30, 1992, that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Utah has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in section 17.3 of its regulations to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a)(3) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. The State of Utah has met the second PROGRAM element by locating the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of the Executive Director, as stated in section 17.5.1 of its regulations. The State of Utah has met the third PROGRAM element by outlining in sections 17.4.1 and 2 of its regulations the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined, which is consistent with section 507(e) of the CAA. Additionally, the State of Utah has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA. This mechanism is contained in section 17.2 of the State's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of North Dakota and Utah. The revisions were made to satisfy the requirements of section 507 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this action, EPA is approving two State programs created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. These programs do not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses; they are programs under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the States. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 28, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack W.

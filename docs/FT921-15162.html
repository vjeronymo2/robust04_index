			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Australian dollar down after rate cut CONCERTED intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia failed yesterday to prevent the Australian dollar falling to its lowest level against the US dollar in nearly three years. Dealers said most of the selling pressure came from overseas investors reacting to a reduction in official interest rates of one percentage point to 7.5 per cent earlier this week. The Australian dollar's weakness came at the same time as the US dollar was rising sharply on world foreign exchange markets. Investors were also concerned about speculation that the federal Labor government would significantly increase the budget deficit soon in an attempt to stimulate the flagging economy. The dollar touched 73.8 US cents in early trading, its lowest since mid-1988, but recovered to just over 74 cents at the close in Sydney, nearly 8 per cent below its level in September, when it traded at just over 80 cents. In the US, the Federal Reserve bought Australian dollars at 74.05 US cents in aggressive intervention yesterday. Dealers assumed it was on behalf of the Reserve Bank. The dollar had opened in New York at 73.66/73 US cents, the lowest since May 1989. In London it closed at 73.6, just above a low during European trading of 73.4. The RBA is thought to have spent more than ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 610m) to support the currency in the last two days, hoping to prevent a rapid decline which could damage hopes of an economic recovery. However, the authorities appeared unconcerned by the size of the adjustment. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), and Mr Bernie Fraser, the RBA governor, have both suggested a moderate fall in the dollar would benefit the economy. Dealers said the decline was likely to continue over the next few weeks. Most said the currency was likely to stabilise at 70-72 cents, but some said it could fall as low as 68 cents. The markets were also unsettled by uncertainty about the size of the fiscal stimulus expected to be announced in late February or early March by Mr Paul Keating. Mr Keating, who replaced Mr Bob Hawke as prime minister in December, has promised to stimulate the economy to end a two-year recession which has pushed unemployment to a post-war record of 10.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish, on the  back page of the front section of its 4 May edition, publishes  an unattributed, four-color, full-page, paid advertisement that  questions the background of members of the Papa Egoro Movement,  including its presidential candidate Ruben Blades. The same  four-color, full-page advertisement is published by Panama City  LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish on page 18A of its 3 May  edition and by Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish on page  15A of its 4 May edition.    The upper left-hand corner of this advertisement features a  four-color graphic of the flag of the Communist Party of Italy.  Next to this flag, flushed right in the upper right-hand corner  of the page, is a graphic of the Papa Egoro logo. Although the  Communist Party flag features the words "Democratic Party of the  Left" and a small graphic rendition of a red flag with a hammer  and sickle -- none of which is found in the Papa Egoro logo --  the two graphics are similar in that both feature green trees  against white, circular backgrounds inside large orange fields.  Beneath the Italian Communist Party flag, the words "Communist  Party, Italy" are published in boldface. Beneath the Papa Egoro  logo, the words "Ideological Recognition" are published in  boldface.    Immediately below the flag and logo, there is a box  featuring  three quotes attributed to Ruben Blades. The box reads as  follows:    ```I have been charged with belonging to the left because I  do not belong to the right.'    ```Che Guevara's project remains in effect.'    ```Another thing that remains in effect is the need for a  change, because there should be a change, no matter where it  comes from.'    ``Ruben Blades, (NOTIMEX) Chile''    Under the box, there is a section headlined: "What Does Papa  Egoro Propose?" This section of the advertisement reads:    "*`The first thing the new government must do is have its  own  currency' -- Raul Leis, ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin  America] conference, University of Panama    ``* `Mandatory military service is required' -- Ruben  Blades,  TVN Dialogue    ``* 'Raise the Social Security quotas' -- Ruben Blades,  ILDEA  [Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies]    ``* `We will change the Assembly in order to rule' --  Fernando Manfredo, Youth '94 TVN''    Under this middle section, there is a final section  headlined  "Who Is Papa Egoro?" This section of the advertisement reads as  follows (all capitalization as published):    "PRESIDENT: RUBEN BLADES    ``FIRST VICE PRESIDENT: CARL NORDSTROM, former PRD  [Democratic Revolutionary Party] member, architect of Noriega's  mansions.    ``SECRETARY GENERAL AND SPOKESMAN: RAUL LEIS, member of the  TENDENCY; activist in solidarity organizations with the  Sandinist National Liberation Front and the Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front in Nicaragua and El Salvador,  respectively.    ``ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARTY: CARLOS VALLE,  Noriegista activist in San Miguelito.

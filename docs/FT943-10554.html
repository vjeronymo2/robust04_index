			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Paradise lost in housing In one of Mr John Major's most successful attempts to set out a vision for the future, he told the 1991 Conservative party conference of his desire to see wealth cascading down the generations. The house price rises of the previous decade made such a dream seem plausible. Many ordinary people found that the increase in value of their homes had made them wealthy beyond their dreams - on paper at least. Forecasters predicted a surge in spending for people in their 50s and 60s, who would inherit their parents' properties. A golden generation would have money to burn on their own homes, cars, holidays and personal services. The vision looks a little less plausible now. For well over a million householders, owning a home is a net liability - their mortgage is greater than the current value of their home. Negative equity is largely concentrated in the south of England, where the housing market enjoyed the largest rise and suffered the deepest slump. But even here its impact is uneven: some areas are afflicted much more than others. Where it coincides with pockets of unemployment in former growth areas such as Essex and southern Hampshire, it holds back the growth of local economies. Negative equity also affects some social groups more than others. A study published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that it overwhelmingly hits owners under 40. People in professional and managerial occupations are most likely to be affected. They are the wealth creators of the future, but they cannot move house to find better jobs, or easily raise capital to start a business. Low inflation The foundation's study also says that average house prices would have to rise 15 per cent to eliminate this negative equity. Current trends in the housing market are hard to read, with monthly house price surveys showing weak price rises, low activity and little sign of any consistent recovery. This is not a cause for despair: in an ideal world, house prices would increase no faster than inflation. But if the chancellor's promise of low inflation proves true, it could be the end of the decade or beyond before the blight of negative equity is lifted. A second study published yesterday by the foundation suggests that the cascade of wealth may be rather more of a trickle than a torrent. In 1992, 140,000 homes were inherited, and over the next 20 years the number will not rise much above 200,000 a year. The study predicts that this could release almost Pounds 15bn in 2000, compared with Pounds 7bn now. But it adds a warning that most of this money will not find its way into consumption. Only a fifth will flow into consumer spending while the rest is reinvested. No cornucopia here. Ageing population And it would be unwise to assume that even these more modest amounts will be available. One consequence of an ageing population is an increasing bill for the care of the elderly. In the past, such care might have been provided by the welfare state; increasingly, those with assets are expected to pay some or all of the cost themselves. As the pressures mount on welfare spending, elderly home owners will have to sell their assets in order to pay for long-term care. This is entirely appropriate. What else, after all, is the point of acquiring wealth except to pay for the comforts of life? The idea of leaving assets to your children is an attractive one, and often a strong motive behind wealth-creation. But it cannot be financed at the expense of the state. It would be wrong for low-income taxpayers, perhaps working long hours for low wages, to have their taxes raised to support asset-rich pensioners. Many of those who were beguiled by the vision of a cascade of wealth may feel cheated by these harsh realities. Far from inheriting a pot of gold on the death of their parents, they may find little left after the bill for their care has been paid. It may be many years before their own home is worth more than the money they owe on it. They can console themselves, however, that one consequence of a saner housing market should be that it will become that much easier for their own children to find somewhere to live in the future.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Charity tins may rattle to a different tune: Alan Pike discloses moves to make the voluntary sector choose between campaigning and providing AN AMBULANCE rushes an elderly woman to hospital after she collapses in the street. When she has recovered she is taken home to find a friendly home-help waiting to greet her. Ten years ago the woman would have passed from one pair of directly employed public-sector hands to another. Today, the picture is different. The emergency ambulance service and hospital are likely to be trusts - statutory bodies, but run by their own boards of management. Trust hospitals are not charities but they often run big appeals that affect the charity fund-raising market. The patient's journey home would probably have been with a private company or voluntary organisation, to which ambulance services contract much non-emergency work. Her home-help may well come from one of the charities, such as Age Concern, that provide welfare services under contract to local authorities. And if the patient has to enter residential care, it will probably be with the private or voluntary sector. Welfare services are now delivered by a mixed economy of quangos, private providers and charities operating public contracts in an increasingly fragmented social market. Initially, charity directors and trustees felt uncomfortable about their role in this new, ill-defined market. Some argued that reliance on public contracts would lead to charities losing their independence, distinctiveness and freedom to campaign, and might eventually undermine charitable status itself. A report by three former Home Office advisers to be published tomorrow will confirm their worst fears. It argues that charities delivering public services are no longer voluntary organisations in the traditional sense and should lose their automatic right to tax relief. It says charities should choose between being publicly funded agencies delivering services or being free-standing campaigning organisations. Charities operating public contracts would receive tax refunds if they met annual performance targets, rather than guaranteed tax relief because of their charitable status. They would join the array of trust hospitals, opted-out schools, housing associations and private welfare companies in a new 'third sector'. Campaigning charities that were not paid to deliver state-funded services would be freed from government regulation to work for causes as they chose. But, the report says, individual charities must decide which type of organisation they want to be. The consequences of implementing all the report's recommendations would be dramatic. Public schools, think-tanks and many other institutions that are not conventionally seen by the public as charities enjoy charitable status, and loss of tax relief would have wide-ranging implications. It is unlikely that the government, having reformed charity law only last year, would want to reopen the issue so soon - particularly on the basis of such a controversial agenda. This does not guarantee, however, that the whole report will be shelved. Although the traditional collecting-box image of charity remains strong, public money is the single biggest source of income for many service charities. This is provoking profound questions about the true nature of charity which this week's report will bring to the surface. Questions arise from all directions in the new social market. Should public bodies such as trust hospitals, universities and opted-out schools be running big charitable appeals, increasing the competition on 'real' charities for precious income? Would voluntary workers continue to give their time to charities if they were simply agencies competing to deliver state contracts? What is the real difference between a tax-exempt charity that gets income from contracts with state authorities, and a quoted residential care company, such as Takare, that receives its income in the same way? The report will increase pressure on the government to address such issues. There are few easy answers but one thing is certain: there will be scant enthusiasm in the voluntary sector for forcing charities to choose between being service or campaigning organisations. Most charity directors believe the distinction is a false one. How, they ask, could leading charities with Christian foundations, such as Barnardos and the Children's Society, divorce their work in providing services from the moral purpose of challenging a social order that makes the services necessary?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha--QNA--Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political  Department, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  saying that Rabin's present policy obstructs all approaches  toward peace.    Warning Israel against mounting an act of aggression against  Jordan in view of Rabin's inability to stop the intifadah,  Qaddumi said that Rabin has been trying to hold Jordan  responsible for his failure and added that if Israel does not  withdraw very soon the struggle with the Palestinian forces will  continue.    In a statement to the Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ published  yesterday, Qaddumi said that a new reality is now emerging in  the arena of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle making all the  Zionist dreams vanish and the greater Israel concept something  of the past.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a provincial anticorruption report meeting that  ended yesterday [19 June], provincial party Secretary Jia  Qinglin stressed: Party committees and governments at all  levels must maintain our leadership style as main party and  government leaders who grasp anticorruption work in person.  They must increase their sense of responsibility and urgency in  deepening the three kinds of work in the anticorruption struggle.    Comrade Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements in the  anticorruption struggle in our province since the three plenary  meetings of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. In  the meantime, he also pointed out: At present, there remain  problems of failing to firmly grasp the work of investigating  and handling major and important cases, and of unhealthy trends  gaining ground. Governments and relevant departments at all  levels must pay close attention to this matter.    He emphasized: It is necessary to further unify our  understanding so as to increase our consciousness of doing two  types of work simultaneously, and attaching equal importance to  both. Proceeding from the overall situation of maintaining a  lengthy and peaceful reign in our country, we must be firm and  unshakable in carrying out our anticorruption struggle in a  deepgoing, solid, and more effective way. We must increase the  weight of investigating and handling major and important cases,  with the focus on cases involving corruption, graft, fraud,  smuggling, and severe violation of financial and economic  discipline. [passage indistinct]    Comrade Lin Zhaoshu put forward specific demands for the  work  arrangements in the next stage of our anticorruption struggle.  He pointed out: It is necessary to continue grasping the work  of maintaining leading cadres' cleanliness, honesty, and self-  discipline, and of correcting unhealthy trends. It is necessary  to continue exercising control over revenues and expenditures to  solve the problem of unhealthy trends at its root. It is  necessary to strengthen supervision and examination work.  [passage indistinct].    Leaders of the provincial court, procuratorate, and public  security bureau also spoke at the meeting.</p>

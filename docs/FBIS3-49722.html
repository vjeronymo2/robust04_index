			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Janko Saradjen] </F>   [Text] After Dusan Pozar, senior prosecutor in Maribor,  has handed the material on the number of violations of Security  Council resolutions on the part of Janez Jansa and the Defense  Ministry -- the material collected in the investigation of the  arms affair -- over to the Ljubljana Public Prosecutor Tomaz  Miklavcic, some procedural processes should be explained. The  Maribor prosecutor had to hand the case over to the Ljubljana  prosecutor because the seat of the Defense Ministry is in  Ljubljana. As we have learned, Tomaz Miklavcic has still not  received the aggravating material, but when he does receive it  he will assess whether it is ready for [word indistinct]. He  has enough time for such an assessment, according to internal  regulations, as he himself claims, up to six months. If he  initiates further investigations, this period could be as long  as four years, which applies to suspicion of an act punishable  by up to one year in prison.    The public prosecutor's office is a hierarchically organized  institution, and if the procedure lasts too long the senior  Ljubljana prosecutor Pavle Dolenc may demand that the municipal  prosecutor speed up the matter. In order to avoid that  altogether, he may take over the matter himself. The republican  public prosecutor, Anton Drobnic, may also intervene. The  development of these events may, for some people, serve as  another occasion to assess to what extent our state is based on  the rule of law.    We do not know how quickly the Public Prosecutor's Office  will react. On this occasion, let us recall that recently, in  some other case, the Ljubljana public prosecutor reacted very  quickly.    The question is of how the aggravating material reached the  public before the Ljubljana public prosecutor received them. Is  the Post Office alone to blame? We would have to have this in  mind, for the Maribor prosecutor stated that we should certainly  take care about the country's reputation abroad and make legal  distinction between aid to victims of aggression and violations  committed from gainful motives.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BA weaker Results in line with expectations, but accompanied by a fairly cautious statement, kept British Airways shares in negative territory. They closed 2 adrift at 397p following turnover of 4.9m. Pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 235m, against Pounds 227m a year ago, while the dividend was raised to 3.18p per share from 2.93p previously. Analysts' forecasts had ranged from 3.1p to 3.3p. In the three months to the end of September, 8.1m passengers flew on the airline's scheduled services, 14.4 per cent more than a year ago, with revenue passenger kilometres rising by 12.6 per cent. Cargo traffic rose 9.3 per cent. Most brokers left their full-year forecasts unchanged. Smith New Court reaffirmed its positive stance on the stock, highlighting the growth in premium traffic and the load trends. Bank shares were driven in both directions, apparently by broker recommendations. Royal Bank of Scotland was the sector's best performer, rising 8 to 364p, within 4 of the stock's all-time high, as the market continued to anticipate more good news from the bank's Direct Line insurance subsidiary, due to announce figures next week. One leading firm of marketmakers was said to have been an aggressive buyer of the shares. Abbey National eased a shade to 403p in spite of some particularly heavy activity in the traded options market, where one front line agency broker was said to have sold 1,000 'puts', equivalent to buying 1m shares. Barclays, up 6 at 582p, and Lloyds Bank, a shade off at 563p, were said to have been recommended by UBS, while Swiss Bank was thought to have been the downside driving force in Standard Chartered, 9 weaker at 1034p. The insurance area of the market failed to arouse much interest ahead of today's third-quarter numbers from General Accident, which analysts forecast will show nine-month profits of around Pounds 230m, against a loss of Pounds 37m last year. GA's shares eased a penny to 691p, while those of Commercial Union declined 8 to 594p on 568,000 shares traded in front of tomorrow's third-quarter numbers. Results from British Steel prompted a volatile session in the shares as a positive reaction to improved profits and dividend turned negative after a downbeat statement from the management. The shares were eventually 2 1/2 off at 122p in turnover of 8.9m. The market had little time to react to a statement by Tiphook - made a few minutes before the market closed - that its losses would extend into the second half, that no final dividend would be paid and that it was in talks to sell its container division. The company also said it had made further progress in its restructuring talks with the banks. The shares were up 3 at 98p. Cable and Wireless was among the FT-SE 100's worst performers, slipping 11 to 486p on keen turnover of 2.7m, ahead of interim figures scheduled for Thursday. The weakness of the shares was said to have been sparked by a bout of sustained selling by US investment bank Goldman Sachs, although this was not confirmed. C&amp;W shares were badly mauled a couple of weeks ago by suggestions that CITIC, the Chinese government investment agency, was considering the sale of a substantial block of its 57 per cent shareholding, although this was said to have been denied by the Chinese authorities. Amstrad was among the market's most active stocks, with more than 12m traded in the cash market and the equivalent of 3.5m dealt in the options market. The underlying shares edged up 1 1/2 to 53p. BICC jumped late in the session, closing 6 higher at 395p amid speculation of a big order from the US. The oil and gas sector did little more than mark time as dealers pondered the recent weakening by international crude oil prices and the chances of a further bout of uncertainty ahead of the next Opec meeting, scheduled for November 23. Shell Transport, roughly handled by the market last week following results only marginally below best expectations, improved 2 to 692p, but Enterprise Oil dipped 7 to 445p. Lasmo, another to suffer substantial downside pressure last week, rallied 1 1/2 to 130p. Utilities lost ground across the board, with regional electricity stocks featured by Eastern, 7 lower at 580p, and Midlands, which dropped 7 to 596p. FT-SE 100 stock Southern eased only 3 to 600p. Unilever rebounded from Friday's post-results fall, closing 19 ahead at 1105p. Kleinwort Benson and Strauss Turnbull both issued buy notes, while NatWest Securities also took a positive view. Shares in Euro Disney recovered after an initial fall, fin-ishing a net 15 firmer at 385p. The stock was hit at first by bearish weekend press comment, but rallied on some international buying interest, according to dealers. Walt Disney, in the US, yesterday had some of its debt downgraded, partly as a result of last week's heavy losses at the French theme park. Forte improved 4 to 231p ahead of an analysts visit to the group's motorway service centre in France this week. Profit-taking clipped 5 from Airtours, which ended at 434p. Adverse press comment hurt First Leisure in the wake of last week's downgrade by the company's broker. The stock retreated 10 to 239p. Ladbroke remained friendless, losing 5 at 163p in big turnover of 5.5m. US buying was said to have lifted Rank Organisation, up 11 at 846p. Conglomerate BTR slipped 5 to 354 1/2 p after Credit Lyonnais Laing reiterated its cautious stance on the stock at the morning meeting. Zeneca was helped by a report that one of its products had moved to the final phase of development following 'particularly encouraging' results in phase two patients. The shares appreciated 11 to 765p. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television strengthened 13 to 218p on weekend newspaper coverage suggesting that LWT was interested in increasing its stake in the company. LWT relinquished 9 to close at 499p on the speculation.</p>

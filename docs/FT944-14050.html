			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London and Dublin plans for talks make progress London and Dublin yesterday acknowledged that they still had differences over a proposed framework document for talks on Northern Ireland's future but said they had made progress on a co-ordinated approach to dismantling terrorist arsenals. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds met at Chequers yesterday, accompanied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister After the meeting, the two prime ministers said they had made 'steady progress' in the framework document intended to promote talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But the two men acknowledged that sticking-points remained and declined to set a date for the document's completion. 'There are still some very important issues that remain to be resolved,' Mr Major said. Mr Reynolds said: 'You can take it that the gap (between the two sides) is narrower after today's meeting than it was yesterday.' Officials will continue talks today on what Mr Major described as the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be handed over. Acknowledging that there were 'self-evident difficulties' in the process, partly because weapons were hidden in Ulster and the Irish Republic, Mr Major said: 'Clearly it is desirable to have a co-ordinated approach.' He declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of talks between the government and Sinn Fein before the end of the year. The IRA has not yet agreed to hand over any weapons. Questioned on his remarks last week, which appeared to irritate Dublin, that plans for an Ulster assembly were separate from the framework document, Mr Major said it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one from the other. The process is seen as falling into three 'strands'. One covers the assembly; strand two concerns north and south relations; and strand three covers relations between London and Dublin. Mr Major said on Friday that the framework document would cover strands two and three. Mr Reynolds declined to say whether he would push for changes in the Irish constitution, which enshrines Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster. Mr Major is thought to have told his Irish counterpart that hopes for a settlement depended on a revision of this claim. Moderate unionists, whose support is vital to efforts to forge a settlement, are expected to insist on such a move. Ulster spending plea, Page 9</p>

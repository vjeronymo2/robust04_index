			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETURN OF LAPPER HELPS UCLA'S SOCCER CHANCES  </P> <P> UCLA fullback Mike Lapper's junior season for the nation's second-ranked soccer  team could have ended 90 minutes after it started.  </P> <P> But Lapper, in his first game for the Bruins since last winter, scored a goal  to even the score, and one of his roommates, freshman midfielder Joe-Max Moore  from Irvine, added the overtime winner in UCLA's 2-1 playoff victory last  Sunday over the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> That extended Lapper's season by at least another 90 minutes, because the  Bruins (16-1-3) meet No. 17 Southern Methodist (17-3-1) Sunday at 1 p.m. at  UCLA's North Soccer Field in the NCAA West Regional final. SMU upset No. 11  Fresno State, 2-1, last Sunday.  </P> <P> The UCLA-SMU winner advances to the Final Four tournament Dec. 1-2 in Tampa,  Fla.  </P> <P> It was the prospect of playing for the national championship that motivated  Lapper to return for the playoffs after missing the regular season to recover  from a broken leg, although he could have stayed out and had two years of  eligibility remaining. College players are given five years to complete four  years of eligibility.  </P> <P> But Lapper has such a promising future in the sport that UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid  didn't figure the defender from Huntington Beach would remain on campus for two  more years.  </P> <P> So, after receiving a doctor's approval, Schmid gave Lapper the option of  joining the team for the playoffs. "It was his decision," Schmid said. "There's  no way I'd make a decision like that for a kid. But I talked about it with  Mike. He's going to do more than just play college soccer. He's going to  continue with the Olympic team, and he also has a future with the national  team.  </P> <P> "If he's playing in the Olympics in '92, I don't think he'd come back to school  that year. So we probably wouldn't have had him here for a fifth year, anyway.  If he had been a player whose highest level of soccer was going to be in  college, I would have been more concerned."  </P> <P> Lapper, 20, already is a member of the pool from which the under-23 team that  will attempt to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics will be chosen. But he  said that he wasn't looking that far ahead when he made his decision.  </P> <P> "I want to be part of the national team and the Olympic team, but you never  know what's going to happen in the future," he said. "The reason I came back is  because I want the opportunity to play for a national championship. Even if I  was still injured, I would have tried to come back."  </P> <P> It was apparent to Lapper that he wasn't still injured when he began practicing  with the team about two weeks before the end of the regular season.  </P> <P> But just to be sure that he was ready, he asked his former club coach, Roger  Wyett of the North Huntington Beach Untouchables, to work with him on his  timing.  </P> <P> It paid off 15 minutes into the game against San Diego when Lapper scored from  15 yards out after a pass from Moore.  </P> <P> "I was looking for someone to pass to when Joe yelled, 'Shoot it,' " Lapper  said. "It wasn't an ideal shot. I think it nicked one of their guys and went  in. But it was a great feeling. What more can you ask for in your first game  back?"  </P> <P> Although Lapper lines up on the offensive end for set plays, he made his  reputation as a defender.  </P> <P> "He's only 6 feet tall, but he's an exceptional header of the ball," Schmid  said. "There are very few people in the country who can beat him in the air.  He's also a very determined tackler. When he makes his decision to tackle, you  know he's coming."  </P> <P> One of those tackles went awry in last summer's Olympic Festival at  Minneapolis. Playing for the South team, he broke his leg while trying to steal  the ball from a West forward. The forward was his UCLA teammate, junior Cobi  Jones from Westlake Village.  </P> <P> "He thinks he's pretty tough now," Lapper said of Jones. "He's still kidding  me. He tells me, 'If you don't be quiet, I'm going to break your leg again.' I  don't think I'll ever hear the end of it."  </P></p>

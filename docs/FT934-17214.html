			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tate &amp; Lyle hint Rumours that Tate &amp; Lyle is eyeing the Spanish sugar refiner Ebro were heard, and the UK group's shares slipped on fears of a rights issue to pay for the purchase. However, Ebro is entangled in the Kuwait Investment Office's affairs in Spain, which holds some 36 per cent of the company's shares, and the practicalities of a full bid are unclear. Ebro holds more than 50 per cent of the Spanish sugar market, and the Madrid authorities have warned that a majority foreign ownership would be discouraged. The company is thought to have annual profits of around Dollars 50m; a full bid would have to be in excess of Dollars 300m, according to London analysts. They added that while such a move by T &amp; L would make a geographical fit, the company has remained out of favour with the market since last month's profits warning and worries over company strategy. The fourth announcement in five days from Grand Metropolitan brought the long-awaited purchase of North British Distillery (NBD), a private supplier of grain for whisky production. GrandMet bought the group in a joint venture involving Highland Distilleries. Brewing analysts said that the move was a good one given the uncertainties in the grain supply market. In a related development, Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, is rumoured to have bought part of NBD's 4.8 per cent stake in Highland to take it towards the 10 per cent holding agreed between the two producers. Highland announced after the market had closed that NBD had disposed of its entire stake, amounting to 6m shares. Highland closed 5 down at 333p and GrandMet rose 3 to 419p. Hints from Forte at its results meeting that it would not sell Harvester sites where it had adjoining hotels discouraged speculation that Whitbread may be about to bid for the public houses and restaurants chain given the brewery group's own hotel interests and ambitions. Allied-Lyons was one name being put forward as an alternative candidate for Harvester, particularly taking into account the chain's concentration in the south-east. Allied slipped 3 to 569p and Whitbread 'A' 2 to 527p. Forte's dull results were also said to have undermined Vaux Group, off 2 at 240p, Greenalls, down 10 at 363p, and Ladbroke, 6 1/2 adrift at 185 1/2 p. Shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered moved sharply forward ahead of a bullish note from Strauss Turnbull due to land on investors' desks today. The former gained 17 at 716p, while the latter advanced 8 to 944p. Mr John Tyce at Strauss said: 'Whilst basically attractive, UK banks look dull for the next few months until lending is revived. You get better operating profit growth from these two, along with much faster dividend growth from HSBC this year and from Standard in due course.' However, the view from Strauss did little harm to the rest of the sector, and Barclays added 9 at 524p, and National Westminster firmed 5 to 507p on good volume of 9.5m. Construction group Redland ended 9 up at 564p after revealing first-half profits of Pounds 108m, against Pounds 88.5m. Analysts had expected between Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m profits. UBS suggested the results reflected 'evidence of UK recovery and very strong evidence of US recovery.' Optimism was furthered with Redland's international activity, where European sales had either been resilient to economic difficulties, as in Germany, or excellent overall, as in eastern Germany and the Netherlands. Mr Howard Seymour of BZW increased his 1993 profits forecast from Pounds 255m to Pounds 265m and felt that 'future strategy seemed very sound'. Activity in chemicals again remained dull. ICI edged up 2 to 716p. GKN was a weak feature, falling 8 to 460p. However, Mr Harry Phillips at Panmure Gordon believes the shares are a strong buy because, being a motor components manufacturer, the company was ideally placed in an attractive sector to take advantage of the emerging economic recovery. Turnover in British Steel rose to 15m after Strauss Turnbull joined the bandwagon of securities houses that have recently upgraded profits expectations for the group. The shares appreciated 4 to 128 1/2 p. The broker left the current year profits forecast at Pounds 50m but doubled expectations for the following year by Pounds 125m to Pounds 250m. Mr Zaffer Khan at Strauss said: 'The recent pricing initiatives will take time to come through, but are likely to be successful and the costs are under control.' James Capel and Smith New Court were reported to have also made positive noises on the stock. Engineering group Fenner closed 14 ahead at 100p after the market was cheered by news that it was in talks with a potential buyer for its Power Transmission division. The company announced a one-for-two rights offer to strengthen the balance sheet. Shares in FKI were in demand and finished 5 up at 157 1/2 p, with analysts expecting a positive vist in two weeks to see the group's US operations. The dubious honour of having the day's biggest fall in the market went to engineering group Atlas Converting, which registered a 21 per cent decline by tumbling 147 to 533p after reporting a poor set of interim profits. Reports that Cadbury Schweppes is lining up to bid to run the National Lottery led to some head scratching among food analysts as to the direction of company strategy. One analyst said the market felt that the company, which last month raised Pounds 324m through a rights issue to buy a US soft drinks group, would be best concentrating its efforts on getting its American operations right. The shares receded 4 to 451p. Profit-taking caused Hillsdown to retreat 7 to 160p. Nervous trading ahead of next week's interims at Bank of Scotland left the shares 3 softer at 167p. International trading group Inchcape continued to be a weak feature following negative comment from Robert Fleming earlier in the week. The shares lost 12 at 515p. Trading in large lines of stock was reported in Smith New Court. The shares finished 10 ahead at 334p after volume of 5.3m.</p>

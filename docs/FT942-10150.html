			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Expenses come under tax reforms Companies will be required to provide employees with details of their expenses and benefits-in-kind each year under Inland Revenue consultative proposals for the new tax system of self-assessment. They will have to provide full information to staff on pay and tax deducted by May 19 after the end of the tax year, and give expenses and benefits information by July 6. Self-assessment, which begins in the 1996-97 tax year, will affect an estimated 9m taxpayers who submit tax returns, including many in the pay-as-you-earn system in the upper-rate tax band or with complex tax affairs.</p>

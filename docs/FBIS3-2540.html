They  extended new year greetings on behalf of the people and  communist party members of Beijing, to the former secretary and  mayor and wished him long life and a happy Spring Festival.  Comrade Peng Zhen was very pleased, and also wished Beijing's  people and the communist party members a happy new year.    Comrade Peng Zhen, who is 91 years old, cordially talked  with  the municipal leaders with a high spirit and clear mind.    Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan said: Under the leadership of the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core,  Beijing improved all of its 1993 work over work in 1992 and  achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  The per capita income of urban staff members and workers  registered a substantial increase last year thanks to economic  development. However, we still have some poverty-stricken,  mountainous areas and low-income plants, shops, schools, and  households that are experiencing difficulties. We will make  efforts to solve this problem as a priority in our endeavors to  achieve a fairly comfortable life in the next few years and make  it a success.    Comrade Peng Zhen said happily that healthy development was  genuine development. He emphasized that great efforts in  improving state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises and  agriculture, were key to this development.    Chen Xitong said: This year's tasks for reform and  development are very arduous. Great efforts should be made to  maintain political and social stability in the capital.  Meanwhile, we should further emancipate our minds, seize the  opportunity, conduct investigation and study, make breakthroughs  in key areas, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the  party Central Committee and the State Council to win still  greater achievements in the capital's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive.    Comrade Peng Zhen said: Stability is a major task concerning  the entire country, and the capital should take the lead in  maintaining it. Without a stable environment, nothing can be  developed.    Chen Xitong said that to continuously promote the cause of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as advocated by  Comrade Xiaoping, we should strengthen party building and, in  particular, achieve ideological and theoretical progress and  improve leading bodies. He reported to Peng Zhen that the  end-of-term reshuffles of district and county leading bodies  improved the age structure to add impetus to the orderly  succession of cadres. Comrade Peng Zhen said: A good age  structure is good. Without the combination of old, middle-aged,  and young comrades, the party's line will lack continuity. The  basic issue is to uphold socialism and communist ideals.  Communist party members should intensify study of Marxist  theory, persistently seek truth from facts, uphold truth, and  correct mistakes that may arise. In this way, they will have  bright prospects and make progress endlessly.    Chen Xitong said to Peng Zhen: Eleven years ago when I first  served as the mayor, I asked you for instructions. You gave me  four: 1) say less and do more, and say nothing about completed  work; 2) a mayor needs money at his disposal, thus meaning that  production needed to be developed to increase financial  resources; 3) set the highest possible demands on all work and  advance continuously; and 4) "measure several times before  cutting" by conducting more investigation and study. I have  benefited greatly from these four instructions. When Comrade Li  Qiyan became the mayor, I passed on the instructions to him. Li  Qiyan said: I kept your four instructions in mind constantly.  In your introduction remarks to the "Frontline" magazine, you  urged us to adhere to the thinking of seeking truth from facts,  and we have always used it to guide our work. Comrade Peng Zhen  smiled.    Li Zhijian and Chen Guangwen, deputy secretaries, and Duan  Bingren, secretary general of the municipal party committee; and  Fan Yuanmou, secretary general of the municipal government; also  visited Comrade Peng Zhen together.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ex-Greencore chief criticised TWO HIGH Court-appointed inspectors investigating a share dealing controversy within Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group, have come to the conclusion that Mr Chris Comerford, its former managing director, 'is an unfit person to be a director of a company in the State'. The inspectors were appointed last September, two weeks after Mr Comerford was forced by the board to resign from his IPounds 135,000 (Pounds 125,000) per year position. This was triggered by a controversial 1990 buy-out of a subsidiary, Sugar Distributors, shortly before Irish Sugar was privatised. Mr Comerford was considered to have a conflict of interest which he had failed to disclose, but he was offered a IPounds 1.5m severance package which was later frozen. The inspectors' report, published in Dublin yesterday and running to almost 300 pages, concluded that Mr Comerford 'corruptly accepted monies . . . may have committed a criminal offence, namely forgery . . . and in his capacity as managing director of Irish Sugar, Mr Comerford deceived the company, being his employer, the board of directors and in particular Mr Cahill (the chairman), from sometime in or around mid-summer 1988 until the privatisation of Irish Sugar'. Mr Comerford said yesterday that he intended fighting the affair through the courts and claimed that he had been made a scapegoat by Greencore's board. Surprisingly, the inspectors concluded that neither 'Mr Comerford nor any of his family' ever had a beneficial interest in a company called Talmino which was involved in the Sugar Distributors buy-out. This directly contradicts the conclusions of another inquiry into the affair commissioned by the Industry Minister.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Abbey's move into derivatives is entirely logical Sir, In his article on Abbey National ('Curious case of the Abbey's habits', September 9), John Gapper expresses some surprise at the 'odd' behaviour of Abbey at establishing a joint venture on derivatives products. This is not untypical of commentators who have not yet grasped the fact that derivatives are no longer the exclusive preserve of the large institutional customer but have now become an integral part of the financial system. Evidence of this is all around us, in the form of fixed-rate and capped mortgages, unit trusts guaranteeing a minimum return, certificates of deposit linked to the FT-SE index, to name a few products that are manufactured and managed using derivatives. It is therefore entirely logical that Abbey, as one of the UK's largest financial institutions, develops this capability. The argument that such a venture may have an adverse impact on shareholder returns is also spurious. The experience of other banks suggests that this activity, if managed well, can provide superior returns on capital. The surprise, if there is one, is that Abbey should have waited so long to develop this capability. Andrew Stott, Price Waterhouse, Milton Gate, 1 Moor Lane, London EC2Y 9PB</p>

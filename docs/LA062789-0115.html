			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. SOLDIER LED UNUSUAL LIFE;  </P> <P> PERI AS SPY: UNBELIEVABLE TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM  </P> <P> While living with his family in South Africa, Michael Peri carried the U.S.  flag for a drill team founded by his mother, a group of uprooted American  teen-agers who called themselves the Patriettes.  </P> <P> Like many other youths living in the expatriate colony about 100 miles  northeast of Johannesburg, Peri became protective of all things American. He  was so concerned that the nasal Afrikaner clip would creep into his U.S.  accent, a family friend recalled, that the California native acquired a Texas  twang.  </P> <P> A decade later, the same young man who struggled to retain his American  identity has admitted betraying his country. Spec. Michael A. Peri, an  intelligence analyst for the Army, pleaded guilty to espionage and was  sentenced on Saturday to 30 years in a military prison.  </P> <P> Once considered a model soldier, Peri was described by Army prosecutors during  his court-martial as a "Judas" who acted on his spy fantasies by slipping into  East Germany with U.S. military secrets and giving away the store.  </P> <P> The picture that has emerged of the young soldier since he returned from the  Eastern bloc nation and surrendered in West Germany is unfamiliar to those who  thought they knew him best. Family friends and military buddies expressed  disbelief that the Michael Peri they knew could become a foreign agent, if only  for a confused, brief moment.  </P> <P> "He's a good, wholesome kid who went into the Army because he was looking for  direction," said Linda Later, a Salt Lake City publisher who became close  friends with the Peri family while living in South Africa. Later recently  helped line up defense attorneys for the accused soldier. "I can't believe that  he would do this. I can't accept it at all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Authorities at a Loss  </P> <P> Peri's disappearance was also baffling to officials of the 11th Armored Cavalry  Regiment in Fulda, West Germany, where Peri had been stationed. The young  soldier, described as well-liked and highly trusted, left behind a new Honda  Civic, a stereo, skis and clothing when he fled to East Germany with a laptop  computer and military secrets last Feb. 20. He returned and surrendered 12 days  later, but even after his court-martial, authorities are at a loss.  </P> <P> "The question we have never been able to answer is why," said Sgt. Major Dale  McInnis, spokeswoman for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany. Peri has not been  accessible by the media since his return from East Germany.  </P> <P> Peri, described by friends as an average American kid, led an international  childhood that was anything but typical. The second of Fred and Winnie Peri's  three children, Michael spent his early years in a middle-class neighborhood of  La Habra. But Fred Peri's career as a project engineer for Fluor Daniels Corp.,  an international firm based in Irvine, soon took the family all over the globe.  They moved eight times before Michael turned 20.  </P> <P> The family lived for about three years in South Africa while Fred Peri worked  on the construction of a refinery, according to Later, whose husband also  worked for Fluor Daniels there. Young Peri and his sister, Desiree, traveled to  Austria to attend the Salzburg International Preparatory School in 1981-82 and  then returned to South Africa to enroll in Evander High Sc hool the following  year.  </P> <P> Another job transfer took the Peris back to Orange County in 1983, and  additional house moves caused Michael to switch from Fountain Valley High  School to La Quinta High School in Westminster before graduating with mediocre  grades in 1983. Michael Peri joined the Army Reserves and, after completing a  two-year tour, moved briefly with his family to a Chicago suburb. In 1987,  after his parents returned to California and began construction on a house in  Laguna Niguel, Peri entered active duty and qualified for an elite intelligence  training course.  </P> <P> California, Africa, Europe -- to many it might sound like a glamorous life. But  it was a difficult path for a shy young man, and one that his parents  apologized for during wrenching testimony at Peri's sentencing hearing.  </P> <P> "This is not my Michael," Fred Peri told a military jury. "He's a quiet,  unassuming young man. He's been under a lot of stress. Maybe when we raised  him, we didn't teach him how to deal with stress. We insulated him."  </P> <P> Winnie Peri described her turbulent childhood in an alcoholic family and said  that, as a result, she had been overprotective of her children.  </P> <P> "Maybe we did spoil our children," she testified. "We helped them along the  way. I didn't have possessions when I grew up. I wanted them to have it better  than I had it. We've given them an opportunity not to grow up, not to mature. I  see that might be wrong now."  </P> <P> Peri said that he made an impulsive mistake when he crossed into East Germany  with a computer and four floppy discs that contained details of U.S. troop  movements in West Germany and Army estimates of Soviet military strength. He  complained that he felt overworked and unappreciated in his job as an  intelligence specialist for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda.  </P> <P> And, as he pleaded for forgiveness, Michael Peri the red-blooded American  appeared again.  </P> <P> "People don't think I have remorse for what I've done," Peri said, crying. "But  I'm willing to join combat arms . . . and put my life on the line in a  front-line unit during the war."  </P> <P> To Sean Regan, who served with Peri in a Los Alamitos Army Reserve unit from  1985 to 1987, the combat offer reflected Peri's early patriotic enthusiasm.  Regan, who is no longer a reservist, was a junior noncommissioned officer  assigned to help train Peri in intelligence analysis.  </P> <P> "He was a good guy, and he really seemed to enjoy the work we were doing," said  Regan, of Westminster. "When you're dealing with national security and you get  your (security) clearance, you get something that only 2% of the country can  get."  </P> <P> But, Regan noted, working for a "glorious unit on the front lines," such as the  11th Armored Cavalry, "can go to your head."  </P> <P> "You're planning war, and moving tanks and troops. It's a game, it's like  chess. To me, that's very exciting, and that's how Mike felt too."  </P> <P> In an interview in March, Peri's uncle, Bob Andre of La Habra, also recalled  the young soldier's interest in intelligence work. Michael Peri had spoken  during a visit home last December of pursuing a career with the CIA, Andre  said.  </P> <P> "He told me that he was going to put his time in military intelligence and  after he came out, he was going to go back to college," Andre said. "Then, with  his background in intelligence, he was going to apply for a job with the CIA."  </P> <P> Prosecutors depicted Peri as a cunning young man whose fantasies of espionage  and intrigue were fueled by a magazine article that Peri read three days before  his flight. Peri seemed fascinated with the story, about the Marine spy scandal  at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and bragged to friends about his high-level  security clearance, according to Maj. Michael Graham, the lead prosecutor.  </P> <P> "He was the proverbial fox in the chicken house," Graham said. "He violated the  trust his unit had placed in him. And like Judas betrayed Jesus at the Last  Supper, Specialist Peri kissed off his friends, kissed off his family, kissed  off his unit and kissed off his country."  </P> <P> A jury panel of five officers deliberated only two hours before returning with  a sentence of 30 years in prison. According to the terms of a plea agreement,  Peri's sentence will be reduced by 5 years if he serves his first three years  in prison with good behavior. At the earliest, Peri could be paroled in 10  years.  </P> <P> "That kid was working 100 hours a week over there in a highly stressful job  with nobody he could talk to," said Michael A. Martinson of Brea, who has known  the Peri family since they were neighbors in La Habra in 1963 and described  Michael as like his own son.  </P> <P> "I think the Army made an example of him, and I find it impossible to believe  that he did what they say he did. Up until the last, I was hoping that he would  be exonerated."  </P> <P> Later, who has been in daily contact with Fred and Winnie Peri, described the  parents as "numb" following the sentencing. And although Later described Peri's  decision to go to East Germany as "a screw-up; 22-year-olds screw up," she  insisted that the soldier is no spy.  </P> <P> "If anything, Mike's on the klutzy side," she said. "If I were on a mission and  Mike were on a mission, I'd worry about him screwing up. Not about being loyal  -- just making a mistake."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Wen (4545 7186): "Perfecting the Taxation </F> System: Effectively Dealing With the Relations in the Intended  Tax Assignment System"]    [Text] Because delineations in matters of rights and  responsibilities are vague, some localities frequently exceed  the limits of their authority, thereby impairing the central  authorities's macro-regulation of the national    economy, and thereby also restricting any full  development of the very function of taxation.    Since 1979, main emphasis in the systematic reform of the  tax  system had been placed on effectively dealing with the relation  between state and enterprises in matters of distribution, and  the readjustment of the relations between central government and  local government finances had been neglected. It is for this  reason that the current system of tax management lags behind the  reform of the tax system. This is the cause of much confusion in  actual practice, and is one of the primary reasons for the  prevailing vague delineation of rights and responsibilities as  between the central authorities and the local authorities. As a  result, it is now an extremely widespread occurrence that local  authorities exceed the limits of their own administrative  authority and infringe on central authority domain. This, in  turn, adversely affects the central government's ability for  macro-regulation of the national economy, and also restricts the  full development of the very function of taxation. It has  therefore become even more urgent to initiate a system of tax  assignments.  <H5>  Which Specific Form of Tax Assignment System To Select? </H5>   We may select one of the following forms for the intended  tax  assignment system:    1) the form in which all tax categories are clearly divided  up; 2) the form in which the various tax categories are divided  up, but which also includes some that are jointly shared. The  method of sharing the joint categories may be either by separate  collections, by proportionate distribution, or by    surtaxes and refunds; 3) the form of mainly separately  sharing in tax rates.    The first form may be considered the unitary system, and the  two other forms may be called mixed forms. Generally speaking,  adopting the form of completely dividing up all tax categories  would be the most thorough way to do it, as it would make it  possible, through the division of the tax sources, to clearly  establish the income distribution between central authorities  and local authorities. It would also make it possible, by  adhering to the principle of unison of financial rights and  responsibilities, to improve the dismal state of central  finances. One may, however, counter that this is only good as an  abstract theory, and that it is almost impossible in actual  practice to truly effect so clear a division. The reason for  this is that there is a multitude of factors that cause changes  in revenue and expenditure of public finance. Generally, it is  easier to adopt a mixed form, as these forms will have a certain  elasticity in the division of tax revenue. Looking at the actual  conditions in China, we see that, on the one hand, it has been  customary for a long time to share revenue, and, on the other  hand, that any division in the tax system is beset with many  practical difficulties, because the tax sources cannot all of a  sudden be divided up thus clearly. It is therefore my opinion  that adoption of a form that provides for common sharing would  be more feasible and more appropriate. As to which specific  pattern to choose among those available in this kind of a form  with common sharing, no preference can be claimed by any one of  them, but the pattern of proportionate sharing comes closer to  Chinese usage.  <H5>  How To Resolve Regional Differences? </H5>   For the resolution of regional differences, there are the  following alternatives:    1) The method of "large unison with small differences."  That would mean, the norms for tax sharing would be more or  less the same for the whole country, and economically backward  regions would have to use other means, such as subsidies,  preferential treatment, etc. to achieve in effect a policy of    due differentiations in regional treatments.    2) The method of "small unison with large differences."  That would mean, that districts throughout the country would be  classed as high, medium, and low categories, according to  disparities in economic development, and that different methods  would then be applied to the different categories.    In my opinion, the first method would be preferable. This  method would have the system appear as much more unified, and it  would also avoid making the system excessively cumbersome and  complex. It would help keep the whole tax management system  appropriately simple and be more convenient in the actual  application of the new system. Adopting the method of subsidies  would conform to international practices, and would, compared  with China's traditional method of large disparities, give full  scope to the redistribution of financial resources. It would  also strengthen the supervisory powers of the central  authorities over this part of the funds and would also impel the  local authorities to properly use these funds. In the opposite  case, if the second method would be adopted, it could engender  in its actual execution--judging by the performances of the  past--much imitation, mutual rivalry, and evasive compromises,  while it would be difficult to appropriately decide on the  particular categories of the districts.    Establishing a Scientific System of Indices    The greatest difficulty in every past attempt to reform the  management system of public finance was the determination of the  base figures for regional revenue and expenditure and  determining the proportions to be shared by central and local  authorities. The main causes for this appear to have been the  lack of a rational system of indices and of subjective will, and  the dominant position of vested interests. Normally, the figures  in the final accounts of revenue and expenditure of a certain  year or of several years were taken as reliable data for the  determination of the base figure, and based on these, the  proportions of income to be shared by central and local  governments would be determined. Because these figures are  subject to fortuitous changes over short periods of time, this  method lays the seeds for future fights over base figures and  proportions between central authorities and local authorities,  and leads--in fact did so for a long time in the past--to  unending wrangling during the process of demarcating revenue and  expenditures, which then had also each time adversely affected  the results of the reforms. The tax assignment system that is  now being planned must absorb the lessons of the past several  attempts at reforming the system of public finance, and must  first provide a scientific system of indices, and on that  foundation rationally demarcate the tax revenue for the various  levels of governments, so as to ensure feasibility as well as  stability of the new system.    Appropriate Delineation of Levels of Tax Management    The ultimate purpose of the delineation of levels of tax  management is the accurate division of responsibilities and  limits of authority as between governments of different ranks.  Judging by the successful experiences in other countries with  the tax assignment system, tax management levels are to be  always identical with the levels of political administration;  commonly there are three levels of administration. In view of  the actual situation in China, it should also be considered to  differentiate, in conformity with the levels in public finance  administration, between the three administrative levels: the  central authorities, the provinces (autonomous regions,  centrally controlled municipalities), and the counties (cities),  each with its own tax sources. Taxation at the latter two levels  would then constitute local taxation. This kind of demarcation  would essentially conform to the levels of political  administration in China, would be comparatively clear, and also  convenient in actual management. However a few points must be  explained here:    1) Village finances, even though one level of financial  administration, need not be a separate and independent level,  because village governments have very limited responsibilities  and authority, and bear almost no economic functions. Their  affairs could therefore be administered unifiedly at the county    (city) level. 2) Delineation of the limits of  administrative authority of the provinces is extremely  important, because the provinces bear the heavy responsibility  of dealing with a dual distribution relation, namely between  central authorities and provinces and between provinces and  counties; they must have a considerable scope of authority. 3)  Because cities with provincial status enjoy administrative  authority equal to that of provinces, their revenue and  expenditure is not connected with those of the provinces. They  can therefore be administered in the same way as provinces.  Moreover, even though these cities have a lot of tax revenue --  most are one of the supporting pillars of their provinces --  according to the guiding idea of the "great unison," they can  also only adopt the same indices, just as throughout the entire  country, in the delineation of tax revenue. This may also  promote their even faster development.    Specific Designs for the Intended Tax Assignment System    The key question in designing the tax assignment system is  the renewed determination and demarcation of financial authority  and financial resources as between the central authorities and  the local governments. This touches on the interests of both  sides. On the one hand, the principle of unison of financial  authority and executive power should be upheld; on the other  hand, however, it is also necessary to consider a series of  other factors, such as the macro strategic objectives of the  state, social policies, and the functions of local governments.  Determination of financial power and financial resources  between the various levels of government must mainly be  accomplished through the delimitation of tax categories, tax  rates, and tax management.    The idea of demarcation of tax categories. In the  demarcation  of tax categories, i.e. in the question of how to select the tax  sources of the central government and those of the local  authorities, one may adopt different models. At present,  different opinions are held by different circles of society. In  my opinion, a choice has to be made between the following two  models:    First Model: The starting point in one's considerations must  be the need to ensure revenue and to ensure the central  authority's ability to effect regulation and control.  According to the special characteristics of the tax revenue  structure in recent years, the first consideration must be to  preserve the financial resources required by the central  government for its normal functions. Second consideration must  be to distribute between central and local authorities when tax  revenue increases. Third consideration must be the degree of  difficulty encountered in levying and administering the taxes,  because for some tax categories collection and administration  may be a dispersed affair and posing great difficulties in  administration. Such taxes must not be made tax categories of  the central authorities, but may be administered by the local  authorities.    According to the above-stated principle, product tax,  value-added tax, special activities tax are tax categories that  should be assigned to the central authorities. Income tax of  enterprises, social security tax, and business tax are tax  categories whose tax sources are closely linked to economic  development and which are characterized by great unevenness.  These tax categories may be commonly shared by central  authorities and local authorities. Most of the remaining tax  categories may be made local tax sources.    Second Model: Dividing up tax categories according to their  nature into those to be tax sources of the central authorities  and those to be tax sources of the local authorities. First,  customs duties, which are needed to maintain the sovereignty of  the state, and the salt tax, which is best unifiedly  administered by the state, must be designated central authority  taxes. Second, high-rate product tax, which the state uses as a  means to prevent duplication of production, the fixed asset  investment tax for the regulation of investment activities, also  taxes on relevant activities of a special kind, must be assigned  to the central authorities. Third, in the case of large items of  tax revenue, which ensure the financial resources of the central  authorities, such as value-added tax, it may be considered to  assign a large proportion of them to the central authorities as  their revenue. Some other taxes, directly related to production  and circulation, may be assigned, because of their rather wide  fluctuations, to both the central authorities and the local  authorities for common administration, so that both may have  benefits from them and also commonly bear the risks. Tax  categories that are of less value, for which collection and  administration is scattered over a wide area and that have a  local character, may be left to be the fixed revenue of the  local authorities.    Delineation of the limits of authority in tax management.  Authority in tax management comprises the right to legislate on  tax matters, the right of interpretation, the right to adjust  tax rates and tax items, and the right to reduce taxes and  exempt from taxes. This delineation is closely liked to the  demarcation of tax sources. As the levels to which the tax  categories belong differ, so differ the levels of authority in  tax management.    The basic demand in the demarcation of tax management  authorities is to appropriately expand the administrative  authority of the local governments, always on the precondition  of ensuring the central authorities' ability to exercise  macro-regulation and control. It is possible to prescribe in  general that governments of all levels shall enjoy authority to  manage their own tax categories. In this way, the legislative  power in matters of central authority taxes is exercised by the  National People's Congress. The State Administration of Taxation  is responsible for interpretations and for the promulgation of  enforcement provisions, which will then have to be enforced by  tax bureaus at all level. The legislative power in tax matters  of governments of the provincial level is exercised by the  provincial people's representative assemblies, and tax rules are  interpreted by the provincial tax bureaus, who will also  promulgate enforcement provisions and enforce the tax rules.  Taxation at the county level is handled similar to the procedure  at the provincial level. At the same time, the local governments  have certain rights with regard to taxation initiated for new  tax categories. All legislative power concerning tax categories  that benefit both the central authorities and the local  authorities rests with the central authorities, so as to ensure  revenue for the central authorities and to strengthen the  central authority's control over the local authorities. However,  the enforcement authority may, according to different  circumstances, be assigned to both to exercise in common, as  this may be beneficial for raising enthusiasm among the local  authorities.    To bring the above plan closer to realization, the authority  in tax management may be assigned in the following  administrative forms:    Central authority taxes are to be legislated and enforced by  the central authorities, and the entire administrative authority  over them is centralized in the central government.    In the case of taxes benefiting jointly both the central  authorities and local authorities, the central government is to  legislate and the State Administration of Taxation is to  interpret and to determine specific enforcement provisions. The  right of adjustments and the right to reduce taxes and exempt  from taxes shall be exercised separately by either the central  authorities or the local authorities.    The province- and county-level governments shall each  separately have authority in the administration of most of the  local taxes, and the central authorities shall not have the  right to interfere.    Province- and county-level governments, acting within the  sphere of their jurisdictions, may, as circumstances demand,  initiate taxation in new tax categories. Administrative  authority over these tax categories shall completely be  exercised by the local governments, so as to have the local  authorities enhance their financial resources, raise enthusiasm  for revenue increases, and also because it will be beneficial  for greater involvement of the local governments in the local  economic activities of their own localities.</p>

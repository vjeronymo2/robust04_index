			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Fright Night" (1985), directed by Tom Holland. 105 minutes. Rated R. Scary,  funny and intentionally campy, "Fright Night" revolves around a teen-ager who  thinks his new next door neighbor is a vampire.  </P> <P> Chris Sarandon makes a wise-cracking, smug resident Dracula, and Roddy McDowall  plays "The Great Vampire Killer" with verve. A perfect mix of comedy and  chills. MIKE BELL  </P></p>

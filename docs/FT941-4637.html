			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Cadbury seeks Dr Pepper purchase as profits rise 25% Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks group, is interested in acquiring all of Dr Pepper, the US soft drinks maker, it confirmed yesterday. Cadbury bought a 20 per cent stake for Dollars 231m (Pounds 155m) last August, bringing its holding to 25 per cent. Mr David Wellings, Cadbury chief executive, said 'the two businesses would be worth more together, provided the shareholder values can be realised. The question is whose shareholders get the benefit of those values, and that's what is being discussed'. The company said present talks were concerned with co-operation between the companies and with the issue of Cadbury representation on Dr Pepper's board. Mr Frank Swan, head of the drinks division, said 'the primary strategic issue is that however the final rationalisation of the US soft drinks industry proceeds, we now have a seat at the table'. The question was one of price, he said. 'At the right price I'd like to own Dr Pepper, but at the right price I'd like to own Coca-Cola.' Cadbury's full-year figures, released yesterday, were better than expected. Pre-tax profits, helped by last year's rights issue, rose 25 per cent to Pounds 416m. Earnings per share were up 16 per cent, or 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. The dividend was raised 9 per cent to 14.4p. Excluding acquisitions, the company said, sales rose 3 per cent and trading profits 7 per cent. Trading profit in confectionery rose 20 per cent to Pounds 208m, with the strongest performance from continental Europe and the Americas, and the weakest in the UK. Drinks profits were up 16 per cent but profits in Europe halved, mostly because of competition and write-offs in Spain. In the UK, drinks volume was up 6 per cent, but prices fell 2 per cent. UK drinks profits rose 12 per cent to Pounds 101m. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said the group planned to grow further through acquisition. Cadbury spent Pounds 476m last year on acquisitions, raising Pounds 340m of the cost through a rights issue. However, gearing fell from 59 per cent to 46 per cent, excluding intangibles, while free cash flow rose from Pounds 100m to Pounds 185m. Mr David Jinks, finance director, said the group had the capacity to finance Pounds 400m-Pounds 500m of acquisitions without recourse to shareholders. Lex, Page 22</p>

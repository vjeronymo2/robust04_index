			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Pan (1728 4323), researcher at State </F> Council's Development Research Center: "Market Economy and  Opening to Outside World"]    [Text] The advancement of theory on the socialist market  economy has laid a theoretical foundation for expanding opening  up to the outside world, and reforms which aim to establish a  market economy system will create conducive conditions for the  rapid development of foreign trade.    Since reform and opening up, our system has experienced  great  changes. However, the relationship between planning and the  market is still a kind of contradiction which hinders our  efforts to deepen reform and rapidly develop the productive  forces. When this contradiction is manifested in the area of  opening up to the outside world, it mainly shows that many of  our practices are still unable to converge with the  international market. Fixing the goal of establishing a  socialist market economy system will help enable our country's  open-door policy to enter a new stage.    The main features of this new stage are:    1. Use the opportunity arising from the restoration of our  country's status as a signatory to the GATT to foster closer and  firmer economic and trade ties between our country and various  countries in the world, and to enable our country to play a more  active role in economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    Our country's work in struggling for the restoration of its  signatory status to the GATT has made important progress. China  has formally raised the goal of building a socialist market  economy system, thus removing the biggest obstacle which has  hindered our country's "entry to the GATT" for a long time. We  have also committed ourselves to increasing the transparency of  our foreign trade system and reducing non-tariff protective  measures, and this shows that at the same time as we enjoy the  rights which come with the GATT, we have the ability to shoulder  and discharge the various obligations associated with the GATT.  "Entrance to the GATT" will enable our country's trade  relations with various countries to be built on a foundation  which has multilateral protection and is more stable.    2. Further implement the strategy of diversifying our  foreign trade markets and winning competition with quality.  China's status in world trade will rise further.    In 1992, our country's total import and export volume  surpassed that of Spain and the ROK, and we leaped two positions  among the major world trade powers, to 11th position. In the  1990's, when engaging in export trade, we must attach importance  to exploring new markets in the developed countries and regions  and pay even more attention to markets in the developing  countries and neighboring countries and regions, including  markets in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America,  the Gulf countries, and the CIS. For this reason, we must  earnestly tackle the acute contradiction which constrains our  efforts to expand exports--the problem of product quality. Poor  quality products are not salable in the international market  even at low prices, while good-quality products are marketable  even though they are sold at high prices.    3. Participate more actively in the international division  of labor. Along with a marked increase in the proportion of  high-tech and value-added products among exports, and with the  gradual opening up of the domestic market, the development of  the national economy will have a greater degree of linkage to  the international market.    In the 1990's, the application of new technology in the  world  will make a series of breakthroughs, and materials technology,  biotechnology, information and communications technology,  astronautics and aeronautical technology, marine exploration  technology, and energy technology will all be used in industry.  This will cause a new revolution in the production domain, while  the focus of competition in international markets will  concentrate more on high and new technology, while the status of  resource-intensive and labor-intensive industries will decline  in the international division of labor and technology-intensive  and knowledge-intensive industries will acquire an increasingly  dominant position in the international division of labor.  Facing this grim challenge, we should grasp the opportunity  arising from the adjustment of the industrial structure in the  international community to give full play to our country's  scientific and technological strength, integrate self-determined  scientific and technological exploration with the importation of  advanced technology from abroad, and form our own high and  new-technology industries.    At the same time, with an eye on the adjustment of the  industrial structure at home, we must selectively open up the  domestic market, introduce competition, and gradually cancel the  protection of an absolute majority of enterprises which have  some foundation and competitive ability in order to allow them  to develop themselves during their participation in  international competition.    4. Further expand the scale of the utilization of foreign  capital. There will be a marked increase in large-scale  investment projects, more capital-intensive and  technology-intensive investment projects, and investment  projects which can promote the development of tertiary industry.  This can help adjust the structure of industries which have  foreign investment and enable foreign capital to flow to those  sectors whose development is being encouraged by our country's  industrial policy; and this can help change the structure of  regions which have foreign investments and increase investment  in central and western China.    5. In the course of foreign economic and technological  exchanges, the "great economic and trade" pattern in which  commodities, funds, technology, and labor are combined, promote  one another, and develop together will emerge. Enterprises will  be able to operate businesses which transcend different trades,  to combine trade in industrial products and trade in technology  with trade in commodities and trade in science, and to follow  the road of professionalism, conglomeration, and  internationalization.    6. Opening up to the outside world will lead to a "network"  in which coastal areas, borders, rivers, and transportation  routes are opened up, and the policy of opening up the regions  will change to one which covers the whole country.    7. Participate in regional cooperation with an active and  pragmatic attitude. Economic and trade links among the  mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will become closer, and  an economic cooperation pattern characterized by reciprocity,  mutual support, common development, and common prosperity will  gradually emerge in South China.    Between the "global unification" of the world economy and  regional groupings are relations of mutual promotion and mutual  restraint. The process of regional grouping itself has a lot of  unclear factors due to the meeting and contradiction of state  interests and group interests. China is a developing country in  the Asia-Pacific region and is enthusiastic about participation  in economic cooperation of various types in the region; at the  same time, China agrees to the establishment of a nonpolitical  and nonmilitary regional cooperation plans and to the idea that  economic cooperation should be open and development should be  orderly and practical. In the 1990's, efforts will be made to  further develop cooperative relations. We must create  conditions for continuing to develop economic and trade  exchanges across the strait, realize the goal of direct and  bilateral "three links" step by step, and foster closer economic  ties with Hong Kong and Macao.    8. Enterprise groups specializing in trades and enterprise  groups specializing in industries will become the backbone force  in the development of an export-oriented economy, and a number  of enterprises will walk through the country's door to carry out  international operations.    Transnational operations by enterprises is a major trend of  global economic development, and our country is still at the  starting stage. By the end of 1992, excluding the Hong Kong and  Macao regions, our country had some 2,400 overseas enterprises  and the Chinese had invested $1.85 billion, but most of these  enterprises were small in scale and had poor returns. In the  1990's, when a number of large enterprises will walk through the  country's door to invest in larger projects and industries, such  as resources, construction, processing and assembling  industries, trade, and overseas commerce, the advantages of  enterprises' transnational operations will be more fully  embodied.    9. When the market's role in allocating resources  increasingly expands, when a managed exchange rate mechanism in  the market is eventually established, and when direct government  intervention in economic activities, such as the import and  export trades, is reduced, the domestic market will gradually  converge with the international market.    The goal of reform is to establish a managed foreign  exchange  market, practice a unitary market exchange rate, and gradually  allow the yuan to be freely exchanged with foreign currencies.  To expand opening up, we must more effectively develop the  regulatory function of the interest rate mechanism, expand the  scope and function of the foreign exchange adjustment market,  and establish a stabilization fund. On the basis of narrowing  the difference between the two exchange rates step by step, this  year, our country eventually combined the two exchange rates  into one. The merger of the two exchange rates and the  establishment of a foreign exchange market indicates that the  domestic market has begun to converge with the international  market.    10. A new operation and management system in foreign trade  in which the state formulates policies and measures and carries  out indirect macroregulation and control; enterprises operate at  their own discretion, take sole responsibility for profits and  losses, and develop and restrain themselves; and chambers of  commerce carry out coordination and provide services according  to the interests and demands of members, will take shape.    The above-mentioned 10 features are only a rough sketch of  the great blueprint of our country's opening up to the outside  world in the course of building a socialist market economy in  the 1990's. But from this we can also see that when China  upholds reform and opening up, it has a series of concrete  arrangements and solid actions.</p>

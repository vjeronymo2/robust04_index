			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / The tinkering engineer who serves as the symbol of Ukraine's quiet revival: Chrystia Freeland visits a surgical needle-maker with a pointer to the future Mr Viktor Skuratovsky, a former professor of mechanical engineering, is the sort of man who, were he an American, would spend his weekends tinkering in his garage and his weekdays parlaying his technical ingenuity into a growing business. But Mr Skuratovsky was born in Ukraine and for the first five decades of his life his inventive drive earned him admonitions rather than rewards. In the 1980s he was dismissed from his job as an engineering professor because of his Ukrainian Catholic faith and he spent the rest of the decade struggling to produce surgical needles with his own unique process in the cramped basement of a Kiev hospital. For Mr Skuratovsky things are at last starting to change. Ukraine's government is incompetent and its state sector largely moribund, but slowly opportunities are opening for private thinkers and tinkers. Without taking into consideration the fast-growing shadow economy, the private sector accounted for 30 per cent of Ukraine's gross national product in the first quarter of this year. That figure, and the expected continued growth of the private sector, is thanks to a new breed of businessmen like Mr Skuratovsky. Together with Mr Andrii Smirnov, a former student, and Mr Evhen Stychynsky, a young lawyer, Mr Skuratovsky has found an American partner and American investors for his business. Their joint venture, Holnit, was due to begin production of surgical needles this summer and they hope by the end of the year to be up to capacity of 2m needles a year. The owners of Holnit have an engineer's scorn for the new biznesmeny who have capitalised on government connections, or muscle, or both, to earn instant fortunes by selling commodities at bargain prices and importing often shoddy western consumer goods. 'Our principle, from the very beginning, has been not to engage in these easy trading operations,' Mr Smirnov says. 'No matter what is happening now, we are convinced that eventually, any nation's economic strength is in manufacturing.' Ukraine has a vast manufacturing base, but, as in other former Soviet republics, in the past the country's technical expertise was almost exclusively devoted to the military sector. Holnit, and other small factories like it, are engaged in conversion by stealth. The two massive lathes in Holnit's brand new workshop amazed the company's new American partners from Look, a Massachusetts-based producer of surgical needles. Purchased at cut-rate prices from cash-starved Ukrainian defence plants, the lathes, according to the Americans, are so sophisticated 'you can make rockets with these things'. Mr Skuratovsky has fitted out his factory at a fraction of the price he would pay in the west thanks to the managers of military factories, once the Soviet Union's industrial elite, but now squeezed by the nearly bankrupt Ukrainian central government, who were delighted to earn money from equipment for which they no longer had any use. Another advantage Holnit has over fledgling manufacturers in the west is a skilled populace, desperate to leave jobs in the collapsing state sector. While Holnit is confident about the technical skills of its new workers, it demands a change in attitude. 'When people come in for a job interview, the first thing I tell them is that this is not a socialist workplace, it is the new Ukrainian capitalism,' says Mr Smirnov, the partner in charge of hiring. 'There will be no trade unions and no communist party cells here. Those who work well will be well rewarded, those who don't will be fired.' Though Holnit's version of capitalism, Ukraine-style, promises to be far tougher than its western counterpart, Mr Skuratovsky is grateful for the participation of his American partners. What Look and the Ukraine Fund, a US based venture capital fund which invests in small Ukrainian businesses, have contributed to Holnit is quality control techniques, packaging, marketing expertise and capital. Holnit and its investors hope that with this combination of Ukrainian know-how and western money, the company will be able to corner the market in the former Soviet Union, which has no indigenous large-scale manufacturer of surgical needles. 'Western aid has destroyed the market in Moscow and St. Petersburg,' Mr Skuratovsky says. 'Why pay for what you can get for free?' But he believes there is a huge, untapped market in Ukraine, provincial Russia and central Asia where surgeons, unable to find the appropriate instruments, often resort to inadequately sterilised, inappropriate needles and sutures. For the privilege of filling this needed gap in the Ukrainian market, Mr Skuratovsky and his partners have had to negotiate a Kafka-esque bureaucratic obstacle course. Everyone from the local fire department, to the tax inspectors to the civic administration must be, as Mr Stychynsky, the lawyer, delicately puts it, 'taken into consideration'. And Holnit has it better than most Ukrainian companies because the country's favourable legislation on foreign investment allows Holnit, as a joint venture, to take a five-year holiday from punitive taxes which, if rigorously applied, can consume all of a company's profits. Somehow, Mr Skuratovsky and his partners retain their confidence that they will manage to continue to circumvent their nation's administrative labyrinth. Even as construction workers were putting the finishing touches to their new workshop, they avidly described the really perfect factory they hoped to be able to build in five years' time. And over coffee, Mr Skuratovsky is unable to resist the temptation to pull out a pen, take a napkin and illustrate his newest invention for an even better lathyroscopic needle.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): M3 scare hits bourses after good start Bourses had a good morning, but lost some of their gains later in the day, writes Our Markets Staff. The turnround in sentiment coincided with speculation on the forthcoming German M3 figures for February; scaremongers were talking of a figure of up to 30 per cent although, said Mr Anthony Thomas of Kleinwort Benson, the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to be steering opinion into the 15 to 20 per cent area. FRANKFURT extended the aggrandisement of German cyclicals as the Dax index rose 19.79 to 2,161.13. Turnover rose from DM7.6bn to DM9.1bn. The winners came mainly in carmakers, chemicals, steels and engineers. Daimler rose DM13.50 to DM859.50, and to DM865 after hours. Bayer put on DM7 to DM388.50. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that indications from companies and industry associations were that the German economy was either at the bottom, or just past the bottom of the economic cycle. Car orders in February, for example, have just shown a marginal pickup. The immediate recovery prospect is reflected in a Dax 1994 p/e of 31 1/2 , falling to 22.8 on Fleming's 1995 forecast of a further 38 per cent rise in earnings next year. ZURICH was led higher by financials on the Fed's overnight moves and the view that the sector's recent weakness had been overdone. The SMI index rose 32.3 to 2,857.0. Drugs stocks were also at the centre of attention. Sandoz certificates rose SFr60 to SFr3,920: US drugs stocks tumbled on Wall Street overnight amid fears of a price war after news that the Swiss group's US subsidiary was to sell its new cholesterol drug at about half the price of rivals. Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS commented that Sandoz was currently overshadowed by Roche and was unjustifiably neglected by investors. She expected annual earnings growth of 14 per cent over the next two years, compared with the forecast sector average of 8-9 per cent. The recently weak Ciba registered rose another SFr16 to SFr871 in continued response to its US subsidiary's plans to market a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Among financials, UBS, the day's most active stock, rose SFr33 to SFr1,220, CS Holding bearers SFr17 to SFr653 and SBC bearers SFr11 to SFr423. PARIS saw the CAC-40 index at 2,225 level in early trading, before selling set in ahead of today's end of the March account. By the close it was barely changed, off 0.51 at 2,200.17, and turnover was slack at just FFr3.6bn. One of the few performers was Societe Generale, up FFr7 at FFr650 ahead of results due after the close on Friday. UAP lost 90 centimes to FFr189 following its results earlier this week. James Capel yesterday maintained its buy recommendation on the stock. The brokers noted that restructuring at Banque Worms and a strong contribution from foreign insurance operations led them to maintain a positive stance on the insurer. 'However, after announcing that the group intends to launch a capital increase in conjunction with the group's imminent privatisation, the shares are likely to consolidate at current levels in the short-term'. AMSTERDAM was supported by strong performances from the blue chips, and the AEX index put on 1.05 at 415.38. KNP BT, the paper manufacturer, which said that it expected a good result in 1994 after a 1993 net loss, rose initially to a session high of Fl 50.40 before falling off to close 30 cents ahead at Fl 49.90. The group added that the performance would be dependent on European economic recovery. Other strong performances were seen by the chemical groups, DSM and Akzo Nobel, which improved respectively by Fl 3.80 and Fl 1.80 to Fl 126.10 and Fl 224.80. MILAN slipped back from a firm opening as profits were taken in some of the recently strong industrial stocks. The Comit index rose 6.62 to 671.30. Olivetti, still awaiting news on the granting of Italy's second cellular telephone licence, fell L58 to L2,535: some analysts said that success was already discounted in the share price. Fiat, leading the rival consortium, slipped L21 to L4,978. Telecoms were mixed, Stet adding L41 to L5,003 but Sip giving up L49 to L4,384. Salomon Brothers commented that the restructuring of the industry could take Stet shares as high as L6,900; the benefit from unification would be significant and Telecom Italia would emerge as a new European leader. The restructuring should also take Sip close to the L6,500 mark. ISTANBUL declined by a further 8 per cent in reaction to the downgrading of the country's debt by Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency. The composite index fell 1,171 to 13,667. The country was also placed on credit watch, which suggested that its rating may be lowered further.

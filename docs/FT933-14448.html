			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Cray Electronics pushes up profits to Pounds 29m - Objectives achieved as acquisition of Dowty IT business gives the group international status CRAY Electronics Holdings, the Berkshire-based data communications and software systems group which acquired the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m in August last year, yesterday reported sharply higher profits for the year ended April 30 1993. Swollen by the Dowty acquisition, profits on disposals and foreign exchange as well as margin improvements and organic growth, pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 29m. Earnings per share were 13.8p (1.9p) and the recommended final dividend is increased to 1p (0.5p) making a total of 1.5p (0.5p). As expected the results will trigger the final tranche of a three-part share-option based incentive bonus package, worth in total about Pounds 27m. The package will be shared by former chairman Sir Peter Michael, his successor Mr Roger Holland, Mr Jeff Harrison, finance director, and Mr Jon Richards, managing director, each of whom invested Pounds 750,000 in the stock at 50p a share when they took over in 1989. Mr Holland, who succeeded Sir Peter last month, said: 'Our objectives of improving profit margins, increasing exports and consolidation in the growth sectors of information technology have been achieved.' Turnover increased to Pounds 200.8m (Pounds 84.8m) including a 40 per cent increase in turnover from continuing operations to Pounds 90.4m (Pounds 64.6m) and Pounds 97m attributable to Dowty. Continuing operations generated Pounds 11m (Pounds 3.22m) of operating profits in addition to the Pounds 7.2m of profits attributable to the acquisition and Pounds 322,000 (Pounds 2.14m) from discontinued operations. After paying Pounds 871,000 (Pounds 2.61m) in interest charges the company reported 'normal trading profits' of Pounds 17.6m, slightly higher than most forecasts. An additional Pounds 3.43m in realised foreign exchange profits made total profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 21m (Pounds 2.74m). Pre-tax profits were further boosted by exceptional profits on disposals which with a Pounds 12.6m gain on the sale of Malvern Instruments partly offset by a Pounds 4.55m loss on other items. At the divisional level, Cray Communications, which now incorporates most of the Dowty business, emerged as the largest and most profitable division within the company with profits of Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 127m representing almost 70 per cent of the total. The Dowty data communications companies accounted for Pounds 7.2m of the profits and Pounds 97m of the divisional turnover. COMMENT The acquisition of the Dowty IT business has transformed Cray Electronics into an international force in the fast growing market for data communications equipment. The business has been quickly integrated but there is still room to push up margins in the combined communications division. The balance sheet is solid with Pounds 12m in net cash at the year end and pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 25.5m this year producing earnings of 8.7p per share. The shares slipped 6 1/2 p yesterday to close at 156p and therefore trade on a lofty prospective p/e of 17.9.</p>

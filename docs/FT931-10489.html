			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank The Royal Bank of Scotland has not made it easy for investors to assess the price it has obtained for its Charterhouse subsidiary. The headline tag of Pounds 235m is flattered by the inclusion of the special Pounds 50m dividend paid by Charterhouse last year. But the bank is retaining a 10 per cent stake in Charterhouse, not to mention its entire capital market business, which contributed almost half last year's pre-tax profits, as well as some other assets. Had Royal been proud of the price, it would doubtless have been at pains to trumpet the fact. Charterhouse was never likely to fetch a large premium over book value given its large development capital portfolio. But that only makes Royal's determination to sell at this stage in the cycle more perplexing. The official explanation is that Charterhouse is now free to expand in Europe. But there was nothing in theory to stop that happening under Royal's ownership, except perhaps that Mr Victor Blank, who heads Charterhouse, could not persuade his Royal Bank colleagues to agree. Instead Royal, which needs to improve its return on assets, has shed a business capable of producing a healthy chunk of fee income. Nor does it seem to have much idea what to do with the proceeds. A share price outperformance against the sector of 11 per cent since December's annual results suggests investors are mesmerised by the fast growing Direct Line insurance business. But that should not mask lack of coherent strategy elsewhere in the group.</p>

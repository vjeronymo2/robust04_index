			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman with foreign </F> and domestic correspondents in the Presidential palace in Zagreb  on 11 January following his return from Bonn -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening. Croatian Radio and  Television. Mr. President, at the Croatian initiative, in Bonn,  another proposal was made to normalize Muslim-Croat relations.  The reply is expected in three days time. What are your  expectations? What will happen despite all of this fighting in  Bosnia?    [Tudjman] As you said, I initiated a new meeting -- for two  reasons. First, despite the fact that all the sides, therefore  the Muslims too, undertook the obligation in Brussels to halt  hostilities during the Christmas holidays -- between 22 December  and 15 January -- the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia still  continued and threatened not only the population of Novi  Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo, over 100,000  Croats, but it also posed the threat of an ecological  catastrophe, since an explosives factory is situated in Vitez.  Understandably, the Muslim forces wanted to take the factory  and it was to be assumed that the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]  units would not allow the factory to fall into the hands of the  Muslims. This could cause an ecological catastrophe, high  casualties, and tens of thousands of new refugees. This was one  of the reasons why exactly a week ago I proposed another meeting  with Alija Izetbegovic to point out the possible catastrophic  consequences for relations in the area, the current situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the future relations between the  Croat and Muslim people.    The second reason was my intention to present once again  Croatia's stands, the stands Croatia has been advocating since  the very beginning of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina about the  need and necessity for the Croatian people to be interested in  cooperation with the Muslims; likewise for the Muslims not only  because of their survival but because of the fact that it would  be linked to western civilization by relying on Croatia. To  this effect in this proposition of ours, in the draft  contractual agreement, we presented concrete proposals for  cooperation within a union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or else if a  parting of the ways takes place -- something the Muslim  leadership has already opted for, then we propose cooperation  between a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state, and Croatia.  This document in fact conveys the continuity of this Croatian  policy.    [Modric] Sanja Modric, NOVI LIST. I would like to ask you --  we read in VJESNIK today, it appears that Sarajevo radio has  reported this, too -- that in Bonn you offered, and of course,  Izetbegovic rejected this, that in Bonn you offered, that it  would be possible to build some port in Peljesac for the  Muslims. As we know very little about this, would you explain  it in more detail. What is at issue here?    [Tudjman] Since Mr. Izetbegovic reiterates his demand that  Neum should be ceded to a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state,  that it should be placed under full sovereignty, I explained  again that from a Croatian point of view such a demand was  unacceptable, that it would mean a breakup of Croatian territory  and the Croatian people. It would pose a threat to southern  Croatia, including Dubrovnik. This demand is in fact in line  with something Serbia's policy has demanded for over a century.  It wanted to conquer Dubrovnik in this war, too.    Consequently, I said that we could only agree to what we had  agreed aboard Invincible, i.e. we offer the Muslims a free zone  in Ploce. We make it possible for them to build their own port  on the Neretva. In Neum only the construction of a tourist  facility appears as a possibility, on Croatian territory under  joint management.    During the two days of talks in Bonn I said that instead of  Neum we could offer this solution: That we rent some tourist  accommodation to the Muslims on the Peljesac peninsula, where  they could then be linked with their, actually not their, but a  free zone in Ploce. In that way it could be thought that we  again showed goodwill to find a solution with the Muslims,  despite their demand regarding Neum, which is unacceptable for  us.    I also reminded not only the Muslim leadership but also the  European participants in the talks that the truce agreements of  Pozarevac and Sremski Karlovci, of 1699 and 1718 respectively,  through which the Dubrovnik diplomats succeeded in getting the  two buffer zones at Neum and Sutorina, did not give access to  the sea to the Bosnia of that period, but that this was a buffer  zone by the sea which had a role of separating the area under  the Venetians from Dubrovnik.    Many of them at the talks in Bonn were surprised by this  and,  as you know, this solidified the viewpoint of serious people in  Europe that Croatia cannot agree to giving any sovereignty to  Bosnia over Neum, for that would threaten Croatia's strategic,  national, and state interests.    [Correspondent] VJESNIK. Mr, President, did the Muslims  perhaps offer us something in central Bosnia?    [Tudjman] They did. Their offer was that we should let them  have central Bosnia or else their army will seize the whole  central Bosnia, which was, according to the Vance-Owen plan on  reorganizing Bosnia into provinces, provinces with the majority  Croatian population, and also according to the current borders  of the republics within the Bosnian union, envisaged to be a  part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    They are carrying out the offensive in today's central  Bosnia  in order to conquer these areas. I told them that the Serbs too  agreed that Croatia should get 17.5 percent of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina territory and that this is the absolute  minimum the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia -- for  strategic reasons -- can agree to, that it is out of the  question that Croatia should cede this territory, because these  areas have predominantly Croat population, because the Croats  lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the Muslims, and because the  Croats defended these areas first from the Serb aggression and  are defending it now from the Muslim aggression.    Consequently, their demand, the Muslims' position is  therefore totally incomprehensible, as they lay claim to this  area, because of the demographic composition of the population  as well as because of the fact that this would reduce the share  of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna in the distribution of  these republics within the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. in a  future union. In this respect Mr. Izetbegovic put forward a  very interesting proposition and a very understandable one from  their point of view -- that we should come up with a joint stand  according to which the Bosnia-Muslim republic and the Croatian  republic should be given 51 percent of territory and the Serbs,  consequently, 49 percent.    Acceptable at first glance. They, however, wanted to conquer  2 or 3 percent, included in this percentage -- 51, precisely in  central Bosnia which was earmarked for the Croat republic. I  pointed out that we cannot accept this as there is no other area  inhabited by Croatian population that might be included in the  Croat republic in the course of dividing up, either within the  framework of a union or in a total parting of the ways.  Consequently, one can conclude that Mr.Izetbegovic and his  leaders invested every effort to, first, conquer militarily and  then, possibly, achieve agreement at the negotiating table so  the Croatian side would give up these areas which, as I say, for  historical, political and strategic reasons as well as because  of the present democratic state of affairs are such that it is  logical that they should belong to the Croat republic in the  division.    As far as that meeting and our proposal are concerned, it  should be pointed out that our proposal was focused on the need  to cease all hostilities. For their part, the Muslims stress  that they now have an army of 200,000 soldiers. Unfortunately,  by far the largest part of that army is directed against  Croatian areas, against the HVO. In reality, they are not  engaged in combat with Serbian forces anywhere, apart from  clashes and mutual artillery attacks around Sarajevo.    Therefore, the Muslim armed forces are directed against  Croatian forces and Croatian areas. This is one of the reasons,  along with the two reasons I mentioned earlier, for an immediate  cessation of hostilities.    We also initiated a proposal on cooperation and friendship  between the Croatian and Muslim peoples within the union; a  proposal on cooperation and very close links, almost a  confederal alliance between the Bosnian Muslim and the Croatian  republics and their alliance with Croatia. As we were aware  that the Muslim leadership had already opted for partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the end of the talks we presented our  proposals on cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim state and  the Croatian state after the breakup of the union, i.e., the  present Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Current attempts to seize the Croatian areas [in Bosnia]  prove that the Muslim leadership has chosen partition, i.e.,  creation of their Muslim state. After Mr. Izetbegovic,  Silajdzic, and Komsic signed an agreement with me on 14  September providing for cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim  and Croat republics, and their cooperation with Croatia, Mr.  Izetbegovic signed an agreement with the Serbs granting the  Bosnian Muslim republic UN membership in case of a breakup.  This was in reality an agreement on partition.    Just before the NATO summit in Brussels the Muslim  leadership  sent a proposal according to which NATO would offer guarantees  for the Bosnian Muslim state. In the proposal they call it the  pluralist Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. the victim state. This means  that they did not even raise the issue of entire  Bosnia-Herzegovina but instead they brought up the issue about  ways in which NATO would offer guarantees for the borders and  the viability of such a state. Therefore it is obvious that the  current leadership has opted to create a Muslim state.    I must admit that during the talks with us, Mr. Izetbegovic  and the members of his delegation said that their prime  objective was to preserve the union, but that clearly all  possibilities had to be examined. But we did not spend much  time on that problem, because the main problem was how to halt  the hostilities and to explain that conquering central Bosnia,  which is what the Muslim forces are trying to do, not only  threatening tens and almost hundreds of thousands of the  Croatian people, and creating streams of refugees [sentence  incomplete as heard].    Therefore this poses the danger that any future cooperation  between the Croatian and Muslim people, between the Croatian and  Muslim states, will be made impossible.    Mr. Izetbegovic admitted in principle that the Muslims have  to be interested in cooperation with Croatia. He described our  proposals as exceptionally useful. He said it in the presence  of the entire delegations, the cochairmen of the conference on  the former Yugoslavia and high-ranking German diplomats. This  was said in Germany and then after the talks, I heard, he said  that the talks had not produced any results. He even said that  our proposals were, as a whole, acceptable, and that they would  be discussed in Sarajevo and he would personally use his  influence for the proposals to be accepted by others in Sarajevo.    We agreed that they should reply to us in writing before the  Geneva conference, which will be held on 15 January. Well, God  willing, we will see.    [Novak] Hloverka Novak, DANAS. Mr. President, some say  that this peace proposal of yours is the last offer by the  Croatian side to the Muslims. If Alija Izetbegovic and the  Muslim leadership refuse your peace proposal, what will happen?  Does this inevitably mean war, or new negotiations? What do  you expect the international community's reaction to be like in  the light of the Muslim leadership's attitude?    [Tudjman] Let us be sensible and say that in the politics,  the same as in life, as long as there is politics, as long as  there is life of a man or of a nation we cannot say that  something is the last thing. Consequently, we are compelled to  have talks until we find a solution. We will be ready to  continue the talks.    But what you said is completely true, that in our proposal  and our examination of the geographical settlement we have  really reached the last straw and the Croatian side in this  respect cannot yield. We said so. We can state with pleasure  that all important international factors both in Europe and the  world have recognized the truth that in these negotiations  Croatia has been behaving very consistently in aspiring toward  peace, that it has been ready to offer proposals which are  acceptable for all three sides and in that sense the  international factors likewise understood our resolve when it  came to the points where there can be no yielding.    I could say that since my initiative, I think it was at the  beginning, on 5 or 6 November, and in the course of both  conferences within the European Union, first the Geneva  conference organized by the European Union and then the Brussels  conference, and this one with this new proposal, that all  important international factors became completely convinced in  the consistency of the Croatian policy, the benevolence of the  Croatian policy; and that with that Croatia's international  position as regards the final phase of the resolution of that  crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been considerably strengthened.    [Correspsondent] Swiss radio. Mr. President, you said that  the Muslims had decided in favor of a Muslim state, that the  Bosnian government had decided in favor of a Muslim state.  Could that in the end provoke Croatia to derecognize  Bosnia-Herzegovina? If Croatia makes such a step, would that  provoke the Croatian Army to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Tudjman] If the Muslim offensive and their efforts to  create  a Muslim state directly threatened the Croatian territories,  including the border territories of Croatia, it is obvious that  Croatia would have to protect its borders.    It is no secret that in Herceg-Bosna a considerable number  of  volunteers from Croatia has been involved in fighting. But  these are volunteers who were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who  fought in the homeland war against the Serbian aggression in  Croatia, and who went back there as volunteers to defend their  homes, their land, first from the Serbian aggression and now  from the Muslim aggression. As regards accusations that regular  formations of the Croatian Army have been involved in fighting  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I said that there were no regular  formations of the Croatian Army there: These are volunteers who  were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are working  abroad, in Europe and other countries, who keep contacting us  wishing to join their ranks.    Consequently, the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are  interested in protecting their home territory, securing its  survival. I told Mr. Izetbegovic that the Croatian policy has  been and is going to remain... [pauses] that we have even been  ready to influence the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain  within the Bosniak Muslim republic, as a considerable number of  Muslims will remain within the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna,  and that their human and national rights must be secured on the  basis of reciprocity. These Croats in the Bosnian republic and  the Muslims in the Croat republic, can be a bridge for  overcoming animosity that has been created in this horrific war,  and for restoring permanent cooperation and friendship in the  future.    [Modric] Modric, YOMIURI SHIMBUN. Mr. President, the map  the Croatian press revealed today is not exactly clear. At  first glance it appears as if the whole of Kiseljak and its  surrounds are missing. Is it true that this part is included in  the Muslim republic? Thank you.    [Tudjman] This is precisely what reflects the Croatian  side's  willingness to contribute its share to a solution that would  enable the Bosnian-Muslim republics to meet territorial  conditions, too, for an independent life. In this demarcation,  in opposition to the Muslims' general demand that they get all  the areas of central Bosnia, meaning Travnik and Novi Travnik  and Vitez and Busovaca and Kiseljak and Kresevo, in the course  of talks we agreed to this with the Croats of Herceg-Bosna so  they would remain within the framework of the Bosnian-Muslim  republic, Kiseljak and Kresevo with their dominantly Croat  populations, but that Busovaca, Vitez and Novi Travnik should by  all means be included in Croatia [as heard].    Likewise, Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf, too, which were  inhabited  by predominantly mainly Muslim populations. In this way one  ends up with a map such as the one you have seen. It is compact  in terms of Croatian territory. On the other hand with  Kiseljak, because of the fact that Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf are  to be included in the Croat republic, one gets compact territory  linked to Croatia. On the other hand, by leaving Kiseljak and  Kresevo to the Bosnian-Muslim republic they receive an area  around Sarajevo which is in territorial terms capable of  supporting the existence of their independent state. This is  what I was speaking about, in this way preconditions would also  be created for cooperation and friendship and an alliance, both  economic and defensive, as we suggested between the  Bosnian-Muslim state and the Croatian state at a later stage.    [Correspondent] DAILY TELEGRAPH, London. Could you try to  explain to me Mr. Tudjman -- from Croatia's point of view what  kind of role is Mr. Boban playing in the light of these new  negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina?. Do you fully and  unreservedly support Mr. Boban as a legally elected  representative of Croats in Bosnia?    [Tudjman] Mr. Boban became the leader of the Croat people in  Herzeg-Bosna during the resistance struggle against the Serb  aggressor. At that time I personally had neither known him nor  had I heard of him, nor had probably the majority of the people  from political leadership.    However, he was doubtlessly legitimately elected, as you  said  yourself, during the self-organized resistance struggle of the  Croat people against the Serb and later also the Muslim  aggression. He has played an exceptionally important role in  the Croat people's resistance against the Serb and later Muslim  aggression in central Bosnia. But there are people in the  Muslim leadership, including Mr. Izetbegovic, and others too,  who also spread these ideas abroad, They laid the blame for the  Muslim-Croat conflict on Mr. Boban and also the responsibility  for the failure of the Muslim-Croat talks. It was clear to me,  personally, and to other people that this was not true. But  even in this respect the Croatian side showed its readiness to  do everything possible, to remove all, even fictitious,  obstacles to an agreement, that is to create all preconditions  to reach an agreement.    I must say here that Mr. Boban, as a great patriot, as a man  who placed his personal resources at the service of the homeland  and the people of Herceg-Bosna, has said that he is a soldier of  his people and that he will accept any solution which is in the  interest of the Croatian people. Mr. Boban has remained the  president of what they call the community of Herceg-Bosna, but  he is not taking part in further talks to prevent the Muslim  side using the argument that they cannot talk to Boban. So,  they are talking to other people now and have received in  written form everything that can be offered to them.    I think that the Croatian side has thereby shown its  unreserved willingness to do everything to create conditions to  end hostilities and initiate cooperation and friendship with the  Muslim people in the future.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that Mr. Boban is not going  to take part in the talks in Geneva...    [Tudjman, interrupting] This is not important. It depends on  the nature of the talks. As you already know, in addition to  the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] leadership, Herceg-Bosna has  got its government, it has its assembly, a presidential council  has been set up, they have the entire leadership which will  appoint their representatives. It is important to restore  peace, to achieve a solution that is in the interest of both the  Croat and Muslim nations.    I will tell you one more thing: When we proposed cooperation  with the Muslims on such a broad basis, when we urged right from  the outset that the Croats should take part in the referendum  for an independent Bosnia, when we were the first to recognize  [Bosnia] and send our ambassador to Sarajevo, then we bore in  mind the interests of the Croatian people, the strategic  interests of the Croatian state, but also the interests of the  Muslim people and the interests of the Western world, because we  knew that the Western world wanted the Muslims to rely on  Croatia and be linked through Croatia with Western civilization.    Contrary to extremist views that have surfaced in this war,  and statements that we have heard when they said they wished to  destroy Croatia, and that it was wrong for the Muslims to have  gone with the Croats rather than with the Serbs, contrary to  these and such views we have been doing everything on our part  to prevent some fundamentalist and extremist elements from  turning Bosnia into a hotbed of terrorist attacks, to which the  Croats have unfortunately been already exposed in the horrific  massacre of the Croat people in Algiers; such incidents have  been recorded elsewhere, in Europe also, in individual  showdowns. Consequently, it is in the interest of the Croat  people and the Western world that the Bosnian Muslims become a  constituent part of Western civilization, which they can remain  to be by relying on and being in an alliance with the Croatian  people.    [Pesikar] Mate Pesikar, VECERNJI LIST. Mr. President, please  tell us just a bit more about the territorial settlement. What  is the destiny of Bosnian Posavina? Thank you.    [Tudjman] As you can see on this map, our demand has been  and  continues to be, that the largest part of Croat-populated  territories in Bosnian Posavina be included into the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna. In this respect I owe an explanation  to our people.    We, the Croatian people, were not able to defend all those  areas in [northern] Herceg-Bosna to the same extent that we were  able to do so in southern Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The reason  is simple: The Yugo-communist Army and then Serbia had such huge  supremacy in tank forces, in overall military equipment, and  manpower in that area, and they were so much interested in  creating a corridor between eastern Bosnia and the Banja Luka  area, that even if we had been allowed to deploy the Croatian  Army there we would not have been able to prevent that. Those  few volunteers whom we could send there were not able to prevent  that. The population of Bosnian Posavina also offered  resistance, but a large majority, I daresay even 80 percent of  the Croatian population fled Bosnia-Herzegovina. It should be  recalled that in the course of fighting in Bosnian Posavina the  Yugo-communist army and then the Serbian army bombarded and  pounded Croatian areas in Croatia -- between Bosanski Brod and  Zupanja, even further afield up to Pozega and Djakovo.    At the same time, I would like to remind you of the fact  that  on 12 July 1992, when signing an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic,  I put forward a proposal on a military alliance, by which the  deployment of the Croatian Army formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina  would have been legalized. However, Mr. Izetbegovic would not  accept such a military alliance then; we only reached a  conclusion that the Croatian Army should cooperate with the  Bosnian Muslim forces and the Croatian Defense Council in border  areas. Therefore, Croatia was in a very delicate position all  the time.    Therefore, our demand for Bosnian Posavina to belong to the  Croat national corpus has been and has remained the same, but it  depended on the developments and on the situation in the Armed  Forces in the course of the war. The territorial settlement in  Bosnian Posavina has not been finalized in the negotiations so  far.    I personally proposed to all the people in Bosnian Posavina  to defend their areas and to organize their demands, including  the proclamation of a separate province. Objections that we  have allegedly forgotten about Bosnian Posavina to the benefit  of Herceg-Bosna are completely unfounded. Not for a moment, on  the contrary. I can even say something that a part of the  public probably knows, I personally said: If we, with our  volunteer forces and the local population, cannot prevent the  corridor that the Serbs have been attacking and wish to control,  then we have to defend Bosanski Brod as it is a part of  Slavonski Brod.    However, something happened there that is still being  examined by commissions: Why was Bosanski Brod abandoned at one  moment contrary to all orders and, in my opinion, not under the  pressure of the balance of forces? Consequently, we have been  doing everything to protect our interests in Bosnian Posavina.    [Correspondent] One more question Mr. President. What are  your expectations from NATO, from their latest meeting. A while  ago you said that Izetbegovic had sent certain proposals to  NATO. Obviously, he is expecting their help. The possibility of  air strikes has also been mentioned. Can you comment on that?    [Tudjman] Mr. Izetbegovic has sent a demand to NATO only to  come to protect borders of his state. However, we can be  pleased with conclusions. On my return journey today I briefly  read them. I have heard of the draft, of the proposal [as  received], but we can be pleased with the NATO conclusions for  two reasons: For the first time a higher level of unity within  Europe and the United States has been created regarding the need  to act more resolutely in the sense of searching for peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina; second, it was said that NATO, and I think  that President Clinton in his Brussels speech had a sentence: If  you leave such a sentence in the declaration, then everything  must be done for its implementation [as heard].    These conclusions say: NATO and the international community  have to apply force both against those who are strangling  Sarajevo, against those who are obstructing humanitarian  convoys, and against those who are threatening other areas.  This means, in other words, that air strikes could be used  against all three sides if they obstruct what I have just  mentioned.    We are welcome this. We believe that in the international  community a demand is becoming ripe for all three sides to reach  a final agreement, and also a standpoint that the humiliation of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will not be tolerated, nor  actions by those who, despite statements on cease-fire, are  continuing with the destruction of Sarajevo. In this case this  can also refer to Muslims if they continue with the offensive  against Croatian areas, which will also refer to the Croats if  they obstruct humanitarian convoys. I am not mentioning  anything else because the Croats are not carrying out any  offensive operations anywhere, they are only defending their  areas. I have not seen the entire document, but at first sight,  judging by these few things that I have seen, we can be pleased  with the conclusions. Two more questions please.    [Todorovski] Ilinka Todorovski, Slovenia TV. I have a  question on another topical issue. Mr. President, have you been  informed about Slovenia's decision to suspend electricity supply  to Croatia from the Krsko nuclear power plant due to Croatia's  outstanding financial obligations? Can you comment on that?    [Tudjman] I have not been informed about it, and if Slovenia  adopts such a decision I will consider it a very unfortunate  decision, that does not contribute to the establishment of  normal relations; there has been discontent among the Croatian  public and views that Slovenia is abusing the situation in which  Croatia has found itself. Slovenia is issuing demands not  conducive to the establishment of good-neighborly relations  between Croatia and Slovenia for which we have been ready and  still are. We would like all relations between Croatia and  Slovenia to be resolved in a satisfactory way, in the interest  of both sides, not to the detriment of anyone, and want them to  be in accordance with the best European examples.    If such a decision has been made I do not consider it being  appropriate to such aspirations.    [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. A while ago in  your reply to a question you said that Croatia will persist on  its peace proposals, but also that its proposal that was  presented in Bonn was final. Croatian opposition parties said  that if Croatia's peace efforts fail, if the Muslim leadership  continues with the offensive against the Lasva River valley,  that Croatia will have to refer to its obligations stemming from  its constitution and protect the Croatian population using other  means. How do you comment on this, and when will it happen if  it had to happen?    [Tudjman] The Croatian state has also until today acted in  accordance with its constitutional obligation, and as I have  already said in my replies to your questions today, it permitted  the deployment of volunteers [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] to protect  Croatian areas. Croatian state policy has proved itself as very  mature in the protection of Croatian interests and pursuant to  this, we will adopt necessary decisions, according to given  circumstances on the battlefield and on the international scene.    [Announcer] By this we are completing the news conference.  Thank you very much and goodbye.</p>
